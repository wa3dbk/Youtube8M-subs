00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.650 

when<00:00:05.100> we<00:00:05.190> started<00:00:05.549> out<00:00:05.670> with<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.060> glove

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
when we started out with the glove

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.150 
when we started out with the glove
project<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:07.410> didn't<00:00:07.680> really<00:00:07.799> know<00:00:07.980> where<00:00:08.130> we

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
project we didn't really know where we

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.000 
project we didn't really know where we
were<00:00:08.309> going<00:00:08.340> we<00:00:08.870> thought<00:00:09.870> we<00:00:10.050> would<00:00:10.230> try<00:00:10.889> to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
were going we thought we would try to

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.610 
were going we thought we would try to
improve<00:00:11.370> upon<00:00:11.960> waterproofness<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.440> try<00:00:13.559> to

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
improve upon waterproofness and try to

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.939 
improve upon waterproofness and try to
improve<00:00:13.950> upon<00:00:14.219> fit<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.049> try<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.109> do<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.800> way

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
improve upon fit and try to do in a way

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.580 
improve upon fit and try to do in a way
that<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.279> could<00:00:17.430> construct<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:19.109> wasn't

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
that we could construct it that wasn't

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.700 
that we could construct it that wasn't
traditional<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:21.720> standard<00:00:22.109> gore-tex<00:00:22.439> glove

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
traditional the standard gore-tex glove

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.920 
traditional the standard gore-tex glove
uses<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.039> waterproof<00:00:23.910> breathable<00:00:24.180> insert<00:00:24.720> that

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
uses a waterproof breathable insert that

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.109 
uses a waterproof breathable insert that
gets<00:00:25.109> sandwiched<00:00:25.380> between<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.189> shell<00:00:26.849> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
gets sandwiched between the shell and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.150 
gets sandwiched between the shell and
the<00:00:27.420> lining<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.710> believe<00:00:28.830> it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the lining and if you can believe it

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.189 
the lining and if you can believe it
this<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> membrane<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.599> has<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.929> fit

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
this is the membrane that has to fit

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.870 
this is the membrane that has to fit
inside<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:34.770> works<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.760> knew

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
inside that and it works but we knew

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.510 
inside that and it works but we knew
there<00:00:36.030> had<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.420> much<00:00:36.719> better<00:00:36.750> solution

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
there had to be a much better solution

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.610 
there had to be a much better solution
our<00:00:38.520> solution<00:00:39.000> was<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.180> use<00:00:39.620> waterproof

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
our solution was to use waterproof

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.310 
our solution was to use waterproof
breathable<00:00:41.190> pro<00:00:41.850> shell<00:00:42.120> fabric<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:43.290> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
breathable pro shell fabric with a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.360 
breathable pro shell fabric with a
removable<00:00:43.620> liner<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.350> exactly<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
removable liner so it's exactly like the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.709 
removable liner so it's exactly like the
layering<00:00:47.579> system<00:00:47.850> we're<00:00:48.120> used<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.600> our

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
layering system we're used to in our

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.200 
layering system we're used to in our
gore-tex<00:00:49.230> shells<00:00:49.670> well<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:50.910> wanted<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
gore-tex shells well what we wanted to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.260 
gore-tex shells well what we wanted to
do<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.449> fit<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.879> do<00:00:53.879> something<00:00:54.180> that

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
do for fit was do something that

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.729 
do for fit was do something that
actually<00:00:54.390> mimic<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> human<00:00:55.050> hand<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.500> closely

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
actually mimic the human hand as closely

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.229 
actually mimic the human hand as closely
as<00:00:55.920> possible<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.579> we're<00:00:56.879> going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.059> take<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
as possible so we're going to take a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.290 
as possible so we're going to take a
fresh<00:00:57.750> run<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.170> making<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> glove<00:00:59.219> we'll<00:01:00.030> take<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
fresh run at making a glove we'll take a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.330 
fresh run at making a glove we'll take a
fresh<00:01:00.629> run<00:01:00.870> exactly<00:01:01.170> how<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.980> glove<00:01:02.219> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
fresh run exactly how a glove is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.579 
fresh run exactly how a glove is
patterned<00:01:02.820> look<00:01:03.390> at<00:01:03.510> exactly<00:01:03.930> how<00:01:04.049> hand<00:01:04.350> works

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
patterned look at exactly how hand works

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.929 
patterned look at exactly how hand works
and<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.949> look<00:01:05.129> at<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> different<00:01:05.549> planes

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and you look at all the different planes

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.030 
and you look at all the different planes
of<00:01:06.119> all<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> different<00:01:06.659> fingers<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.260> how<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
of all the different fingers and how the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.800 
of all the different fingers and how the
thumb<00:01:08.310> works<00:01:08.520> together<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> baby

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
thumb works together with the baby

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.899 
thumb works together with the baby
finger<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.409> how<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.650> opposes<00:01:11.310> every<00:01:11.790> other

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
finger and how it opposes every other

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.539 
finger and how it opposes every other
finger<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.920> when<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:13.979> look<00:01:14.010> at<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
finger and when you look at that you

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.520 
finger and when you look at that you
realize<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.030> each<00:01:15.119> finger<00:01:15.509> needs<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.380> be

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
realize that each finger needs to be

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.770 
realize that each finger needs to be
addressed<00:01:16.860> separately<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.270> what<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
addressed separately to do what that

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.210 
addressed separately to do what that
finger<00:01:19.080> needs<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.890> were<00:01:19.950> able<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
finger needs to do we were able to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.060 
finger needs to do we were able to
achieve<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:21.020> dexterity<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.320> wanted<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.740> get

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
achieve the dexterity we wanted and get

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.460 
achieve the dexterity we wanted and get
the<00:01:23.159> fit<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.460> wanted<00:01:23.790> by<00:01:24.420> coming<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the fit we wanted by coming up with a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.490 
the fit we wanted by coming up with a
pattern<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.100> was<00:01:26.970> simple<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.479> sew<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.990> yet

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
pattern that was simple to sew and yet

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.990 
pattern that was simple to sew and yet
remain<00:01:29.159> incredibly<00:01:30.030> articulated<00:01:30.990> so

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
remain incredibly articulated so

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.380 
remain incredibly articulated so
ironically<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.210> came<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:35.090> something<00:01:36.090> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
ironically we came up with something so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.140 
ironically we came up with something so
simple<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:37.049> amazing<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:38.000> hadn't<00:01:39.000> thought<00:01:39.090> of

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
simple it's amazing we hadn't thought of

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.850 
simple it's amazing we hadn't thought of
it<00:01:39.299> before<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.409> single<00:01:40.710> piece

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
it before but it's a it's a single piece

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560 
it before but it's a it's a single piece
of<00:01:40.890> fabric<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.549> has<00:01:41.670> three<00:01:41.970> lobes<00:01:42.210> coming

off of it and those three lobes just
flour<00:01:44.909> together<00:01:45.680> one<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.250> three

flour together one you know on three
different<00:01:47.670> planes<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.750> become<00:01:49.110> this

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
different planes to become this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.660 
different planes to become this
incredibly<00:01:50.810> articulated<00:01:51.810> shape<00:01:52.159> using<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
incredibly articulated shape using the

minimal amount of construction possible

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.429 
minimal amount of construction possible
when<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.520> sew<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.880> together<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.990> trim<00:01:58.320> it

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
when we sew that together we trim it

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.830 
when we sew that together we trim it
down<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.040> Micra<00:01:59.939> seam<00:02:00.119> allowance<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:00.600> point

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
down to a Micra seam allowance one point

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.630 
down to a Micra seam allowance one point
six<00:02:00.960> millimeters<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.100> absolutely

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
six millimeters so it's it's absolutely

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.170 
six millimeters so it's it's absolutely
tiny<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.920> by<00:02:04.920> getting<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.340> seam<00:02:05.579> tape<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.149> top

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
tiny and by getting a seam tape on top

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.960 
tiny and by getting a seam tape on top
of<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.829> we<00:02:07.829> take<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.129> tiny<00:02:08.369> seam<00:02:08.610> allowance

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
of that we take this tiny seam allowance

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.219 
of that we take this tiny seam allowance
and<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.209> gets<00:02:09.360> crushed<00:02:09.660> out<00:02:09.840> into<00:02:10.110> this

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
and it gets crushed out into this

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.140 
and it gets crushed out into this
completely<00:02:10.649> flat<00:02:11.069> surface<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.790> actually

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
completely flat surface to actually

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.950 
completely flat surface to actually
eliminate<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> seam

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
eliminate the seam

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.230 
eliminate the seam
it's<00:02:13.170> all<00:02:13.260> together<00:02:13.700> all<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.850> great<00:02:15.000> things

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
it's all together all the great things

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.610 
it's all together all the great things
we<00:02:15.330> did<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.690> shell<00:02:15.960> we<00:02:16.140> wanted<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.410> apply

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
we did in the shell we wanted to apply

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.930 
we did in the shell we wanted to apply
to<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.830> liner<00:02:17.040> we<00:02:17.430> were<00:02:17.490> able<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.700> take<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
to the liner we were able to take the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.430 
to the liner we were able to take the
same<00:02:18.090> tried<00:02:18.330> X<00:02:18.480> pattern<00:02:18.660> we<00:02:19.110> were<00:02:19.170> able<00:02:19.320> to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
same tried X pattern we were able to

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.620 
same tried X pattern we were able to
micro<00:02:20.070> seem<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.580> fleece<00:02:20.820> which<00:02:21.090> has<00:02:21.450> never

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
micro seem the fleece which has never

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.930 
micro seem the fleece which has never
been<00:02:21.870> done<00:02:21.990> before<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.590> end<00:02:23.460> up<00:02:23.550> with<00:02:23.700> zero

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
been done before and end up with zero

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.600 
been done before and end up with zero
seem<00:02:24.180> bulk<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.440> take<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.800> combine<00:02:26.460> it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
seem bulk so we take that combine it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.070 
seem bulk so we take that combine it
with<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.880> shell<00:02:28.760> we<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.150> incredible

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
with the shell we have this incredible

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.690 
with the shell we have this incredible
relationship<00:02:32.040> between<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.340> shell<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
relationship between the shell and the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.260 
relationship between the shell and the
liner<00:02:32.940> where<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:34.020> an<00:02:34.230> exact<00:02:34.650> match<00:02:35.240> well<00:02:36.240> the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
liner where it's an exact match well the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.090 
liner where it's an exact match well the
end<00:02:36.420> result<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.020> we<00:02:37.170> have<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> glove<00:02:37.830> that

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
end result is that we have a glove that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.390 
end result is that we have a glove that
stays<00:02:38.610> waterproof<00:02:39.090> all<00:02:39.270> day<00:02:39.420> long<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.370> has<00:02:41.370> a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
dexterity and a fit that is completely

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.030 
dexterity and a fit that is completely
unexpected
