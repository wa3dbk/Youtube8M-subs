feature on this tent is the fact that we

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:15.749 
feature on this tent is the fact that we
use<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.689> Robin<00:01:14.139> storm<00:01:14.530> guard<00:01:14.799> system<00:01:15.009> so<00:01:15.609> what

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
use the Robin storm guard system so what

use the Robin storm guard system so what
that<00:01:15.880> is<00:01:16.030> is<00:01:16.060> where<00:01:16.359> the<00:01:16.479> guy<00:01:16.600> lanes<00:01:16.840> are

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
that is is where the guy lanes are

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.779 
that is is where the guy lanes are
attached<00:01:17.259> onto<00:01:17.709> these<00:01:17.829> pieces<00:01:18.189> of<00:01:18.490> webbing

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
attached onto these pieces of webbing

around the poles just making sure that
you<00:01:22.959> get<00:01:23.139> the<00:01:23.289> webbing<00:01:23.619> itself<00:01:24.009> around<00:01:24.219> the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
you get the webbing itself around the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.209 
you get the webbing itself around the
poles<00:01:24.579> just<00:01:25.359> connect<00:01:25.719> on<00:01:25.929> your<00:01:26.529> fly<00:01:26.950> sheet

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
poles just connect on your fly sheet

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.940 
poles just connect on your fly sheet
using<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.939> twist<00:01:28.420> clip<00:01:28.779> hooks<00:01:29.139> I'll<00:01:29.409> just<00:01:29.709> get

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
using the twist clip hooks I'll just get

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.789
