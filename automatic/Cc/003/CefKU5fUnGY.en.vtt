right here and get a bigger mixing bowl

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.250 
right here and get a bigger mixing bowl
so<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:11.700> need<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:12.090> small<00:04:12.450> mixing<00:04:12.480> bowl<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.170> a

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
so you need a small mixing bowl and a

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.159 
so you need a small mixing bowl and a
big<00:04:13.500> mixing<00:04:13.890> bowl

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
big mixing bowl

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:18.670 
big mixing bowl
okay<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.500> put<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.979> small<00:04:17.519> mixing<00:04:17.790> bowl<00:04:17.850> with<00:04:18.239> the

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
okay to put a small mixing bowl with the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.360 
okay to put a small mixing bowl with the
solution<00:04:19.680> in<00:04:20.090> so<00:04:21.090> now<00:04:21.209> we're<00:04:21.359> going<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.630> need<00:04:21.750> a

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
solution in so now we're going to need a

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:34.150 
solution in so now we're going to need a
whole<00:04:23.370> cup<00:04:23.790> of<00:04:24.000> water<00:04:27.680> pour<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.740> in<00:04:30.290> okay<00:04:33.140> and
