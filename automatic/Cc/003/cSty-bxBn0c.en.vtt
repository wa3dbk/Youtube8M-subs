00:00:01.312 --> 00:00:03.437
 This is called Swan Annie. 

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:05.646
 (Day 9: Xinghai famous players) I learned from Day 9 

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:08.437
 Duck or swan 

00:00:08.437 --> 00:00:10.687
 Cross the river slowly 

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.896
 Have you seen my bear? 

00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:17.562
 But you don't know how to swim 

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:23.104
 You don't know what it is so beautiful to swim 

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:27.812
 Hahaha 

00:00:28.854 --> 00:00:29.979
 Someone sent something 

00:00:31.187 --> 00:00:32.396
 By! I am doing live! 

00:00:40.812 --> 00:00:41.771
 sandwich 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:43.854
 I just talked about it. 

00:00:43.854 --> 00:00:46.187
 Yes, Swannie 

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:47.437
 This game likes 

00:00:47.812 --> 00:00:49.312
 Basically... 

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:52.229
 (Ghost hit the wall) Swan swims very... 

00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:54.604
 elegant 

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:57.937
 But you don't know how to do it. 

00:00:57.937 --> 00:00:59.687
 This Akali is thinking 

00:00:59.687 --> 00:01:03.479
 I flashed the W skill and it was fine. 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.062
 But what is terrible is his general attack. 

00:01:05.062 --> 00:01:06.229
 Hey~~ 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:07.146
 a little bit awkward 

00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:09.604
砰~~~~ 

00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:13.729
砰~~~~~~ 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.937
 Super strong 

00:01:15.937 --> 00:01:18.687
 You never know why he is so elegant 

00:01:21.312 --> 00:01:26.479
 You all know that they may be rushing forward. 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.021
 Still use those two broken feet to advance in the water 

00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:33.854
 And AD Anne 

00:01:33.854 --> 00:01:36.312
 Swannie Swan Anne Stream 

00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:37.437
 Swannie 

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:38.854
 like this 

00:01:38.854 --> 00:01:43.312
 Have you seen Anne who is so coquettish? 

00:01:43.312 --> 00:01:44.354
 I am not there. 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.229
砰~~~~~~~~ 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.479
 She is very elegant in the middle to destroy everything 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.771
 shit 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.021
 Why has to be this way 

00:02:03.687 --> 00:02:05.937
 Fear! Under the name of Swannie! 

00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:10.729
 He stood in Swannie's hands with a high hat and lost his body. 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.896
 Um~~~~~~ 

00:02:11.896 --> 00:02:17.729
 People will not see the runes of those things under the river. 

00:02:19.146 --> 00:02:20.896
 Swannie awesome 

00:02:21.437 --> 00:02:24.271
 Squeeze him on the floor 

00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:26.604
 Squeeze her to live with the dinosaurs! 

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:27.979
 Um~~~~~~~~ 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:28.896
 That's it 

00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:34.937
 "Sparkling Sword" provides the magic attack and can also use our previous physical damage. 

00:02:35.604 --> 00:02:36.521
砰~~~~~~~~~~ 

00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:37.687
 Shining sword is superb 

00:02:37.687 --> 00:02:42.479
 Perfectly turn AD into AP 

00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:44.896
 Welcome to Anne's Animal Partner 

00:02:44.896 --> 00:02:45.812
 This time it is introduced 

00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:47.021
 bat 

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:49.354
 and also... 

00:02:50.812 --> 00:02:52.562
 Bear~~ 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:57.396
 I want him to see Swannie's power. 

00:02:57.396 --> 00:02:59.062
 I want to buy this 

00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:04.271
 Hey~~ Now it’s perfect to transform AD Swannie into an AP. 

00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.146
 Hello, Ann~~ 

00:03:14.187 --> 00:03:15.729
 Someday they will come 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.646
 They will run into this grass and think about it. 

00:03:18.646 --> 00:03:20.979
 This grass is really safe. 

00:03:22.312 --> 00:03:24.271
 But they soon know 

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:26.562
 Not safe at all 

00:03:26.562 --> 00:03:29.854
 Have a Swannie 

00:03:29.854 --> 00:03:32.146
 Are waiting in the head? 

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:41.771
 Swannie~ 

00:03:57.687 --> 00:04:00.479
 Not that I am talking about super~ 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.604
 Oh 

00:04:03.687 --> 00:04:06.021
 If you are a man then see this 

00:04:06.021 --> 00:04:07.979
 If you don't burst into tears, go when your guns go. 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:08.979
 Look at it 

00:04:10.521 --> 00:04:15.646
 Swannie looks like a normal Annie wearing a cute dance dress. 

00:04:15.646 --> 00:04:17.479
 but... 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.854
 In private, she is a Master Buster. 

00:04:19.854 --> 00:04:21.896
 She is all physically attacked 

00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:25.146
 Look at this, all are physical attacks. 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.229
 She has a long general attack distance 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.687
 Then glyph magic 

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:31.062
砰~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.146
 I like! 

00:04:34.687 --> 00:04:35.896
 Like it~ 

00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:38.729
 Um~~~~ 

00:04:39.687 --> 00:04:40.937
 My goodness 

00:04:40.937 --> 00:04:42.229
 Oh my god 

00:04:43.354 --> 00:04:45.146
 My... um~~ um~~ 

00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:47.104
 Um~~~ 

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:50.646
 Um!~~ 

00:04:50.646 --> 00:04:51.771
 Wait, let me try this... 

00:05:05.354 --> 00:05:06.312
 Um!~~ 

00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:08.021
 tomato 

00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:09.146
 Ok!!!! 

00:05:09.146 --> 00:05:10.146
 Sauce 

00:05:14.104 --> 00:05:15.062
 Bacon 

00:05:22.604 --> 00:05:26.479
 My mouth has never been so enjoyed. 

00:05:27.396 --> 00:05:29.521
 I am not advertising. 

00:05:30.646 --> 00:05:31.854
 This is awesome 

00:05:31.854 --> 00:05:33.979
 I want you all to look! 

00:05:40.312 --> 00:05:43.521
 I want you to see the full course. 

00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:46.104
 (chewing, chewing, chewing) 

00:05:50.146 --> 00:05:52.771
 This taste is like what you hear 

00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:53.521
 Um~~~ 

00:05:55.854 --> 00:05:55.896
