 fast lap and canapino gets third 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.530
 behind your teammate and 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.900
 fourth will no longer be in shape because 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.030
 the time will be withdrawn 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.060
 the technical anomaly led to the bottom 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.159

 canapino with rossi himself but 2 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:51.700
 the only 38 is a revolver and I trigger it 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.700
 right in 1 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.840

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.680
 first meters of this first 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.140
 classification 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.670
 Juan Martin Ponte is one of the best 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.860

 from Juan Pablo Gianini there is the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.220
 reiteration 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.130
 of a critical sector several have had 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.550
 to go through unemployment, some have fallen 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.930
 nothing to the earth and this ends it 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.190
 complicate in this classification of 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.580
 Friday when we see it now 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.389
 star then this spin with the

 who is 13th prospered while niko 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:40.200
 his brother is 29th mixed luck for 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.380
 the locals there is the reiteration of 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.320
 what happened to the pope the eldest of the 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.560
 dynasty of prosperous and spataro that 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.490
 try to see if that number is better 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.320
 16 spartan on the ninth final 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.570
 novena miliano spataro harvest 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.910
 fruitful this argument for that of the 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.979
 the first part of the 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.680
 luciano kinder the last group 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.249
 qualifier is on the auto track 39 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.769
 I say Carlos 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.769
 to three tenths change is suffering 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:16.980
 with the 2 and gets thirteenth by 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.440
 another round plus all 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.570
 you have to go, you have a chance 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.990
 behind him comes Rodriguez and also 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:28.080
 the 112 advance and with the Chinese weights 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.820
 it is 25 for now it comes to close it 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.900
 making it appear on the first screen in 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.670
 the labyrinths of nicolás pezzucchi

 will close the round to see if you can to 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.040
 see if he succeeds he entered the straight 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.900
 main here this extension can be 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.780
 put between the seven you can get 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.090
 tenth other yields in the last part is 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.620
 vital for the hoop what bench art 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.530
 Thread of the bank to gabriel ponce de león

 hundredths of facundo ardusso is 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.400
 finishing this classification test 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.990
 the flag squared in one of 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.240
 the last curves by nicolás 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.780
 pezzucchi the one of olavarría that comes for 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:14.610
 close we will see if it can continue to improve 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:20.129
 the final part weight tries tails 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:22.499
 pezzuti and 13th thirteenth 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:24.959
 when accessing the second of the novelties of 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:27.599
 the category behind chunks that is 

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:30.800
 tenth he has been the second best one 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:30.800
 classifies thirteenth
