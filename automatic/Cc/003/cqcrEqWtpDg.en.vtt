over flip it over use these two marks

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.010 
over flip it over use these two marks
right<00:04:21.169> here<00:04:21.580> for<00:04:22.580> a<00:04:22.610> guideline<00:04:23.090> it's<00:04:23.750> going<00:04:23.960> to

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
right here for a guideline it's going to

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:33.140 
right here for a guideline it's going to
hold<00:04:24.229> it

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.020 

like<00:04:33.720> that<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.770> tips<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.699> then<00:04:35.880> you're

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
like that to the tips and then you're

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:46.219 
like that to the tips and then you're
going<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.240> fold<00:04:37.169> it<00:04:37.380> in<00:04:44.840> it's<00:04:45.840> going<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:46.110> be<00:04:46.199> a

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
going to fold it in it's going to be a

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.050 
going to fold it in it's going to be a
little<00:04:47.130> bump<00:04:47.760> right<00:04:48.150> here<00:04:49.190> right<00:04:50.190> there<00:04:50.400> and

little bump right here right there and

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.450 
little bump right here right there and
then<00:04:51.389> you're<00:04:51.540> going<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.840> fold<00:04:52.500> all<00:04:52.949> the<00:04:53.250> way<00:04:53.400> to
