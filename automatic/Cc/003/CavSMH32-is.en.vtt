you guys how to go from a black and

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.590 
you guys how to go from a black and
white<00:00:11.110> sketch<00:00:11.440> to<00:00:11.650> color<00:00:12.029> it's<00:00:13.029> a<00:00:13.240> pretty

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.600 
white sketch to color it's a pretty

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.060 
white sketch to color it's a pretty
simple<00:00:13.930> process<00:00:14.139> as<00:00:15.209> I<00:00:16.740> don't<00:00:17.740> know<00:00:17.800> doesn't

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
simple process as I don't know doesn't

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.570 
simple process as I don't know doesn't
involve<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:20.289> much<00:00:20.529> knowledge<00:00:20.770> of<00:00:21.040> Photoshop

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
involve that much knowledge of Photoshop

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.240 
involve that much knowledge of Photoshop
it's<00:00:21.880> just<00:00:22.240> more<00:00:22.480> or<00:00:22.510> less<00:00:22.780> if<00:00:23.440> you<00:00:23.650> can<00:00:23.830> render

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
it's just more or less if you can render

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.840 
it's just more or less if you can render
out<00:00:24.520> forms<00:00:25.060> because<00:00:25.360> it<00:00:25.510> has<00:00:25.690> to<00:00:25.840> be<00:00:25.990> a

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
out forms because it has to be a

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.760 
out forms because it has to be a
decently<00:00:27.850> rendered<00:00:28.380> character<00:00:29.380> like<00:00:29.590> what

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
decently rendered character like what

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.050 
decently rendered character like what
I'm<00:00:29.860> doing<00:00:29.890> right<00:00:30.130> now<00:00:30.280> is<00:00:30.550> just<00:00:30.580> a<00:00:30.850> quick

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
I'm doing right now is just a quick

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.260 
I'm doing right now is just a quick
sketch<00:00:31.330> I<00:00:31.510> did<00:00:31.539> just<00:00:32.199> show<00:00:33.000> value<00:00:34.000> how<00:00:34.210> much

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
sketch I did just show value how much

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.060 
sketch I did just show value how much
value<00:00:34.510> range<00:00:34.840> you<00:00:34.989> need<00:00:35.140> to<00:00:35.199> actually<00:00:35.920> have

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
value range you need to actually have

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.029 
value range you need to actually have
this<00:00:36.250> work<00:00:36.579> I<00:00:37.170> know<00:00:38.170> it's<00:00:38.409> not<00:00:38.499> like<00:00:38.679> the<00:00:38.800> best

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
this work I know it's not like the best

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.139 
this work I know it's not like the best
process<00:00:39.940> really<00:00:40.510> but<00:00:41.379> it<00:00:41.649> helps<00:00:42.129> me<00:00:42.190> write

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
process really but it helps me write

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.680 
process really but it helps me write
help<00:00:43.510> me<00:00:43.690> learn<00:00:43.870> values<00:00:44.379> really<00:00:44.890> quickly<00:00:45.429> and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
help me learn values really quickly and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.299 
help me learn values really quickly and
that's<00:00:46.690> why<00:00:46.929> I<00:00:46.960> started<00:00:47.469> using<00:00:47.649> it<00:00:47.949> and<00:00:48.129> now<00:00:48.280> I

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
that's why I started using it and now I

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.939 
that's why I started using it and now I
use<00:00:48.640> it<00:00:48.670> just<00:00:48.940> because<00:00:49.149> it's<00:00:49.719> a<00:00:50.019> really<00:00:50.800> easy

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
use it just because it's a really easy

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.469 
use it just because it's a really easy
process<00:00:52.019> it's<00:00:53.019> really<00:00:53.109> quick<00:00:53.760> anyway<00:00:54.760> so<00:00:54.819> here

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
process it's really quick anyway so here

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.889 
process it's really quick anyway so here
we<00:00:55.569> are

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
we are

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.709 
we are
it's<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.379> open<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.429> new<00:00:57.579> layer<00:00:57.789> and<00:00:58.120> I'm<00:00:58.359> changing

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
it's a open a new layer and I'm changing

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.099 
it's a open a new layer and I'm changing
the<00:00:59.289> layer<00:01:00.280> type<00:01:00.609> to<00:01:00.819> color<00:01:01.059> that<00:01:01.659> little<00:01:01.870> tab

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
the layer type to color that little tab

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.240 
the layer type to color that little tab
at<00:01:02.229> the<00:01:02.260> top<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:04.470> I'm<00:01:05.470> just<00:01:05.680> going<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:05.860> sketch

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
at the top and I'm just going to sketch

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.450 
at the top and I'm just going to sketch
it<00:01:06.430> in<00:01:06.549> just<00:01:07.210> choose<00:01:07.510> a<00:01:07.720> simple<00:01:08.460> anatomica

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
it in just choose a simple anatomica

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.179 
it in just choose a simple anatomica
medium<00:01:09.729> a<00:01:09.969> red<00:01:10.899> tone<00:01:11.110> just<00:01:11.560> sketch<00:01:11.860> it<00:01:11.890> in

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
medium a red tone just sketch it in

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:13.980 
medium a red tone just sketch it in
that's<00:01:12.490> a<00:01:12.670> hundred<00:01:12.850> percent<00:01:13.000> opacity<00:01:13.479> on<00:01:13.899> the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
that's a hundred percent opacity on the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.440 
that's a hundred percent opacity on the
brush<00:01:14.259> hundred<00:01:14.979> percent<00:01:15.280> opacity<00:01:15.549> on<00:01:16.090> the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
brush hundred percent opacity on the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.149 
brush hundred percent opacity on the
layer<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:19.180> that's<00:01:19.719> pretty<00:01:20.259> much<00:01:20.380> all<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:20.710> do<00:01:20.890> I

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
layer so that's pretty much all you do I

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.639 
layer so that's pretty much all you do I
just<00:01:21.850> block<00:01:22.299> them<00:01:22.479> in<00:01:22.659> I<00:01:22.810> block<00:01:23.049> in<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.350> colors

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
just block them in I block in the colors

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.289 
just block them in I block in the colors
of<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:23.920> character<00:01:24.399> then<00:01:24.789> I'll<00:01:24.880> add<00:01:25.030> like<00:01:25.270> a

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
of the character then I'll add like a

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.899 
of the character then I'll add like a
general<00:01:25.840> tone<00:01:26.200> on<00:01:26.680> top<00:01:27.039> on<00:01:27.369> another<00:01:27.640> color

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
general tone on top on another color

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.539 
general tone on top on another color
layer<00:01:28.210> but<00:01:28.990> anyways<00:01:29.289> then<00:01:29.859> just<00:01:30.070> showing<00:01:30.430> you

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
layer but anyways then just showing you

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.170 
layer but anyways then just showing you
right<00:01:30.700> now

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
right now

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.359 
right now
what<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:31.719> looks<00:01:31.899> like<00:01:32.109> this<00:01:32.859> I<00:01:32.890> changed<00:01:33.280> the

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
what it looks like this I changed the

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.819 
what it looks like this I changed the
opacity<00:01:33.460> on<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.179> actual<00:01:34.479> color<00:01:34.719> layer<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.109> 69%

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
opacity on the actual color layer to 69%

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.069 
opacity on the actual color layer to 69%
and<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.789> was<00:01:36.909> just<00:01:37.030> showing<00:01:37.179> you<00:01:37.539> no<00:01:37.750> those<00:01:37.929> are

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
and I was just showing you no those are

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.749 
and I was just showing you no those are
two<00:01:38.229> separate<00:01:38.619> tones<00:01:38.859> there's<00:01:39.219> no<00:01:39.310> blending

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
two separate tones there's no blending

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.870 
two separate tones there's no blending
between<00:01:39.850> them<00:01:40.240> so<00:01:40.479> now<00:01:40.810> I'm<00:01:40.929> blending<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.880> just

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
between them so now I'm blending it just

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.940 
between them so now I'm blending it just
to<00:01:42.969> show<00:01:43.149> that<00:01:43.179> it<00:01:43.359> you<00:01:43.570> know<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:44.710> reads

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
to show that it you know it reads

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.209 
to show that it you know it reads
differently<00:01:46.229> because<00:01:47.229> it<00:01:47.409> just<00:01:47.649> because<00:01:48.130> the

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
differently because it just because the

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.800 
differently because it just because the
color<00:01:48.369> layer<00:01:48.579> doesn't<00:01:48.820> add<00:01:49.030> anything<00:01:49.299> except

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
color layer doesn't add anything except

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.039 
color layer doesn't add anything except
for<00:01:49.890> color<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:51.700> just<00:01:51.909> changes<00:01:52.539> your<00:01:52.600> value

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
for color it just changes your value

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.749 
for color it just changes your value
range<00:01:53.289> to<00:01:53.530> color<00:01:53.740> basically<00:01:54.369> I<00:01:54.399> mean<00:01:54.670> it

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
range to color basically I mean it

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.639 
range to color basically I mean it
doesn't<00:01:54.909> it's<00:01:55.630> not<00:01:55.719> like<00:01:55.840> an<00:01:56.049> overlay<00:01:56.469> layer

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
doesn't it's not like an overlay layer

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.380 
doesn't it's not like an overlay layer
where<00:01:56.979> it'll<00:01:57.130> blow<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:57.520> out<00:01:57.670> saturation

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
where it'll blow it out saturation

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.399 
where it'll blow it out saturation
whatever

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
whatever

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.630 
whatever
so<00:02:00.340> anyways<00:02:00.929> going<00:02:01.929> back<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.439> it<00:02:02.590> sped<00:02:03.460> this

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
so anyways going back to it sped this

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.880 
so anyways going back to it sped this
one<00:02:03.789> up<00:02:03.939> a<00:02:04.060> bit<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:04.869> changed<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.649> color

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
one up a bit so I changed the color

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.370

opacity<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.590> brush<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.570> it's<00:02:13.570> a<00:02:13.630> hard

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
opacity on the brush and it's a hard

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.380 
opacity on the brush and it's a hard
brush<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.980> has<00:02:15.160> hard<00:02:15.370> edges<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.940> I'm<00:02:16.180> just

brush so it has hard edges and I'm just

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.030 
brush so it has hard edges and I'm just
filling<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.290> can<00:02:17.410> do<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.650> with<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.800> hard

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
filling in you can do this with a hard

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.270 
filling in you can do this with a hard

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
brush again this is a colored layer

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.500 
brush again this is a colored layer
filling<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.280> whole<00:02:21.430> thing<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.790> with<00:02:22.030> one<00:02:22.240> tone

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
filling the whole thing in with one tone

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.430

this<00:02:23.110> green<00:02:23.680> yellow<00:02:23.890> tone<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:26.140> then<00:02:26.290> I'm

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
this green yellow tone and then I'm

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.930 
this green yellow tone and then I'm
going<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.709> play<00:02:26.950> with<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.220> opacity<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.819> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
going to play with the opacity of the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.290 
going to play with the opacity of the
layer<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.360> turned<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.720> down<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.959> 25%<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.970> just

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
layer I turned it down to 25% it just

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.090 
layer I turned it down to 25% it just
looks<00:02:31.600> better<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.959> way<00:02:32.140> it's<00:02:32.470> dollar<00:02:32.740> it's

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
looks better that way it's dollar it's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.760 
looks better that way it's dollar it's
more<00:02:33.280> realistic<00:02:34.350> doesn't<00:02:35.350> look<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.470> great

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
more realistic doesn't look that great

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.140 
more realistic doesn't look that great
because<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.280> really<00:02:36.580> quick<00:02:36.790> sketch

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
because this is a really quick sketch

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.720 
because this is a really quick sketch
and<00:02:37.480> if<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.290> hear<00:02:38.470> noises<00:02:38.680> in<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.069> background

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
and if you hear noises in the background

adorable
anyways<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.250> made<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.489> new<00:02:51.700> color<00:02:51.970> layer<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.600> I'm

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
anyways I made a new color layer and I'm

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.949 
anyways I made a new color layer and I'm
using<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.530> soft<00:02:54.220> round<00:02:54.489> brush<00:02:54.820> and<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.540> chose<00:02:55.930> a

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
using the soft round brush and I chose a

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.930 
using the soft round brush and I chose a
red<00:02:56.290> tone<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:56.980> I'm<00:02:57.310> going<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.519> put<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.730> on<00:02:57.820> the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
red tone so I'm going to put it on the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.790 
red tone so I'm going to put it on the
parts<00:02:58.239> where<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.840> skin<00:02:59.110> where<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.709> know

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
parts where the skin where the you know

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.650 
parts where the skin where the you know
the<00:02:59.890> blood<00:03:00.100> will<00:03:00.220> show<00:03:00.430> through<00:03:00.670> most<00:03:01.420> like

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
the blood will show through most like

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.030 
the blood will show through most like
nose<00:03:01.959> or<00:03:02.260> on<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.410> lips<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.010> cheeks

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
nose or on the lips and the cheeks

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.500 
nose or on the lips and the cheeks
around<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.060> eyes<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:05.620> Izzy's<00:03:05.920> monster<00:03:06.510> will

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
around the eyes just Izzy's monster will

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.470 
around the eyes just Izzy's monster will
show<00:03:07.720> through<00:03:07.959> a<00:03:07.989> little<00:03:08.200> bit<00:03:08.290> more<00:03:10.110> spooky

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
show through a little bit more spooky

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.410 
show through a little bit more spooky
then<00:03:13.480> anyways<00:03:13.900> I'm<00:03:14.200> adjusting<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:15.420> adjusted

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
then anyways I'm adjusting the adjusted

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.400 
then anyways I'm adjusting the adjusted
the<00:03:16.510> opacity<00:03:16.810> on<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.470> actual<00:03:18.069> layer<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:20.260> it

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
the opacity on that actual layer so it

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.199 
the opacity on that actual layer so it
reads<00:03:20.650> better<00:03:20.800> it<00:03:21.100> looks<00:03:21.250> more<00:03:21.430> realistic<00:03:21.760> and

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
reads better it looks more realistic and

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.039 
reads better it looks more realistic and
now<00:03:22.720> I'm<00:03:22.900> going<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.260> play<00:03:23.440> with<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:25.049> adjustment

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
now I'm going to play with a adjustment

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:33.509 
now I'm going to play with a adjustment
layer<00:03:31.500> I'm<00:03:32.500> using<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.860> color<00:03:33.100> balance

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
layer I'm using the color balance

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.069 
layer I'm using the color balance
adjustment<00:03:33.730> layer<00:03:35.190> just<00:03:36.360> flying<00:03:37.360> around<00:03:37.690> you

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
adjustment layer just flying around you

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.229 
adjustment layer just flying around you
know<00:03:38.230> it's<00:03:38.980> easier<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.489> use<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.790> adjustment

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
know it's easier to use the adjustment

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.970 
know it's easier to use the adjustment
layers<00:03:40.390> because<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:40.870> can<00:03:41.079> just<00:03:41.350> go<00:03:41.739> in<00:03:41.980> and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
layers because you can just go in and

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.560 
layers because you can just go in and
you<00:03:44.980> can<00:03:45.130> actually<00:03:45.220> turn<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.730> opacity<00:03:46.030> down

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
you can actually turn the opacity down

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.680 
you can actually turn the opacity down
and<00:03:46.900> use<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.470> layer<00:03:47.799> mask<00:03:48.190> that's<00:03:49.150> right<00:03:49.390> next

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
and use the layer mask that's right next

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.599 
and use the layer mask that's right next
to<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.810> it's<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.170> white<00:03:50.380> square<00:03:50.769> you<00:03:51.430> just

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
to it it's the white square you just

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.699 
to it it's the white square you just
click<00:03:51.850> on<00:03:52.000> there<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.780> can<00:03:52.989> actually<00:03:53.200> draw

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
click on there and you can actually draw

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.240 
click on there and you can actually draw
out<00:03:53.980> parts<00:03:54.670> using<00:03:55.030> black<00:03:55.299> or<00:03:55.720> white<00:03:56.040> then<00:03:57.040> use

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
out parts using black or white then use

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.640 
out parts using black or white then use
black<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.880> draw<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:58.660> pots<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:59.109> don't<00:03:59.290> want<00:03:59.500> to

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
black to draw the pots you don't want to

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.740 
black to draw the pots you don't want to
be<00:03:59.739> changed<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.489> white<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.209> draw<00:04:01.390> them<00:04:01.600> back

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
be changed and white to draw them back

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.660 
be changed and white to draw them back
in<00:04:02.049> so<00:04:02.410> like<00:04:02.590> if<00:04:02.799> the<00:04:02.890> whole<00:04:03.070> picture<00:04:03.310> was

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
in so like if the whole picture was

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.479 
in so like if the whole picture was
messed<00:04:03.940> up<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.650> just<00:04:05.829> want<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.250> color

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
messed up and you just want it to color

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.910 
messed up and you just want it to color

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
adjust one part you use an adjustment

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.979 
adjust one part you use an adjustment

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
and then like I said you draw the parts

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.840 
and then like I said you draw the parts
you<00:04:28.310> don't<00:04:28.490> want<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.940> be<00:04:29.060> affected<00:04:30.160> so<00:04:31.160> if<00:04:31.699> you

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
you don't want to be affected so if you

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.520

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
didn't want like the sky to be affected

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.879 
didn't want like the sky to be affected
you<00:04:33.740> draw<00:04:34.010> that<00:04:34.220> out<00:04:34.280> or<00:04:34.729> you<00:04:34.760> know<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:36.860> know

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
you draw that out or you know you know

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.080 
you draw that out or you know you know
there<00:04:37.190> you<00:04:37.250> go<00:04:37.400> that's<00:04:37.520> just<00:04:37.639> what<00:04:37.850> it<00:04:37.940> looks

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
there you go that's just what it looks

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.689 
there you go that's just what it looks
like<00:04:38.560> dried<00:04:39.560> out<00:04:39.770> so<00:04:39.919> certain<00:04:40.280> parts<00:04:40.580> are

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
like dried out so certain parts are

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.730 
like dried out so certain parts are
affected<00:04:41.150> or<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.389> bites<00:04:41.570> aren't<00:04:41.870> then<00:04:42.560> you

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
affected or the bites aren't then you

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.640 
affected or the bites aren't then you
can<00:04:42.889> turn<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.160> opacity<00:04:43.550> on<00:04:43.880> that<00:04:44.210> again<00:04:44.479> up<00:04:45.410> or

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
can turn the opacity on that again up or

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.670 
can turn the opacity on that again up or
down<00:04:46.360> depending<00:04:47.360> on<00:04:47.780> which<00:04:47.990> how<00:04:48.320> much<00:04:48.500> you

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
down depending on which how much you

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.420 
down depending on which how much you
want<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:49.389> change<00:04:50.389> to<00:04:50.479> affect<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.110> image<00:04:51.430> so

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
want the change to affect the image so

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.070 
want the change to affect the image so
anyways<00:04:52.729> is<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.000> selective<00:04:53.510> color<00:04:53.750> in<00:04:53.960> the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
anyways is a selective color in the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.070 
anyways is a selective color in the
color<00:04:54.260> balance<00:04:54.530> there<00:04:55.190> so<00:04:56.060> two<00:04:56.120> adjustment

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
color balance there so two adjustment

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.530 
color balance there so two adjustment
layers<00:04:57.229> again<00:04:58.010> that's<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.490> circle<00:04:58.940> at<00:04:59.210> black

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
layers again that's the circle at black

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.690 
layers again that's the circle at black
half<00:04:59.750> white<00:04:59.830> it's<00:05:00.830> really<00:05:01.160> easy<00:05:01.430> to<00:05:01.580> make

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
half white it's really easy to make

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.090 
half white it's really easy to make
quick<00:05:02.030> adjustments<00:05:02.150> on<00:05:02.660> your<00:05:02.780> image<00:05:03.080> in<00:05:03.350> you

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
quick adjustments on your image in you

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.610 
quick adjustments on your image in you
don't<00:05:04.280> get<00:05:04.400> rid<00:05:04.550> of<00:05:04.580> them<00:05:04.790> because<00:05:04.970> if<00:05:05.090> you<00:05:05.120> use

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
don't get rid of them because if you use

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.830 
don't get rid of them because if you use
if<00:05:06.620> you<00:05:06.680> use<00:05:06.830> them<00:05:07.190> regularly<00:05:07.419> it<00:05:08.419> messes<00:05:08.810> up

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
if you use them regularly it messes up

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.530 
if you use them regularly it messes up
like<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:10.040> whole<00:05:10.220> image<00:05:10.610> you<00:05:10.729> can't<00:05:10.940> go<00:05:11.210> back

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
like the whole image you can't go back

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:19.540 
like the whole image you can't go back
and<00:05:11.930> change<00:05:12.260> that<00:05:17.860> just<00:05:18.860> through<00:05:19.100> something

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
and change that just through something

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.770 
and change that just through something
it<00:05:19.700> look<00:05:19.910> at<00:05:20.150> but<00:05:20.450> I<00:05:20.479> totally<00:05:20.810> missed<00:05:22.780> but

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
it look at but I totally missed but

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.820 
it look at but I totally missed but
that's<00:05:23.960> good<00:05:24.260> because<00:05:24.440> now<00:05:24.770> he's<00:05:24.919> rather

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
that's good because now he's rather

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.390 
that's good because now he's rather
anyways<00:05:28.690> there<00:05:29.690> we<00:05:29.780> go

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
anyways there we go

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.730 
anyways there we go
I'm<00:05:31.400> using<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.850> guy's<00:05:32.030> just<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:33.080> just<00:05:33.470> used<00:05:33.650> the

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
I'm using the guy's just I just used the

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.279 
I'm using the guy's just I just used the
brightness/contrast<00:05:34.190> adjustment<00:05:35.260> layer

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.680 

yeah<00:05:39.400> but<00:05:40.400> that's<00:05:40.520> but<00:05:40.940> those<00:05:41.270> are<00:05:41.419> just<00:05:41.479> the

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
yeah but that's but those are just the

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.600 
yeah but that's but those are just the
easy<00:05:41.900> way<00:05:42.229> to<00:05:42.289> adjust<00:05:42.680> the<00:05:42.979> whole<00:05:43.220> image

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
easy way to adjust the whole image

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.879 
easy way to adjust the whole image
without<00:05:43.820> making<00:05:44.450> any<00:05:44.599> serious<00:05:44.930> changes<00:05:45.740> you

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
without making any serious changes you

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.080 
without making any serious changes you
can<00:05:46.010> go<00:05:46.070> back<00:05:46.400> in<00:05:46.669> and<00:05:46.700> you<00:05:47.030> know<00:05:48.610> do<00:05:49.610> really

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
can go back in and you know do really

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.260 
can go back in and you know do really
simple<00:05:50.539> things<00:05:50.780> like<00:05:51.490> changing<00:05:52.490> the<00:05:52.520> tones<00:05:52.849> or

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
simple things like changing the tones or

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.940 
simple things like changing the tones or
whatever<00:05:53.599> and<00:05:53.870> not<00:05:54.320> have<00:05:54.470> to<00:05:54.590> worry<00:05:54.800> about

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
whatever and not have to worry about

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.360 
whatever and not have to worry about
having<00:05:55.910> to<00:05:56.030> repaint<00:05:56.510> everything<00:05:57.160> so<00:05:58.160> it's

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
having to repaint everything so it's

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.360 
having to repaint everything so it's
cool<00:06:02.349> so<00:06:03.349> now<00:06:03.380> I'm<00:06:03.530> just<00:06:03.650> using<00:06:03.800> an<00:06:04.070> overlay

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
cool so now I'm just using an overlay

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.460 
cool so now I'm just using an overlay
layer<00:06:04.610> to<00:06:04.880> change<00:06:05.120> that<00:06:05.389> background<00:06:05.660> light<00:06:06.200> to

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
layer to change that background light to

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.900 
layer to change that background light to
a<00:06:06.500> blue<00:06:06.740> tone<00:06:08.470> you<00:06:09.470> know<00:06:09.650> just<00:06:10.370> trying<00:06:10.729> to<00:06:10.820> add

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
a blue tone you know just trying to add

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.480 
a blue tone you know just trying to add
some<00:06:11.150> more<00:06:11.330> tones<00:06:11.870> in<00:06:12.289> there<00:06:12.500> but<00:06:12.889> anyways<00:06:13.220> I

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
some more tones in there but anyways I

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.520 
some more tones in there but anyways I
mean<00:06:13.669> this<00:06:13.820> is<00:06:15.789> you<00:06:16.789> know<00:06:16.910> you<00:06:16.970> can<00:06:17.240> get<00:06:17.530> get

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
mean this is you know you can get get

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.190 
mean this is you know you can get get
more<00:06:18.650> complicated<00:06:19.310> with<00:06:19.400> it<00:06:19.520> but<00:06:19.639> I<00:06:19.669> mean<00:06:19.940> as

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
more complicated with it but I mean as

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.920 
more complicated with it but I mean as
it<00:06:21.200> is<00:06:21.320> right<00:06:21.590> now<00:06:22.330> it's<00:06:23.330> just<00:06:23.419> a<00:06:23.750> simple

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
it is right now it's just a simple

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.379 
it is right now it's just a simple
sketch<00:06:27.070> you<00:06:28.070> have<00:06:28.250> to<00:06:28.400> have<00:06:28.520> your<00:06:28.639> values<00:06:29.120> down

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
sketch you have to have your values down

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.420 
sketch you have to have your values down
again<00:06:29.960> for<00:06:30.289> all<00:06:30.349> this<00:06:30.560> to<00:06:30.770> work<00:06:30.979> right

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
again for all this to work right

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.060 
again for all this to work right
especially<00:06:32.270> the<00:06:32.900> beginning<00:06:33.169> stage<00:06:33.710> with<00:06:33.979> the

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
especially the beginning stage with the

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.700 
especially the beginning stage with the
color<00:06:34.310> layers<00:06:34.610> and<00:06:35.060> the<00:06:35.330> overlays<00:06:35.930> and

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
color layers and the overlays and

and<00:06:36.979> stuff<00:06:37.160> it<00:06:37.460> just<00:06:37.520> won't<00:06:37.940> look<00:06:38.120> good<00:06:38.180> if<00:06:38.419> you

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630

don't know you values so it takes a lot

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.020 
don't know you values so it takes a lot
of<00:06:42.080> practice<00:06:42.860> to<00:06:43.039> really<00:06:43.190> get<00:06:43.460> that<00:06:43.669> up<00:06:46.030> so
