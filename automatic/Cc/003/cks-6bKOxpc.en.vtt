00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.660
 The piece 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.819
 another aspect to accept 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.819
 just did not imagine 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.759
 overheating 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.759
 on this 30th year 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.850
 the decline 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.700
 but she is not much 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.230
 at the request of the brazil of 2006 of military medicine 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.710
 We think she's pretty big. 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.020
 all bring more recently 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.500
 before more expensive issues 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.300
 ae 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.300
 each country to meet 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.520
 What I found interesting 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
 he wants attention 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.590
 How I look 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.450
 How do you see this? 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.050
 with more this challenge 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.280
 if you can operate soon 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.509
 these chinese 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.760
 fc nÃ¼rnberg 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.930
 also describes from peshawar nothing arrived in the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.190
 it is certainly a glorious moment 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.190
 this one also has discrete tracks 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.610
 here is one of them 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.910
 Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful photo. 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.810
 That's when we got too tall. 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.210
 Diego Medina 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.530
 it's a shame more from here 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.530
 every kitchen for you to have advanced 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.470
 that I could no longer 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.870
 but clearly he is not a boy anymore 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.100
 how much more 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.819
 I know you're coming 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.959
 this big on my way 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.450
 we want it to be more legal 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.409
 It's to correct some 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:19.489
 some passion 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.489
 I'm not going to study 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.519
 and if we can a little more closed 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.019
 here it is much more notably with himself 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.759
 this one also has 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:40.759
 one already goes away there's some orange 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:44.749
 this is a very light pink March 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:50.339
 I think it's going to be a bit lucky. 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:53.339
 here on my team 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:56.489
 this reasoning 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.629
 the martini 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.479
 this was already 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.280
 with him 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.639
 probably yes 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.019
 but no other 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.999
 and be more dashing 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.239
 this new release 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.049
 a little darker 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.479
 it's more closed 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:19.089
 the one that exports the most, letting the Indians know not to 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:20.939
 that the team is well 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.939
 I do not know if I will be able to access the series b 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.919
 we have nephews here 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.909
 at the cost of 500 thousand 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.339
 who are with this result more famous 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.369
 then one notices 15 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:41.369
 and this is a very individual time 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:43.920
 the works are also corrected 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.899
 are current 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.899
 in disagreement with issues song of matias 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.089
 yes email 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:56.949
 some with a little bit from now on the staff and five even guests 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.629
 however with 25 April 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.229
 they live and 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:06.229
 I hope we can get treatment 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.209
 and so I do not like people because it's here 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.359
 Cecilia 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:18.219
 I was trying to cross a stream 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.009
 the drug trade 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.009
 in this episode 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.330
 it's still early 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.680
 the marvel 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.990
 also in the camera 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.030
 who practices the illicit
