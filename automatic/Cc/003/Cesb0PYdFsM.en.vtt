00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
I guess glitchyness for lack of a better

term the Sun there's a lot of things
that<00:00:15.480> were<00:00:15.599> kind<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.900> if<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.139> thought<00:00:16.379> they

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
that were kind of if you thought they

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.740 
that were kind of if you thought they
weren't<00:00:16.830> working<00:00:17.010> but<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.820> looked<00:00:18.119> around<00:00:18.300> and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750

Infuse and I think it works with a bunch
of<00:00:23.970> Samsung<00:00:24.449> phones<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.260> might<00:00:25.380> want<00:00:25.529> to

double check don't take my word for but

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.390 
double check don't take my word for but
there<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.260> should<00:00:28.439> work<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:28.800> most<00:00:29.010> Samsung

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
