00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 He should be werner and welcome to one 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.109
 note of a brief summary of the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.599
 last two developer diaries too 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.929
 I did not make my own video three 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.759
 because there were not really many 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.330
 playful innovations at the beginning 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.430
 very short on cards were overworked 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.779
 in the development diary three west africa 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.150
 presented with some very 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.699
 interesting points became so very 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.970
 Much done and recommends the diary 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.710
 The Chinese region including Korea 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.360
 All the paper was found at me 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.760
 Manchuria in the three years 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.890
 is divided and I believe that we 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.050
 Here one of the young to many and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.940
 make a sound is a nice last one 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.010
 idea cinema has been redesigned 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.170
 Of course, Korea still hear the others 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.690
 and also around it 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.379
 including korea to japan have this 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.640
 Nothing says that I always go 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.809
 not elucidate because I believe the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.100
 you make sense of that with the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.170
 screenshots google is needed now 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.120
 here in the video not more accurate 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.149
 go completely little comparatively 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.030
 makes sense to the playful changes 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.530
 for a military between some 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.799
 announced after initially rather 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.460
 a bit much focus on peace 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.830
 his seemed 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.360
 for one thing is a kind of war 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.670
 probably also a patch namely 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.590
 the exact breakdown mother year later 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.450
 announce its possible sieges 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.070
 So when you transfer to a warehouse 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.750
 you can give it to another 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.630
 give allies in the war 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.759
 The ki should use this sensibly 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.060
 Sounds very sensible, I hope she does 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.490
 also 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.250
 One can now be allied to it 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.780
 give military goals 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.009
 So one can say on the one hand 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.590
 on sample sets then becomes even 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.530
 try to besiege this province or 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.320
 right there to destroy more 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.780
 or military military 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.090
 Focus of it especially for and 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.830
 actually only for subordinate nations 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.680
 possible as for vasallen 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.570
 something similar and here you can and 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.490
 subordinates should either say 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.680
 be aggressive then try yourself 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.750
 provinces besiege and opposing 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.220
 to combat or even army 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.020
 then try to support yourself 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.090
 just the name of the player 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.040
 to connect and therefore just this more 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.330
 help out 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.070
 not interesting the supreme command 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.180
 but at least one more thing in the 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.800
 Developer Diary as one of 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.720
 main features have been mentioned 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.400
 I personally think it's nice 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.190
 but why it matters to me 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.720
 little alien and the army 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.330
 generator mentioned earlier 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.100
 has been and payment options 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.820
 army template so a pattern too 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.100
 to save 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.930
 and then with a few clicks in 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.950
 one or distributed on several 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.470
 excavate 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.910
 if you give money to this was 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.310
 Of course a few clicks but quite 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.740
 honest, I do not think so important now 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.140
 and the built regiments when 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.760
 then automatically in the beginning of the province 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.400
 assemble and as well together army 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.450
 decide on 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.430
 except a little change in that 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.140
 if you are an army 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.600
 has named and together with 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.519
 the game or the game is put together 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.050
 army now always the individual 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.800
 retained names and not 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.780
 like in old times 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.630
 this with the generic name of 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.200
 game override then still to one 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.080
 few minor other game changes 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.090
 to become a rebel in the future 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.480
 able to cross its waters 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.160
 So just as an example were thanked 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.510
 The rebels on Gotland can do that 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.610
 Example after the siege of Gotland 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.560
 over water in the Baltic States 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.400
 translate and just continue to besiege there 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.019
 this does not work on boats 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.760
 but they just have the 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.459
 Possibility over the water province 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.600
 sort of tour to machines apparently 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.290
 exactly where it is not 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.239
 described 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.989
 because nothing is not possible if the 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.820
 port is blocked and the second one is 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.290
 only one last thing there are new ones 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.930
 merchandise for the brand new 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.630
 provinces and that ropes dyes and 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.250
 tropical if that's it 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.440
 again like telling him we go 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.850
 a bit short game on changes 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.420
 and for that very many changes 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.459
 the more of you in bed 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.750
 and maybe will take place next day 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.120
 also a summary like that 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.099
 previous three days getting as always 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.520
 look in the central ones that are the 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.569
 single day books translated and 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.410
 probably during the day 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.550
 maybe also summary 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.070
 there are always the update 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.750
 the latest information looks at the 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.709
 Strategies news reinnehmen only as 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.960
 fathers because I always the 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.220
 provide translated diaries and 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.300
 otherwise you are there a lot 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.300
 joy out
