00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 very good everyone if you see guys are still 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.819
 come to a grand american game up 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.460
 that we are a game called pacman a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.410
 version as well as terrifying and others already 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.250
 this is a recent version of how it 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.180
 but it was to see a little more 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.830
 the india the crimes throw a little bit 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.800
 bad because he just smiled 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.880
 ok look here we have self to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.390
 enlarge the sound I'm listening to 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.390
 already for god 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.120
 incurring ok that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.050
 it is useful 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.450
 normal is not more expensive because I just 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.809
 scare in an incredible way by god 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.100
 the bugs these too the and 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.100
 aggressive apart 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.000
 although a ball this month is still 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.590
 killing or is there no way to power 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 get rid of them look at me is 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.710
 pressing very believable follows totally 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.970
 right the bad thing is that everything is 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.280
 secret, carava, dovalina, as 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.909
 competent 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.909
 OK 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.560
 look for one has as a sound by god 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.540
 this is like the most terrifying version 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.540
 that has pacman look that there 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.180
 you see if you want to play, a 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.450
 bit bad I'm not but it seems that I 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.450
 they are talking 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.149
 and is speaking as a very language 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.890
 demoniac by god what version of batman 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.820
 is with a covenant before for the love of 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.440
 Christ 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.270
 calm calm haberes I think that equal 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.500
 we can move to the first area what 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.150
 what happens is that this is very complicated 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.760
 because in addition everything straight to one side and 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.229
 then you just totally lost the plate 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.940
 as they approach you as it sounds very 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.070
 strange badly studied so many laps 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.020
 right now it's that it does not run anymore 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.390
 of what can already run and what the fuck is 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.560
 what to do because neither one assumes in 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.770
 account one is going to hit the cry of my 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.770
 lifetime 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.180
 because it is active to pass from this what 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.579
 I see how complicated I have it 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.220
 that I do like pussy and how much is 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.870
 My good thing is that there are areas that do not have 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.150
 absolutely nothing and like pussy you do 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.379
 this if I send you a device for me like 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.829
 this is therefore a little bit more than 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.829
 advantage 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.349
 we're 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:51.650
 we have chosen the typical way not 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.650
 we want to return we need 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.440
 chasing guys we should 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.510
 skirt these four steps because I feel 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.370
 have a daddy my head thing that is almost 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.299
 impossible the best is here 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.299
 because like 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.140
 what the fuck what the fuck bad guys 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.760
 I'm going to try to calm down a bit 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.470
 because I see it as too complicated 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.780
 I had to give another try but it seems 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.640
 very very difficult to put me on twitter if 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.930
 you get past some of this damn 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.450
 game if it has more level is because I 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.680
 I think I will not be able to do more than not 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.970
 because it's not the typical pacual either 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.770
 normal but it has hallways like 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:31.700
 too empty and that I do not really know 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:33.860
 where two ways come together we can catch 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.130
 this we are going to turn we take this here not 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.440
 for the other side for 35 touring 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.610
 here our square mind only 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.470
 have a back that will not want 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.060
 eat then it is but it is great here 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.290
 see if they are going this Christmas that I'm going so 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.910
 launched because I think it's already so much 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.060
 times of dying we have known the 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.810
 Map 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.810
 plus 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.830
 just as it is the half square we 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.840
 we can leave quietly we have left 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.700
 over here we can one of these and 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.820
 surely here at the end we will have 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.320
 one for the take a bunch we 've 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.970
 found it 's great to dump around here 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.620
 because we continue on this path now 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.210
 we can also catch more for god than 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.250
 there are a lot and they are super bad 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.550
 placed more guys because they're going to 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.550
 eat 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.819
 it is not viable the fact that what 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.430
 find in front and I can not almost 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:33.400
 move or do anything samur or yes or yes is 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.590
 very difficult this thing for god of 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.960
 roberts since this may be the last 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.780
 most terrifying recording attempt of 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:45.930
 pacman known to date a 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.930
 dressed in cane we're a bit of a drain 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.690
 God 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.230
 these selling themselves guys sitting 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.010
 pass me was that possible is impossible 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.010
 welcome the catch one 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:05.530
 by god we are 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.530
 the day we want it 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.310
 this part I think I 'm 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.810
 inventing I only have 46 lots left 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.750
 right now that is for this so 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.220
 It can be a good 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.320
 I did not declare he came back 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.060
 we catch more quietly just me 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.110
 eat like two the bases that are and by 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.200
 the center my grandfather on this part 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.580
 there are 22 but those right now is that 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.380
 when you turn this one with people with people 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.690
 they take the walls are disgusting guys 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.730
 they have not left the balls these I already 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.930
 that are on the other side thing that I 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.930
 they are coming as they are seeing 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:44.620
 I can not make myself building 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.660
 I do not have to hear ghosts I hear 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.430
 everywhere what I do not want is 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.620
 stop for me or turn me because I know 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.070
 that almost all of them choose me 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.070
 he just said 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.400
 if you want to play what we are not that 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.200
 comment 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.760
 bad batman because he has behaved very badly 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.760
 a very big hug until the next
