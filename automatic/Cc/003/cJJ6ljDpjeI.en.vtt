00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.360
 from the last time we have 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.670

 I'll get in touch with him we're going to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.140
 repeat the same formula I would make a 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.460
 question that you have it there which is which 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.170
 is the only Spanish player to win the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.200
 golden ball I'm a track played in the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.240
 barça and still playing today play 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.890
 with the name is worth because today 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.590
 a player who is called exactly 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.380
 equal only golden Spanish ball that what 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.450
 has gotten is a Spanish player worth 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.590
 do not break your head because it is a 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.990
 Spanish player for the answer by 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.909
 example I will put a case I think about 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.700
 father players won the golden ball very 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.729
 simple the answer is very simple 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.490
 For example, I say aurelio fernández 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.380
 the golden ball in 1835 when still 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.450
 exist in football because I would put 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.450
 aurelio fernández and my social network 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.649

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.269

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.440
 previous many already understood it very 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.630
 easy is very simple 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.870
 in the comments the answer that 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.940
 we create and we are going to put there is a happy 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.260
