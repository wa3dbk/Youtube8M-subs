00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
can make this stick now and can open up

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.740 
can make this stick now and can open up
a<00:04:46.050> couple<00:04:46.260> of<00:04:46.410> lengths<00:04:46.770> through<00:04:47.430> these<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.750> sort

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
a couple of lengths through these a sort

of mid speed technical coroner's Cal

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.580 
of mid speed technical coroner's Cal
he's<00:04:51.120> got<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.450> open<00:04:51.570> up<00:04:51.840> enough<00:04:52.139> so<00:04:52.260> down<00:04:52.410> that

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
he's got to open up enough so down that

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.140 
he's got to open up enough so down that
long<00:04:52.710> black<00:04:52.919> I'll<00:04:53.190> back<00:04:53.400> straight<00:04:53.700> he<00:04:53.820> doesn't

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
long black I'll back straight he doesn't

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.790 
long black I'll back straight he doesn't
get<00:04:54.210> blown<00:04:54.419> by<00:04:54.630> that's<00:04:54.990> right<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.440> think<00:04:55.680> he

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
get blown by that's right and I think he

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.260 
get blown by that's right and I think he
realized<00:04:56.039> that<00:04:56.490> if<00:04:56.550> he<00:04:56.669> waited<00:04:57.030> much<00:04:57.240> longer

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
realized that if he waited much longer

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.060 
realized that if he waited much longer
those<00:04:57.870> cars<00:04:58.110> right<00:04:58.350> behind<00:04:58.380> and<00:04:58.830> we're<00:04:58.919> going

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
those cars right behind and we're going

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.320 
those cars right behind and we're going
to<00:04:59.130> start<00:04:59.310> pressuring<00:04:59.610> him<00:04:59.970> and<00:05:00.180> making<00:05:00.330> his

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
to start pressuring him and making his
