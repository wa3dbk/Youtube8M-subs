00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
let's watch this in slow motion can

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.340 
let's watch this in slow motion can
Eddie<00:00:49.309> anybody<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.610> explain<00:00:51.289> how<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
Eddie anybody just explain how the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.910 
Eddie anybody just explain how the
physics<00:00:53.219> were<00:00:53.489> created<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.690> game<00:00:54.960> fifa

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920

physics were created for this game fifa
13<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.610> mean<00:00:56.850> better<00:00:57.449> shock<00:00:57.840> chomps<00:00:58.199> punches

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
13 I mean better shock chomps punches

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.029 
13 I mean better shock chomps punches
out<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> bow<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.270> diego<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.750> better<00:01:01.590> check<00:01:01.890> is

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
out the bow to diego and better check is

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.000 
out the bow to diego and better check is
running<00:01:02.460> back<00:01:02.699> look<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.470> it<00:01:04.470> should<00:01:04.739> go

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
running back look and it should go

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.000 
running back look and it should go
inside<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.270> goal<00:01:06.510> because<00:01:07.409> he<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.710> diving

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
inside the goal because he is diving

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.899 
inside the goal because he is diving
into<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.880> goal<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.740> it<00:01:10.740> hits<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.369> inside<00:01:11.610> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
into the goal and it hits the inside of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.289 
into the goal and it hits the inside of
his<00:01:12.119> hand<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.900> should<00:01:13.260> rebound<00:01:13.939> into<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
his hand so it should rebound into the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.020 
his hand so it should rebound into the
goal<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.560> instead<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.400> rebounding

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
goal and it's the instead of rebounding

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
goal and it's the instead of rebounding
into<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> goal<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.290> ball<00:01:19.500> actually<00:01:19.830> rebounds

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
into the goal the ball actually rebounds

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.789 
into the goal the ball actually rebounds
out<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> goal<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.229> let<00:01:22.380> me<00:01:22.409> know<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
out of the goal so let me know in the
