00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello friends here to get here 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.800
 Presentation of the chronicle 720 acid cross 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.330
 creek polish or have been here 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.760
 the model from the 13th is this feature 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.789
 something with some features 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.430
 I noticed anyway once I is 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.090
 I'm a professional but the tires of his 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.160
 bill big 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.019
 Overall, very very high but what 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.610
 as I said not if that's right 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:36.930
 what you look like here is the 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:45.480
 German-greek stöhr just once 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:48.450
 the man who is perhaps the brightest 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.030
 maybe it's time to call it that 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.730
 one can believe that one can do it now 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.899
 take care if you know it 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.820
 What you have here is cabin lighting 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.829
 that is at least clear what 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.150
 One only has this one improved 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.560
 texture okay i know the previous text 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.240
 without the font in front is goodwill 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.299
 that you're good there's nothing to it 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.400
 also criticize the details like here the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.350
 fire extinguisher you briefly in the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.070
 inside dashboard you can do so 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.810
 recognizing such the rest is 13 13 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.610
 10 of course that's obvious 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.060
 So therefore you need not mean long 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.560
 Talk about what you just here 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.680
 the stability has made rat weights 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.490
 ps and weights of weights of the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.259
 adapted to the tractor and the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.180
 dynamic outpouring of qualm days axel 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:45.479
 dark now think so what is 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:49.079
 what the skin is he gets dirty it 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.299
 is great and yet so the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.159
 tire finds relationships bisserl what 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.000
 be either too big or too wide or 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.260
 too fat as you can so what 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.380
 made 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:06.210
 it is here grab dust particles and 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.920
 tire marks of course that's very 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.560
 nice that goes well with it 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.620
 there is little to complain about I am 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.450
 not sure what it looks like 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.810
 on the rhine as it looks to me a lot 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.490
 moral performance warning ok has 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.820
 investigate something related 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.280
 should be so bad mistakes 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.050
 technical problems before we very much 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:38.370
 from the physics of physics there are now 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:41.190
 not really any problems are just these 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.090
 angle of inclination the finder bad emine 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.500
 life visible 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.870
 also the digital one 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:53.190
 Speed ​​gauge tachometer 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.560
 you can also see here and 15 live the 13th 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.190
 what you have tried is that you have the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.830
 115 mirror 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.480
 they can easily fit in or fit 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.790
 quite in the mirror that could be 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.500
 maybe just adjust more track width 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.770
 but otherwise there is nothing bad 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.430
 bad it is just short air 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.470
 up 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.489
 This year can be relatively bad 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.450
 ever read this achronix 720 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.220
 comes good read 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.030
 but these are the small things the tires 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.730
 height wide mass no idea or says 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.370
 then you could still adjust tracks 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.830
 or that important, I'm pretty sure 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.640
 but it runs like it should be in the 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.010
 Write comments 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.360
 if the conditions are right 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.000
 or not otherwise for normally 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.790
 you only test polish cards but for 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.290
 a polish tractor definitely not 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.180
 bad I thank you as always 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.860
 quite cordial for seeing and being 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.570
 I'm happy if you first time 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.790
 See you bye bye without stopping 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.100
 stop stop look in the shop is right 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.800
 We just look in the shop and look 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.110
 us here of this model no longer 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.260
 How else everyday will men in the 1000 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.600
 euro from the price 275er girl under the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.980
 hood all definitely ever 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.910
 let's see with the best you can 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.210
 quite a bit of 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.010
 and cause court so deserve now we
