00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.979 
on your instrument I'm not a bass player
so<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.820> can<00:04:02.060> go<00:04:02.180> back<00:04:02.299> there<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.570> play<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.810> bass

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
so I can go back there and play the bass

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.020 
so I can go back there and play the bass
parts<00:04:03.320> but<00:04:03.530> you're<00:04:03.709> not<00:04:03.830> gonna<00:04:04.010> get<00:04:04.310> what<00:04:05.000> a

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
parts but you're not gonna get what a

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.030 
parts but you're not gonna get what a
symphony<00:04:05.660> player<00:04:05.930> is<00:04:06.110> gonna<00:04:06.260> sound<00:04:06.620> like<00:04:06.799> on<00:04:07.010> a

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
symphony player is gonna sound like on a

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.039 
symphony player is gonna sound like on a
base<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.640> so<00:04:07.850> I<00:04:07.880> think<00:04:08.060> it's<00:04:08.330> very<00:04:08.480> important

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
base and so I think it's very important

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.960 
base and so I think it's very important
for<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.320> kids<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.680> say<00:04:09.890> that's<00:04:10.610> what<00:04:10.850> I'm

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.810 
for the kids to say that's what I'm
supposed<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.450> sound<00:04:11.690> like<00:04:11.870> or<00:04:12.519> that's<00:04:13.519> what<00:04:13.790> I

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
supposed to sound like or that's what I

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.620 
supposed to sound like or that's what I
can<00:04:14.150> do<00:04:14.590> if<00:04:15.590> I<00:04:15.799> if<00:04:16.070> I<00:04:16.220> work<00:04:16.519> I<00:04:16.820> can<00:04:17.209> be<00:04:17.359> there

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630
