00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.069
 moin moin and welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.160
 new for beginners this with the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.860
 theme fixed camera or free chambers 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.620
 Michael butcher someone asked he can 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.060
 I play with the free camera but 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.190
 it is still a bit problematic 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.560
 and if I'm not there to make a video 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.360
 can and that I do now and at 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.119
 I have my research on the internet 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.770
 it states that you do not have any 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.260
 only video in German only one 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.949
 English video exists for and before 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.920
 two years 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.200
 and nothing else either 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.899
 is seems to be the need to be so because 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.670
 simply do not have people to video 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.340
 and then we just go 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.130
 pioneer and start with it 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.930
 as first we look at the places we 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.780
 the whole thing at all 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.489
 down here next to the mini market in the new 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.190
 interface you see such a small camera 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.559
 there you can press on and then stands 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.180
 there stop either camera lok or unlock 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.539
 or the last of both chambers at the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.250
 old interface is up here that 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.240
 means you can watch it once and 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.229
 Try what he plays when you play 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.860
 to write the comments 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.950
 and yes well, of course, is fixed 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.310
 the disadvantage quite clearly i want now 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.680
 here is what I want here the tower 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.930
 see for example but the earlier 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.280
 rather see the opponent behind me and me 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.830
 brings nothing if I now this 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.270
 excerpt here who does that for me 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.009
 now the guard does not make sense 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.210
 that's why and the free camera 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.750
 go up now that will work again 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.220
 fixed camera of course not but one 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.590
 great advantage is of course in the team 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.120
 battle when five on five is must 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.590
 In any case, you are always where you are 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.650
 what you can do you still have 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.620
 problems any ultimate 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.700
 for example , here is the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.710
 ultimate of the little boy 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.420
 if you like the kite for example 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.670
 meet volt is that from this 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.320
 position could be extremely difficult now 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.420
 Somehow shoot and guess where you are 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.460
 down strikes, or at least you can on the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.010
 but do not know how to press minimap 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.510
 Exactly if you meet and or if 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.979
 I now here we meet on the mini 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.960
 viewed med future and it Press 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.030
 but that's not the way it works 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.550
 sense to shoot somehow 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.030
 Therefore, I hold a fixed camera 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.720
 Of course it is very questionable 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.460
 of course you 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.020
 you could still do the left 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.790
 Press the mouse button 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.190
 that would probably go on the minimap 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.350
 but this variant just no longer 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.260
 as soon as you let go you will jump 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.240
 he advances camera on one again 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.550
 yourself and you will always be tracked 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.190
 if we compare to that now 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.980
 free camera so the active thing here 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.530
 back down here we can go to 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.630
 Example, the champion here behind 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.170
 but then let's look up there 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.550
 I do not drive much anymore 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.110
 interested and straightforward and could 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.190
 for example, synonymous fixed camera 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.900
 by not going through it naturally anymore 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.480
 now the ultimate meet against it though 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.459
 I am now on new camera I can do 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.800
 For example, we go and say okay 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.590
 I go there now and maybe 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.370
 I luck and I met him the disadvantage 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.260
 Of course it's clear 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.390
 You always have to go down to the edge 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.660
 shit right around her 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.440
 can somehow go around there and 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.320
 can do something 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.300
 which of course clear but that ye 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.800
 of course the advantage as I said that 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.420
 you can look over them you can 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.170
 Watching something up there because only ultimate 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.980
 in oblique or here 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.390
 if you no longer have your character 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.330
 because he gets lost somewhere here 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.530
 you just press spacebar then 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.360
 spill theirs back to you those 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.370
 camera or you can also do the 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.920
 currently anthurie in pressure overload, it is 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.480
 as best camera merely just so long as he 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.190
 the space key pressed why 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.840
 then release page back to normal 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.110
 So maybe for beginners as a tip 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.200
 Just let the last one and press 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.740
 You can then do more things with it 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.600
 do 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.180
 Of course it does not apply though 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.820
 teenagers also for normal bed though 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.520
 I now have the fixed camera in it and 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.800
 have for example now the courier and 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.690
 I hardly see any mangold minions here 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.100
 or because there is even longer 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.510
 world they can fly further than 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.060
 now the little boy and that is 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.769
 of course, a problem that has since 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.330
 I also do not meet the ability 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.710
 can and how said is 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.700
 limited once you want certain 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.560
 do not see scopes 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.090
 example behind you is none but 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.680
 only event the motives are the whole 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.550
 opponent then of course you want this 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.620
 area seen 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.210
 with the fixed camera phone no 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.870
 possibility to get there even if 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.490
 you have a word or here 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.450
 had run that minions somewhere long 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.640
 I can not do that then 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.580
 hingucken 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.020
 That's why I would recommend you 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.010
 tried with the free camera is on 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.840
 maybe a little bit at the beginning 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.360
 getting used to in the end must 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.790
 you walk around I tell him he clicks 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.930
 for example, depending on the front and made 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.750
 the camera is a bit forward 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.030
 and put it around and when he runs 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.720
 then you have time and can go map and 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.330
 move it 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.310
 in the meantime , if somewhere 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.160
 running the automatic made her 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.910
 Of course you can use this time and 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.790
 your 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.540
 I should postpone it anyway 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.270
 That's how I do it 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:23.840
 where and move my map 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.800
 and there is a lot of the enemy and left 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.800
 my ultimate on him 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.940
 I hope you have the video or 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.370
 free chambers drop like it 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.990
 thumb up there else check 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.050
 again down in the direction of facebook and 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:58.430
 twitter and informs well 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.430
 and bye
