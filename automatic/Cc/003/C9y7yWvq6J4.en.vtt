00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 yo everyone a new video 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.340
 commented that this time will bring on a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.080
 little swell for the flannel game that is 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.529
 simple enough if you will help to make your 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.770
 shops without too much trouble so I 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.600
 will show you that a bit or so 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.119
 it's my first commented video 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.400
 so if you can be a little 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.969
 indulgent this is it would be nice 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.430
 so yes I put you a little bit of 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.350
 tutorial to understand what it takes 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.660
 make 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.489
 we know not too complicated do you 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 do not worry there is not really any 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.120
 worries is good for the v 16 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.050
 17 had it not work on v 19 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.879
 August you want more or less and 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.879
 it works only on official file 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.090
 So in cali it can not 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.250
 operate under a few other 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.850
 emulators 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.790
 good must have downloaded download 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.270
 the tool that will of course be in the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:16.290
 description of my video that 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.229
 will present so you can launched that's it 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.200
 there will be a small start the time that it 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.450
 this launch no worries and you will see 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.290
 all really is really 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.290
 complete besides after you know you 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.250
 really have everything you need 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.640
 wait i have already created 2 3 2 3 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.600
 inventory so for example 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.500
 that would be all your creations 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.070
 so for me that's it for example I 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.350
 you show a moon creates so you 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.729
 will see it's really a not responding 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.899
 So here it is, it's really 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.700
 really nice you just have to 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:03.600
 insert then and then no problem then 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.820
 yes, that's it, it's already 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.200
 programmed a man you just have to 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.590
 put under your 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.590
 wish pnj sellers so for example 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.780
 is alley where after you have it all 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.550
 to enjoy but characters inc y'a 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:28.940
 no worries for that then the wood the 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:31.200
 vote on the entire sprang so then 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.560
 what do you want to do you 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.709
 want to add an item so here is your 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.680
 work where eternit m so to see the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.489
 item ideas a small block items 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.140
 opened at launch all so 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.840
 for example I want the ticket rarity zia 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.480
 lasting seven days so his idea 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.060
 it's 26 1962 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.060
 so I get it from an ID 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.459
 size then you make the touch 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.340
 entrance then there your ethic and of 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.069
 viella rarity so you want to add it 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.049
 in the bucket for example the slow the slow 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.780
 1 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:19.200
 that's the slogan you're going to do next 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.560
 added the item so that's it then you see 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.930
 an item so an item we will try to 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.190
 add a second item for good 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.130
 show you how it works 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.889
 since good when you understood 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.120

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:37.859
 any worry what are we going to put a 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.980
