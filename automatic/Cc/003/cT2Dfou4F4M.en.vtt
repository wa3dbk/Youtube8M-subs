00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.190
 and what about between facebook and youtube here 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.140
 the male is canache with a new video 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.570
 this time speaking is by common with better 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.450
 design taking into account the opinion of 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.089
 you and I hope you enjoy it convert 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.309
 of like what you want and I want to ask you 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.430
 a favor send the video to the end 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.710
 how important it is at the end of this 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.020
 video and I hope you enjoy it as well as the 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.960
 start to this video of the pokemon with 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:33.040
 better design not staggered so far 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:37.610
 good to start being crime alcalá is 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.040
 a little more to a mythical creature 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.980
 perhaps it is mainly characterized by 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.240
 his speed his special attack and his 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.670
 attack 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.580
 if you are starting in this of the games 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.730
 from pokémon I recommend it is very good 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.060
 option is very strong and is very good 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.310
 companion 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.800
 the next one is hook garzón is 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.020
 based on a shark this because it's 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.110
 highly used in competitive has 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.540
 a very high attack speed and 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.640
 he receives a lot of bullying since he does not 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.310
 learn the Aragonese but it does not matter anymore 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.230
 that with a sword dance it can end 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.760
 with whole equipment and it's very dangerous 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.830
 you have to take care of much of the silo must 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.870
 be competitive 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.180
 the next one is goal gross the forward 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.870
 shit that this pokemon is based on 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.360
 but it has an attack and a very strong defense 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.140
 high this harbor montt its habitat is 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.200
 naturally in mountainous areas and 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.120
 although its speed is somewhat low it is 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.760
 fully compensated with an attack 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.470
 higher than 400 so it's very 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.230
 It is also advisable to use it in 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.360
 competitive 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.860
 here we have the dragon on this point 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.710
 world reaches a great defense and has 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.590
 access to a mega evolution that has 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.690
 a defense higher than 600 is not very 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.540
 used since it is your special defense 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.870
 it's low and its speed too but it's 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.750
 a great physical wall 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.210
 it's short and a little a normal guy 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.880
 flying is based on an eagle 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.840
 it is not widely used since its speed 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.680
 and their defenses are somewhat low but their 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.570
 attack is high and its design is 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.730
 sincerely spectacular the truth is 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.000
 the best by as normal flying 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.220
 in terms of design 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.950
 we have a hunt or that if we talk about 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.470
 designs this is one of the best and one 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.050
 of my favorites since 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.620
 your combination of types your speed and 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.940
 his access to being an attacker in mixed 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.050
 as very good very complete and above all 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.000
 It is widely used in double battles 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.760
 good since the fifth generation comes and 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.460
 dragon and de jong is a bit a kind of 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.760
 dark dragon was very used in the 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.530
 fifth generation but its use went down a lot 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.140
 in this generation since it became 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.080
 weak for 4 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.180
 to the fairy type but its design is very similar 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.830
 good and is based on a hydra is one 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.720
 of the fifth generation foals with 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.780
 better design if it is not the best 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.260
 and from the shadows comes the legendary 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.410
 first generation I'm slow I did not want 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.840
 include legendary but if we are 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.680
 talking about designs this should be 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.960
 in this top a lot they mention me and I 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.640
 attracts most very good memories 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.850
 of this little molds in fans being one 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.820
 of the protagonists of the series more 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.920
 specifically from the movies and it's from 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.900
 psychic type and its characteristic 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.800
 Main speed and attack 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.740
 special 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.880
 well, almost reaching the end we have 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.490
 a season 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.350
 this pokemon is highly used in 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.290
 competitive and that is not for less its 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.260
 design and its attack make it a great little 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.510
 common does not do a bit much used 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.049
 have access to 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:12.500
 bullet fist has access to large quantity 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.870
 of attacks that can be very harmful and 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.109
 that's why this is very used is kind 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.940
 Steel bug is highly recommended too 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.440
 for those who are playing competitive 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.800
 they are starting to play this fucking 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.289
 mont if you know how to use it well it's very very 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.870
 difficult to defeat and now yes 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.210
 last has come to the little better design 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.630
 of all the others that I have shown 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.380
 they have been totally garbage next to 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.500
 this 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.960
 this then as it follows is 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.390
 the best design of all of the six 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.060
 generations that go so far there's no 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.270
 comparison and here it shows them a 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.820
 so this milestone look at those muscles 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.690
 look at that design that face of my god 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.700
 it is an incredible pokémon its design is the 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.320
 I hope you also have it in 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:05.300
 consideration and already with this final masters 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.770

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.860
 can better to worse just was a top with 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.340
