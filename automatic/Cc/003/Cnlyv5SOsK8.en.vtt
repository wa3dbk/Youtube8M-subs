00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
don't need to put a lot of muscle power

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.350 
don't need to put a lot of muscle power
into<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.670> have<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:53.910> at<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.180> right

into it to have it at the right
consistency<00:02:54.690> ready<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.410> roll<00:02:55.650> you'll<00:02:56.250> know

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
consistency ready to roll you'll know

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.070 
consistency ready to roll you'll know
it's<00:02:56.550> ready<00:02:56.640> when<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.360> feels<00:02:57.720> nice<00:02:58.020> and

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
it's ready when it feels nice and

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.780 
it's ready when it feels nice and
malleable<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.860> it's<00:02:59.010> warmed<00:02:59.370> up<00:02:59.490> a<00:02:59.580> little

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
malleable and it's warmed up a little

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.940 
malleable and it's warmed up a little
bit<00:02:59.940> but<00:03:00.120> it's<00:03:00.270> not<00:03:00.330> sticky<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.260> then<00:03:01.770> at<00:03:01.860> this

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
bit but it's not sticky and then at this

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.830 
bit but it's not sticky and then at this
point<00:03:02.220> flip<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.790> over<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:03.360> have<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.570> nice

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
point flip it over so you have a nice

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.050 
point flip it over so you have a nice
bowl<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.470> now<00:03:05.010> we're<00:03:05.190> going<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.400> liberally

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
bowl and now we're going to liberally

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.970 
bowl and now we're going to liberally
dust<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.420> work<00:03:06.540> surface<00:03:07.110> with<00:03:07.260> icing<00:03:07.770> sugar

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
dust the work surface with icing sugar

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.160 
dust the work surface with icing sugar
we<00:03:08.610> don't<00:03:08.970> want<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.300> stick<00:03:09.570> as<00:03:09.690> we<00:03:09.840> roll<00:03:10.020> it

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
we don't want it to stick as we roll it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.260 
we don't want it to stick as we roll it
out<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:10.709> I've<00:03:11.400> rolled<00:03:11.640> out<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:11.970> thickness

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
out so I've rolled out to a thickness

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.260 
out so I've rolled out to a thickness
here<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.900> around<00:03:13.370> three<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.520> four<00:03:14.550> millimeters

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
here of around three to four millimeters

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.570 
here of around three to four millimeters
which<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.690> ideal<00:03:16.020> for<00:03:16.080> covering<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:17.250> little

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
which is ideal for covering this little

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.199 
which is ideal for covering this little
vanilla<00:03:18.060> cake<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.720> then<00:03:19.500> lift<00:03:19.739> up<00:03:20.120> over<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
vanilla cake and then lift up over the

surface of the cake and allow the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.920 
surface of the cake and allow the
marzipan<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.489> fall<00:03:23.730> this<00:03:24.390> way<00:03:24.630> I've<00:03:24.750> got<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
marzipan to fall this way I've got a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.930 
marzipan to fall this way I've got a
nice<00:03:25.230> even<00:03:25.709> amount<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:26.070> marzipan<00:03:26.370> all<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.850> way

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
nice even amount of marzipan all the way

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.910 
nice even amount of marzipan all the way
around<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.300> cake<00:03:27.510> which<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.290> can<00:03:28.440> then<00:03:28.470> use<00:03:28.739> my

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
around the cake which I can then use my

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.070 
around the cake which I can then use my
hands<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.700> flats<00:03:29.970> of<00:03:30.120> my<00:03:30.209> hands<00:03:30.600> for<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.900> base

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
hands the flats of my hands for the base

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.330 
hands the flats of my hands for the base

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
position all the way around and then I'm

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.830 
position all the way around and then I'm
going<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:37.980> trim<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.850> excess<00:03:39.360> just<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.720> leave

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
going to trim the excess just to leave

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.220 
going to trim the excess just to leave
myself<00:03:40.670> an<00:03:41.670> excess<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.269> around<00:03:42.570> two

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
myself an excess of around two

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.110 
myself an excess of around two
centimetres<00:03:43.920> all<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.610> way<00:03:44.700> around<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.120> cake

centimetres all the way around the cake

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.699 
centimetres all the way around the cake
and<00:03:48.120> then<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.540> take<00:03:48.720> my<00:03:48.870> blade<00:03:49.140> up<00:03:49.320> at<00:03:49.470> eye-level

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
and then I take my blade up at eye-level

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.080 
and then I take my blade up at eye-level
and<00:03:50.570> use<00:03:51.570> this<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.959> slice<00:03:52.410> underneath<00:03:53.090> the

edges so it's slightly more rounded at

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.719 
edges so it's slightly more rounded at
the<00:05:51.870> bottom<00:05:52.229> so<00:05:52.439> it's<00:05:52.560> not<00:05:52.680> got<00:05:52.830> a<00:05:52.860> hard<00:05:53.159> blunt

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.360 
the bottom so it's not got a hard blunt
edge<00:05:54.210> on<00:05:54.689> what<00:05:54.900> would<00:05:54.990> be<00:05:55.169> the<00:05:55.199> icing<00:05:55.979> on<00:05:56.310> the
