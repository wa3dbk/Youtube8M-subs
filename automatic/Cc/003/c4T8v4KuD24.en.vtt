00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.850
 hello how 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.870
 how it costs a lot to get the figurines and 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.960
 and put it on the table is mentioned vital is to make a single chapter 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.890
 of the pull those who always dressed with the same clothes 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.320
 and that got rid of the technicians 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.650
 percent 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.730
 this second chapter 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.109
 about that 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.689
 deserves his chapter of the miniseries about my favorite figures of this 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.689
 coarse bag centered 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.539
 min figures 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.539
 ridiculous 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 and unnecessary g that have been made but that I still have 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.820
 but good is a way to 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.560
 the societal 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.650
 in the last two years because his life in his day 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.870
 one of the first venues 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.990
 today as I saw it as one of the other flavors 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.110
 they die rehn 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.329
 in the first part he was not alone you have a new episode 4 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.480
 samoré 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.540
 but it does not disappear it becomes a ghost of a presence 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.040
 accompany him to luke skywalker 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.060
 throughout the next two films the empire strikes back and the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.360
 return of the king 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.920
 how to solve that erc ballot 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.310
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.490
 of making a high figure plasma sale 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.020
 jazz rock is fast and good 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.080
 Well, very simple 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.080
 has been a transparent figure the blue plastic 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.630
 I did not look for expression on my face 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.870
 level 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.920
 hair on the beard or something like that because 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.610
 it simply is 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.170
 something like one of his figures of Madrid b glass that could have 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.570
 your grandmothers on top of 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.570
 on the table chair or 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.259
 2 really incredible and that's how they were the virgin 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.030
 dn the macarena or something like that 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.830
 I'm sure you have not made it with the same material 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.830
 for a long time I thought that I forced care but 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.209
 you can see what not 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.069
 this young wan kenobi 70 henchmen 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.779
 the next time 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.489
 the musician 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.469
 as you will remember cnn 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.569
 in the canteen there 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.849
 a band of resident musicians 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.039
 what with all 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.039
 of a kind of pitches 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.160
 new Orleans 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.809
 b as well as new orleans but 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.809
 connery the unmistakable taste of tatuí 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.889
 this one assures is not particularly ridiculous in fact you can say today you 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.450
 liked it is conceived nobel 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.450
 the alien is very very realistic but 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.820
 there is one this highlights the manufacturing that see 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.649
 it seemed unfortunate and that is 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.879
 how you buy the one who played the clarinet was what he played 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:04.419
 per cent the trumpet from the band very simple you do not have to go choosing 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:09.609
 efe one of the musicians concrete but only shopping 5 6 7 and another band 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:10.789
 complete because 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:14.409
 because with each one of them comes the whole instrument kit this should 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:15.489
 be like 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.939
 a sae clarinet bonus 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.939
 this of what we say is the transverse flute 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.609
 this is 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.649
 the accordion 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:28.769
 galactic 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.089
 and that 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:33.039
 he really did not think about it because it seems 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.499
 the base of a brazier 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.409
 musicians of the Seattle band 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.349
 the following is what they call 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.719
 n the previous one was a kind of name 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.999
 in trades or on the internet and in the end it ended up being 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.319
 assimilated by the master manufacturers 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.939
 kayak 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.109
 for the bad and bad this 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.419
 the steppes 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.519
 this man should not be in the wars thanks for the face I do not know if not 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.719
 you can see well 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.719
 It seems a character behind the theft 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.969
 no sir it is not scary nor does it look like a monstrous lima creature just a 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:14.109
 a grandfather a grandfather with a mustache and hair on his ears 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.479
 I still do not have 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.090
 and that's supposed to be a weapon 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.739
 I think it's a vast 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:22.540
 good 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.680
 other more ridiculous 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.449
 the alacantí the cradle of this sport to six 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.400
 is supposed to be a character who also appears in the canteen 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.970
 or some say it is that it enters the group d 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:38.129
 of low friends and in his court I have not seen any of the two movies 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.240
 well for a hundred among that group nourished 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.419
 we have seen is that there is in the canteen and also the court she is going 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.419
 this one is 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:51.889
 Mary late 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.710
 the stick with the 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.419
 that I really do not know what it is is like a great new lizard 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.419
 a the oposicón with very long arms and 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.830
 could be 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.930
 a creature that appeared in the film 'anaconda' by jennifer lópez 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.009
 and nostradamus taboos 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.430
 not only has lips painted red 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.140
 but it also comes with they were told a stick with 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.460
 careers we look like their human skulls 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.080
 morricone 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.520
 with a skeleton without a head 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.520
 The head is supposed to be fair in August 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.449
 min 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.449
 I do not know I do not have words 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.680
 lilly shabby figures 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.380
 the figure of Ivan does not seem especially unfortunate to us in him 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.169
 see speak elder 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.879
 hence the one that excludes luke skywalker on the planet obama 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:53.589
 in the movies 

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:56.180
 the empire strikes back and the return of the jedi 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.220
 if not that of I do not know if you remember there is a part in the empire it counterattacks the 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.939
 who was waiting for him 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:03.849
 English gets on the hump of 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.289
 in what the latter with the pc backpack 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.549
 Well, I guess they could not resist and they made the backpack 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.910
 I have tried for years to put 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.809
 and around here the little arms of 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.449
 luke skywalker but it's impossible 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.449
 I have never managed to put state we are and lan 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.860
 therefore none of the luxury figures 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.970
 It does not seem like an unworthy destination for a figure as important as it is 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:30.639
 I 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.849
 the loans 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:35.860
 - pc in the shopping cart 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.139
 here to finish 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.569
 there are some figures attacked in that is an inexhaustible source figure ridiculous 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:49.350
 you have to add points the ones that are more or less the feet that handle the 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.080
 from him the carbon chamber in which 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.050
 he does not catch the ball 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.969
 Jan only at the end of the empire strikes back 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:01.159
 Come have the two juntitos 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:02.570
 and these are 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.930
 that I do not know if they are Mr. and Mrs. or balloon the case is that one of them has 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.930
 a small briefcase 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:13.210
 the faces are a little 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.070
 of weights of these masses pedestrian finished slogans that releases 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.559
 percent the injured out there that 

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:23.639
 that they will never be null votes 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:26.969
 the designers of the clubs had in mind pigs 

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:29.139
 when they did this 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:33.119
 impulse I think that really mind did not have many things from the bcr 

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:36.829
 we're going to take the train habits we have here we put them the first 

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:39.829
 masks and how 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.259
 I left or we have and you're 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.300
 what's in the briefcase 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.149
 I do not understand, I do not have words before 

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:51.069
 mockus alone 

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:54.929
 five most ridiculous figures I have of him my collection of shoes 

00:07:54.929 --> 00:07:55.589
