00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.539 
instead of two dimensional and so
there's<00:02:05.440> that<00:02:05.680> kind<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:05.979> stuff<00:02:06.159> you<00:02:06.190> just<00:02:06.310> have

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
there's that kind of stuff you just have

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.550 
there's that kind of stuff you just have
to<00:02:06.670> get<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:06.880> word<00:02:07.060> out<00:02:07.210> of<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.930> once<00:02:08.289> we<00:02:08.440> do

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
to get the word out of it and once we do

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.340 
to get the word out of it and once we do
that<00:02:08.590> it'll<00:02:09.009> well<00:02:09.610> we<00:02:09.880> could<00:02:10.060> over<00:02:10.989> a<00:02:11.019> million

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
that it'll well we could over a million

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.320 
that it'll well we could over a million
people<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.800> month<00:02:11.950> watching<00:02:12.400> our<00:02:12.519> videos<00:02:12.850> and

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
people a month watching our videos and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.650 
people a month watching our videos and
it<00:02:14.319> is<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.890> new<00:02:15.360> generation<00:02:16.360> it's<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
it is the new generation it's the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.750 
it is the new generation it's the
Millennials<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.319> can<00:02:17.500> say<00:02:17.620> about<00:02:17.739> so<00:02:18.190> it's<00:02:18.370> 20

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
Millennials I can say about so it's 20

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.180 
Millennials I can say about so it's 20
to<00:02:18.880> 30<00:02:19.120> s<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.500> hopefully<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.890> know<00:02:21.010> they're

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
to 30 s and hopefully you know they're

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.880 
to 30 s and hopefully you know they're
really<00:02:21.489> environmentally<00:02:22.380> conscious<00:02:23.380> well

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
really environmentally conscious well

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.740 
really environmentally conscious well
and<00:02:24.069> I've<00:02:24.220> got<00:02:24.489> a<00:02:24.519> little<00:02:24.730> spiel<00:02:25.209> i<00:02:25.239> can<00:02:25.600> give

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
and I've got a little spiel i can give

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.940 
and I've got a little spiel i can give
you<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:25.989> weeds<00:02:26.260> too<00:02:27.630> weeds<00:02:28.630> are<00:02:29.110> something

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
you on weeds too weeds are something

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.090 
you on weeds too weeds are something
that<00:02:29.980> we've<00:02:30.250> labeled<00:02:30.580> as<00:02:30.910> bad<00:02:31.690> but<00:02:32.680> if<00:02:32.950> you

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
that we've labeled as bad but if you

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.680 
that we've labeled as bad but if you
just<00:02:33.310> take<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.580> example<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> milkweed

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
just take the example of the milkweed

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.900 
just take the example of the milkweed
that<00:02:35.380> is<00:02:35.680> what's<00:02:35.950> instrumental<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:36.790> getting

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
that is what's instrumental in getting

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.860 
that is what's instrumental in getting
the<00:02:37.090> monarch<00:02:37.480> butterfly<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:38.080> follows<00:02:38.650> its<00:02:39.870> it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
the monarch butterfly it follows its it

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.430 
the monarch butterfly it follows its it
progresses<00:02:41.560> north<00:02:41.860> as<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.239> milkweed

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
progresses north as the milkweed

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.820 
progresses north as the milkweed
produces<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.549> we<00:02:45.940> need<00:02:46.180> these<00:02:46.540> weeds<00:02:46.900> what

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
produces and so we need these weeds what

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.650 
produces and so we need these weeds what
we<00:02:47.980> think<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.340> as<00:02:48.459> being<00:02:48.519> an<00:02:48.790> antagonistic

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
we think of as being an antagonistic

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.259 
we think of as being an antagonistic
plant<00:02:50.260> maybe<00:02:50.950> we<00:02:51.190> need<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.370> change<00:02:51.489> our<00:02:51.880> views

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
plant maybe we need to change our views

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.930 
plant maybe we need to change our views
something<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:53.769> our<00:02:53.980> area<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.489> we've<00:02:54.640> seen

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
something in our area that we've seen

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.150 
something in our area that we've seen
really<00:02:55.420> well<00:02:55.600> as<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:55.989> map<00:02:56.320> we<00:02:56.560> plant<00:02:56.920> they've

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
really well as this map we plant they've

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.590 
really well as this map we plant they've
nearly<00:02:57.400> killed<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:57.940> off<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.209> don't<00:02:58.329> see

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
nearly killed it off you don't see

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.270 
nearly killed it off you don't see
Hurley<00:02:58.930> any<00:02:59.109> of<00:02:59.290> them<00:02:59.410> around<00:02:59.590> anymore<00:02:59.859> oh

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
Hurley any of them around anymore oh

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.720 
Hurley any of them around anymore oh
there's<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:00.640> few<00:03:00.910> over<00:03:01.150> here<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.959> dead

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
there's a few over here the dead

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.729 
there's a few over here the dead
skeletons<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.970> what<00:03:04.390> we're<00:03:04.540> map<00:03:05.140> we<00:03:05.320> plants

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
skeletons of what we're map we plants

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.610 
skeletons of what we're map we plants
last<00:03:05.980> year<00:03:06.340> they're<00:03:07.090> actually<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.540> thistle<00:03:08.260> and

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
last year they're actually a thistle and

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.800 
last year they're actually a thistle and
they're<00:03:09.340> one<00:03:09.489> of<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.640> few<00:03:09.700> things<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.510> will

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
they're one of the few things that will

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.479 
they're one of the few things that will
flower<00:03:11.170> when<00:03:11.530> everything<00:03:12.130> else<00:03:12.250> is

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
flower when everything else is

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.289 
flower when everything else is
completely<00:03:13.420> dry<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.930> bad<00:03:14.109> in<00:03:14.140> audit<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.299> so

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
completely dry and bad in audit and so

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.410 
completely dry and bad in audit and so
it'll<00:03:16.660> be<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.870> source<00:03:17.320> for<00:03:17.790> honey<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.090> for

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
it'll be a source for honey and for

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.120 
it'll be a source for honey and for
pollen<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:19.870> that's<00:03:20.019> a<00:03:20.109> protein<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.739> carbo

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
pollen so that's a protein and carbo

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.160 
pollen so that's a protein and carbo
source<00:03:21.430> for<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.760> bees<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.299> then<00:03:22.959> in<00:03:23.079> the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
source for the bees and then in the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.259 
source for the bees and then in the
winter<00:03:23.380> some<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.430> those<00:03:24.489> little<00:03:24.670> black<00:03:24.940> cap

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
winter some of those little black cap

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.470 
winter some of those little black cap
chickadees<00:03:25.780> will<00:03:26.079> eat<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.410> seeds<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.070> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
chickadees will eat the seeds and the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.330 
chickadees will eat the seeds and the
butterflies<00:03:28.480> will<00:03:29.140> also<00:03:29.560> be<00:03:29.859> using<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.220> and

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
butterflies will also be using it and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.470 
butterflies will also be using it and
the<00:03:30.459> moths<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.950> we<00:03:32.950> have<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.340> maybe<00:03:33.609> open<00:03:33.970> our

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
the moths so we have to maybe open our

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.289 
the moths so we have to maybe open our
view<00:03:34.870> on<00:03:35.170> what<00:03:35.560> we're<00:03:35.769> thinking<00:03:36.040> is<00:03:36.370> nasty<00:03:37.060> and

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
view on what we're thinking is nasty and

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.259 
view on what we're thinking is nasty and
why<00:03:37.600> we're<00:03:37.840> thinking<00:03:38.140> it's<00:03:38.260> nasty<00:03:38.910> why<00:03:39.910> is<00:03:39.970> it

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
why we're thinking it's nasty why is it

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.979 
why we're thinking it's nasty why is it
bad<00:03:40.450> to<00:03:40.510> have<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.959> thistle<00:03:41.350> growing<00:03:41.920> here<00:03:42.989> maybe

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
bad to have a thistle growing here maybe

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.180 
bad to have a thistle growing here maybe
it<00:03:44.170> isn't

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.880 

so<00:03:48.190> that's<00:03:48.370> part<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.760> one<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.120> my<00:03:49.180> little<00:03:49.890> let's

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
so that's part of one of my little let's

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.000 
so that's part of one of my little let's
not<00:03:51.130> kill<00:03:51.460> every<00:03:51.760> weed<00:03:52.380> dandelions<00:03:53.380> great

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
not kill every weed dandelions great

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.770 
not kill every weed dandelions great
source<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.700> fluff<00:03:55.030> from<00:03:55.240> that<00:03:55.480> there's<00:03:55.720> a

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
source the fluff from that there's a

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.360 
source the fluff from that there's a
whole<00:03:55.990> bunch<00:03:56.110> of<00:03:56.290> birds<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.710> follow<00:03:57.070> those

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
whole bunch of birds that follow those

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.610 
whole bunch of birds that follow those
dandelions<00:03:58.150> as<00:03:58.330> they<00:03:58.780> go<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:58.960> fluff<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.500> eat

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
dandelions as they go to fluff and eat

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.040 
dandelions as they go to fluff and eat
the<00:03:59.740> protein<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.400> seeds<00:04:00.670> I've<00:04:01.570> pictures<00:04:02.020> I

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
the protein the seeds I've pictures I
