00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.850 
what i've done is i've selected
miniature<00:00:29.660> trees<00:00:29.899> because<00:00:30.290> as<00:00:30.410> you<00:00:30.529> can<00:00:30.649> see

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
miniature trees because as you can see

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.850 
miniature trees because as you can see
here<00:00:31.129> we<00:00:31.939> only<00:00:32.059> have<00:00:32.270> about<00:00:32.300> eight<00:00:33.050> feet<00:00:33.379> to

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
here we only have about eight feet to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.729 
here we only have about eight feet to
the<00:00:33.890> wall<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.870> it's<00:00:35.870> all<00:00:35.989> I<00:00:36.020> was<00:00:36.230> given<00:00:36.559> so

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
the wall and it's all I was given so

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.110 
the wall and it's all I was given so
that's<00:00:36.860> all<00:00:37.010> I<00:00:37.039> have<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:37.250> work<00:00:37.399> with<00:00:37.430> so<00:00:38.090> i

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
that's all I have to work with so i

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.959 
that's all I have to work with so i
actually<00:00:38.920> will<00:00:39.920> aggressively<00:00:40.399> prune<00:00:40.850> the

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
actually will aggressively prune the

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.360 
actually will aggressively prune the
trees<00:00:41.180> keep<00:00:41.539> them<00:00:41.690> small<00:00:41.930> but<00:00:42.710> also<00:00:43.040> another

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
trees keep them small but also another

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.880 
trees keep them small but also another
thing<00:00:43.489> going<00:00:43.850> for<00:00:43.880> me<00:00:44.060> is<00:00:44.270> that<00:00:44.540> my<00:00:45.410> trees<00:00:45.710> are

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
thing going for me is that my trees are

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.100 
thing going for me is that my trees are
naturally<00:00:46.370> somewhat<00:00:47.270> dwarf<00:00:47.600> they<00:00:47.810> only<00:00:47.930> have

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
naturally somewhat dwarf they only have

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.000 
naturally somewhat dwarf they only have
a<00:00:48.320> span<00:00:48.920> of<00:00:48.950> ten<00:00:49.910> feet<00:00:50.180> at<00:00:50.360> full<00:00:51.020> growth<00:00:51.350> so

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
a span of ten feet at full growth so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.010 
a span of ten feet at full growth so
that's<00:00:52.190> after<00:00:52.460> you<00:00:53.060> know<00:00:53.180> 18<00:00:53.570> years<00:00:53.810> you'll

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
that's after you know 18 years you'll

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.790 
that's after you know 18 years you'll
have<00:00:54.170> a<00:00:54.350> you'll<00:00:55.040> have<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.329> tree<00:00:56.329> span<00:00:56.720> of<00:00:56.960> 10

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
have a you'll have a tree span of 10

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.830 
have a you'll have a tree span of 10
feet<00:00:58.130> so<00:00:58.489> it's<00:00:58.730> all<00:00:59.180> going<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.390> be<00:00:59.450> good<00:00:59.630> it's

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
feet so it's all going to be good it's

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.040 
feet so it's all going to be good it's

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
organic mixture so the roots can grow

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.520 
organic mixture so the roots can grow
now<00:01:23.389> the<00:01:23.450> other<00:01:23.509> thing<00:01:23.659> you<00:01:23.810> want<00:01:24.079> is<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:24.229> make

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
hours of sunlight fruit trees need a lot

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.179 
hours of sunlight fruit trees need a lot
of<00:01:28.219> Sun<00:01:28.459> to<00:01:28.609> grow<00:01:28.880> because<00:01:29.749> they<00:01:30.079> are<00:01:30.350> very

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
of Sun to grow because they are very

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.760 
of Sun to grow because they are very
very<00:01:31.520> vigorous<00:01:32.119> growers<00:01:32.569> and<00:01:33.079> they're<00:01:33.560> going

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
very vigorous growers and they're going

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.349 
very vigorous growers and they're going
to<00:01:33.829> grow<00:01:33.979> several<00:01:34.279> feet<00:01:34.700> in<00:01:34.819> a<00:01:34.880> year<00:01:35.149> if<00:01:35.179> you

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
to grow several feet in a year if you

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.699 
to grow several feet in a year if you
give<00:01:35.509> them<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:35.719> right<00:01:35.899> condition<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:36.619> they

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
give them the right condition so they

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.889 
give them the right condition so they
need<00:01:36.889> all<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:37.100> light<00:01:37.279> they<00:01:37.429> can<00:01:37.490> get<00:01:37.819> so<00:01:38.749> what

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899

the process for prepping the holes the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.330 
the process for prepping the holes the
fruit<00:01:44.659> trees<00:01:44.929> that<00:01:45.049> I<00:01:45.079> have<00:01:45.349> are<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.649> bare<00:01:46.069> root

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
fruit trees that I have are a bare root

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.239 
fruit trees that I have are a bare root
and<00:01:46.639> you<00:01:47.359> can<00:01:47.539> get<00:01:47.719> ones<00:01:47.990> in<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.229> pot<00:01:48.469> on<00:01:48.859> where

this

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
this

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.420 
this
orchard<00:02:18.099> going<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.359> also<00:02:19.540> chose<00:02:20.430> varieties

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
orchard going so I also chose varieties

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.660 
orchard going so I also chose varieties
that<00:02:21.459> are<00:02:21.640> self<00:02:22.120> pollinating<00:02:22.719> because<00:02:23.670> some

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
that are self pollinating because some

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.619 
that are self pollinating because some
varieties<00:02:25.120> require<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:26.489> two<00:02:27.489> different<00:02:28.120> trees

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
varieties require to two different trees

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.440 
varieties require to two different trees
to<00:02:28.959> cross<00:02:29.379> pollinate<00:02:29.620> can<00:02:30.549> you<00:02:30.849> know<00:02:30.969> apples

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
to cross pollinate can you know apples

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.129 
to cross pollinate can you know apples
pears<00:02:32.609> stuff<00:02:33.609> like<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.790> they<00:02:34.329> will<00:02:34.810> produce

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
pears stuff like that they will produce

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.849 
pears stuff like that they will produce
better<00:02:35.469> if<00:02:35.739> you<00:02:36.099> have<00:02:36.280> two<00:02:37.209> varieties<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:38.260> the

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
better if you have two varieties so the

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.140 
better if you have two varieties so the
apple<00:02:39.250> varieties<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.879> pair<00:02:40.090> of

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
apple varieties and the pair of

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.479 
apple varieties and the pair of
varieties<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.540> do<00:02:40.599> have<00:02:40.840> two<00:02:41.139> of<00:02:41.319> them<00:02:41.469> but<00:02:42.099> I<00:02:42.430> do

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
varieties I do have two of them but I do

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.970 
varieties I do have two of them but I do
have<00:02:42.819> some<00:02:43.180> other<00:02:43.540> varieties<00:02:44.260> such<00:02:44.920> as

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
have some other varieties such as

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.970 
have some other varieties such as
peaches<00:02:45.340> nectarines<00:02:45.579> and<00:02:46.480> an<00:02:47.319> Asian<00:02:47.680> pear

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
peaches nectarines and an Asian pear

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.360 
peaches nectarines and an Asian pear
those<00:02:48.730> don't<00:02:48.909> require<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.659> cross<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.680> therefore

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
those don't require a cross so therefore

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.399 
those don't require a cross so therefore
I<00:02:51.579> only<00:02:51.700> got<00:02:51.819> one<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.090> them<00:02:52.299> so<00:02:52.629> I<00:02:52.840> got<00:02:52.989> seven

I only got one of them so I got seven

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.710 
I only got one of them so I got seven

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
the the hole and i made it about two

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.909 
the the hole and i made it about two
times<00:03:32.319> as<00:03:32.680> deep<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.489> about<00:03:34.329> two<00:03:35.049> to<00:03:35.590> one<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:35.799> a

half times is why you know depending on

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.379 
half times is why you know depending on
which<00:03:38.409> way<00:03:38.530> it's<00:03:38.680> twisted<00:03:39.099> obviously<00:03:39.489> but

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
which way it's twisted obviously but

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.059 
which way it's twisted obviously but
it's<00:03:40.540> going<00:03:40.689> to<00:03:40.780> allow<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.109> spread<00:03:41.739> out

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
it's going to allow it to spread out

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.069 
it's going to allow it to spread out
quite<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.370> bit<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.760> it's<00:03:43.479> going<00:03:43.689> to<00:03:43.840> allow<00:03:43.930> it

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
quite a bit and it's going to allow it

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.050 
quite a bit and it's going to allow it
to<00:03:44.260> get<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.799> healthy<00:03:45.189> root<00:03:45.370> system<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.939> support

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
to get a healthy root system to support

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.689 
to get a healthy root system to support
a<00:03:46.329> lot<00:03:46.479> of<00:03:46.629> fruit<00:03:47.139> so<00:03:48.069> basically<00:03:48.430> what<00:03:48.609> I've

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
a lot of fruit so basically what I've

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.679 
a lot of fruit so basically what I've
done<00:03:48.819> here<00:03:48.879> is<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:50.650> prepared<00:03:51.009> a<00:03:51.040> bag<00:03:51.359> of<00:03:52.359> just

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:52.689 
done here is I prepared a bag of just

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.110 
done here is I prepared a bag of just
transplanting<00:03:53.259> mix<00:03:53.439> it's<00:03:54.400> got<00:03:54.549> no<00:03:54.669> fertilizer

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
transplanting mix it's got no fertilizer

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.550 
transplanting mix it's got no fertilizer
and<00:03:55.359> it's<00:03:55.509> just<00:03:55.659> a<00:03:55.750> loose<00:03:56.699> mixture<00:03:57.699> of<00:03:58.560> Pete

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
and it's just a loose mixture of Pete

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.729 
and it's just a loose mixture of Pete
humise<00:04:00.009> and<00:04:02.280> in<00:04:03.280> some<00:04:03.699> organic<00:04:05.939> compost<00:04:06.939> and

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
humise and in some organic compost and

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.990 
humise and in some organic compost and
it's<00:04:08.739> just<00:04:09.040> our<00:04:09.159> it's<00:04:09.430> just<00:04:09.579> a<00:04:09.609> really<00:04:09.759> light

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.229 
mix oh I'm just going to put some of

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:16.499 
mix oh I'm just going to put some of
that<00:04:11.259> in<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.530> hole<00:04:14.759> so<00:04:15.759> that<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:16.150> can<00:04:16.329> have<00:04:16.479> a

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:16.509 
that in the hole so that it can have a

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:20.790 
that in the hole so that it can have a
nice<00:04:16.690> start

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:20.800 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.620 

we<00:04:21.800> get<00:04:21.920> the<00:04:22.010> tree<00:04:22.190> plants<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.640> up<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.510> I'll

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
we get the tree plants it up and I'll

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.380 
we get the tree plants it up and I'll
show<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.990> next<00:04:24.080> step<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:26.030> now<00:04:26.150> what<00:04:26.300> you

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
the soil back filled and the holes fill

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.030 
the soil back filled and the holes fill
then<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.750> want<00:04:32.900> to<00:04:32.960> take<00:04:33.110> all<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.410> extra<00:04:33.710> soil

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
sure that the soil has no large air

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.260 
sure that the soil has no large air
pockets<00:04:46.340> now<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:47.510> also<00:04:48.190> slightly<00:04:49.190> pressed<00:04:49.820> as<00:04:50.000> I

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
pockets now I also slightly pressed as I

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.080 
pockets now I also slightly pressed as I
was<00:04:50.420> filling<00:04:50.690> soil<00:04:51.080> in<00:04:51.440> because<00:04:52.310> you<00:04:52.790> don't

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
was filling soil in because you don't

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.640 
was filling soil in because you don't
want<00:04:53.150> large<00:04:53.480> air<00:04:53.690> pockets<00:04:54.110> because<00:04:54.260> I<00:04:54.500> like

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
want large air pockets because I like

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.860 
want large air pockets because I like
that<00:04:54.890> will<00:04:55.130> actually<00:04:55.280> air<00:04:55.670> prune<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.660> roots

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
that will actually air prune the roots

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.560 
that will actually air prune the roots
they'll<00:04:57.230> actually<00:04:57.440> not<00:04:58.340> grow<00:04:58.850> where<00:04:59.270> that<00:04:59.420> air

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
they'll actually not grow where that air

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.660 
they'll actually not grow where that air
pocket<00:04:59.990> is<00:05:00.080> you<00:05:00.260> want<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.470> make<00:05:00.560> sure<00:05:00.670> that

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
pocket is you want to make sure that

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.570 
pocket is you want to make sure that
there's<00:05:02.180> no<00:05:02.420> air<00:05:02.600> pockets<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:04.280> you<00:05:04.370> kind<00:05:04.550> of

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
there's no air pockets and you kind of

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.150 
there's no air pockets and you kind of
just<00:05:04.760> press<00:05:05.090> down<00:05:05.410> and<00:05:06.410> make<00:05:06.560> a<00:05:06.590> mound<00:05:06.890> here

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
just press down and make a mound here

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.080 
just press down and make a mound here
and<00:05:07.310> then<00:05:07.880> just<00:05:08.150> ever<00:05:08.600> so<00:05:08.900> slightly<00:05:09.730> make<00:05:10.730> a

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
and then just ever so slightly make a

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.110 
and then just ever so slightly make a
small<00:05:11.660> indentation<00:05:13.000> because<00:05:14.000> that

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
small indentation because that

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.640 
small indentation because that
indentation<00:05:14.450> is<00:05:14.870> going<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.080> allow<00:05:15.200> water<00:05:15.500> to

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
indentation is going to allow water to

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.440 
indentation is going to allow water to
settle<00:05:16.040> there<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.820> it's<00:05:17.030> going<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:17.240> lot<00:05:17.360> of

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
settle there and it's going a lot of

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.000 
settle there and it's going a lot of
water<00:05:17.570> go<00:05:17.870> right<00:05:18.110> down<00:05:18.290> to<00:05:18.590> where<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.830> roots

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
water go right down to where the roots

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.600 
water go right down to where the roots
are<00:05:19.220> and<00:05:19.520> not<00:05:20.360> a<00:05:20.420> big<00:05:20.630> indentation<00:05:20.840> but<00:05:21.610> you

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
are and not a big indentation but you

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.890 
are and not a big indentation but you
know<00:05:22.700> about<00:05:24.910> but<00:05:25.910> a<00:05:25.940> couple<00:05:26.270> inches<00:05:26.420> around

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
know about but a couple inches around

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.400 
know about but a couple inches around
around<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:27.950> base<00:05:28.670> of<00:05:28.700> the<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.750> root<00:05:29.960> there

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
around the base of the the root there

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.820 
around the base of the the root there
the<00:05:30.590> base<00:05:30.740> of<00:05:30.950> the<00:05:31.090> trunk<00:05:32.090> there<00:05:32.390> and<00:05:32.830> also

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
the base of the trunk there and also

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.810 
the base of the trunk there and also
another<00:05:34.010> thing<00:05:34.130> is<00:05:34.400> when<00:05:34.520> you're<00:05:34.610> back

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
another thing is when you're back

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.030 
another thing is when you're back
filling<00:05:35.330> there's<00:05:35.900> going<00:05:36.200> to<00:05:36.260> be<00:05:36.320> a<00:05:36.380> mud<00:05:36.740> line

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
filling there's going to be a mud line

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.850 
filling there's going to be a mud line
on<00:05:37.340> the<00:05:37.910> tree<00:05:38.180> you<00:05:38.720> never<00:05:39.050> want<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.290> fill<00:05:39.590> dirt

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
on the tree you never want to fill dirt

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.950 
on the tree you never want to fill dirt
past<00:05:40.370> that<00:05:40.670> mud<00:05:40.940> line<00:05:41.210> because<00:05:41.720> it<00:05:41.870> will

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
past that mud line because it will

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.770 
past that mud line because it will
actually<00:05:42.170> choke<00:05:42.860> off<00:05:43.070> the<00:05:43.100> tree<00:05:43.700> it's<00:05:44.480> called

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
actually choke off the tree it's called
