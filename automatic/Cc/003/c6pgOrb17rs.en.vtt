00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280
 every time 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.740
 it 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.980
 at the same time alert really looks 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.300
 impressed and politicized or 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.300

 report to tell him 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.120
 the sound is very very short on this 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:46.840
 adventure since the distance to travel 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.840
 small 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.130

 as I hear you not encourage him 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.600
 maybe you could do a 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.050
 criterion is not in addition it's just 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.050

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.380
 scared and I still have this revolt 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.070
 army canton 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.070

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.220
 wives and the order box have 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.220
 dropped but the fact 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.690
 no 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.690

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.159

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.939
 to my taste 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.989
 accelerates you won for five weeks 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.989

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.340
 self-destructing message 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.560
 to arrive there the attempt 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.350
 I test myself 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.450
 here 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.750

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:35.540
 the story and if the cops and then when 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.640

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.230

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.200
 the audience really obliged and you me 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.940
