shortcrust pastry which uses half
buckets<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.810> flour<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.380> if<00:00:25.500> you've<00:00:25.650> got<00:00:25.830> 250

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
buckets of flour so if you've got 250

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.120

have 3/4 butter to flour so that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.920

translates has been 2 cups of flour
which<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.500> just<00:00:40.649> help<00:00:41.190> straighten<00:00:43.850> 150<00:00:44.850> grams

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
which we just help straighten 150 grams

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
of butter and with butter usually you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.950 
of butter and with butter usually you
want<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.850> softened<00:00:48.390> when<00:00:48.600> you're<00:00:48.780> baking

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
want it softened when you're baking

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080 
want it softened when you're baking
because<00:00:49.350> makes<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.800> easier<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> work<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.430> but

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
because makes it easier to work with but

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.880 
because makes it easier to work with but
pastry<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.719> definitely<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> exception<00:00:52.559> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
pastry is definitely the exception to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.410 
pastry is definitely the exception to
that<00:00:52.920> rule<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.940> better<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> work<00:00:54.390> with

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
that rule and it's better to work with

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.680 
that rule and it's better to work with
chilled<00:00:55.079> butter<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:56.100> making<00:00:56.520> pastry<00:00:57.030> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
chilled butter when making pastry so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.119 
chilled butter when making pastry so
we're<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.109> just<00:00:58.410> roll<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.340> pulse<00:00:59.850> it

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
we're going to just roll that pulse it

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.620 
we're going to just roll that pulse it
to<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.370> sort<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.930> coarse<00:01:03.930> spray

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
to like sort of coarse spray

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.390 
to like sort of coarse spray
let's<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.870> look<00:01:07.110> yes<00:01:07.350> that's<00:01:07.770> false

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
let's have a look yes that's false

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.500 
let's have a look yes that's false
breadcrumbs<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.390> add<00:01:09.930> some<00:01:10.890> sugar<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.030> cure

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
breadcrumbs I add some sugar and a cure

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.560 
breadcrumbs I add some sugar and a cure
and<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:14.260> water<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:15.010> almost<00:01:15.490> icy<00:01:16.060> water<00:01:16.270> it's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
and this water is almost icy water it's

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.480 
and this water is almost icy water it's
nice<00:01:16.870> and<00:01:17.200> cold<00:01:17.410> again<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.040> same<00:01:18.280> principle

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
nice and cold again the same principle

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.430 
nice and cold again the same principle
when<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.120> work<00:01:19.300> with<00:01:19.330> pastry<00:01:19.990> blocking<00:01:20.770> coal

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
when you work with pastry blocking coal

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.080 
when you work with pastry blocking coal
now<00:01:23.440> it's<00:01:23.710> important<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.400> look<00:01:24.580> at<00:01:24.730> it<00:01:24.850> at<00:01:24.940> this

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
now it's important to look at it at this

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.500 
now it's important to look at it at this
stage<00:01:25.300> as<00:01:26.020> you'll<00:01:26.350> see<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:27.520> hasn't<00:01:27.820> come

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
stage as you'll see it hasn't come

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.930 
stage as you'll see it hasn't come
together<00:01:28.780> into<00:01:29.380> one<00:01:29.590> ball<00:01:29.890> of<00:01:30.100> dough<00:01:30.310> but<00:01:30.700> when

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
together into one ball of dough but when

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.860 
together into one ball of dough but when
I<00:01:31.090> feel<00:01:31.510> it<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:32.170> pulls<00:01:32.740> into<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.370> don't<00:01:33.870> so

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
I feel it it pulls into it don't so

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.330 
I feel it it pulls into it don't so
we've<00:01:34.990> just<00:01:35.020> cleared<00:01:35.500> ourselves<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.100> little

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
we've just cleared ourselves a little

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.100 
we've just cleared ourselves a little
space<00:01:36.610> on<00:01:36.790> our<00:01:36.940> work<00:01:37.120> bench<00:01:37.420> here<00:01:37.690> so<00:01:37.870> that<00:01:38.020> we

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
space on our work bench here so that we

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.390 
space on our work bench here so that we
can<00:01:38.290> get<00:01:38.980> the<00:01:39.220> pastry<00:01:40.180> needed<00:01:40.660> now<00:01:40.870> I<00:01:41.400> don't

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
actually add much flour to the work

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.580 
actually add much flour to the work
bench<00:01:45.340> at<00:01:45.670> this<00:01:45.820> stage<00:01:46.510> I<00:01:46.720> just<00:01:46.750> wait<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:47.380> see

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
bench at this stage I just wait and see

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.180 
bench at this stage I just wait and see
how<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:47.860> is<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.580> gather<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:49.480> together<00:01:49.980> you<00:01:50.980> see

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
how it is I gather it together you see

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.330 
how it is I gather it together you see
them<00:01:51.280> just<00:01:51.460> pull<00:01:51.940> it<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:53.140> what<00:01:53.710> is<00:01:53.980> going<00:01:54.280> to

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
them just pull it now what is going to

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.010 
them just pull it now what is going to
make<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.610> look<00:01:54.820> good<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.270> turn<00:01:55.510> it<00:01:55.660> upside

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
make this look good you turn it upside

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.620 
make this look good you turn it upside
down<00:01:56.050> you<00:01:56.770> always<00:01:57.100> keep<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:57.880> sign<00:01:58.210> up<00:01:58.240> from

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
down you always keep that sign up from

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.410 
down you always keep that sign up from
now<00:01:58.810> on<00:01:59.050> when<00:01:59.230> you<00:01:59.320> go<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.530> Roland<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.940> roll<00:02:01.240> it

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
now on when you go to Roland you roll it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.750 
now on when you go to Roland you roll it
up<00:02:01.570> with<00:02:01.750> that<00:02:01.930> side<00:02:02.230> up<00:02:02.440> so<00:02:02.710> I<00:02:03.250> pack<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.700> up

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
up with that side up so I pack that up

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.080 
up with that side up so I pack that up
to<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.180> fit<00:02:04.480> cake<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:05.110> then<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.040> children<00:02:06.670> for<00:02:06.910> 30

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090

filling that didn't require further

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.040 
filling that didn't require further
baking<00:05:29.640> then<00:05:30.120> you'd<00:05:30.270> want<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:30.630> in<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.810> little
