00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.790
 well found boys then the tutorial 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.920
 of the cloth mouse first of all it is necessary 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.900
 find the right fabric to make 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.619
 this artifact that is indicatively 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.509
 a handkerchief 40 x 40 cm the classic ones 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.930
 as a man and with is that there is to go crazy for 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.640
 find it and or even better are the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.170
 bandanas because bandanas result 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.530
 even more decorated are a little bit more 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.239
 large the cotton fabric is excellent not 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.489
 those napkins are fine instead 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.620
 thick ones fine yes as well as not 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.079
 silk handkerchiefs are fine because 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.809
 the mouse would be too light 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.809
 and the movements would not be credible 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.710
 see this is like a handkerchief 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.839
 the one for men and this is with the bandana 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.159
 apart from the size that this one in 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.519
 black to the largest but then also 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:06.850
 clearly much much nicer 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:10.030
 let's see how this is done 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.750
 artifact here I dissolve the mouse that I have 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.750
 done previously 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.670
 here is my bandana but but 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:26.040
 certainly this is minimum 50 x 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:30.790
 50 overlap the two ends like this 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:34.360
 this type the name of the bandage 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:40.299
 that puts the bandit on the mouth the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:43.840
 gag here is superimposed on this 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:46.990
 point I take the two corners so and of 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.420
 overlap them overlap enough 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.609
 because these two sails here will go to 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.820
 respectively form the tail is the 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:59.079
 head of the mouse then fold here and there 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:03.159
 bend here if you overlap them slightly 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.140
 own difficulty in building the head 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.539
 of the little mouse so I recommend you 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.880
 overlap them enough to give you an idea 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.790
 kg overlapped more than the length of the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.780
 my hand the first napkin underneath 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.860
 start don't do a little less 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.230
 if it is born this is the first napkin 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.040
 below starts here and ends here is 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.980
 roughly so much so that cooked will be 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.860
 I think it will be 15 centimeters 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.860
 I say super g 15 centimeters from e 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.530
 they overlap approximately 15 centimeters 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.739
 then it starts to turn from above everything 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.840
 how decidedly enough 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.000
 that is, it is not that it must become a stick 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.130
 but make sure it doesn't stay too much 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.970
 air between the landslide at the other 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:57.010
 arrived at this point here turn the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:59.840
 all 180 degrees and overlap this one 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.930
 end here with the second end 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:08.269
 not so you don't match them but 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:11.000
 overlap the now take these 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:17.630
 two sails here that were the initial ones e 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.730
 the passes and passes under here you have to 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.250
 first excuse yourself over and then the 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.370
 wedged under the two ends it has 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.440
 I then superimposed these two real ones 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.370
 pass over lists straw below 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.370
 in this way 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.130
 now the only step I have to do is 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.030
 here I do this movement ie I do 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.200
 folds inside and here instead 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.500
 I loosen that is I make folds 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.150
 outwards and these operations 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.150
 must be performed simultaneously 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.550
 have faith and have a little bit of 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.129
 patience if this is this 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.720
 passage that is a bit difficult 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.769
 probably because he was using 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.709
 the fabric that is not suitable because maybe 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.360
 does a little friction is a bit rough or is it 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.760
 too short 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.230
 that's when you get to this point that 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.670
 there is this handbag is a great sign 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.000
 it means that you have arrived 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:23.620
 practically at the bottom now you 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.760
 just figure out where it is if you choose a little 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:32.070
 this skein you will find two 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:36.790
 end of the bandana we look at if 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:39.910
 the affair liam 1 have caught here is the 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.400
 you see that there are ends one ends 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.520
 here then I pull and the other 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.120
 surely it will end here and Latin 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.520
 so we here the tail continues 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.190
 the head or vice versa is completely 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.690
 indifferent according to your tastes 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.600
 if you like to have a little bit longer 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.830
 the head to the tail 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.550
 let's make the head here 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:12.700
 overlap this one in half 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:15.400
 this piece of handkerchief so e 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.900
 let's do a simple way with these two 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:23.349
 end I attach here with here I do 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.260
 I am overlapping at this point 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:31.539
 these two ends I read them between 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:36.660
 them that will go to form the nose and 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.660
 the ears of our meal 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.570
 here you make a nice tight knot and 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:50.810
 form the head of the mouse that a 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:54.630
 looking at it well it seems like goldrake a little 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.730
 but the body seems to enjoy and is 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.660
 done and the tail is left as it is 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.920
 this is your lovely little mouse 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.730
 cloth 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:12.060
 enjoy yourself more than you can always do that 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:15.770
 always always and always needed support
