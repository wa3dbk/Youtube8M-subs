00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
I think about four to six foot long so

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.850 
I think about four to six foot long so
not<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.020> real<00:04:41.229> big<00:04:41.440> Cobra<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:44.650> guess

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
not a real big Cobra and I guess

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.090
