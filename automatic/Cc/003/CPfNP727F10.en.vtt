reason<00:00:35.140> what<00:00:35.680> I<00:00:35.710> actually<00:00:36.100> got<00:00:36.430> is<00:00:36.910> not<00:00:37.270> really

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
reason what I actually got is not really

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.990 
reason what I actually got is not really
quite<00:00:38.020> field<00:00:38.380> experience<00:00:38.980> because<00:00:39.790> I

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
quite field experience because I

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.750 
quite field experience because I
recently<00:00:40.420> dropped<00:00:40.840> my<00:00:41.350> in<00:00:41.770> a<00:00:41.950> Motorola<00:00:42.370> MOTO<00:00:42.520> G

recently dropped my in a Motorola MOTO G

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.630 
recently dropped my in a Motorola MOTO G
and<00:00:42.970> I<00:00:43.180> got<00:00:43.480> it<00:00:43.630> then<00:00:43.900> on<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.950> above<00:00:45.250> side<00:00:45.520> of

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
and I got it then on the above side of

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.420 
and I got it then on the above side of
the<00:00:45.730> phone<00:00:45.940> so<00:00:46.270> you<00:00:46.300> just<00:00:47.200> take<00:00:47.590> closer<00:00:48.070> look

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
the phone so you just take closer look

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.900 
the phone so you just take closer look
here<00:00:48.820> you<00:00:49.660> might<00:00:49.960> see<00:00:50.350> that<00:00:50.620> then<00:00:50.890> right<00:00:51.520> there

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
here you might see that then right there

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.030 
here you might see that then right there
just<00:00:52.150> right<00:00:52.390> on<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.720> above<00:00:53.020> side<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.620> the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
just right on the above side of the

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.580 
just right on the above side of the
secondary<00:00:54.550> camera<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.660> you<00:00:55.990> know<00:00:56.230> one<00:00:56.440> of<00:00:56.470> the

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
secondary camera so you know one of the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.230 
secondary camera so you know one of the
reason<00:00:56.860> at<00:00:56.950> that<00:00:56.980> I'm<00:00:57.280> not<00:00:57.550> really<00:00:57.790> you<00:00:58.180> know

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
reason at that I'm not really you know

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.420 
reason at that I'm not really you know
for<00:00:58.810> the<00:00:58.960> longest<00:00:59.080> part<00:00:59.500> I'm<00:01:00.010> not<00:01:00.250> really

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
for the longest part I'm not really

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.940

silicone whatever you call it but for

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.389 
silicone whatever you call it but for
this<00:01:07.810> kind<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.049> particle<00:01:08.439> time<00:01:08.649> I<00:01:08.890> just

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
this kind of particle time I just

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.730 
this kind of particle time I just
decided<00:01:09.729> myself<00:01:09.969> whenever<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.840> got<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.200> 10<00:01:11.469> on<00:01:11.499> my

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
decided myself whenever I got a 10 on my

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.980 
decided myself whenever I got a 10 on my
Motorola<00:01:12.039> MOTO<00:01:12.280> G<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.729> then<00:01:13.299> I<00:01:13.390> think<00:01:13.659> that<00:01:13.749> I

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
Motorola MOTO G and then I think that I

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.690 
Motorola MOTO G and then I think that I
might<00:01:14.289> needs<00:01:14.590> one<00:01:14.890> then<00:01:15.189> and<00:01:15.369> actually

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
might needs one then and actually

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.399 
might needs one then and actually
purchase<00:01:16.210> this<00:01:16.740> speaking<00:01:17.740> slim<00:01:18.490> armor<00:01:18.939> series

so<00:01:20.409> you<00:01:20.740> know<00:01:20.829> take<00:01:21.039> a<00:01:21.069> closer<00:01:21.520> look<00:01:21.640> here's<00:01:22.060> on

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
so you know take a closer look here's on

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.989 
so you know take a closer look here's on
the<00:01:22.600> case<00:01:23.229> cell<00:01:23.530> one<00:01:24.249> of<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.429> reasons<00:01:24.789> why<00:01:24.969> I

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:24.999 
the case cell one of the reasons why I

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:27.209 
the case cell one of the reasons why I
actually<00:01:25.210> choose<00:01:25.810> speaking<00:01:26.289> is<00:01:26.469> because<00:01:26.920> that

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
actually choose speaking is because that

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.039 
actually choose speaking is because that
the<00:01:27.369> speaking<00:01:27.759> brain<00:01:28.030> itself<00:01:28.359> is<00:01:28.600> attached

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
the speaking brain itself is attached

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.770 
the speaking brain itself is attached
towards<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.159> image<00:01:30.579> of<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:30.880> gravity<00:01:31.539> and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
towards the image of the gravity and

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.989 
towards the image of the gravity and
also<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.200> safety<00:01:32.439> space<00:01:32.829> of<00:01:33.039> your<00:01:33.429> smartphone

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
also the safety space of your smartphone

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.139 
also the safety space of your smartphone
and<00:01:34.210> then<00:01:34.869> it's<00:01:35.139> really<00:01:35.530> true<00:01:35.770> because<00:01:36.310> these

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
and then it's really true because these

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.169 
and then it's really true because these
sides<00:01:37.509> and<00:01:37.810> also<00:01:37.929> T<00:01:38.289> the<00:01:38.740> silently<00:01:39.249> case<00:01:39.639> L<00:01:39.939> it

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
sides and also T the silently case L it

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.230 
sides and also T the silently case L it
actually<00:01:40.749> shows<00:01:41.469> that<00:01:41.889> the<00:01:42.520> rapidly<00:01:42.999> T

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
actually shows that the rapidly T

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.059 
actually shows that the rapidly T
guarantee<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.229> your<00:01:44.380> smart<00:01:44.619> phone<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:44.799> for

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
you use this kind of particle case on

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:47.190 
you use this kind of particle case on
your<00:01:46.749> smart<00:01:46.990> phone

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200

so<00:01:47.920> here's<00:01:48.219> let's<00:01:48.490> just<00:01:48.729> take<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:48.909> closer<00:01:49.329> look

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
so here's let's just take a closer look

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.929 
so here's let's just take a closer look
to<00:01:49.749> the<00:01:49.840> case<00:01:50.049> L<00:01:50.259> so<00:01:50.920> it's<00:01:51.069> actually<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.459> slim

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
to the case L so it's actually a slim

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.609 
to the case L so it's actually a slim
armor<00:01:52.450> series<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.929> actually<00:01:53.229> come<00:01:53.409> from

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
armor series that actually come from

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.739 
armor series that actually come from
speaking<00:01:53.889> and<00:01:54.189> I<00:01:54.700> recently<00:01:54.969> bought<00:01:55.420> this<00:01:55.600> kind

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
speaking and I recently bought this kind
