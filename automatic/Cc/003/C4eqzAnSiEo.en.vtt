00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.340
 aol 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.799
 Speak people, I'm Maria. 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.360
 starting one more round for you guys 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.009
 program we had there in the 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.900
 santafigÃªnia giving the launch 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.450
 of fiori memories and today I'm here 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.009
 invade the house of the guys from icnb and I go 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.720
 talk to lox that will set up a 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.939
 how do you install the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.680
 memories movies on the computer and of course 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.390
 You will learn with me. 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.860
 Let's check a good alarm with a 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.000
 bit of what movie memories have 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.770
 so special 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.360
 these memories they are from the top line 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.550
 hyper apps performance they are 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.550
 found in four different colors 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.679
 white to black 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.019
 the red and blue any difference of 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.579
 ability to manage the other they are 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:57.739
 found in three different 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.390
 4gb and 8gb capacities of 16 gigs to them 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.239
 are also found in three 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.120
 different mega frequencies 1,303 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.600
 hertz 1,600 maria rech and for the people 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.890
 more records 1866mhz or so I guess 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.610
 that we can already start the installation 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.610
 huh 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.130
 that's where I brought my kit of 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.649
 memory card and that it could help me 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.390
 This packaging here is well, right? 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.869
 so it's not one that needs 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.939
 scissors it already opens easy as it is 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.259
 it was not very simple as you can see 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.899
 just the crisis 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.289
 then the simple to open up to those who do not 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.719
 know this is the firm memory she comes 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.340
 double kit like this one from the sea and another 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.770
 it comes from the isolated ones for those who want 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.990
 buy only a memory is very simple 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.020
 so she is cute she has a 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.020
 Asymmetrical sink here it comes a 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.140
 aggressive design is different from that of 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.659
 It is common to realize from her that this 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.979
 she is black where usually the wine 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.289
 green 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.390
 so come on you are breast feeding 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.480
 first part of the procedure you have 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.160
 to connect the computer to the power 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.640
 you can simply turn off the key 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.520
 from the source to later you will be using 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.810
 an electrostatic bracelet 10 she likes 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.810
 head 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.629
 there are later then it is very simple people 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:32.689
 will remove the old memory card 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:36.349
 It's very simple, I'll draw it here by pulling 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:39.650
 the latches and lift old memory 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:43.129
 now I'll get the movie memories 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.099
 the interep fair to be able to install there 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:49.069
 so I see a side and I just 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.040
 I fit it into the right bus in place 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.620
 of a software and presses it closed 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.439
 to automatic prisons and is very simple 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.299
 I'm going to install another one the same way it's 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.579
 same procedure just tighten one 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:06.169
 Little is already installed so it's okay. 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:08.239
 ready to use we can already see 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.730
 how it works in the configuration of the 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.650
 same computer really is very easy 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.359
 I'm super excited to see if you can 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.280
 show now with the memories already 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.950
 installed and shows what has changed in 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.900
 computer she looks at let's just see the 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.709
 installed two modules of four 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.650
 gigas 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.449
 so we should have 8 gb of RAM there 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.479
 How can you see it here in the panel 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.479
 control 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.680
 what changes to the public gamer so 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.170
 with the difference that these memories 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.090
 They bring not know if you know but 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.379
 memory that it manages the flow of 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.680
 information on your computer 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.470
 so basically you a player will 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.150
 have less leg it will be able to use more 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.250
 the computer playing games much more 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.500
 he goes on 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.860
 take advantage of the capacity of your 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.860
 own computer 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.150
 This is very good on you could. 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.400
 Uninstall to take home to 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.010
 start playing you think not you 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.640
 must install you learned how does 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.980
 that 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.989
 good luck so I 'll say install 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.760
 because now I already know and in the next 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.099
 program I tell you how you do 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.350
