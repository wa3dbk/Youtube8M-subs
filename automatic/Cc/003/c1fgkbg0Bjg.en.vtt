00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.430
 I am too 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.860
 November 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.220
 because more and more detectable for everything I do 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.319
 Hello 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.229
 more 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.229
 either Barak 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.040
 I want to do it myself, we also give it a workout 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.940
 many investors so everything remains unclear 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.270
 verplant 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.860
 or soon follow forest areas 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.309
 the Reference work 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.760
 more than a dozen times even 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.760
 mercury 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
 Peter Mansfield on Moritz 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.650
 Hey you only hit once and then he has an ironic chance 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
 was 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.540
 not coincidentally 1 many stand 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.329
 I 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.329
 more than 40 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.480
 Nothing 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.360
 Munich until 30 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.209
 s is 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.209
 I knew that what he has on us 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.299
 MÃ¶rfelden so supported 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.299
 so will where it's off 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.419
 because they had their intention 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.419
 26 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.879
 it's very easy 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.359
 normal 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.129
 important is more important than ever 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.079
 should someone finish one 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.079
 his choice of words, however, would need every game 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.749
 Iris Capital is 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:44.749
 the referees have them for themselves 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.929
 have their star status 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:55.759
 necessary 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:58.759
 also Marein 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:00.230
 January 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.230
 Justin save a little less though 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.129
 we wonder 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.639
 are you ready to go what would be then 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.259
 because to do this 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.779
 first 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.059
 we do not need any reason for us 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:01.550
 only when she felt like it 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.960
 now he is as he says 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.759
 I'm afraid 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.250
 why do you have us 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.809
 looks different 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:14.469
 what he is doing 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.469
 "Such low instincts 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.509
 nice result 1 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.800
 Seoul to Moscow but again 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.010
 Unfortunately I did not have time for the alternatives cup 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.360
 Play and I succeeded in the students first take a long time 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.229
 so stay tuned then in a few days the alternative end wants that 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.169
 Terrain plus additional functions 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.889
 and unfortunately not again run for all viewers rooms 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:12.639
 to solve 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.410
 however, more than at school are still solved with 4 6 7 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.290
 and who I am confident that next year in the Soderbergh 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.289
 to arrive in July 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.509
 how do we all enjoy it? 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:29.509
 because the app music here and stoked the loot 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:32.409
 or not 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:34.340
 Schweisgut mirrored 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.249
 have played across the ages Alternative Indie 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:39.189
 higher in percentage terms
