00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.599
 jerusalem what a beautiful ere golden streets 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:16.040
 a sea ​​of ​​glass in those streets I go 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.040
 to walk gold streets crystal sea 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.590
 this time I'm going to teach you how to 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.070
 know if something really has gold and 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.990
 silver or do not have anything good here 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.950
 we have some earth with gold 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.860
 here we have a piece of gold and here 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.190
 we have a piece of a sandpaper 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.150
 that was used to move parts with 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.480
 gold 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.440
 well now let's see how we are going to 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:54.990
 know if you really have gold or you do not have 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:58.530
 well, we're going to need nitric acid 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.530
 muriatic acid 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.089
 and ferrous sulfate or pink coating as 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.690
 He also knows in many places 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:12.470
 well here we have a bit of land with 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.120
 water that has gold 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.190
 and first of all 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:23.080
 the gold in a land rushes up 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.020
 the bottom 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.660
 we shake it a little so he leaves 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.950
 to the bottom it is obviously a metal and 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.730
 it's heavier than any land like that 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.730
 we are going to shake it 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.880
 perfectly 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.880
 and in this way 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.300
 let's discover 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.190
 gold 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.240
 I do not know if you could see it 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.030
 gold 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.750
 there is 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:08.110
 that is a proof that there is metal 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.090
 on this earth 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.930
 let's see a little more 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.680
 there you can clearly see that there 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.680
 is the metal 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.440
 right now let's check that 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.150
 really contain gold or silver what 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.590
 first let's do let's place 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.970
 a few drops first of nitric acid and 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.750
 let's see the reaction 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.750
 from the earth 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.040
 the piece 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.040
 of gold 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.920
 and one 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.780
 now let's put 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.780
 muriatic acid 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.870
 a drop 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.870
 here 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.870
 at the time of putting the drop 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:20.670
 if we see that a similar cream is formed 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.260
 to milk or cream that means 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.260
 that there is money 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.810
 now let's put it 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.810
 on the piece of gold 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:41.020
 Muriatic acid does not formulate anything 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:45.300
 it means that there is no money now in 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.300
 the piece of sandpaper 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.070
 muriatic acid 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.830
 well now let's see if he has gold 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.810
 well we saw what 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:08.250
 if they have silver this piece the liquid 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.950
 has been watered on a plastic so that 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.950
 can be better appreciated now let's 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.280
 see if there is gold we are going to need the 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.940
 ferrous sulfate or pink coat as you 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.490
 you know it is also a green colored salt 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.490
 we are going to dilute it in water 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.180
 truth let's start with the first one if 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.979
 this changes color 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.280
 and it turns black it means that if there 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:40.570
 gold let's see 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.570
 how it changes color 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.449
 good as you can see it looks clearly 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.370
 what a change of color black 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:58.360
 and you can also notice 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.520
 the white part that was formed which is 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.600
 like milk or cream that means that 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.000
 there is silver and gold now let's see the 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.529
 piece of gold we will confirm that 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.110
 really if it marks the gold 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:17.470
 and we put a drop 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:23.490
 of ferrous sulfate diluted in water 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.490
 and we see how it changes color 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.580
 black 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.729
 when it turns black it means that 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.729
 there is 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:41.230
 you can see 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.230
 how it got totally black 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:51.150
 there is the now 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.150
 now let's see the sandpaper 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:11.000
 can see how it changes color 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.180
 and it turns black 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.600
 means 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.600
 waths up 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:30.510
 well that would be all this is how 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:32.400
 we check if something really has 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.490
 well I hope this video has you 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.900
 liked that I can make your comments 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.849
 subscribe and any questions you have 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.509
 write it 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.509
 goodbye
