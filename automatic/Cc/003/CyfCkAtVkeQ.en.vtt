00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
easily persuaded by that orbital night

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.510 
easily persuaded by that orbital night
uh<00:01:14.540> even<00:01:15.540> after<00:01:15.810> slain<00:01:16.350> tells<00:01:16.740> him<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.430> know

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
was already investigating the sea who

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.010 
was already investigating the sea who
attacked<00:01:22.920> his<00:01:23.159> granddaughter<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.020> he

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
attacked his granddaughter and he

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.770 
attacked his granddaughter and he
already<00:01:25.229> had<00:01:25.530> his<00:01:25.560> doubts<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:27.150> when

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
already had his doubts on it so when

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.640 
already had his doubts on it so when
slain<00:01:28.110> tells<00:01:28.439> him<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.860> why<00:01:29.340> would<00:01:29.729> he<00:01:30.650> not

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
slain tells him this why would he not

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.800 
slain tells him this why would he not
listen<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.070> him<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:33.060> easily<00:01:33.509> just

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
listen to him and just easily just

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.980 
listen to him and just easily just
forego<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.619> information<00:01:35.189> he<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.549> received

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
forego the information he just received

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.690 
forego the information he just received
maybe<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.259> flames<00:01:37.680> are<00:01:37.890> Tehran<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.250> you

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
maybe because flames are Tehran and you

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.370 
maybe because flames are Tehran and you
know<00:01:38.820> how<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.000> may<00:01:39.299> feel<00:01:39.600> about<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.229> know

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
know how we may feel about you know

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.350 
know how we may feel about you know
Tehran's<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:41.040> don't<00:01:41.220> trust<00:01:41.460> them<00:01:41.759> they

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
Tehran's they don't trust them they

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.609 
Tehran's they don't trust them they
think<00:01:42.630> they're<00:01:42.780> beneath<00:01:43.049> them<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.439> that's

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
think they're beneath them so that's

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.999 
think they're beneath them so that's
probably<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.189> main<00:01:44.990> focal<00:01:45.990> point<00:01:46.229> as<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.500> why

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
probably the main focal point as to why

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.460 
probably the main focal point as to why
he<00:01:47.040> isn't<00:01:47.670> believing<00:01:48.270> slain<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.290> what<00:01:49.439> I

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
he isn't believing slain but what I

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.830 
he isn't believing slain but what I
