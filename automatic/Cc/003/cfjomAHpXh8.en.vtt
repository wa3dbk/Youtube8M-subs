playing an E chord but with the G sharp

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.559 
playing an E chord but with the G sharp
in<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.560> base<00:01:51.590> here<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:52.940> it's<00:01:53.030> giving<00:01:53.270> me<00:01:53.300> that

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
in the base here so it's giving me that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.969 
in the base here so it's giving me that
nice<00:01:55.179> first<00:01:56.179> inversion<00:01:56.600> sound<00:01:57.289> but<00:01:57.530> also<00:01:57.560> I've

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
nice first inversion sound but also I've

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.149 
nice first inversion sound but also I've
got<00:01:58.159> this<00:01:58.280> low<00:01:58.580> E<00:01:58.909> so<00:01:59.750> you<00:01:59.840> could<00:02:00.020> stay<00:02:00.259> still

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
got this low E so you could stay still

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.190 
got this low E so you could stay still
say<00:02:01.369> it's<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.759> root<00:02:01.970> position<00:02:02.149> chord<00:02:02.780> although

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
say it's a root position chord although

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.029 
say it's a root position chord although
we've<00:02:03.470> got<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:03.890> G<00:02:04.340> sharp<00:02:04.580> here<00:02:04.909> low<00:02:06.039> because

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
we've got this G sharp here low because

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.440 
we've got this G sharp here low because
you're<00:02:07.310> really<00:02:07.610> nice<00:02:07.789> you<00:02:08.360> know<00:02:08.830> full<00:02:09.830> chord

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
it's really cool and I think it's a

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.050 
it's really cool and I think it's a
great<00:05:35.380> complementary<00:05:36.070> part<00:05:36.340> to<00:05:36.550> the<00:05:36.670> busier

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060
