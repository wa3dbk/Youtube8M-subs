00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.980
 now our studios very interesting subject you know what you want 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.240
 permaculture, you will know by now 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.350
 We are here then with Claudio Jacinto who has one told the engineer 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.470
 poor American forestry and other forests in our history. 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.230
 say 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.449
 I own jmfc with six defeats 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.500
 He is a forest engineer who owns the White House Farm. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.890
 He lives now. 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.720
 apply school permaculture practices 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.169
 receives visitation 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.610
 and gives courses also in addition it is part of the recall and mother who is the 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:36.440
 permaculture institute 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.620
 organization 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.129
 is with candles and the environment 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.519
 Claudio couto a little to us because that's permaculture 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.900
 extremely broad permaculture 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.990
 there 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.810
 Generally 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.080
 it is the planning of sustainable human environments 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.870
 behind this concept there is a range of doubts that may arise in the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.910
 my planning 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.310
 of the presence the man on the planet put this organized planet 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.390
 What are human settlements? 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.910
 it's cities 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.909
 Samoa 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.230
 bad city conditions in favelas 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.170
 are they 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.240
 neighborhoods farms 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.460
 these are the human settlements 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.200
 permaculture she is part of a class 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.770
 realistic view 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.740
 nanda reality given the gift of the current context 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.870
 a CA 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.690
 environmental 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.340
 everyone where you are aware that people 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.620
 also experienced environmental problems 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.040
 what permaculture seeks to do is to associate 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.050
 these problems to your cause 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.030
 or regional 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.450
 what happens to human activities today and how do people 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.910
 occupy the planet 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.910
 is extremely degrading to nature for the environment 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.660
 then by turel behind a proposal of what 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.610
 this review of ours is a little more sustainable 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.520
 which was the case then be sustained 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.010
 is that you 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.259
 activities for skiing 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.619
 sustain themselves over time 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:13.269
 whatever 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.759
 is the diary in the present and also in the future 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.399
 It is the time of the Lord 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:21.989
 Merkel because it always makes me think what you're talking about and then I do too 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.060
 I am a laywoman who apologizes 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.460
 simple curiosity my seventy copies as it feels saucers that were 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.210
 1 that were inhabited 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.660
 often before outside the 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.450
 of the year henin tallec 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.380
 is drawn by ibama and such if you have for example a community 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.700
 that she puts herself in the place where they are in the mind she should not be and 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.389
 like you through permaculture 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.370
 decreases 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.580
 the impact of this population for example in an area since it is so difficult 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.290
 sometimes 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.340
 remove these populations we know people also do not have with pt 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.970
 I have not been many times, there is this possibility, yes there is 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.949
 possibility 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:05.359
 even beyond that possibility what we need to understand that in the 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.200
 permaculture 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.619
 we are not limited to the localized impact 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:11.299
 many times this time 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.949
 or a settlement is not a city either 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:18.399
 or venture kate without the environmental standards they have a great customer 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:22.219
 environmental pact despite the fact that the standards are 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.809
 from the point of view of regulation and rules of law, it is not 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:27.930
 enough 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.850
 to embrace the intention 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.150
 higher permaculture because of the greater attention of the cousin so that our 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.570
 life as a whole 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.869
 be sustained for 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:40.879
 the whole planet so that we can all live in a way that does not degrade our 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.249
 life I'm going to try dates and some examples to clear opponents 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:48.929
 to ask what the basic needs of any service are 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.929
 mainly in the matter they are finding human being 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.099
 on food theme aware food 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.549
 have energy and use 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:03:59.819
 use of the area 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.729
 These are basic baskets. 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:05.870
 the way of life that we have today the way geni as hegemonic 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.310
 every woman with the hegemonic there are new ways of life these prices are 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.160
 differentiated 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.980
 but the way of life of our globalized society today 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.990
 it by itself to impact from 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.990
 the constructions of ours they use 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.350
 many features that run out 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.460
 many features that is already a recording 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.110
 For example, cement and faith are large ned and mineral 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.240
 people can have masonry on the cement 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.979
 ah 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.159
 ours 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.319
 our food production today 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.929
 responsible for the loss of biodiversity, so they ask for 

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:46.279
 monocultures by contamination of solving them by the use of poison 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.379
 push that 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.610
 instead of deciding can absolve from the land the original animals press 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.490
 the water that we use the gnv
