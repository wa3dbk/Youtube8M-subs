00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 good afternoon dear viewers and guests 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.819
 my channel with you thorium snow and 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.379
 today we will make key chains with 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.790
 letter initials 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.210
 for work we need 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.299
 directly plastic beige 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.130
 brown colors are also other colors 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.490
 polymer clay on my case this 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.090
 a set of tools that are convenient for you 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.230
 work 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.939
 roller or paste machine blade textural 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.550
 leaf form of a tree I will use 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.510
 so this film, and directly by the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.469
 small letters and I have a form from meytens 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:40.850
 first we need to create a tree color 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:44.000
 for this we take beige plastic and 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.789
 directly dark brown 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.120
 try to achieve the line transition 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.610
 some curls between all these 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.739
 the main thing just do not bring up 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.899
 uniform color but otherwise it makes no sense 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.660
 it won't be as you know even how 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.359
 you see basically on my table gave 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.409
 wooden surface on of course yes and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:12.570
 sleep but still it has a different 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.909
 color coloring and so here we are 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.540
 try to do something about 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.100
 such that is, for simplicity, the concept we 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.049
 we can cut 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:30.380
 somehow randomly our pieces blind them 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.380
 just as chaotic and then roll in a long 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.380
 sausage 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.750
 not 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.220
 and 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.750
 Now we roll this thing in the post 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.970
 car on the thickest layer 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.370
 Here is such a wooden thing with us 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.490
 it turned out now we are directly 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:38.700
 take our texture sheet and top 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.010
 We treat it with talcum powder instead of just 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.170
 Can not use there baby 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.840
 powder well here already at your discretion 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.800
 it doesn't matter that we just 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.560
 it was easier 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.560
 tear off our texture sheet from plastic 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.650
 and 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.940
 now let's skip right like this 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.550
 together with a sheet and plastic and all this 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:15.710
 welcome through the pasta car at the very 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.530
 thick layer as you see left here 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.780
 so waved 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.760
 wood texture prints well and a plus 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.580
 there is some straight hair 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.480
 so that it becomes more visible try 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.900
 shade it 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.590
 pastel and see how much the texture 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.590
 will become more clear 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.819
 now take directly our 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.819
 molds and cut out the letters we need 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.269
 and 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.240
 and 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.850
 but 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.510
 but 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:57.430
 to seal our letters i will 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:05:00.949
 use a second layer of a similar color 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.949
 rolled out on the post machine and now Iâ€™m all 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:07.069
 I will take these small letters and I will transfer already on here 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.469
 such things as you can understand 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:11.960
 be already here this two words here 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:15.550
 there will be small letters with each other place 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.550
 these are separate letters 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:42.329
 with letters that we have one 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.649
 everything's just we take the mold again 

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:47.319
 attach and cut directly 

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:49.659
 and the stylbook image of which we decided 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:54.809
 make up the words here will have a couple 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:54.809
 give a special thin knife 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.620
 and 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.139
 not 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.210
 not 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:44.870
 and now we sand the edges of our letters 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.870
 so that they are even 

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:57.079
 and but here's the actual and final 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:07:00.449
 the finished result what the chip is yes 

00:06:57.079 --> 00:07:02.669
 See these two here again this 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.759
 directly complete words 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:08.129
 which can be used somewhere for 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:12.889
 decor for example stick on some 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:16.369
 photo frame or decorate the cover of some 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:20.959
 don't know scrapbooking album 

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:26.189
 these are the key chains 

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:30.839
 it's already directly to mobile 

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:31.729
 phones are still somewhere here as 

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:34.529
 decor 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:37.469
 used a colored polymer k for 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:38.009
 leaflets and for ladybugs painting 

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:40.249
 was 

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:43.439
 glossy acrylic paints and 

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:46.979
 imitation of these droplets here as if 

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:51.539
 from water this fimo gel is just digging it 

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:57.449
 and he gives here such a result from above 

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:59.879
 all transparent gloss varnish thanks 

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:02.759
 Great for viewing I hope this idea 

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:03.959
 it was interesting and useful for you creative 

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:06.329
 creative ideas to you 

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:08.719
 all the best for new meetings 

00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:08.719
 until
