most of the time it probably is a fold
it<00:02:05.310> really<00:02:05.759> all<00:02:05.939> depends<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:07.229> opponent's

the more hands he plays the wider his

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
range in fact if he plays let's say

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.119

then there really is no gap at all with

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.040 
then there really is no gap at all with

your ace Jack offsuit and I would

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.690 
ahead of preflop with a move like this
you<00:02:29.900> can<00:02:30.230> take<00:02:30.620> control<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.280> hand<00:02:31.489> by

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
you can take control of the hand by

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.930 
you can take control of the hand by
eliminating<00:02:32.299> loose<00:02:32.810> competitors<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.940> having

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
he is a tight player and preflop raises
