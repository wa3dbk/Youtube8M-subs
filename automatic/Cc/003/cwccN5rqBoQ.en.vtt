00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
and I really wish they would have put

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.340 
and I really wish they would have put
another<00:02:48.320> color<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.950> I'm<00:02:49.070> doing<00:02:50.000> I've<00:02:50.900> tried

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
another color and I'm doing I've tried

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.800 
another color and I'm doing I've tried
multiple<00:02:51.830> ways<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.400> get<00:02:52.910> these<00:02:53.180> colors<00:02:53.450> to

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
multiple ways to get these colors to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.600 
multiple ways to get these colors to
stop<00:02:54.080> fading<00:02:54.710> to<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.040> point<00:02:55.280> where<00:02:55.460> they

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
stop fading to the point where they

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.540 
stop fading to the point where they
literally<00:02:55.970> disappear<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.710> that<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.250> this

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.240 
only had this on for about maybe 20
minutes<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.870> it's<00:03:11.990> already<00:03:12.500> started<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.010> fade

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
minutes and it's already started to fade

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
under this and this is really fading but

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.450 
under this and this is really fading but
I'm<00:03:20.900> going<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.170> build<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.740> up<00:03:21.830> so<00:03:22.070> you<00:03:22.130> guys<00:03:22.400> can

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.290 
I'm going to build it up so you guys can
see<00:03:23.030> what<00:03:23.270> it<00:03:23.420> looks<00:03:23.660> like<00:03:24.760> when<00:03:25.760> it's<00:03:25.940> built

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300

up

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.160 

so<00:03:34.670> as<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:34.879> can<00:03:35.030> see<00:03:35.090> it's<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.659> very<00:03:35.689> beautiful

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
so as you can see it's a very beautiful

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.270 
so as you can see it's a very beautiful
pink<00:03:37.900> this<00:03:38.900> camera<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.409> definitely<00:03:39.650> not<00:03:39.980> doing

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
pink this camera is definitely not doing

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.929 
pink this camera is definitely not doing
it<00:03:40.370> justice

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:40.939 
it justice

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.690 
it justice

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700
