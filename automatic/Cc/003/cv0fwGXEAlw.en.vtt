00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
and for optimize for I would just leave

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.500 
and for optimize for I would just leave
it<00:03:28.950> on<00:03:29.010> high<00:03:29.220> resolution<00:03:29.400> if<00:03:30.180> you're<00:03:30.360> having

it on high resolution if you're having

it on high resolution if you're having
some<00:03:30.750> issues<00:03:31.080> leave<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.440> on<00:03:31.500> any<00:03:32.070> device<00:03:32.250> but<00:03:32.760> I

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
some issues leave it on any device but I

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.190 
some issues leave it on any device but I
would<00:03:33.120> just<00:03:33.150> suggest<00:03:33.330> to<00:03:33.660> set<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.050> high

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
would just suggest to set it to high

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.320 
would just suggest to set it to high
resolution<00:03:34.770> about<00:03:35.310> box<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.910> don't<00:03:36.060> have<00:03:36.180> to

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
resolution about box you don't have to

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.570 
resolution about box you don't have to
do<00:03:36.420> anything<00:03:36.650> I'm<00:03:37.650> gonna<00:03:37.920> go<00:03:38.160> ahead<00:03:38.280> and

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
do anything I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.580 
do anything I'm gonna go ahead and
actually<00:03:39.210> register<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:39.810> one<00:03:39.960> I<00:03:39.990> start<00:03:40.350> but

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
actually register this one I start but

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.140 
actually register this one I start but
you<00:03:40.650> guys<00:03:41.040> have<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.370> free<00:03:41.640> version<00:03:41.670> that

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
you guys have a free version that

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.300 
you guys have a free version that
records<00:03:42.510> for<00:03:42.720> up<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:43.020> 10<00:03:43.320> minutes<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.890> then

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
records for up to 10 minutes and then

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.670 
records for up to 10 minutes and then
it's<00:03:44.430> plenty<00:03:44.760> of<00:03:44.820> time<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.060> record<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.480> raid

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
it's plenty of time to record a raid

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.900 
it's plenty of time to record a raid
okay<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:46.740> when<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.100> actually<00:03:47.220> start<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.760> up

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
okay so when you actually start it up

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.480 
okay so when you actually start it up
it's<00:03:48.090> going<00:03:48.270> to<00:03:48.360> ask<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:49.710> if<00:03:49.830> you<00:03:49.950> want<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.250> buy

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
it's going to ask you if you want to buy

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.750 
it's going to ask you if you want to buy
a<00:03:50.520> license<00:03:50.940> or<00:03:51.060> anything<00:03:51.240> just<00:03:51.450> click<00:03:51.630> try<00:03:52.260> and

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
a license or anything just click try and

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.370

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
it will give you 10 minutes to record so

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.550 
it will give you 10 minutes to record so
currently<00:03:55.650> I'm<00:03:55.800> err<00:03:55.980> playing<00:03:56.190> my<00:03:57.320> iPad<00:03:58.320> here

currently I'm err playing my iPad here
and<00:03:58.740> it's<00:03:59.160> lagging<00:03:59.370> because<00:03:59.790> I<00:04:00.120> am<00:04:00.270> recording

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
and it's lagging because I am recording

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.960 
and it's lagging because I am recording
many<00:04:01.110> applications<00:04:01.680> at<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:01.920> same<00:04:02.100> time<00:04:02.370> so

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
many applications at the same time so

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.430 
many applications at the same time so
ignore<00:04:03.270> that<00:04:03.330> but<00:04:03.660> it<00:04:03.750> won't<00:04:03.930> lag<00:04:04.110> for<00:04:04.350> you

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
ignore that but it won't lag for you
