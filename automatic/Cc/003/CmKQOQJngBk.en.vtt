know<00:00:38.379> it<00:00:38.650> may<00:00:38.829> not<00:00:38.860> be<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.820> fastest<00:00:40.780> to<00:00:40.809> focus

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
know it may not be the fastest to focus

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.530 
know it may not be the fastest to focus
or<00:00:41.470> with<00:00:41.860> sharpest<00:00:42.370> or<00:00:42.580> the<00:00:42.879> most<00:00:43.090> beautiful

I<00:01:11.140> would<00:01:11.560> love<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:12.280> see<00:01:12.520> is<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.060> 24<00:01:13.869> to<00:01:13.990> 70

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
I would love to see is a 24 to 70

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.359 
I would love to see is a 24 to 70
constant<00:01:15.280> f2<00:01:16.090> now<00:01:16.869> what<00:01:17.770> does<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:17.979> mean

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
constant f2 now what does that mean

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.880 
constant f2 now what does that mean
f-22<00:01:18.970> 2.8<00:01:19.810> doesn't<00:01:20.110> sound<00:01:20.290> like<00:01:20.439> a<00:01:20.470> big<00:01:20.680> change

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
f-22 2.8 doesn't sound like a big change

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.560 
f-22 2.8 doesn't sound like a big change
in<00:01:21.070> numbers<00:01:21.430> but<00:01:21.549> that's<00:01:21.729> actually<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:22.119> full

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
in numbers but that's actually a full

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.050 
in numbers but that's actually a full
stop<00:01:22.900> faster<00:01:23.530> so<00:01:24.159> if<00:01:24.280> you<00:01:24.400> compare<00:01:24.850> you<00:01:25.030> know

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
stop faster so if you compare you know

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.270 
stop faster so if you compare you know

the 70 to 200 F 2.8 to the 200 f2 it's a
huge<00:01:30.729> leap<00:01:31.030> in<00:01:31.270> size<00:01:32.009> however<00:01:33.009> I<00:01:33.549> really

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
huge leap in size however I really

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.609 
huge leap in size however I really
wonder<00:01:34.270> how<00:01:34.299> much<00:01:34.659> bigger<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.200> lens<00:01:35.409> would

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
wonder how much bigger the lens would

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.029 
wonder how much bigger the lens would

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
need to get considering a 270 to 200

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.090 
need to get considering a 270 to 200

needs<00:01:59.259> to<00:01:59.380> be<00:01:59.499> given<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.460> maximum<00:02:00.609> aperture

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
needs to be given the maximum aperture

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:02.760 
needs to be given the maximum aperture
and<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.630> focal<00:02:02.020> length<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.259> we<00:02:02.350> know<00:02:02.590> that

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
and the focal length so we know that

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.379 
and the focal length so we know that
that's<00:02:02.920> possible<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:05.100> mathematically<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.670> 70

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:07.389 
that's possible so mathematically a 70

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:10.200 
that's possible so mathematically a 70
mil<00:02:07.600> f2<00:02:08.080> would<00:02:08.860> fit<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.460> there<00:02:09.819> as<00:02:10.000> well

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
mil f2 would fit in there as well

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.620 
mil f2 would fit in there as well
because<00:02:10.450> 70<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:12.069> stop<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.520> half<00:02:12.700> less<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
because 70 is a stop and a half less the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.710 
because 70 is a stop and a half less the
focal<00:02:14.350> lengths<00:02:14.560> are<00:02:15.040> then<00:02:15.370> 200<00:02:16.030> but<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.569> only

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
focal lengths are then 200 but it's only

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.650 
focal lengths are then 200 but it's only
one<00:02:16.990> step<00:02:17.410> more<00:02:17.710> in<00:02:18.069> aperture<00:02:18.880> then<00:02:19.810> F<00:02:20.170> 2.8<00:02:20.830> now

don't<00:03:19.690> know<00:03:20.200> what<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.800> stopping<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.550> all<00:03:22.360> the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
don't know what is stopping it all the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
they're fast zooms at F 2.8 I don't know

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.450 
they're fast zooms at F 2.8 I don't know
why<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:27.880> couldn't<00:03:28.120> do<00:03:28.390> an<00:03:29.200> F<00:03:29.410> 2<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:30.070> know<00:03:30.190> they

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
why you couldn't do an F 2 you know they

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.020 
why you couldn't do an F 2 you know they
make<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:30.700> 200<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.570> 400<00:03:32.250> constant<00:03:33.250> aperture<00:03:33.610> zoom

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
make a 200 to 400 constant aperture zoom

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.770 
make a 200 to 400 constant aperture zoom
so<00:03:34.750> you<00:03:35.290> know<00:03:35.410> scale<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:36.070> down<00:03:36.450> fasten<00:03:37.450> up<00:03:37.540> the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
so you know scale it down fasten up the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.310 
so you know scale it down fasten up the
aperture<00:03:38.260> make<00:03:39.040> it<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.510> he'll<00:03:40.510> I'll<00:03:40.960> buy<00:03:41.260> two

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
aperture make it and he'll I'll buy two

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.170 
aperture make it and he'll I'll buy two
because<00:03:42.100> I'll<00:03:42.220> be<00:03:42.310> using<00:03:42.460> it<00:03:42.670> so<00:03:42.820> much<00:03:43.030> I'll

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
because I'll be using it so much I'll

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.460 
because I'll be using it so much I'll
probably<00:03:43.360> wear<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.690> first<00:03:43.870> one<00:03:44.080> out<00:03:44.260> in<00:03:44.380> a

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
probably wear the first one out in a

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.010 
probably wear the first one out in a
couple<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:44.770> years<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.580> I'd<00:03:46.270> love<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.480> hear<00:03:46.720> what

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
couple of years so I'd love to hear what

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.960 
couple of years so I'd love to hear what
would<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.740> buy<00:03:47.890> one<00:03:48.160> if<00:03:48.400> they<00:03:48.610> brought<00:03:48.820> that

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
would you buy one if they brought that

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.320 
would you buy one if they brought that
