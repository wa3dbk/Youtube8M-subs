me playing the Sicilian is pretty

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.990 
me playing the Sicilian is pretty
frustrating<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.380> actually<00:00:25.529> prefer<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.340> move

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
frustrating I actually prefer a move

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.880 
frustrating I actually prefer a move
like<00:00:27.269> beef<00:00:27.570> or<00:00:27.840> even<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> French<00:00:28.560> defense

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
like beef or even the French defense

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.460 
like beef or even the French defense
East<00:00:29.250> six<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.670> really<00:00:30.359> don't<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.840> playing<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
East six I really don't like playing the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.350 
East six I really don't like playing the
Sicilian<00:00:31.980> defense<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.030> started

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
Sicilian defense and so I started

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.389 
Sicilian defense and so I started
playing<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.719> Smith<00:00:33.930> more<00:00:34.170> gambit<00:00:34.680> quite

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
playing the Smith more gambit quite

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.069 
playing the Smith more gambit quite
frequently<00:00:35.880> now<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.630> feel<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:36.840> it

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
frequently now because I feel like it

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.260 
frequently now because I feel like it
gives<00:00:37.290> white<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> lot<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.219> aggressive<00:00:38.610> lines<00:00:39.000> to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
gives white a lot of aggressive lines to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.450 
gives white a lot of aggressive lines to
play<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> same<00:00:40.680> time<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
play and at the same time it's going to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.819 
play and at the same time it's going to
take<00:00:41.579> black<00:00:42.030> completely<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.500> any

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
take black completely out of any

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.790 
take black completely out of any
Sicilian<00:00:44.550> defense<00:00:44.940> lines<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.570> they've

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
Sicilian defense lines that they've

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.709 
Sicilian defense lines that they've
thought<00:00:46.800> about<00:00:47.100> trying<00:00:47.460> against<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.480> so

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
there's so many aggressive lines that

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.810 
there's so many aggressive lines that

feel<00:05:29.210> it's<00:05:29.360> really<00:05:29.720> hard<00:05:30.139> for<00:05:30.260> black<00:05:30.590> to

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
feel it's really hard for black to

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.060 
feel it's really hard for black to
always<00:05:31.850> prepare<00:05:32.320> against<00:05:33.320> all<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.710> attacks
