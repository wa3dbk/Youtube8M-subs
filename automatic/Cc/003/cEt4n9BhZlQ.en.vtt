himer mixtures on it but let's turn the
battery<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:56.489> we'll<00:00:56.610> see<00:00:56.760> what<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.149> do

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
battery on and we'll see what we can do

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.170 
battery on and we'll see what we can do
about<00:00:57.629> starting<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.309> I'll<00:00:59.309> put<00:00:59.550> my<00:00:59.699> hand<00:00:59.969> over

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:13.219 
about starting it I'll put my hand over
the<00:01:01.399> intake<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:03.600> kind<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.619> act<00:01:04.769> as<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.949> choke<00:01:12.229> put

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the intake to kind of act as a choke put

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:38.500 
the intake to kind of act as a choke put
my<00:01:13.350> hand

what<00:02:22.920> I'll<00:02:23.010> do<00:02:23.190> my<00:02:23.760> cameras<00:02:24.210> just<00:02:24.390> about<00:02:24.660> full

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
what I'll do my cameras just about full

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.980 
what I'll do my cameras just about full
I'll<00:02:26.340> leave<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.060> running<00:02:27.180> for<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.540> few<00:02:27.690> minutes

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
I'll leave it running for a few minutes

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.440 
I'll leave it running for a few minutes
and<00:02:28.400> download<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.520> special<00:02:29.850> my<00:02:29.940> computer<00:02:30.330> and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
and download the special my computer and

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.820 
and download the special my computer and
come<00:02:30.630> back<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.050> then<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.320> see<00:02:31.560> how<00:02:31.710> it

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
come back and then you can see how it

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.250 
come back and then you can see how it
runs<00:02:32.180> once<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.330> warmed<00:02:33.630> up<00:02:35.840> that's<00:02:36.840> camera

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
runs once it's warmed up that's camera

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.570 
runs once it's warmed up that's camera
and<00:02:38.750> I'll<00:02:39.750> make<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.960> report<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.560> its<00:02:41.310> kind<00:02:41.490> of

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
and I'll make a report to its kind of

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.570 
and I'll make a report to its kind of
match<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.880> video<00:02:42.000> together
