in particular clutch
I<00:00:53.199> did<00:00:54.199> a<00:00:54.230> previous<00:00:54.589> video<00:00:55.129> on<00:00:55.579> how<00:00:55.699> could<00:00:56.449> you

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
I did a previous video on how could you

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.380

add<00:00:57.019> just<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:57.800> touch<00:00:58.159> back<00:00:58.489> even<00:00:58.969> better<00:00:59.149> than

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
add just a touch back even better than

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.710 
add just a touch back even better than
duct<00:00:59.569> tape<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.969> the<00:01:01.969> method<00:01:02.659> was<00:01:04.570> one<00:01:05.570> with

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
duct tape and the method was one with

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.210 
duct tape and the method was one with
that<00:01:05.900> bracelet<00:01:06.229> because<00:01:06.680> of<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.890> simple<00:01:07.159> fact

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
that bracelet because of the simple fact

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.330 
that bracelet because of the simple fact
that<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.850> was<00:01:08.240> just<00:01:08.710> learning<00:01:09.710> or<00:01:10.100> practicing

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
that I was just learning or practicing

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.760 
that I was just learning or practicing
that<00:01:10.939> duct<00:01:11.240> tape<00:01:11.270> that<00:01:12.200> clutch<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:12.979> life<00:01:13.540> so

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
that duct tape that clutch that life so

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.440 
that duct tape that clutch that life so
when<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:15.799> did<00:01:16.219> it<00:01:16.250> I<00:01:16.430> came<00:01:16.490> back<00:01:16.939> and<00:01:17.119> I<00:01:17.180> was<00:01:17.360> like

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
when I did it I came back and I was like

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.480 
when I did it I came back and I was like
I<00:01:18.049> know<00:01:18.110> this<00:01:18.409> is<00:01:18.560> easier<00:01:18.920> way<00:01:19.130> or<00:01:19.189> a<00:01:19.340> better

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
I know this is easier way or a better

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.910 
I know this is easier way or a better
way<00:01:19.729> that<00:01:19.969> I<00:01:20.060> can<00:01:20.270> do<00:01:20.450> this<00:01:20.630> than<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.560> one<00:01:21.740> I

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
way that I can do this than the one I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.279 
way that I can do this than the one I
placed<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.490> lot<00:01:22.729> of<00:01:22.880> duct<00:01:23.270> tape<00:01:23.299> in<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:23.810> one

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
placed a lot of duct tape in that one

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.050 
placed a lot of duct tape in that one
put<00:01:24.530> that<00:01:24.740> in<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.009> hunt<00:01:25.369> that<00:01:25.549> wasn't<00:01:25.969> what

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
put that in the hunt that wasn't what

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.490 
put that in the hunt that wasn't what
about<00:01:26.270> look<00:01:27.789> 10<00:01:28.789> inches<00:01:29.149> by<00:01:29.329> 7<00:01:30.110> inches<00:01:30.200> or

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
about look 10 inches by 7 inches or

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.080 
about look 10 inches by 7 inches or
something<00:01:30.799> like<00:01:30.890> that<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.520> I'm<00:01:31.640> used<00:01:31.820> almost

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
something like that and I'm used almost

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.819 
something like that and I'm used almost
a<00:01:32.270> whole<00:01:32.479> roll<00:01:32.810> of<00:01:32.840> duct<00:01:33.140> tape<00:01:33.170> with<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.799> so<00:01:34.579> I

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
a whole roll of duct tape with that so I

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.649 
a whole roll of duct tape with that so I
went<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:37.430> thought<00:01:37.670> about<00:01:37.820> it<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.240> I<00:01:38.420> came

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
went and I thought about it and I came

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.649 
went and I thought about it and I came
up<00:01:38.719> with<00:01:38.930> this<00:01:39.289> method<00:01:39.560> here<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.820> we're<00:01:41.539> going

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
up with this method here so we're going

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.569 
up with this method here so we're going
to<00:01:41.750> go<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.200> I'm<00:01:42.289> going<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.680> I'm<00:01:43.340> going<00:01:43.399> to

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
to go and I'm going to I'm going to

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.599

create that width

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.839 
create that width
once<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.379> sides<00:02:51.620> were<00:02:51.859> folded<00:02:52.310> I've<00:02:52.430> been

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
once the sides were folded I've been

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.289 
once the sides were folded I've been
pressed<00:02:53.269> out<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:54.379> sides<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:55.489> creep<00:02:55.819> to

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
did do three layers of duct tape just so

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.789 
did do three layers of duct tape just so
I<00:03:13.310> can<00:03:13.639> say<00:03:13.849> a<00:03:14.120> little<00:03:14.540> bit<00:03:14.659> more<00:03:14.959> so<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.620> could

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
I can say a little bit more so I could

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.209 
I can say a little bit more so I could
be<00:03:15.889> more<00:03:15.919> sturdier<00:03:16.579> I'm<00:03:16.790> just<00:03:17.060> in<00:03:17.239> simpler<00:03:17.659> Bay

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:18.219 
be more sturdier I'm just in simpler Bay

be more sturdier I'm just in simpler Bay
once<00:03:19.219> I<00:03:19.400> was<00:03:19.579> done<00:03:19.760> laying<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.299> duct<00:03:20.510> tape<00:03:20.780> I

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
once I was done laying the duct tape I

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.180 
once I was done laying the duct tape I
then<00:03:21.889> turned<00:03:22.609> it<00:03:22.790> back<00:03:23.359> on<00:03:23.599> its<00:03:23.930> side<00:03:24.229> or<00:03:24.620> back

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
then turned it back on its side or back

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.250 
then turned it back on its side or back
on<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.489> other<00:03:25.639> side<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.299> remove<00:03:26.629> all<00:03:27.079> the

excess<00:03:27.709> duct<00:03:27.979> tape<00:03:28.250> just<00:03:28.519> so<00:03:28.669> it<00:03:28.819> wouldn't<00:03:29.000> be

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
excess duct tape just so it wouldn't be

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.610 
excess duct tape just so it wouldn't be
sticking<00:03:29.569> out<00:03:29.720> on<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:31.220> outside<00:03:31.519> of<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.209> bag

once I was done with that I folded the

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.729 
once I was done with that I folded the
back<00:03:36.349> up<00:03:36.680> on<00:03:36.949> the<00:03:37.370> wrong<00:03:37.729> side<00:03:38.239> just<00:03:39.229> like<00:03:39.560> to

I<00:03:51.500> was<00:03:51.650> done<00:03:51.829> with<00:03:52.009> that<00:03:52.040> I<00:03:52.430> mashed<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.239> down

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
I was done with that I mashed it down

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.390 
I was done with that I mashed it down
with<00:03:53.659> my<00:03:53.810> hands<00:03:54.109> to<00:03:54.379> kind<00:03:54.620> of<00:03:54.709> create<00:03:55.069> the

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
with my hands to kind of create the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.319 
with my hands to kind of create the
shape<00:03:55.720> drew<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:57.049> line<00:03:57.500> on<00:03:57.859> each<00:03:58.220> side<00:03:58.699> so<00:03:59.299> I

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
shape drew a line on each side so I

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.330 
shape drew a line on each side so I
would<00:03:59.689> know<00:03:59.870> where<00:04:00.109> to<00:04:00.349> staple<00:04:00.949> and<00:04:01.310> staple

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
would know where to staple and staple

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.379 
would know where to staple and staple
each<00:04:01.939> side<00:04:02.299> down<00:04:03.819> whence<00:04:04.819> I<00:04:05.060> stick<00:04:05.359> with

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
each side down whence I stick with

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.140 
each side down whence I stick with
everything<00:04:05.930> down<00:04:06.259> I've<00:04:06.590> been<00:04:07.250> covered<00:04:07.970> the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
everything down I've been covered the

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.149 
everything down I've been covered the
staples<00:04:08.689> with<00:04:09.229> duct<00:04:09.620> tape

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
staples with duct tape

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.979 
staples with duct tape
so<00:04:10.489> it<00:04:10.669> it'd<00:04:10.790> be<00:04:10.819> a<00:04:10.939> little<00:04:11.150> bit<00:04:11.269> more<00:04:11.509> cleaner

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
so it it'd be a little bit more cleaner

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.520 
so it it'd be a little bit more cleaner
and<00:04:12.379> polished<00:04:13.069> look<00:04:13.750> once<00:04:14.750> I<00:04:14.959> was<00:04:15.169> finished

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
and covering them with duct tape I then

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.200 
and covering them with duct tape I then

shape and then covering it with duct

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.640 
shape and then covering it with duct
tape<00:04:56.860> so<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.700> can<00:04:57.850> all<00:04:58.060> be<00:04:58.530> cohesive<00:04:59.530> and

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
tape so it can all be cohesive and

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.650 
tape so it can all be cohesive and
everything<00:04:59.980> will<00:05:00.190> look<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.700> same<00:05:00.910> but<00:05:01.240> I<00:05:01.390> just
