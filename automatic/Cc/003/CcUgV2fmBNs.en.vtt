00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.799
 I know 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.259
 to 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.259
 no no but but 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.560
 What a group of scientists from a number of years have in common. 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.670
 it is not a plant; on the contrary, it is a very serious topic of eels on ours 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.040
 coasts are worryingly diminishing due to fishing 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.780
 excessive 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.680
 and of the health conditions of the manga today to cesenatico some researchers 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.370
 year to share with important results 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.780
 here it is 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.440
 this is a female 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.440
 party starts with letter and put eggs 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.730
 you see the huge belly 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.340
 because they should start now and put wheels on their own 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.380
 here is the feast of forgiveness accommodated watching 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.080
 this is another color 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.670
 open ports router 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.150
 cheat for 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.950
 the event is one to celebrate a female eel after 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.469
 one year of experimentation 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.630
 spontaneously laid the eggs 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.710
 it is the point of arrival of a work considered in some ways impossible 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 marvel 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.050
 marlene 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.880
 for over a century they explain us the reproduction in captivity of the 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.370
 eels is an elusive topic as the animal itself and in vain it seeks to 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.750
 find a method that allows you to breed these fish for purpose 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.659
 industrial 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.710
 how to do for campÃ  bass and time 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.780
 the results achieved which they suggest instead. the percentage is certainly optimistic 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.629
 fertilization with natural reproduction 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.199
 fineco room eggs 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.619
 second 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:17.079
 there is no human intervention animals are much less stressed 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.109
 we are left we are that 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.110
 we reproduce that we go to collect the eggs collects the sperm 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.560
 I'm hungry. them directly into vast then animals 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.430
 surely they suffer much much less mortality with this technique is 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.429
 reduced alice not zero 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:37.239
 this is certainly an extremely positive state because milk and honey 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.200
 will connect 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.290
 to very high mortality rates 40 50 60 percent 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.389
 according to the auction click here I am 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.609
 therefore it is relatively simple and lasts 5 months based on 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.039
 control of both dental x ray luzier ascent parameters 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.560
 and water temperature 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.700
 associated 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.629
 a magazine to keep the complicity on TV 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.540
 to make sure that we say bites that are made by animals weekly 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.969
 and that lead slowly to the maturation of the yamaha eggs. I'm not 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.869
 of mirrors 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:13.809
 plitvice 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:18.699
 in short, with the tested techniques to which animals and production do not die 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:24.059
 of eggs is significant and the deposition promises to occur naturally 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:29.029
 everything appears ready for the next step the decisive weaning 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:31.859
 we are the site to see 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.299
 place we went out had to get the the 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.079
 newborn up. this larva opens the mouth to the need to eat 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.899
 we stopped here 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.079
 we have seen that 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.090
 it will not be easy to feed this animal with the normals we say 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:50.729
 tacniche that I see the utility for nappo culture 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.029
 I had to dream and I hope that 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:56.870
 in this regard the region we owe the hand to be able to continue say the 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.869
 search 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.889
 we embark on the dafne a real laboratory on the sea for the 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.659
 release operations of some eels equipped with a device of 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.659
 license plate recognition will allow the map to be moved 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.759
 we take the opportunity to speak with the regional councilor 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:25.119
 we are ready to make our part hahaha continue to finance the proscenium of 

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:25.840
 this 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.340
 of this project I must say that the result is really big important 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.770
 of international level 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.490
 if we think of the regional funding in this case 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.530
 it must be said that the little mouse gave birth to a small mountain 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.830
 financing a great result we are going to auto preparing a leek of the 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.450
 law to apply the European protection directive in emilia romagna 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:59.720
 eel with me kind of threatened and intro and this year start 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.240
 next year this law will see the light will become operational within a hard 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.360
 ufo a strong reduction in the catch of juvenile eel and why we have 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.279
 need to increase in our sea and in inland waters 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.650
 the thousand and as a population 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.849
 the bet is of the important ones 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.979
 inpdap headquarters will allow the market for eels to thrive by 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.909
 continue to generate wealth 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:41.539
 without damaging the spice the eels have centuries could have 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.469
 an alternative their usual and mysterious journey for reproduction 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:49.949
 towards the sargasso sea dog stay on the Adriatic coast and you have to grow 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.610
 of own cities 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.689
 now
