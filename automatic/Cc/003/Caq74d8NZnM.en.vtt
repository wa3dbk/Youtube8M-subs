sophisticated and scarily smart alarm
clock<00:00:43.290> after<00:00:43.800> you've<00:00:44.010> set<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> time<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.940> like

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
clock after you've set a time just like

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you sleep it uses that information to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.830 
you sleep it uses that information to
calculate<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.879> various<00:00:51.210> stages<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.719> sleep

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840

you<00:00:52.079> know<00:00:52.170> light<00:00:52.440> sleep<00:00:52.739> deep<00:00:53.070> sleep<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.520> so

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
you know light sleep deep sleep and so

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.670 
you know light sleep deep sleep and so
on<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.090> figure<00:00:54.360> out<00:00:54.510> when<00:00:54.750> would<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.110> ideal

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
on to figure out when would be the ideal

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.799 
on to figure out when would be the ideal
time<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.219> wake<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.550> allowing<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.660> have
