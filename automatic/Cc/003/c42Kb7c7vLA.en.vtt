00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.030
 videos in time lapse is usually the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.429
 videos in time lapse could only be 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.109
 made in the title's own cameras or 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.170
 in cameras with some more features 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.350
 professionals when the dslr with the use 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.390
 timers or even with the use of 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.180
 messenger lanter that was a plugin that you 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.609
 was on camera is currently there 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.219
 some apps for both android 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.270
 How much for the beach and for you? 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.550
 for windows phone that let you 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.760
 turn your camera phone into 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.670
 a camera to make time lapse is in 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.550
 example of this video I'm going to use 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.340
 this app here called frame- lapse 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.410
 that it is very simple free of charge 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.340
 use and does not include advertising in 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.609
 your nests are low you look there in the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.469
 app store on your phone and 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.970
 you will see that it has settings 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.540
 very basic is that I will here first 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.360
 option is when you click on the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.390
 camera you can set up with the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.580
 resolution you want to record the video is 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.159
 in the case of my phone is that it does not 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.460
 supports full HD video which is the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.330
 of 80 but it supports HD videos 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.909
 so I can consider this way 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.869
 here I have a gap between each 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.400
 photo is the longer the interval time 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.850
 between one photo and another 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.030
 but it is interesting will get the effect 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.890
 holds lapse but you will get more going 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.899
 take longer to record 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.659
 this video I recommend you 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.549
 use a second or five seconds 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.040
 I do not know if marking the option is already 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.820
 configured is here you have the option of 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.240
 set how long 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.920
 video you want then it's the infinite 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.110
 here you will choose when you 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.540
 will start and finish it is here 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.500
 some options 7 seconds from the second 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.959
 minute you put that one 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.870
 preset time of video it goes 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.940
 taking the photos in sequence and at the end 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.560
 these photos it will generate the video as 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.920
 It's just the example I'm going to put here 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.459
 seven seconds we mark that the set 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.160
 next and here it gives you some options 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.140
 additional camera settings that are only 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.380
 available on a paid version of the same 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.020
 application is at first you do not 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.910
 need to use these options 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.989
 because what he already had the option is already 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.590
 very interesting 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.440
 and then you can start is the recording 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.959
 of your time lapse video is enough for you 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.780
 push blue button here so he 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.150
 here already giving you is the time that you go 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.250
 take to be able to record this 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.739
 video is not saying here the range 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.230
 between them with the brakes is one second 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.130
 that is, you will take a picture every 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.200
 second 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.200
 the length of the video we set 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.790
 to access just the next set and here 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.769
 it already gives you a weather forecast that 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.910
 It will take three minutes to do it. 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.150
 30 seconds 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.340
 when you press the record button it 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.970
 automatically start to make the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.079
 photo captures 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.079
 depending on camera movement 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.220
 he is aggravating 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.280
 as the intention here is not to make a 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.960
 video is not showing here with the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.100
 max fans 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:47.380
 I'm going to finish it just to show you 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:51.280
 Here you can access the video that 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.990
 you just record how much it was 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.060
 low cut I did not give it to 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.830
 realize the effect but it is an application 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.540
 very interesting 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.220
 then the intent of this video is even 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.900
 displaying this application will show that 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.300
 it is an interesting option for those who 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.950
 want to do some differentiated videos 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.750
 is an important tip for you to do 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.870
 time lapse you put your cell phone 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.150
 on-site support for 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.950
 that you can capture the movements 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.989
 with more quality 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.670
 I hope I have helped with this video if 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.989

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.120
