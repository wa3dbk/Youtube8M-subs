six sure so let's just start with the MV
for<00:00:31.679> over<00:00:31.980> here<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> 14-inch

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
for over here so this is a 14-inch

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.389 
for over here so this is a 14-inch
ultrabooks<00:00:35.040> from<00:00:35.280> HP<00:00:35.910> same<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:36.960> MV<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.770> so

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
ultrabooks from HP same as MV for so

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.549 
ultrabooks from HP same as MV for so
let's<00:00:39.149> look<00:00:39.300> from<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> design<00:00:39.870> perspective<00:00:40.020> on

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
let's look from a design perspective on

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.069 
let's look from a design perspective on
the<00:00:41.010> outside<00:00:41.430> as<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.969> see<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:42.420> since<00:00:42.989> this

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the outside as you see here since this

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.860 
the outside as you see here since this
is<00:00:43.260> brushed<00:00:43.500> aluminium<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.660> once<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.750> open

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
is brushed aluminium and once you open

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.200 
is brushed aluminium and once you open
up<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.739> insight<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> palm<00:00:47.760> rest<00:00:48.000> this

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
up on the insight on a palm rest this

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.049 
up on the insight on a palm rest this
entire<00:00:48.600> area<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.980> brushed<00:00:50.280> aluminum<00:00:50.879> as

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
entire area it is brushed aluminum as

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.650 
entire area it is brushed aluminum as
well<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:52.340> here<00:00:53.340> comes<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> bottom<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.480> we

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
well and here comes to the bottom so we

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.569 
well and here comes to the bottom so we
have<00:00:54.750> did<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> special<00:00:55.320> treatment<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.250> call<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
have did a special treatment we call it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.869 
have did a special treatment we call it
a<00:00:56.730> soft<00:00:57.180> touch<00:00:57.360> pain<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.410> can<00:00:58.730> fill<00:00:59.730> it

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
a soft touch pain so if you can fill it

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.450 
a soft touch pain so if you can fill it
it<00:01:00.120> actually<00:01:00.359> has<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> very<00:01:01.260> smooth<00:01:01.800> kind<00:01:02.340> of

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it actually has a very smooth kind of

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
it actually has a very smooth kind of
feeling<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> bottom<00:01:04.710> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
feeling so this on the bottom is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.830 
feeling so this on the bottom is
actually<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.489> composite<00:01:06.180> material<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.720> we

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
actually a composite material that we

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.750 
actually a composite material that we
use<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.200> actually<00:01:07.439> plastics<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.430> glass

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
use is actually plastics with glass

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.960 
use is actually plastics with glass
fiber<00:01:09.090> fuse<00:01:09.540> together<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.640> kind<00:01:11.820> of

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
fiber fuse together so it's a kind of

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.300 
fiber fuse together so it's a kind of
way<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.510> try<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.560> research<00:01:13.950> into<00:01:14.189> new

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
way that we try to so research into new

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.460 
way that we try to so research into new
material<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:14.970> our<00:01:15.000> notebooks<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:16.229> terms

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
material for our notebooks and in terms

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.710 
material for our notebooks and in terms
of<00:01:16.590> colors<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:18.060> does<00:01:18.420> offer

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
of colors as you can see we does offer

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.870 
of colors as you can see we does offer
