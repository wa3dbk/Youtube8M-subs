00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.879
 like to measure 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.200

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.200

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.240

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.020
 mister more money 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:17.269
 hello dear friends that was the trailer 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.370
 kills that is a film of the 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.480
 man 20 november 2010 in the german 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.569
 Cinemas is coming 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.900
 Takes 1 hour and 47 minutes and one 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:31.010
 action thriller thriller is of the dear 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.489
 Robert Rodriguez and what if that 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.209
 American state again no 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.799
 new has to solve their problems 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.690
 Of course they hire a killer 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.970
 how it shoots through the crowd 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.190
 and leaves neat marks and 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.629
 That is also what you do when you get away from it 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.510
 Of course, that is not the case 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.459
 is super sexist 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.430
 I think that will be a movie under everyone 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.930
 Compare level with wonderful 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.620
 works like hangover 1 2 and 3 or what 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.069
 Do not we have any nice ones then? 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.409
 Clue maybe Kerschowski will be like that 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.659
 really bad b-movie moderately if I 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.280
 let's say and there is no way there 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.109
 I go there just because I say mine 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.889

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.359

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.400

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.160

 I would also be very happy 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.060
 looking forward constructive criticism and upward 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.299
 It would not be that bad either 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.160
 abo down who got better and it 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.290

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.180
