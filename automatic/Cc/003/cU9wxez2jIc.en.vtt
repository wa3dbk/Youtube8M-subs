00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.080
 you have to imagine a good bowl of 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.389
 spaghetti and that's the land my 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.670
 future is here this piece of spaghetti 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.810
 I 'll explain that to you but suddenly 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.880
 it touches all the other pieces 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.950
 so sometimes it becomes difficult and 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.300
 complicated to explain something 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.219
 because we heard right away 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.300
 started in all the other subjects that 

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:28.300
 will touch during the course 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.730
 so we have a dad the impression how 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.170
 starts with flints and then we have 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:43.000
 does a light evolution until 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:45.220
 hands we come with iphones ok on 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.260
 was coming to a child with agriculture 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.460
 we have this agricultural system that 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.949
 equipa necessarily uninhabitable and their 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.839
 evolution is not inevitable either 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.589
 we are creating this right now 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:02.229
 there are more and more than 10 fights 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.879
 explore approaches that are very 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.280
 different from what we are currently doing 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.400
 so me when I pass by in a 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.020
 field and someone plowing 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.460
 for me this historic first 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.500
 we do not do anymore to a guy asked me 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.299
 make a design for his farm 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.250
 I started arguing with the idea that 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.320
 are you going to be a shepherd so that makes 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.299
 how long do you host 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.880
 get my life why it was doing 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.810
 shepherd because my dad is lodged 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.810
 my grandfather was a shepherd 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.750
 so I say ah like you like 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.400
 job no I hate sheep so 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.440
 we start to discuss if there is 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.659
 euphoria frost of the forest gardens 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.150
 behind all this and here is the floor 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.260
 I explain everything that at one point it 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.909
 ask me if his forest garden there for 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.360
 vegetables danger to you and 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.620
 vegetables 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.630
 so we make small flower beds 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.280
 l like that is that the citizens and 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.350
 produce vegetables indoors 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.690
 when it's not because of maintenance and 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.810
 600 digging 1 which will have pebbles 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.670
 fish caught by them do not prevent it 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.399
 return by the land with a spade 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.659
 it's killing now it's not going at all 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.200
 because I like it when I like it 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.200
 well digging 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:22.630
 it's ok we'll make them a little tray 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.580
 sand there so we put small quilts 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.440
 like that and you can come back from work 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:33.550
 who can lower the otherwise small 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:38.170
 you Belgian not here people tell me 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.760
 sometimes yeah but at home and that 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.950
 will not push on his own 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.170
 roots it has to be grafted all 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.210
 that's what is coluche trees or 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.480
 yeah so that's going to go because it's 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.190
 a tree ok it's not complicated in 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.200
 reason that there is need for some 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.060
 climate but the tabs for example they 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.080
 even brought deposits'm back 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.560
 kerala in india 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.980
 so there and no winter so that the pot 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.660
 mines we adapt a universe of kyzyl the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.060
 ep local children climb into 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.380
 apple trees to pluck leaves 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.410
 like that the first ones think that this 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:17.950
 universe but still there is the 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:24.880
 runoff and also evaporation in 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:30.910
 colo pelvis clown and whose soil because 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:34.150
 of this congress the newton one always has a 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.770
 more and thousands of tons of shit that 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.990
 is now processed and so that's done 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:44.380
 what are you doing with that? 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.090
 hanged in the fields is not here ago 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.520
 strong thunderstorms but if we do that in 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.560
 brittany for example the more I live there 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.230
 they can not hurt in Brittany so in 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.530
 state it in the fields 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.180
 it's raining there are very few people who are 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.970
 completely flat 1 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.490
 so it's okay or sealed and it'll give 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.090
 network in the rivers and it happens 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.100
 on the coast 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.260
 mix with the mans with the read ya 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.220
 pores we already have 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.410
 in Brittany, stool and urine 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.190
 this source of fertility so I want 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.600
 to recycle that into my system 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.620
 so I will find the way most 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.370
 adapted to people with climate practiced 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.610
 these traces and raz energy and its 3 1 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.610
 to be able to use that 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.610
 and 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:46.199
 I love because from the sky it is 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:47.520
 permaculture banana it's a rules 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.810
 of basel it is by affirming that I have so 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.360
 we do not have the ball one shot we do the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.479
 full so you do not do it's other 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.479
 thing
