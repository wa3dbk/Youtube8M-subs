00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660
 and what do you think about the 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.939
 good about the player claudio pizarro 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.639
 you think I should be a captain who does not 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.950
 it should be selected what we started on 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.599
 best Peruvian tour in the history of 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.009
 history there is no one better than what 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.009
 step on at least and asked me ma 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.440
 and then why do you think that in four 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.560
 knockout I think he's done four 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.119
 goals there is one that does not count what we throw 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.950
 because I only play two games 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.050
 because then this whole issue happens 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.080
 but definitely clear it has a theme 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.300
 with the selection that I think does not happen 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.580
 neither for the subject nor for the subject of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.870
 football performance are topics 12 7 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.450
 cars that is a subject an incredible subject 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.390
 for example 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.940
 of pizarro throughout his career in all his 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.110
 career has only failed three penal 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.290
 only three penalties have come out and then 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.850
 for the sum of 15 years of footballer 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.110
 with Peru there had never been any criminal 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.210
 has put all the penalties in the 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.090
 match against argentina catches the ball 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.160
 and the whole state said no 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.449
 because they fell and he never had any 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.850
 failure 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.920
 there is a topic of trust in the end I do not know 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.940
 but that the players support them and 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.010
 they adore all fighters 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.780
 and speaking of the archer who do you think 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.840
 I should cover up on happiness I do not have 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.070
 I doubt I wanted to do it to another so I did not 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.480
 was convened is part of the party but 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.060
 for me it is the best archer the green of 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.649
 years 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.409
 and another closed one that has the management of 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.859
 burga 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.850
 look at this last stage people have not 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:42.729
 talked about a past volcano but piola 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.630
 nobody is in his office but he has already 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.630
 gone 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.430
 this is a question of specifically 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.310
 paraguay game what do you think about the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.189
 hard approach that mark esequibo 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.990
 as a white individual I think it's going to 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.970
 want is wrong among other things 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.280
 also in that want to always play with 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.689
 the four of forward not then and 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.560
 above all, keep in mind that vargas do not 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.110
 is going through a good time 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.060
 then since it has shown that no 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.679
 all matches are the same and I 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.630
 it seems they would mark it because it would mark 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.120
 characterized and that's why they put him a magician 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.040
 in the 90's because he plan 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.840
 each different party and thus an eleven 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.340
 different according to the rival with Peru 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.810
 it seems like you want to always play 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.120
 with the four and that is the big mistake 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.590
 who is committing and in the house of vargas 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.299
 what opinion do you deserve I do not know in the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.299
 Last images as you saw 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.000
 can not be criticized in the 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.340
 topic 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.870
 Let's say to question yourself and if you want to take 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.790
 what he wants to take because he was free 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.650
 and he was leaving and there was already 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.720
 called off from our conception and he 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.040
 it can be what it wants but as it says 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.630
 the saying no of the entity must be 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.450
 but also look like 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.130
 but within the selection and well I think 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.930
 I that there are elements that can be 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.310
 rescue that being crossed reincarnation is 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.410
 good another that was not summoned that 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.120
 other elements do you think that you could 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.650
 give good results but in the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.110
 silicon definitely not last 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.210
 the players to zambrano to give it 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.070
 crossed 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.090
 the same cachito ramÃ­rez that did not play 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.620
 well with Paraguay that was so bad that 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.210
 we leave with a bad memory and as 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.830
 this with what until March but 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.700
 particular formalism according 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.400
 nobody will deny it but 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.080
 but he has good players and present 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.569
 the big mistake that match with colombia 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.940
 we take the game if we do not do anything 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.660
 with we have them in another situation I 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.250
 I do not take the world 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.220
 and as we see the game of chile 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.110
 even missing a lot much is missing 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.750
 March, many things can still happen 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.550
 from here until March but we have to go 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.170
 Chileans beat them I think for the 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.170
 global because we have to win them
