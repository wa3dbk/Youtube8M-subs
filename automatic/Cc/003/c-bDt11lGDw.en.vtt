00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
I think the free squat has way way more

free<00:01:04.640> squats<00:01:04.939> that's<00:01:05.449> my<00:01:06.200> advice<00:01:06.350> all<00:01:06.920> the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
free squats that's my advice all the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.219 
free squats that's my advice all the
time<00:01:07.310> your<00:01:08.149> main<00:01:08.299> movement<00:01:08.659> has<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:08.899> be<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.020> free

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
time your main movement has to be a free

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.530 
time your main movement has to be a free
squat<00:01:09.469> is<00:01:10.340> there<00:01:10.579> a<00:01:10.610> place<00:01:10.850> for<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.119> box<00:01:11.299> squat

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
squat is there a place for the box squat

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.010 
squat is there a place for the box squat
as<00:01:11.659> a<00:01:11.690> supplemental<00:01:12.260> move<00:01:12.470> most<00:01:13.100> definitely

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
as a supplemental move most definitely

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.870 
as a supplemental move most definitely
but<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.170> majority<00:01:15.440> of<00:01:15.620> your<00:01:15.740> training<00:01:15.979> needs

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
but the majority of your training needs

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.980 
but the majority of your training needs
to<00:01:16.970> be<00:01:17.030> based<00:01:17.270> around<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.600> free<00:01:17.750> squat

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
to be based around the free squat

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.120 
to be based around the free squat
because<00:01:18.350> that's<00:01:18.680> what<00:01:18.799> you're<00:01:18.890> going<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.070> do

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
because that's what you're going to do

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.969 
because that's what you're going to do
in<00:01:19.220> competition<00:01:20.440> too<00:01:21.440> many<00:01:21.590> people<00:01:21.799> who<00:01:21.860> come

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
in competition too many people who come

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.060 
in competition too many people who come
reliant<00:01:22.430> on<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.640> on<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.119> box<00:01:23.299> for<00:01:24.170> athlete

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
reliant on the on the box for athlete

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.039 
reliant on the on the box for athlete
though<00:01:25.280> totally<00:01:26.240> different<00:01:26.510> issue<00:01:26.600> I<00:01:26.720> don't

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
though totally different issue I don't

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.800 
though totally different issue I don't
think<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:27.350> really<00:01:27.590> matters<00:01:27.740> at<00:01:28.070> all<00:01:28.810> between

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
think it really matters at all between

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.980 
think it really matters at all between
free<00:01:29.990> squats<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:30.610> box<00:01:31.610> squats<00:01:31.909> or<00:01:32.150> front

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
know he didn't eat in front so I mean

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.560

eating<00:02:41.410> clean<00:02:41.590> with<00:02:41.770> me<00:02:41.920> because<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.210> know<00:02:43.330> he

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
eating clean with me because you know he

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.170 
eating clean with me because you know he
just<00:02:43.600> wasn't<00:02:44.520> biomechanically<00:02:45.520> set<00:02:45.760> up<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.030> do

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
just wasn't biomechanically set up to do

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.670 
just wasn't biomechanically set up to do
that

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
that

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.260 
that
so<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.830> it<00:02:48.040> just<00:02:48.190> made<00:02:48.310> those<00:02:48.460> bad<00:02:48.730> lifts<00:02:49.060> for

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
so that it just made those bad lifts for

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.030 
so that it just made those bad lifts for
him<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.810> it's<00:02:50.020> not<00:02:50.170> like<00:02:50.290> he<00:02:50.320> has<00:02:50.710> to<00:02:50.920> be<00:02:51.010> a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
him and it's not like he has to be a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.030 
him and it's not like he has to be a
good<00:02:51.310> fronts<00:02:51.550> quarter<00:02:51.850> or<00:02:52.270> has<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.690> be<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.810> good

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
good fronts quarter or has to be a good

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.930 
good fronts quarter or has to be a good
power<00:02:54.040> cleaner<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.430> be<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.580> good<00:02:54.790> football

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
power cleaner to be a good football

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.030 
power cleaner to be a good football
player<00:02:55.300> you<00:02:55.600> know<00:02:55.780> those<00:02:56.230> aren't<00:02:56.410> mutually

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
player you know those aren't mutually

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.810 
player you know those aren't mutually
exclusive<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:59.530> know<00:02:59.680> for<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.310> lift<00:03:00.520> for<00:03:00.790> a

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
exclusive so you know for the lift for a

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.400 
exclusive so you know for the lift for a
competitive<00:03:01.240> lifter<00:03:01.540> yes<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.080> definitely

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
competitive lifter yes it definitely

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.850 
competitive lifter yes it definitely
matters

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
matters

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.440 
matters
I<00:03:02.890> think<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.940> free<00:03:04.330> squat<00:03:04.630> just<00:03:05.320> squat<00:03:05.860> is

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
I think the free squat just squat is

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.810 
I think the free squat just squat is
much<00:03:07.450> better<00:03:07.630> but<00:03:08.470> for<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.830> athlete<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.460> don't

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
much better but for the athlete I don't

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.400 
much better but for the athlete I don't
think<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.000> really<00:03:10.060> matters<00:03:10.300> decision<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:11.020> be

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
think it really matters decision to be

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.260 
think it really matters decision to be
able<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.590> do<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.770> safely<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.340> be<00:03:12.430> good<00:03:12.970> at<00:03:13.120> it

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
able to do it safely and be good at it

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.820 
able to do it safely and be good at it
and<00:03:13.920> that'll<00:03:14.920> be<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.010> good<00:03:15.160> exercise<00:03:15.370> for<00:03:15.550> them
