said the first one we're going to do

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.040 
said the first one we're going to do
here<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.110> for<00:00:34.500> defense<00:00:35.180> let's<00:00:36.180> pretend<00:00:36.750> right

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
here is for defense let's pretend right

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.200 
here is for defense let's pretend right
now<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.559> we're<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.739> offense<00:00:38.460> okay<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.059> we're

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
now that we're on offense okay and we're

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.119 
now that we're on offense okay and we're
going<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> pretend<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.840> they<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.290> pushing<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
going to pretend that they are pushing a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.209 
going to pretend that they are pushing a
so<00:00:41.940> what<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> average<00:00:42.629> fuck<00:00:43.350> boy<00:00:43.559> will<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:43.980> is

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
so what the average fuck boy will do is

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.090 
so what the average fuck boy will do is
come<00:00:44.489> off<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.510> let's<00:00:45.930> say<00:00:46.140> come<00:00:46.920> off<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
come off of a and let's say come off a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.520 
come off of a and let's say come off a
spawn<00:00:47.460> excuse<00:00:47.789> me<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.120> go<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.170> push

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
spawn excuse me and go to a on a push

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.229 
spawn excuse me and go to a on a push
they'll<00:00:49.950> probably<00:00:50.190> send<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.550> kid<00:00:50.700> hospital

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
they'll probably send a kid hospital

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.689 
they'll probably send a kid hospital
probably<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.170> fucking<00:00:52.590> warrior<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.160> an<00:00:53.280> ASM

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
probably a fucking warrior with an ASM

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.939 
probably a fucking warrior with an ASM
one<00:00:54.000> then<00:00:54.719> they'll<00:00:54.930> probably<00:00:55.199> send<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.739> kids

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
one then they'll probably send the kids

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.580 
one then they'll probably send the kids
somewhere<00:00:56.190> around<00:00:56.460> there<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:57.590> most

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
somewhere around there and then most

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.020 
somewhere around there and then most
likely<00:00:58.800> you'll<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.520> or<00:00:59.609> two<00:00:59.760> kids

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
likely you'll have one or two kids

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.760 
likely you'll have one or two kids
sitting<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.719> head<00:01:00.930> glitch<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.440> he<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
sitting in this head glitch like he is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.579 
sitting in this head glitch like he is
doing<00:01:02.359> it'll<00:01:03.359> probably<00:01:03.570> look<00:01:03.809> over<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
doing it'll probably look over here the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.350 
doing it'll probably look over here the
hub<00:01:04.739> kid<00:01:05.040> looking<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.369> green<00:01:05.519> either<00:01:05.820> way<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
spot is going to be heavily populated to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.050 
spot is going to be heavily populated to
counter<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.900> defense<00:01:10.650> off<00:01:10.950> spawn<00:01:11.760> what

to<00:02:54.510> see<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.810> little<00:02:55.020> pivot<00:02:55.620> like<00:02:55.800> right<00:02:56.160> here

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
to see this little pivot like right here

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.130 
to see this little pivot like right here
in<00:02:56.460> this<00:02:56.670> structure<00:02:57.060> you're<00:02:57.780> going<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.990> want

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
in this structure you're going to want

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.650 
in this structure you're going to want
to<00:02:58.260> line<00:02:58.560> up<00:02:58.830> your<00:02:58.860> cross<00:02:59.490> your<00:02:59.880> top<00:03:00.120> crosshair

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
to line up your cross your top crosshair

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.780 
to line up your cross your top crosshair
in<00:03:00.870> there<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:01.740> as<00:03:01.950> I'm<00:03:02.070> doing<00:03:02.190> right<00:03:02.400> now<00:03:02.490> so

in there just as I'm doing right now so

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.820 
in there just as I'm doing right now so
that<00:03:02.910> way<00:03:03.030> your<00:03:03.210> top<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.690> bottom<00:03:04.290> crosshairs

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
that way your top and bottom crosshairs

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.330 
that way your top and bottom crosshairs
are<00:03:04.980> just<00:03:05.490> to<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.790> right<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.570> like<00:03:06.810> pull

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
are just to the right of this like pull

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.850 
are just to the right of this like pull
just<00:03:08.340> like<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.450> it's<00:03:09.600> like<00:03:09.930> an<00:03:10.080> even<00:03:10.560> line

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
just like that so it's like an even line

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.380 
just like that so it's like an even line
you<00:03:11.400> don't<00:03:11.550> have<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.820> really<00:03:12.000> worry<00:03:12.150> about

you don't have to really worry about
your<00:03:12.870> right<00:03:13.710> and<00:03:13.920> left<00:03:13.980> crosshair<00:03:14.670> too<00:03:14.850> much

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
your right and left crosshair too much

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.940 
your right and left crosshair too much
just<00:03:15.390> make<00:03:15.780> sure<00:03:15.930> it's<00:03:16.080> lined<00:03:16.320> up<00:03:16.560> like<00:03:16.740> this

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
just make sure it's lined up like this

to push a bomb I mean you never know
there's<00:04:34.630> randoms<00:04:35.050> out<00:04:35.200> there<00:04:35.410> that'll<00:04:35.620> do<00:04:35.830> it

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
there's randoms out there that'll do it

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
but I mean most of the time is going to

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.980 
but I mean most of the time is going to
be<00:04:38.770> clear<00:04:39.160> you<00:04:39.730> can<00:04:40.120> go<00:04:40.240> right<00:04:40.570> into<00:04:40.750> this

corner like this just run right into it

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.480 
corner like this just run right into it
and<00:04:43.930> then<00:04:44.080> crouch<00:04:44.470> once<00:04:45.040> you've<00:04:45.190> done<00:04:45.430> that
