the long run on troubleshooting your
vehicle<00:00:34.640> alright<00:00:35.640> let's<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.030> look<00:00:36.329> at

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
vehicle alright let's have a look at

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.420 
vehicle alright let's have a look at
this<00:00:36.600> engine<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.230> fucking<00:00:37.680> VTEC<00:00:38.070> inch<00:00:38.250> is

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
this engine this fucking VTEC inch is

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.729 
this engine this fucking VTEC inch is
pretty<00:00:38.730> small<00:00:39.320> four-cylinder<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.440> hard<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
pretty small four-cylinder it's hard to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.520 
pretty small four-cylinder it's hard to
believe<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.120> an<00:00:42.120> engine<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.719> small<00:00:43.140> can

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
believe that an engine this small can

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.400 
believe that an engine this small can
fucking<00:00:43.890> propel<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> car<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:46.140> already

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
fucking propel a car so it's already

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.029 
fucking propel a car so it's already
half<00:00:46.590> stripped<00:00:46.950> apart<00:00:48.530> neighbor<00:00:49.530> had<00:00:49.829> his

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
half stripped apart neighbor had his

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.040 
half stripped apart neighbor had his
garage<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.879> gonna<00:00:51.030> scrap<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:51.930> he

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
garage was just gonna scrap it so he

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.260 
garage was just gonna scrap it so he
said<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> could<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.649> it

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
said I could have it

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.779 
said I could have it
so<00:00:54.350> it's<00:00:55.350> an<00:00:55.410> overhead<00:00:55.739> cam<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:56.489> camshaft

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
so it's an overhead cam to your camshaft

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.900 
so it's an overhead cam to your camshaft
up<00:00:57.480> top<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.190> bolted<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.760> or

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
up top here it's not bolted in or

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.060 
up top here it's not bolted in or
anything<00:01:00.210> anymore<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.050> I'm<00:01:01.530> gonna<00:01:01.649> pull<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
anything anymore so I'm gonna pull the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.369 
anything anymore so I'm gonna pull the
belt<00:01:02.309> off<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.660> we're<00:01:03.809> gonna<00:01:03.899> rip<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
belt off and then we're gonna rip the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.800 
belt off and then we're gonna rip the
head<00:01:04.559> off<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.979> her<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.400> mean<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.390> looking<00:01:06.720> at

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
head off of her I mean just looking at

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.510 
head off of her I mean just looking at
the<00:01:06.900> camshaft<00:01:07.470> itself<00:01:07.979> apparently<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the camshaft itself apparently the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.010 
the camshaft itself apparently the
engine<00:01:08.909> has<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> knock<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.740> most<00:01:11.100> likely<00:01:11.250> a

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
engine has a knock so it's most likely a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.420 
engine has a knock so it's most likely a
crankshaft<00:01:13.020> bearing<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.710> main<00:01:13.860> bearing<00:01:14.250> or

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
crankshaft bearing a main bearing or

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.219 
crankshaft bearing a main bearing or
something<00:01:14.760> far<00:01:15.090> maybe<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.570> piston<00:01:16.140> or

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
something far maybe a piston or

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.899 
something far maybe a piston or
something<00:01:16.530> screwed<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.460> anyways<00:01:17.670> look<00:01:17.820> at

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
something screwed up but anyways look at

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.359 
something screwed up but anyways look at
the<00:01:18.000> um<00:01:18.360> look<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.500> camshaft<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
the um look at the camshaft here the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.429 
the um look at the camshaft here the
camshaft<00:01:20.939> itself<00:01:21.450> some<00:01:21.720> pretty<00:01:21.930> good<00:01:22.140> shape

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
camshaft itself some pretty good shape

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.950 
camshaft itself some pretty good shape
still<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.759> mean<00:01:23.909> there's<00:01:24.090> no<00:01:24.240> parent<00:01:24.570> wearing

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
still you mean there's no parent wearing

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.920 
still you mean there's no parent wearing
or<00:01:25.080> scoring<00:01:26.390> doesn't<00:01:27.390> appear<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:27.780> any

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
or scoring doesn't appear to be any

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.140 
or scoring doesn't appear to be any
broken<00:01:28.229> springs<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> cylinder<00:01:29.520> head<00:01:29.549> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
broken springs in the cylinder head so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.999 
broken springs in the cylinder head so
let's<00:01:30.930> go<00:01:31.140> ahead<00:01:33.259> we're<00:01:34.259> gonna<00:01:34.439> take<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.829> head

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
let's go ahead we're gonna take the head

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.179 
let's go ahead we're gonna take the head
off<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> look<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> Pistons<00:01:40.189> so

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
off and have a look at the Pistons so

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.160 
off and have a look at the Pistons so
here's<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> reverse<00:01:41.790> side<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.509> head<00:01:42.720> four

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
here's the reverse side of the head four

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.760 
here's the reverse side of the head four
valves<00:01:43.680> per<00:01:43.740> cylinder<00:01:45.229> there's<00:01:46.229> quite<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> bit

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
valves per cylinder there's quite a bit

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.440 
valves per cylinder there's quite a bit
of<00:01:46.890> fricken<00:01:47.250> carbon<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.850> there<00:01:47.970> even<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
of fricken carbon and there even on the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.690 
of fricken carbon and there even on the
Pistons<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.829> quite<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> bit<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.520> fucking

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
Pistons it's quite a bit of fucking

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.179 
Pistons it's quite a bit of fucking
carbon<00:01:54.380> interesting<00:01:55.380> design<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
carbon interesting design for the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.590 
carbon interesting design for the
cooling<00:01:58.549> weight<00:01:59.549> goes<00:01:59.820> through<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.360> this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
cooling weight goes through like this

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.440 
cooling weight goes through like this
it's<00:02:00.960> all<00:02:01.110> open<00:02:01.350> water<00:02:01.770> goes<00:02:02.130> through<00:02:02.450> comes

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
it's all open water goes through comes

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.679 
it's all open water goes through comes

like<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.009> interesting<00:02:10.459> yeah<00:02:11.459> if<00:02:11.610> you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
like that it's interesting yeah if you

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.850 
like that it's interesting yeah if you
were<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.970> bust<00:02:12.270> your<00:02:12.480> fucking<00:02:12.840> cylinder<00:02:13.319> wall

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
were to bust your fucking cylinder wall

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.980 
were to bust your fucking cylinder wall
now<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.550> fill<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.060> up<00:02:15.120> full<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.480> coolant<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
now you fill it up full of coolant and

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.040 
now you fill it up full of coolant and
fucking<00:02:16.380> hydro<00:02:16.710> lock<00:02:16.920> pretty<00:02:17.340> darn<00:02:17.550> quick<00:02:18.050> all

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
fucking hydro lock pretty darn quick all

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.540 
fucking hydro lock pretty darn quick all
right<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.410> now<00:02:19.500> we've<00:02:19.650> got<00:02:19.770> two<00:02:19.920> Honda<00:02:20.220> VTEC

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
right so now we've got two Honda VTEC

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.820 
right so now we've got two Honda VTEC
engine<00:02:20.610> flipped<00:02:21.240> upside<00:02:21.660> down<00:02:21.690> we're<00:02:22.650> going

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
engine flipped upside down we're going

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.550 
engine flipped upside down we're going
to<00:02:22.890> remove<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.520> oil<00:02:23.550> pan<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.660> that's<00:02:25.380> going

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
to remove the oil pan and that's going

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.590 
to remove the oil pan and that's going
to<00:02:25.650> expose<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.340> crankshaft<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.240> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
to expose the crankshaft and the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.150 
to expose the crankshaft and the
connecting<00:02:28.050> rods<00:02:29.360> all<00:02:30.360> right<00:02:30.630> here's<00:02:30.960> the

your oil pump strainer from your sump

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.040 
your oil pump strainer from your sump
ill<00:02:37.170> suck<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.680> up<00:02:38.090> pump<00:02:39.090> up<00:02:39.300> be<00:02:39.450> right<00:02:39.750> inside

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
ill suck it up pump up be right inside

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.870 
ill suck it up pump up be right inside
here<00:02:40.080> pump<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.890> throw<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.160> all<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> journals

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
here pump it throw it all the journals

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.630 
here pump it throw it all the journals
and<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.180> bearings

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
and the bearings

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.580 
and the bearings
this<00:02:44.640> would<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:44.880> your<00:02:45.000> crankcase<00:02:45.570> cage<00:02:45.960> here

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
this would be your crankcase cage here

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.040 
this would be your crankcase cage here
and<00:02:47.100> between<00:02:48.060> every<00:02:48.300> bolts<00:02:48.750> here<00:02:48.840> there

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
and between every bolts here there

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.180 
and between every bolts here there
should<00:02:49.230> be<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> bearing<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:52.620> piece<00:02:52.890> here

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
should be a bearing and this piece here

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.730 
should be a bearing and this piece here
is<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.580> keep<00:02:54.300> your<00:02:54.480> crankshaft<00:02:54.990> in<00:02:55.200> place<00:02:55.410> keep

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
is to keep your crankshaft in place keep

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.900 
is to keep your crankshaft in place keep
it<00:02:55.920> straight<00:02:56.310> keep<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:57.150> from<00:02:57.360> bending<00:02:58.910> gives

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
it straight keep it from bending gives

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.820 
it straight keep it from bending gives
the<00:03:00.180> engine<00:03:00.360> integrity<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.230> strength<00:03:01.470> so

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
the engine integrity and strength so

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.980 
the engine integrity and strength so
let's<00:03:02.070> rip<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.310> bitch<00:03:02.700> apart<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.450> fucking

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
let's rip this bitch apart and fucking

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.790 
let's rip this bitch apart and fucking
let's<00:03:04.140> see<00:03:04.350> what<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.860> bearings<00:03:05.250> look<00:03:05.430> like

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
let's see what the bearings look like

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.199 
let's see what the bearings look like
all<00:03:07.800> right<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.130> remove<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.610> piece<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:08.970> can

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
all right so I remove this piece you can

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.240 
all right so I remove this piece you can
look<00:03:09.540> at<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.870> bearing<00:03:10.230> journals<00:03:10.470> right<00:03:10.860> here

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
look at the bearing journals right here

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.720 
look at the bearing journals right here
and<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.850> can<00:03:11.970> just<00:03:12.030> see<00:03:12.950> like<00:03:13.950> how<00:03:14.160> if<00:03:14.280> scored

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
and you can just see like how if scored

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.910 
and you can just see like how if scored
they<00:03:14.910> are<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.750> it's<00:03:15.900> no<00:03:16.050> wonder<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.560> engine

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
they are so it's no wonder the engine

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.940 
they are so it's no wonder the engine
was<00:03:17.070> knocking<00:03:17.870> these<00:03:18.870> crankshaft<00:03:19.500> bearings

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
was knocking these crankshaft bearings

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.320 
was knocking these crankshaft bearings
have<00:03:20.280> shit<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.970> fucking<00:03:21.420> bed<00:03:23.060> could<00:03:24.060> see<00:03:24.209> and

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
have shit the fucking bed could see and

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.030 
have shit the fucking bed could see and
the<00:03:24.390> crankshaft<00:03:24.750> itself<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.650> evidence

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
the crankshaft itself the evidence

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.449 
the crankshaft itself the evidence
speaks<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:26.670> itself<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:28.170> fucking<00:03:28.680> crank<00:03:29.070> has

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
speaks for itself the fucking crank has

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.870 
speaks for itself the fucking crank has
some<00:03:29.790> severe<00:03:30.330> wear<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:31.350> now<00:03:31.500> we're<00:03:31.680> gonna<00:03:31.880> it's

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
some severe wear so now we're gonna it's

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.509 
some severe wear so now we're gonna it's
not<00:03:32.910> gonna<00:03:33.180> remove<00:03:33.480> all<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:34.250> bearing<00:03:35.250> caps

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
not gonna remove all the bearing caps

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.759 
not gonna remove all the bearing caps
we're<00:03:36.120> gonna<00:03:36.239> pull<00:03:36.480> those<00:03:36.660> off<00:03:36.930> then<00:03:37.650> we're

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
we're gonna pull those off then we're

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.710 
we're gonna pull those off then we're
gonna<00:03:37.860> separate<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.670> oil<00:03:39.060> pump<00:03:39.480> from<00:03:39.660> the

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
gonna separate the oil pump from the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.160 
gonna separate the oil pump from the
front<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:41.430> then<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.880> think<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.180> back<00:03:42.450> might

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
front and then I think the back might

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.380 
front and then I think the back might
separate<00:03:43.800> to<00:03:44.070> we're<00:03:44.790> going<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.000> figure<00:03:45.180> that

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
separate to we're going to figure that

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.790 
separate to we're going to figure that
out<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.900> we're<00:03:45.989> gonna<00:03:46.080> rip<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.440> crankshaft

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
out and we're gonna rip the crankshaft

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.940 
out and we're gonna rip the crankshaft
oh<00:03:47.870> all<00:03:48.870> right<00:03:49.110> here's<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.410> oil<00:03:49.500> pump

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
oh all right here's the oil pump

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.080 
oh all right here's the oil pump
assembly<00:03:51.290> once<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.470> remove<00:03:52.890> all<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.670> bolts

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
assembly once you remove all the bolts

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.170 
assembly once you remove all the bolts
from<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.390> outside<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.290> can<00:03:56.190> pull<00:03:56.430> off<00:03:56.850> the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
from the outside you can pull off the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.660 
from the outside you can pull off the
pulley<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.840> front<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.500> just<00:03:59.220> used<00:03:59.610> to

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
pulley on the front I just used to

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.280 
pulley on the front I just used to
hammer<00:03:59.940> beat<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.450> till<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.720> came<00:04:00.900> off<00:04:01.110> because

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
hammer beat it till it came off because

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.800 
hammer beat it till it came off because
this<00:04:01.470> engine<00:04:01.650> scrap<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.550> think<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.239> might<00:04:03.510> take

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
this engine scrap I think I might take

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.199 
this engine scrap I think I might take
apart<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.890> as<00:04:05.160> well<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.640> have<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.760> look<00:04:05.940> at<00:04:06.120> the

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
apart that as well to have a look at the

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.390 
apart that as well to have a look at the
oil<00:04:06.239> pump<00:04:06.540> inside<00:04:07.190> apparently<00:04:08.190> there's<00:04:08.340> still

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
oil pump inside apparently there's still

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.430 
oil pump inside apparently there's still
some<00:04:08.670> oil<00:04:08.880> in<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.180> engine<00:04:09.209> fuck<00:04:09.959> me<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.260> got<00:04:10.410> a

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.520 
the backside to get this crank oh holy
shit<00:04:18.030> I've<00:04:18.150> never<00:04:18.359> worked<00:04:18.600> on<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.870> Honda<00:04:19.260> engine

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
shit I've never worked on a Honda engine

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.939 
shit I've never worked on a Honda engine
before<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:20.130> fuck<00:04:20.370> that's<00:04:20.580> the<00:04:20.760> water<00:04:20.970> pump

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
before but fuck that's the water pump

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.219 
before but fuck that's the water pump
I<00:04:21.979> can<00:04:22.639> see<00:04:22.819> if<00:04:22.909> your<00:04:23.090> water<00:04:23.419> pump<00:04:23.689> ever<00:04:23.960> went

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
I can see if your water pump ever went

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.890 
I can see if your water pump ever went
that'd<00:04:24.499> be<00:04:24.620> pretty<00:04:24.800> costly<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.900> fucking

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
that'd be pretty costly to fucking

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.869 
that'd be pretty costly to fucking
change<00:04:26.930> out<00:04:27.409> but<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.800> impellers<00:04:28.129> metal<00:04:28.729> so

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:28.879 
change out but the impellers metal so

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.839 
change out but the impellers metal so
that's<00:04:29.060> good<00:04:29.419> it's<00:04:30.050> got<00:04:30.199> a<00:04:30.259> seal<00:04:30.849> basically

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
that's good it's got a seal basically

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.100 
that's good it's got a seal basically
the<00:04:31.999> only<00:04:32.090> thing<00:04:32.300> that's<00:04:32.479> going<00:04:32.629> to<00:04:32.659> wear<00:04:32.900> out

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
the only thing that's going to wear out

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.360 
the only thing that's going to wear out
is<00:04:33.409> your<00:04:35.289> bearing<00:04:36.289> and<00:04:36.650> probably<00:04:37.249> got<00:04:37.340> a

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
is your bearing and probably got a

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.980 
is your bearing and probably got a
mechanical<00:04:37.999> seal<00:04:38.270> in<00:04:38.479> there<00:04:38.659> as<00:04:38.810> well

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
mechanical seal in there as well

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.260 
mechanical seal in there as well
otherwise<00:04:39.979> water<00:04:40.340> pump<00:04:40.610> should<00:04:40.789> last<00:04:40.939> a<00:04:41.120> long

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
otherwise water pump should last a long

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.809 
otherwise water pump should last a long
time<00:04:41.300> but<00:04:42.370> interesting<00:04:45.279> all<00:04:46.279> right<00:04:46.310> so<00:04:46.639> now

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
time but interesting all right so now

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.850 
time but interesting all right so now

they tipped it off I remove these four

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.159 
they tipped it off I remove these four
bolts<00:04:49.069> here<00:04:49.550> I<00:04:49.729> should<00:04:50.449> be<00:04:50.569> able<00:04:50.629> to<00:04:50.779> smash

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169

the bitch right there that caused the

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.879

her<00:06:06.439> tick<00:06:07.629> so<00:06:08.629> your<00:06:08.750> oil<00:06:08.779> sub<00:06:09.319> comes<00:06:09.620> in<00:06:09.830> here

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:10.189 
her tick so your oil sub comes in here

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:12.249 
her tick so your oil sub comes in here
as<00:06:10.370> the<00:06:10.729> positive<00:06:11.270> displacement<00:06:11.870> pump<00:06:12.110> is

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
as the positive displacement pump is

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.920 
as the positive displacement pump is
turning<00:06:12.819> this<00:06:13.819> guy<00:06:14.060> start<00:06:14.360> opening<00:06:14.810> it's

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
turning this guy start opening it's

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.839 
turning this guy start opening it's
gonna<00:06:15.110> start<00:06:15.349> sucking<00:06:15.889> the<00:06:16.009> oil<00:06:16.219> and<00:06:16.610> as<00:06:16.729> it

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
gonna start sucking the oil and as it

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.279 
gonna start sucking the oil and as it
travels<00:06:17.240> through<00:06:17.300> the<00:06:17.449> oil<00:06:17.599> is<00:06:17.960> going<00:06:18.050> to<00:06:18.169> go

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
travels through the oil is going to go

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.279 
travels through the oil is going to go
into<00:06:18.529> these<00:06:18.649> cavities<00:06:18.949> here<00:06:19.550> and<00:06:19.839> then<00:06:20.839> as

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
into these cavities here and then as

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.579 
into these cavities here and then as
these<00:06:21.889> start<00:06:22.339> to<00:06:22.490> close<00:06:22.729> up<00:06:23.089> it<00:06:23.629> pushes<00:06:24.409> the

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:24.589 
these start to close up it pushes the

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:26.619 
these start to close up it pushes the
oil<00:06:24.620> through<00:06:25.460> and<00:06:25.729> that's<00:06:25.879> how<00:06:26.149> it<00:06:26.270> gets<00:06:26.419> its

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:26.629 
oil through and that's how it gets its

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:28.480 
oil through and that's how it gets its
pressure<00:06:27.020> this<00:06:27.229> is<00:06:27.349> a<00:06:27.379> positive<00:06:27.740> displacement

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
pressure this is a positive displacement

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.449 
pressure this is a positive displacement
pump<00:06:29.210> so<00:06:29.959> if<00:06:30.080> you<00:06:30.229> ran<00:06:30.500> it<00:06:30.709> with<00:06:30.830> no<00:06:31.009> oil

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:31.459 
pump so if you ran it with no oil

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:33.670 
pump so if you ran it with no oil
it<00:06:31.969> only<00:06:32.180> take<00:06:32.479> a<00:06:32.509> matter<00:06:32.839> of<00:06:32.990> seconds<00:06:33.529> to

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
it only take a matter of seconds to

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.600 
it only take a matter of seconds to
destroy<00:06:33.889> this

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
destroy this

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.300 
destroy this
up<00:06:34.699> not<00:06:35.629> only<00:06:35.930> see<00:06:36.139> these<00:06:36.289> pumps<00:06:36.710> and<00:06:36.860> gasoline

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
up not only see these pumps and gasoline

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.659 
up not only see these pumps and gasoline
or<00:06:37.550> diesel<00:06:37.580> engines<00:06:38.240> but<00:06:39.039> hydraulic<00:06:40.039> pumps<00:06:40.460> a

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
or diesel engines but hydraulic pumps a

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:43.779 
or diesel engines but hydraulic pumps a
lot<00:06:41.180> of<00:06:41.300> hydraulic<00:06:41.810> pumps<00:06:42.259> are<00:06:42.469> the<00:06:43.129> same<00:06:43.400> set

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
lot of hydraulic pumps are the same set

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.140 
lot of hydraulic pumps are the same set
up<00:06:43.969> just<00:06:44.150> larger<00:06:44.659> version<00:06:45.939> pause<00:06:46.939> the

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
up just larger version pause the
