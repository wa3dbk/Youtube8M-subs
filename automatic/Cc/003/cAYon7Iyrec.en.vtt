 alone as always to be champions for 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.999
 supposed that they think the 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.040
 seven other teams but we're going to 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.320
 show that they are the best invited to 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.700
 the fans especially the lions 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.310

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.110
 championship at the highest level we have done 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.510
 all a great effort to overcome 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.610
 some problems that you know and 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.500
 I am sure that we will have a 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.970
 extraordinary tournament despite everything 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.950
 that has happened there is a new face of 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.080
 sharks because for the first time in the 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.040
 last years we are not going to start this 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.810
 organization is not going to start 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.340
 depending on the big leagues there 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.840
 let's start depending on figures 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.010
 as gregor blanco hÃ©ctor sanchez 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.110
 salvador perez 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.820
 On the contrary, we conclude that 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.500
 come the moment give the opportunity to 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.119
 a series of names that already begins to 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.170
 double or triple to but that maybe they are not 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.570
 so well known in the league 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.759
 they already have the maturity to jump and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.299
 fight for a position to regulate the 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.159
 message 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.049
 for amateurs sharks it's clear 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.770
 I know it's been many years without winning 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.970
 Title 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.259
 I know there is some way 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.420
 Despair for winning a championship 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.060
 for you have to take things little to 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.070
 little we can not get to the first day of 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.049
 season already thinking that we are going to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.490
 to make champion is to try to achieve this 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.630
 championship number 21 that the fanaticada 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.030
 so much is longing for 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.689
 the league as always is a league of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.700
 a lot of talent a lot of experience 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.229
 many young boys learned in 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.289
 a mix that's why the league is 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.270

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.560

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.799

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.340
