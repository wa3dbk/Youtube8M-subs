 video titles will always be like this 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.439
 My opinion on this thing of mine 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.810
 opinion on this or that I never 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.470

 keep doing this kind of thing I go 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.830
 always bring my opinion about that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.259
 thing understood understood beauty there 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.979
 Come on, I'm going to tell you guys today. 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.939
 the postponement is the various postponements there 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.420
 gta 5 for pc beauty wins everybody 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.030
 there waiting in expectation and the gps 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.060
 to win again to conquer 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.270
 Day now that it was planned is not for 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.380
 March 23 was 23 or March 24 in 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.280
 now is the time 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.140
 but has now postponed to April 15 the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.619
 face is always being like this always 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.479
 is delaying and in one year I do not know why 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.670
 she puts the date she would not be so 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.950
 easier so look in the second 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.219
 semester I do not know there in the third 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.509
 I do not know if it would not be 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.390
 easier it does not speak to date 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.090
 it would be much easier because it causes 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.290
 a lot of expectations and I have do I change the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.329
 theory 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.250
 about that, Italy will now move on to 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.500
 You will share with you I 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.790
 I also want you to leave the theory 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.920
 of you guys 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.099
 so come on I have two things 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.000
 here can be beauty two things the most 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.250
 Obvious is what always speaks to us 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.989
 is that the game is being polluted that the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.930
 game is still being used for 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.840
 Ralph on pc not to screw up 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.510
 they did by launching gta4 abc that was 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.709
 very poorly used game needed a 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.709
 pc type that indicates stick is of the 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.290
 delegate to be able to stop still 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.730
 still managed very well with the foot with the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.209
 legal performance as well 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.189
 so this is it people are and can can 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.349
 be the beauty that's where she is 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:05.609
 optimizing tap can be 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:08.400
 It's more than a month, it's not like 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.200
 My blog title in my opinion is 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.349
 the next we'll see if you agree 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.599
 with me or disagree and why beauty is 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.359
 My opinion is that it is not like this 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.690
 I know if you know but here it is is very 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.849
 famous for being a very 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:28.650
 controversy of the galley very controversial thus 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:31.530
 9 on issues that are very well is 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.629
 difficult to deal with in the media is 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.150
 against him, neither the first nor the 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.250
 back there was a game as soon as it was 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.829
 prohibited in several countries because it had 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.750
 too much movement in blood violence 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.129
 one thing the games still had not 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.699
 pretty so do not 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:50.489
 and then gta began to be controversial for 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:53.310
 cause of this and with the controversial galera comes 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.769
 self-disclosure of fame and 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.180
 success comes behind the controversy are 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.049
 thinking that they do not think that it is 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.620
 maude talk to someone to study this gives 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.079
 A lot of percussion, it's a lot of people. 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.419
 repercussion and that's what I think 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.989
 may be happening is when people 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:16.799
 I was there and postponed to 23 in the gym. 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:20.070
 the area now days 13 to 15 April arms 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.880
 while January 2006 whenever she 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.730
 It's the day she 's causing repercussions. 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.640
 It's being said, understood. 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.130
 this subject promoting you have understood 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.650
 That's when I told you to see if the game 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.270
 launch in the first sentence that they 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.160
 they were going to launch in January 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.540
 You go there and launch January that the 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.190
 people killed it ended 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.480
 Is everyone waiting for it, is it over? 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.640
 The whole gta line ends and ends up 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.580
 everybody hope such a release 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.730
 to win then throw herself if she 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.880
 arrived on the 23rd to launch it just hit 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:00.240
 closed your understanding will stop talking 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.910
 from over so that way so great 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.310
 about gta is everyone talking about doing 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.890
 review awaits the game that will become this 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.710
 game that 's finally snow in sgt a 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.530
 pc will not stop talking will not 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.180
 participating in talking always understood the 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.940
 game is very famous in following almost 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.740
 I always have to talk about the game but the 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.360
 issue is a very important thing. 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.820
 great 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.460
 understanding then every time that day 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.820
 She's right promoting her. 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.270
 blogs and people who make them dream have stopped 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.250
 the DJ for example every time the day he 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.960
 go there and make a video with the 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.100
 views do not have this video 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.620
 already for psb out the dj how many more 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.590
 youtube they talk there of the evaluations that 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.350
 they know that fox is right 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.170
 the play blood talks to give day off the 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.050
 Greek clubs that are not gigantic 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.900
 much larger than the YouTube en 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.450
 then it causes repercussion then this 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.220
 My theory, I do not know if you agree. 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:06.360
 This is my opinion, the beauty guys. 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.180
 So I explained more or less what I 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.980
 I thought about this theory and only that you 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.890
 Have you liked this video, guys? 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.870
 I want you to eat when you think 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.180
 I'm still getting the morning to log 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.040
 so relax that the next ones will be 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:25.920
 The best guys are in slow motion. 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:28.350
 bonus strip is no slack either 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.360
 but I have too much work are living 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.330
 that hear me also advanced 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.460
 with her own audio and it would be cool if 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.009
 give feedback also to connect 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.900
 image and digital audio 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.330
 It's the second time I 've been doing. 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.020
 So I'm still adapting to it. 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.789
 so this is it 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.580
 without further ado not finalizing the video 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:51.499
 A big hug to all of you. 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.499
 Okay, he said and went
