00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
longer the shaft the more it cools the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.569 
longer the shaft the more it cools the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
smart idea I came up with this to add

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.330 
smart idea I came up with this to add
this<00:01:05.460> high<00:01:06.000> friction<00:01:06.299> non-skid<00:01:07.140> pad<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.979> top

this high friction non-skid pad on top

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.730 
this high friction non-skid pad on top
which<00:01:09.240> keeps<00:01:09.840> your<00:01:09.960> material<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.619> get

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
which keeps your material can get

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.679 
which keeps your material can get
damaged<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.760> horses<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.450> stops

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
damaged but it's all horses and it stops

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.539 
damaged but it's all horses and it stops
it<00:01:12.840> from<00:01:12.990> sliding<00:01:13.229> around<00:01:13.500> when<00:01:14.400> you're

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
it from sliding around when you're

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
dead from smoking my other one for years

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.630 
dead from smoking my other one for years
now<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.530> nice<00:01:49.530> hardwood<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.220> easy<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.520> work

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
now and nice hardwood it's easy to work

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.179 
now and nice hardwood it's easy to work
with<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.240> beautiful<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.110> use<00:01:52.799> cherry

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
with and it's beautiful so I use cherry

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.859 
with and it's beautiful so I use cherry
you<00:01:53.939> might<00:01:54.090> use<00:01:54.240> something<00:01:54.570> else

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
you might use something else

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.719 
you might use something else
maple<00:01:55.350> I've<00:01:55.649> also<00:01:55.829> made<00:01:56.040> pipes<00:01:56.310> out<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.579> maple

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
maple I've also made pipes out of maple

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.959 
maple I've also made pipes out of maple
that<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.630> works<00:01:57.810> fine<00:01:58.049> too<00:01:58.520> but<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.579> I

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
that that works fine too but I I

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.600 
that that works fine too but I I
personally<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:01.020> cherry<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.560> start<00:02:02.399> with<00:02:02.520> an

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
personally like cherry so start with an

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.359 
personally like cherry so start with an
inch<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.909> quarter<00:02:03.119> square<00:02:03.329> piece<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> cherry

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
inch of quarter square piece of cherry

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.709 
inch of quarter square piece of cherry
now<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> tricky<00:02:05.729> part<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.030> drilling<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.570> hole

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
now the tricky part is drilling the hole

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.650 
now the tricky part is drilling the hole
that's<00:02:07.140> kind<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:09.030> whole<00:02:09.209> trick<00:02:09.629> to

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
that's kind of the the whole trick to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.630 
that's kind of the the whole trick to
this<00:02:09.929> whole<00:02:10.110> project<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.950> drilling<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> hole

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
this whole project is drilling the hole

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.430 
this whole project is drilling the hole
now<00:02:11.849> what<00:02:12.090> I'm<00:02:12.209> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.390> try<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:12.810> do

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
now what I'm going to try and do

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.720 
now what I'm going to try and do
use<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.580> 1/8<00:02:15.390> ship<00:02:15.990> auger<00:02:16.440> bit<00:02:16.680> about<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> foot

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
use this 1/8 ship auger bit about a foot

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.580 
use this 1/8 ship auger bit about a foot
long<00:02:17.760> which<00:02:18.300> isn't<00:02:18.480> quite<00:02:18.870> long<00:02:19.140> enough<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.470> go

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
long which isn't quite long enough to go

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.840 
long which isn't quite long enough to go
the<00:02:19.740> way<00:02:19.830> all<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.250> way<00:02:20.340> through<00:02:20.640> but

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
the way all the way through but

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.910 
the way all the way through but
hopefully<00:02:21.780> it'll<00:02:21.930> give<00:02:22.140> me<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> straight<00:02:22.650> hole

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
hopefully it'll give me a straight hole

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.830 
hopefully it'll give me a straight hole
for<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.340> first<00:02:23.550> foot<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.180> then<00:02:24.630> I'm<00:02:24.690> going<00:02:24.810> to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
for the first foot and then I'm going to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.750 
for the first foot and then I'm going to
switch<00:02:25.110> over<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.680> which<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.370> just<00:02:26.640> my

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
switch over to this which is just my

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.230 
switch over to this which is just my
MacGyver<00:02:28.010> five-gallon<00:02:29.010> bucket<00:02:29.490> handle<00:02:30.000> I

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
MacGyver five-gallon bucket handle I

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.750 
MacGyver five-gallon bucket handle I
just<00:02:31.050> bent<00:02:31.320> off<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.770> bucket<00:02:32.190> flattened<00:02:32.700> it

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
just bent off of a bucket flattened it

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.300 
just bent off of a bucket flattened it
out<00:02:32.880> ground<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.630> little<00:02:33.750> chisel<00:02:34.740> tip<00:02:34.950> on<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
out ground a little chisel tip on the

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.910 
out ground a little chisel tip on the
end<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.870> will<00:02:36.870> hopefully<00:02:37.020> follow<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
end and that will hopefully follow the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.740 
end and that will hopefully follow the
straight<00:02:38.490> hole<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.000> did<00:02:39.240> with<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.510> drill

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
straight hole that I did with the drill

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.980 
straight hole that I did with the drill
bit<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.140> then<00:02:40.320> finish<00:02:40.890> me<00:02:41.070> off<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.550> last

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
bit and then finish me off the last

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.060 
bit and then finish me off the last
three<00:02:42.990> or<00:02:43.140> four<00:02:43.320> inches<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.710> I'll<00:02:43.860> need

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
three or four inches that I'll need

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.600 
three or four inches that I'll need
without<00:02:44.400> going<00:02:45.270> too<00:02:45.720> far<00:02:45.930> off<00:02:46.110> center<00:02:46.470> so

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
without going too far off center so

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.410 
without going too far off center so
let's<00:02:47.610> give<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.970> shot<00:02:49.940> all<00:02:50.940> right<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.300> my

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
let's give it a shot all right so my

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.290 
let's give it a shot all right so my
first<00:02:51.600> attempt<00:02:52.020> was<00:02:52.290> not<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.710> success<00:02:53.370> that

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
first attempt was not a success that

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.130 
first attempt was not a success that
gives<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.930> any<00:02:55.140> encouragement<00:02:55.530> yeah<00:02:57.140> the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
gives you any encouragement yeah the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.990 
gives you any encouragement yeah the
green<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.710> moving<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.160> little<00:02:59.310> bit<00:02:59.490> along<00:02:59.850> this

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
green is moving a little bit along this

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.540 
green is moving a little bit along this
would<00:03:00.590> kind<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.710> got<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.860> twist<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.340> so

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
would kind of got a twist in it so

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.160 
would kind of got a twist in it so
hopefully<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.060> won't<00:03:03.240> run<00:03:03.420> my<00:03:03.570> bit<00:03:03.780> too<00:03:03.960> far

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
hopefully that won't run my bit too far

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:19.580 
hopefully that won't run my bit too far
off<00:03:04.380> I'll<00:03:04.590> try<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.060> do<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.210> one<00:03:06.450> straight

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.679 

you

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:24.689 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.610 

all<00:03:25.689> right<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.249> drove<00:03:27.249> my<00:03:27.370> end<00:03:27.549> hole<00:03:28.469> went<00:03:29.469> down

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
all right so drove my end hole went down

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.319 
all right so drove my end hole went down
with<00:03:29.739> five-eighths<00:03:30.159> Fortuner<00:03:30.670> met<00:03:30.999> the<00:03:31.150> hole

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
with five-eighths Fortuner met the hole

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.119 
with five-eighths Fortuner met the hole
turned<00:03:31.749> out<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.019> be<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.200> little<00:03:32.829> bit<00:03:32.920> on<00:03:33.010> the

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
turned out to be a little bit on the

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.160 
turned out to be a little bit on the
side<00:03:33.370> of<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.760> hole<00:03:33.939> but<00:03:34.389> it<00:03:34.599> still<00:03:34.989> works

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
side of the hole but it still works

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.670 
side of the hole but it still works
great<00:03:36.450> run<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.540> drill<00:03:37.780> bit<00:03:37.959> through<00:03:38.200> three<00:03:38.650> or

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
great run the drill bit through three or

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.199 
great run the drill bit through three or
four<00:03:38.769> more<00:03:39.040> times<00:03:39.250> just<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.730> clean<00:03:39.939> out<00:03:40.090> the

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
four more times just to clean out the

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:47.789 
four more times just to clean out the
hole<00:03:45.689> the<00:03:46.689> next<00:03:46.719> part<00:03:47.139> after<00:03:47.409> you've<00:03:47.530> made<00:03:47.620> the

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
hole the next part after you've made the

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.170 
hole the next part after you've made the
shaft<00:03:48.069> is<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.760> cut<00:03:49.120> out<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.419> bowls<00:03:49.629> now

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.119 

you<00:03:52.599> might<00:03:52.780> as<00:03:52.870> well<00:03:52.930> cut<00:03:53.230> out<00:03:53.379> too<00:03:53.680> because

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
you might as well cut out too because

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.820 
you might as well cut out too because
eventually<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.970> will<00:03:55.209> wear<00:03:55.569> wear<00:03:56.409> one<00:03:56.650> out

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
eventually you will wear wear one out

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.199 
eventually you will wear wear one out
you'll<00:03:57.069> burn<00:03:57.250> through<00:03:57.610> it<00:03:57.640> or<00:03:58.440> it'll<00:03:59.440> just<00:03:59.650> get

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
you'll burn through it or it'll just get

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.360 
you'll burn through it or it'll just get
