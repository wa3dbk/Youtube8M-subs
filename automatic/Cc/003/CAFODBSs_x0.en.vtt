does you won't stop it the idea is to

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.149 
does you won't stop it the idea is to
stop<00:01:14.570> it<00:01:14.600> with<00:01:14.870> preventative<00:01:15.530> maintenance<00:01:15.740> as

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
stop it with preventative maintenance as

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.130 
stop it with preventative maintenance as
opposed<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.850> trying<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:17.330> stop<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.630> once<00:01:17.960> it

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
opposed to trying to stop it once it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.160 
opposed to trying to stop it once it
starts<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:19.370> how<00:01:19.940> do<00:01:20.000> we<00:01:20.090> prevent<00:01:20.510> it<00:01:20.690> firstly

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.720 
is is giving me an extra line of defense
against<00:02:04.790> corrosion<00:02:05.950> once<00:02:06.950> that's<00:02:07.190> done<00:02:07.400> you

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
against corrosion once that's done you

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.309 
against corrosion once that's done you
can<00:02:07.760> place<00:02:08.060> your<00:02:08.239> backing<00:02:08.420> on<00:02:08.690> make<00:02:08.989> sure<00:02:09.019> you

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
can place your backing on make sure you

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.020 
can place your backing on make sure you
lock<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.709> other<00:02:09.890> knot<00:02:10.190> down<00:02:10.369> very<00:02:10.670> firmly

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
lock that other knot down very firmly

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.839 
lock that other knot down very firmly
and<00:02:11.360> also<00:02:11.930> make<00:02:12.349> sure<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.519> backing

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
and also make sure that the backing

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.180 
and also make sure that the backing
doesn't<00:02:14.180> slip<00:02:14.450> on<00:02:14.599> that<00:02:14.660> waxy<00:02:15.410> surface<00:02:15.620> that's

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
doesn't slip on that waxy surface that's

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.400 
doesn't slip on that waxy surface that's
the<00:02:16.340> only<00:02:16.970> negative<00:02:17.180> with<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.660> wax<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.200> can

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the only negative with the wax is it can

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.080 
the only negative with the wax is it can
create<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.860> slippery<00:02:19.250> surface<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:19.819> make<00:02:20.060> sure

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
create a slippery surface so make sure

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.699 
create a slippery surface so make sure

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
manufacturers is the ability to firstly

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.509 
manufacturers is the ability to firstly
quickly<00:03:00.030> remove<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.389> spool<00:03:00.870> but<00:03:01.260> also<00:03:01.519> to

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
quickly remove the spool but also to

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.330 
quickly remove the spool but also to
soak<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:03.090> spool<00:03:03.590> for<00:03:04.590> as<00:03:04.650> long<00:03:04.799> as<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.099> need

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
soak the spool for as long as you need

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.490 
soak the spool for as long as you need
to<00:03:05.609> after<00:03:05.939> you've<00:03:06.510> been<00:03:06.689> fishing<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.379> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
to after you've been fishing and the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.149 
to after you've been fishing and the
reason<00:03:07.859> being<00:03:08.040> there's<00:03:09.030> no<00:03:09.180> moving<00:03:09.959> parts<00:03:10.439> or

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
reason being there's no moving parts or

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.220 
reason being there's no moving parts or
bearings<00:03:11.790> or<00:03:12.030> anything<00:03:12.389> in<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.659> spool<00:03:12.930> it's

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
bearings or anything in the spool it's

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.470 
bearings or anything in the spool it's
just<00:03:13.650> basically<00:03:14.099> a<00:03:14.250> spool<00:03:14.639> with<00:03:14.909> a<00:03:14.939> handle<00:03:15.359> on

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
just basically a spool with a handle on

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.770 
just basically a spool with a handle on
it

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
it

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.890 
it
so<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.470> soak<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:17.040> overnight<00:03:17.659> I'm<00:03:18.659> not

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
so if I soak that overnight I'm not

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.179 
so if I soak that overnight I'm not
going<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.109> have<00:03:19.200> any<00:03:19.349> issues<00:03:19.530> with<00:03:19.980> water

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:20.189 
going to have any issues with water

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:22.399 
going to have any issues with water
ingressing<00:03:20.939> into<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.389> mechanical<00:03:21.959> working

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
ingressing into the mechanical working

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.369 
ingressing into the mechanical working
parts<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.040> reel<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.480> makes<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.109> a<00:03:25.230> lot

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
parts of the reel so it makes it a lot

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.679 
parts of the reel so it makes it a lot
easier<00:03:25.439> to<00:03:25.859> get<00:03:26.250> salt<00:03:26.639> out<00:03:26.879> of<00:03:26.939> that<00:03:27.389> backing

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
easier to get salt out of that backing

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.939 
easier to get salt out of that backing
and<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.620> basically<00:03:29.810> maintain<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.379> reel<00:03:31.650> I

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
and and to basically maintain the reel I

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.009 
and and to basically maintain the reel I
just<00:03:32.549> soaked<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.790> overnight<00:03:33.030> or<00:03:33.629> even<00:03:33.690> a

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
just soaked it overnight or even a

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.990 
just soaked it overnight or even a
couple<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.409> nights<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.859> then<00:03:35.400> put<00:03:35.639> it<00:03:35.729> out<00:03:35.879> in

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
couple of nights and then put it out in

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.210 
couple of nights and then put it out in
the<00:03:36.090> Sun<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.449> dry<00:03:36.479> the<00:03:37.349> main<00:03:37.530> body<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:37.919> the<00:03:38.010> reel

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
the Sun to dry the main body of the reel

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.199 
the Sun to dry the main body of the reel
is<00:03:38.250> waterproof<00:03:39.000> but<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.359> would<00:03:39.510> never<00:03:39.780> stick<00:03:40.229> a

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.170 
is waterproof but I would never stick a
moving<00:03:42.290> part<00:03:43.290> like<00:03:43.889> a<00:03:43.919> mechanical<00:03:44.669> part<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.090> a

rinse with the drag locked-up place it

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.140 
rinse with the drag locked-up place it
