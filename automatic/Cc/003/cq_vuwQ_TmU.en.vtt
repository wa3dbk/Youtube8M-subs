shit i went ahead and bought two and uh
yeah<00:03:39.440> man<00:03:39.880> five<00:03:40.880> calories<00:03:41.269> a<00:03:41.480> serving<00:03:41.660> I<00:03:42.019> guess

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
yeah man five calories a serving I guess

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.460 
yeah man five calories a serving I guess
this<00:03:42.950> has<00:03:43.160> zero<00:03:43.549> fat<00:03:43.910> zero<00:03:44.660> called<00:03:44.989> in<00:03:45.170> zero

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
this has zero fat zero called in zero

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.860 
this has zero fat zero called in zero
protein<00:03:45.980> but<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.579> still<00:03:46.850> has<00:03:47.060> five<00:03:47.420> calories

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
protein but it still has five calories

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.890 
protein but it still has five calories
of<00:03:48.230> serving<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:48.829> believe<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:50.120> comes<00:03:50.720> from<00:03:50.810> the

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
of serving I believe it comes from the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.390 
of serving I believe it comes from the
dextrose<00:03:51.560> because<00:03:51.980> it<00:03:52.100> doesn't<00:03:52.370> have

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
dextrose because it doesn't have

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.759 
dextrose because it doesn't have
destruction<00:03:53.150> ingredients<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:54.230> I<00:03:54.260> finish

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
destruction ingredients so I finish

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.080 
destruction ingredients so I finish

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
where the five calories come from but

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.900
