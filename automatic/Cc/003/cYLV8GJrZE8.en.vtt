 web space available at the moment for

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.769
 phone in chat 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.439
 since I moved ss wordpress here 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.080
 above from ong ator the site has recovered 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.030
 over a second of speed and how you can 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.450
 see my home page which weighs approx 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.650
 one megabyte 2 downloads in just two 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.140
 seconds 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.330
 these data are very important because 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.549
 site speed has an impact either 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.650
 on the visitor experience and on 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.100
 how search engines 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.040
 judge your site 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.860
 when they must also place it godaddy 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.570
 and bluehost are great services and you 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.790
 I invite you to check them 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.610
 I used them in the past to ensure the pd 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.640
 My clients and personal websites are 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.200
 always very satisfied 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.479
 click on side ground and once 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.180
 you are on the site proceeds to insert the name 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.500
 domain you want to buy me 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.420
 I enter mine 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.000
 clearly it is a fictitious domain for 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.020
 show you exclusively how it works 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.420
 then click on search 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.360
 domain is available and now I have to 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.759
 choose who type of web space 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.469
 buy the options are three and go 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.490
 based on the volume of visits you 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.640
 wait to receive monthly 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.380
 as on sos wordpress or about 40 50 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.660
 thousand monthly visitors 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.230
 I purchased the bobic plan the most 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.290
 advanced 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.060
 but if your site is new and not visits 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.220
 I advise you to start with the plan 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.590
 start up that comes for the first year 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.110
 less than 4 euros a month 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.790
 at this point fill in this giving form 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.790
 particular attention to these things 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.590
 state en provence leave it outside usa e 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.240
 in canada 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.620
 after which when you will complete the 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.110
 password fields 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.180
 remember to enter a complex e 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.100
 draw canvas because this is here it will be 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.530
 the password with which we will access the 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.410
 space management panel 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.840
 hosting also ensures that the 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.900
 location of the sting space one is 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.880
 set to europe 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.760
 finally side ground at the bottom of the page 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.310
 offers you two paid services 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.690
 optional site backup and protection 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.030
 from hacker attacks is spam 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.880
 I would leave both active but if 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.500
 you want to save one off too 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.990
 once you have filled in all the fields 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.300
 proceed to the purchase then make a jump 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.280
 in your inbox to find the 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.910
 username and other useful data for 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.910
 log into 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.280
 once received the email 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.950
 go to this link and enter it now 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.810
 username I received via email and 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.420
 password you entered before 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.800
 within that format it is 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.260
 filled out 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.780
 after which once you are inside the 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.550
 your said ground control panel 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.430
 go to my account and click on go to see 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.450
 panel si panel stands for panel of 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.430
 control 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.440
 from here over to install wordpress 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.180
 we can indeed create our e-mails 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.570
 and manage the database 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.080
 among the various things now that you're in go 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:06.230
 on auto installer wordpress click on it 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.790
 above and then click on install here in 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.860
 high 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.989
 now check that the domain 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.090
 here is the correct one then 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.120
 go down and change your username and password 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.720
 of wordpress with something simple to 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.750
 to remember 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.340
 in the future I could always change them 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.740
 these are the data you can use 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.930
 access the management panel or 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.780
 dashboard of your website 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.910
 therefore without confusion reminds the 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.850
 a management panel your space 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.640
 hosting which is where we are now e 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.710
 then you will also have a panel 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.810
 of managing your website 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.270
 the two things are detached but the 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.690
 second is inside the other for 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.090
 both will have a username and password 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.760
 different remember to keep them marked by 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.700
 somewhere safely 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.500
 Now enter an email too 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.510
 currently active 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.090
 and then select as the wordpress language 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.880
 Italian and maybe even tivo the 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.330
 security plugin that protects the 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.270
 your site 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.220
 any people who do not have 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.960
 authorization to access click on 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.430
 install and once the bar 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.200
 loading has finished 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.290
 you can click on the link of your site 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.110
 web and see that now a appears above 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.570
 fake website set by default for 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.290
 the bass to the ground and ready to be 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.450
 completely customized now 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.490

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.850
 access the management panel of the 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.540
