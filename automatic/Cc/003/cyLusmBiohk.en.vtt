00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
can see 26 inch wheels got RockShox our

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.830 
can see 26 inch wheels got RockShox our
girls<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.490> front<00:00:17.760> at<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.330> hundred<00:00:18.539> mill

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
girls on the front at a hundred mill

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.970 
girls on the front at a hundred mill
they're<00:00:19.380> pretty<00:00:19.619> cool

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
they're pretty cool

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.859 
they're pretty cool
riveted<00:00:20.550> bars<00:00:20.760> they're<00:00:21.090> pretty<00:00:21.330> wide<00:00:21.539> and

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
riveted bars they're pretty wide and

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.170 
riveted bars they're pretty wide and
pretty<00:00:22.439> high<00:00:22.590> because<00:00:22.830> I'm<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> tall<00:00:23.400> guy<00:00:23.670> I'm

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
pretty high because I'm a tall guy I'm

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.960 
pretty high because I'm a tall guy I'm
six<00:00:24.539> foot<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.960> need<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> high<00:00:25.380> front<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.970> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
six foot so I need a high front and the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.429 
six foot so I need a high front and the
frame<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.300> pretty<00:00:27.390> short<00:00:27.689> we've<00:00:27.960> been<00:00:28.080> working

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
frame is pretty short we've been working

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.650 
frame is pretty short we've been working
on<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.710> it's<00:00:28.949> like<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.789> new<00:00:29.939> polygon<00:00:30.390> jump

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
on this it's like the new polygon jump

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
on this it's like the new polygon jump
bike<00:00:31.009> we're<00:00:32.009> working<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> graphics<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
bike we're working on the graphics and

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.490 
bike we're working on the graphics and
work<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> geometry<00:00:33.899> at<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.020> moment<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
work on the geometry at the moment you

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.049 
work on the geometry at the moment you
can<00:00:34.680> see<00:00:34.860> we've<00:00:35.130> made<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.399> back<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.730> short<00:00:35.969> as

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
can see we've made the back as short as

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.150 
can see we've made the back as short as
possible<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.110> wheels<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.739> close<00:00:37.980> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
possible so the wheels like is close to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.260 
possible so the wheels like is close to
the<00:00:38.219> bottom<00:00:38.370> bracket<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:38.790> we<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.000> get<00:00:39.120> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the bottom bracket as we can get it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.479 
the bottom bracket as we can get it
which<00:00:39.809> makes<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.620> back<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.980> frame<00:00:41.190> a

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
which makes the the back of the frame a

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.180 
which makes the the back of the frame a
lot<00:00:41.700> shorter<00:00:41.969> which<00:00:42.809> makes<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.860> easier<00:00:44.160> for

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
lot shorter which makes it easier for

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.670 
lot shorter which makes it easier for
like<00:00:44.430> manuals<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.180> makes<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> shorter<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.930> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
like manuals it makes it shorter so it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.590 
like manuals it makes it shorter so it
like<00:00:46.890> responds<00:00:47.430> faster<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.180> easier<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
like responds faster and it's easier to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.959 
like responds faster and it's easier to
spin<00:00:48.780> around<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.200> little<00:00:49.559> shorter<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.399> like

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
spin around a little shorter and like

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.750 
spin around a little shorter and like
for<00:00:51.149> tail<00:00:51.300> whips<00:00:51.770> makes<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> better<00:00:52.980> yeah<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.730> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
for tail whips makes it better yeah so I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.520 
for tail whips makes it better yeah so I
like<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> real<00:00:54.180> short<00:00:54.420> back<00:00:54.690> end<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.199> maybe<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
like the real short back end but maybe a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.200 
like the real short back end but maybe a
longer<00:00:55.739> front<00:00:56.039> end<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.370> got<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> long<00:00:56.699> stem<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.120> as

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
longer front end I got a long stem on as

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.529 
longer front end I got a long stem on as
well

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
well

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.959 
well
because<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.109> yeah<00:00:58.440> pretty<00:00:58.710> big<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.160> need<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
because I'm yeah pretty big and need the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.380 
because I'm yeah pretty big and need the
space<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.390> there<00:01:00.420> got<00:01:01.320> DMR<00:01:02.190> pedals<00:01:02.550> through

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
space up there got DMR pedals through

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.060 
space up there got DMR pedals through
vivid<00:01:03.719> cranks<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.320> got<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> plastic<00:01:04.680> seat

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
vivid cranks and I got a plastic seat

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.130 
vivid cranks and I got a plastic seat
here<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> lightest<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.930> can

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
here because it's the lightest one I can

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.920 
here because it's the lightest one I can
find<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.850> it's<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.030> an<00:01:09.150> incentive<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.659> get

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
find and it's like an incentive to get

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.330 
find and it's like an incentive to get
your<00:01:10.080> pedals<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.530> never<00:01:10.710> slip<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.070> pedals

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
your pedals and never slip your pedals

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.950 
your pedals and never slip your pedals
because<00:01:11.460> obviously<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.330> slip<00:01:12.570> your<00:01:12.689> pedals

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
because obviously you slip your pedals

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.940 
because obviously you slip your pedals
and<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:16.140> down<00:01:16.290> which

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and like you know it's going down which

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.999 
and like you know it's going down which
is<00:01:17.130> bad<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.450> saves<00:01:18.720> weight<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.290> got<00:01:19.770> one

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
is bad and that saves weight I got one

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.160 
is bad and that saves weight I got one
break<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.670> avid<00:01:21.000> break<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> back<00:01:21.570> which

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
break one avid break on the back which

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.140 
break one avid break on the back which
is<00:01:22.290> wound<00:01:22.500> round<00:01:22.799> here<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.070> eight<00:01:23.580> times<00:01:23.880> so

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
is wound round here like eight times so

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.719 
is wound round here like eight times so
I<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.420> eight<00:01:24.570> tail<00:01:24.810> whips<00:01:25.070> on<00:01:26.070> my<00:01:26.340> break<00:01:26.549> I

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
I can do eight tail whips on my break I

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.210 
I can do eight tail whips on my break I
have<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> smaller<00:01:27.270> rotor<00:01:27.869> than<00:01:28.220> normal

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
have a smaller rotor than normal

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.190 
have a smaller rotor than normal
normally<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.000> 160<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.689> guess<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
normally it's like 160 I guess is the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.440 
normally it's like 160 I guess is the
smallest<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.740> got<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> 140<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> special

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
smallest but I got a 140 like a special

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.920 
smallest but I got a 140 like a special
little<00:01:33.570> tiny<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.770> save<00:01:34.979> weight<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
little tiny one to save weight and

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.080 
little tiny one to save weight and
because<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.079> smaller<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.470> easier<00:01:37.939> to<00:01:38.939> keep

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
because it's smaller it's easier to keep

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.569 
because it's smaller it's easier to keep
it<00:01:39.270> straight<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.750> doesn't<00:01:39.990> Bend<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
it straight you know it doesn't Bend and

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.069 
it straight you know it doesn't Bend and
uncut<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> big<00:01:42.270> crush<00:01:42.479> so

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
uncut you if you have a big crush so

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.719 
uncut you if you have a big crush so
