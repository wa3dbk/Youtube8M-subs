00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.870
 so we 're not just going to use two 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.880
 pounds of piston cut into squares 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.700
 half a pound of bacon cut into boxes 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.890
 I'm going to use green bell pepper and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.690
 red are also known as chile 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.359
 bell and both of us are going to use 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.660
 cut on squares two onions 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.590
 filleted about a cup of 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.150
 cheese 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.510
 I'm going to use mozzarella but 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.570
 Originally oaxaca cheese is used 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.430
 oil to fry salt and pepper like 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.640
 first step let's put to the fire a 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.559
 pan let's add the bacon and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.200
 We will constantly move until 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.140
 stay golden 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.360
 once it is golden we will remove 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.130
 the excess fat and then we're going to 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.320
 add the vegetables I will start by 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.830
 onion red pepper pepper 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.750
 green we mix 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.239
 occasionally and we're going to leave them there 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.670
 until they change a little good color 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.530
 here they already changed a little color and if 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.040
 you can still see the peppers are 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.740
 crispy that's how we want them like that 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.510
 that I'm going to turn off on the other hand in a 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.850
 pan I'm going to add a little bit of 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.990
 oil only so that it does not stick 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.470
 meat and then I'm going to add the encores 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.090
 season with salt and pepper to taste 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.060
 move and let's leave there until the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.890
 meat is fully cooked once 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.420
 that the meat has been cooked 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.800
 let's add the preparation of the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.680
 vegetables 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.410
 we mix let's leave 12 minutes at 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.610
 fire we turn off and we're going to add the 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.280
 cheese 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.720
 let's wait until it's gratin and 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.740
 then we can serve 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.060
 and well finally the wire is left 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.640
 regularly accompanied with a sauce 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.100
 of guacamole and some people add 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.229
 a few drops of lemon 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.150
 can accompany with corn tortillas or 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.920
 of flour and well I hope you have 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.920
 liked and see you in the next video
