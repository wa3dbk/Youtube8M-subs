this<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.570> tube<00:00:03.779> zipper<00:00:04.230> definitely<00:00:04.859> one

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
this is the tube zipper definitely one

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.070 
this is the tube zipper definitely one
of<00:00:05.100> my<00:00:05.189> most<00:00:05.399> favorite<00:00:05.819> pedals<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.300> all<00:00:06.450> time

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
of my most favorite pedals of all time

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.980 
of my most favorite pedals of all time
it<00:00:07.710> combines<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.430> really<00:00:08.730> nice<00:00:08.910> smooth<00:00:09.389> tube

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
it combines a really nice smooth tube

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.339 
it combines a really nice smooth tube
overdrive<00:00:10.410> using<00:00:11.099> two<00:00:11.309> 12ax7<00:00:11.730> s<00:00:12.360> with<00:00:13.200> an

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
overdrive using two 12ax7 s with an

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.410 
overdrive using two 12ax7 s with an
envelope<00:00:13.650> filter<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.580> combination<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
envelope filter the combination of the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.060 
envelope filter the combination of the
two<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.809> can<00:00:15.900> get<00:00:15.990> some<00:00:16.170> really<00:00:16.470> wild<00:00:16.619> effects

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
two you can get some really wild effects

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.800 
two you can get some really wild effects
the<00:00:20.070> pedal<00:00:20.430> engage<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.240> turn<00:00:21.539> up<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
the pedal engage and turn up the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:30.650 
the pedal engage and turn up the
resonance<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.470> envelope<00:00:22.949> filter<00:00:29.660> gives

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
resonance of the envelope filter gives

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.140 
resonance of the envelope filter gives
you<00:00:30.810> an<00:00:30.960> up<00:00:31.230> envelope<00:00:31.920> then<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.699> can<00:00:32.850> reverse

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
you an up envelope then you can reverse

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.329 
you an up envelope then you can reverse
the<00:00:33.330> envelope<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> down<00:00:34.470> position<00:00:37.220> just<00:00:38.220> a

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
the envelope to the down position just a

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:52.640 
the envelope to the down position just a
sensitivity<00:00:50.690> next<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:51.809> go<00:00:51.960> back<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.470> up

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
sensitivity next we go back to the up

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.770 
sensitivity next we go back to the up
envelope<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.549> we're<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.299> to<00:00:54.360> add<00:00:54.510> some

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
envelope and we're going to add some

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.289 
envelope and we're going to add some
distortion<00:00:55.440> some<00:00:56.040> Drive<00:00:56.339> I<00:00:56.369> should<00:00:56.790> say<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:57.299 
distortion some Drive I should say and

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.280 
distortion some Drive I should say and
you<00:00:58.049> have<00:00:58.080> an<00:00:58.350> input<00:00:58.530> gain<00:00:59.330> that<00:01:00.330> will

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
you have an input gain that will

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.079 
you have an input gain that will
increase<00:01:01.619> your<00:01:01.830> gain<00:01:02.040> feeding<00:01:02.640> into<00:01:02.939> the

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
increase your gain feeding into the

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:04.520 
increase your gain feeding into the
envelope<00:01:03.269> filter<00:01:03.839> and<00:01:04.140> then<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
envelope filter and then you have a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.680 
envelope filter and then you have a
drive<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:05.280> after<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.850> filter

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:23.810 

oh<00:01:11.270> cool<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.510> really<00:01:12.890> accents<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.130> resonance

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.099 

Hey

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.010 

the<00:01:28.109> next<00:01:28.380> key<00:01:28.560> feature<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.490> trill

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
the next key feature is the trill

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.309 
the next key feature is the trill
control<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:32.149> which<00:01:33.149> when<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.929> increase

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
control on here which when you increase

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.480 
control on here which when you increase
the<00:01:34.500> residence

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
the residence

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.319 
the residence
it<00:01:37.530> introduces<00:01:38.530> an<00:01:38.710> LFO<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.340> low<00:01:39.700> frequency

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
it introduces an LFO a low frequency

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.719 
it introduces an LFO a low frequency
oscillator<00:01:43.740> which<00:01:44.740> creates<00:01:45.159> this<00:01:45.399> trill

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
oscillator which creates this trill

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.230 
oscillator which creates this trill
effect<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.979> can<00:01:51.159> use<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.549> as<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.700> standalone

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
effect you can use it as a standalone

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.320 
effect you can use it as a standalone
distortion<00:01:53.610> by<00:01:54.610> turning<00:01:55.000> off<00:01:55.119> the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
distortion by turning off the

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.300 
distortion by turning off the
sensitivity<00:01:56.049> getting<00:01:56.890> sort<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.159> that

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
sensitivity getting sort of that

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.510 
sensitivity getting sort of that
half-cocked<00:01:57.939> wah<00:01:58.210> sound

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.790 

which<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.670> great<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.260> feedback<00:02:07.260> at<00:02:07.680> low

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
which is great for feedback at low

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:17.550 
which is great for feedback at low
levels

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.170 

this<00:02:18.560> panel<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:19.040> also<00:02:19.250> capable<00:02:19.700> of

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
this panel is also capable of

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.790 
this panel is also capable of
self-oscillation

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
self-oscillation

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:32.290 
self-oscillation
there's<00:02:22.340> one<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.700> crazy<00:02:23.000> effects<00:02:31.300> mmm

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
there's one of the crazy effects mmm

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.690 
there's one of the crazy effects mmm
this<00:02:33.230> may<00:02:33.500> give<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.800> an<00:02:33.890> idea<00:02:34.070> of<00:02:34.340> why<00:02:34.490> it's

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
this may give you an idea of why it's

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:47.640 
this may give you an idea of why it's
called<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.000> tube<00:02:35.210> zipper<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:46.310> as<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.580> can<00:02:46.730> see

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
called the tube zipper so as you can see

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.840 
called the tube zipper so as you can see
anybody<00:02:48.650> can<00:02:48.860> pretty<00:02:49.070> much<00:02:49.130> dial<00:02:49.520> their<00:02:49.730> own
