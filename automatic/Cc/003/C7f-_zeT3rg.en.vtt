00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.640 
commentary but I think it reflects the
gameplay<00:03:48.270> it's<00:03:48.390> pretty<00:03:48.630> messed<00:03:48.840> up<00:03:49.020> all<00:03:49.410> the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
gameplay it's pretty messed up all the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.870 
gameplay it's pretty messed up all the
spawns<00:03:49.890> are<00:03:50.070> in<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.220> same<00:03:50.370> place<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.850> just
