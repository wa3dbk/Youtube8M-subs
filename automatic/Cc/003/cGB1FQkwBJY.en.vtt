00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
and you're gonna fold it exactly along

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.990 
and you're gonna fold it exactly along
the<00:05:31.169> edge<00:05:31.350> and<00:05:31.830> line<00:05:32.070> up<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.250> scallops<00:05:32.820> so

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000

that it's nice and centered otherwise

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.250 
that it's nice and centered otherwise
it'll<00:05:36.000> look<00:05:36.150> off<00:05:36.330> balance<00:05:36.750> and<00:05:36.840> that'll<00:05:37.080> just

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
it'll look off balance and that'll just

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.320 
it'll look off balance and that'll just
look<00:05:37.440> really<00:05:37.620> weird<00:05:37.830> so<00:05:38.729> now<00:05:39.060> that<00:05:39.120> that's

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
look really weird so now that that's

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.710 
look really weird so now that that's
done<00:05:39.860> you're<00:05:40.860> gonna<00:05:40.950> hold<00:05:41.220> it<00:05:41.430> and<00:05:41.640> place<00:05:42.450> it

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
done you're gonna hold it and place it

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.990 
done you're gonna hold it and place it
down<00:05:42.979> with<00:05:43.979> the<00:05:44.130> fold<00:05:44.400> because<00:05:44.760> there<00:05:44.880> is<00:05:44.970> a

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
down with the fold because there is a

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.760 
down with the fold because there is a
fault<00:05:45.300> that<00:05:45.360> I've<00:05:45.540> happened<00:05:45.840> piece<00:05:46.020> and<00:05:46.410> you

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
fault that I've happened piece and you

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.500 
fault that I've happened piece and you
can<00:05:46.919> see<00:05:47.070> that<00:05:47.280> the<00:05:47.370> scallops<00:05:47.820> are<00:05:48.030> perfectly

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
can see that the scallops are perfectly

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.409 
can see that the scallops are perfectly
aligned<00:05:49.050> here<00:05:49.500> so<00:05:50.490> then<00:05:50.640> take<00:05:50.880> your<00:05:51.210> pattern

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
aligned here so then take your pattern

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.210 
aligned here so then take your pattern
piece<00:05:51.750> I'm<00:05:52.020> doing<00:05:52.229> the<00:05:52.320> front<00:05:52.500> insert<00:05:52.979> but

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
piece I'm doing the front insert but

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.500 
piece I'm doing the front insert but
you're<00:05:53.340> going<00:05:53.490> to<00:05:53.640> do<00:05:53.729> the<00:05:53.910> front<00:05:54.060> and<00:05:54.240> the

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
you're going to do the front and the

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.670 
you're going to do the front and the
back<00:05:54.860> place<00:05:55.860> it<00:05:56.100> on<00:05:56.250> like<00:05:56.580> so<00:05:56.610> and<00:05:57.500> then<00:05:58.500> you

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
back place it on like so and then you

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.650 
back place it on like so and then you
should<00:05:58.860> pin<00:05:59.130> it<00:05:59.310> but<00:05:59.820> I'm<00:05:59.910> not<00:06:00.060> going<00:06:00.210> to<00:06:00.330> just

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
should pin it but I'm not going to just

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.330 
should pin it but I'm not going to just
so<00:06:00.720> I<00:06:00.750> can<00:06:00.960> show<00:06:01.140> you<00:06:01.200> and<00:06:01.710> then<00:06:02.100> we're<00:06:02.250> going

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
so I can show you and then we're going

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.500 
so I can show you and then we're going
