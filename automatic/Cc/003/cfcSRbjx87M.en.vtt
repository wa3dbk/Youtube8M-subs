another<00:00:15.680> oil<00:00:16.010> jeez<00:00:16.430> to<00:00:17.420> connect<00:00:17.750> two<00:00:18.199> lines<00:00:18.470> of

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
another oil jeez to connect two lines of

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.339 
another oil jeez to connect two lines of
different<00:00:19.039> diameters<00:00:19.550> I'm<00:00:20.199> going<00:00:21.199> to<00:00:21.259> be

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349 
different diameters I'm going to be

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.640 
different diameters I'm going to be
using<00:00:21.560> some<00:00:22.490> colored<00:00:22.820> cord<00:00:23.150> and<00:00:23.449> some<00:00:24.349> string

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
using some colored cord and some string

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.210 
using some colored cord and some string
today<00:00:24.980> just<00:00:25.490> so<00:00:25.609> that<00:00:25.699> it<00:00:25.759> shows<00:00:26.000> up<00:00:26.240> easier<00:00:26.660> on

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
today just so that it shows up easier on

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:37.450 
today just so that it shows up easier on
the<00:00:28.220> camera<00:00:33.100> purple<00:00:34.100> cord<00:00:34.930> signifies<00:00:36.460> the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
the camera purple cord signifies the

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.160 
the camera purple cord signifies the
line<00:00:37.640> that<00:00:37.940> goes<00:00:37.970> straight<00:00:38.150> to<00:00:38.660> your<00:00:38.810> reel<00:00:38.990> so

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
line that goes straight to your reel so

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.190 
line that goes straight to your reel so
this<00:00:39.290> is<00:00:39.440> your<00:00:39.560> main<00:00:39.710> line<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:42.020> white

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
this is your main line and the white

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.090 
this is your main line and the white
string<00:00:42.590> is<00:00:43.480> what<00:00:44.480> would<00:00:44.720> be<00:00:44.960> your<00:00:45.380> leader<00:00:45.740> to

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
string is what would be your leader to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.960 
string is what would be your leader to
the<00:00:46.190> higher<00:00:46.400> diameter<00:00:46.970> line<00:00:48.430> so<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.490> start<00:00:49.820> off

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
the higher diameter line so to start off

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.320 
the higher diameter line so to start off
with<00:00:50.270> we're<00:00:50.900> going<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.110> take<00:00:51.320> your<00:00:51.920> leader<00:00:52.330> the

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
with we're going to take your leader the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.350 
with we're going to take your leader the
higher<00:00:53.690> diameter<00:00:53.960> line<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:55.120> you're<00:00:56.120> going<00:00:56.300> to

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
higher diameter line and you're going to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.520 
higher diameter line and you're going to
create<00:00:56.540> a<00:00:57.020> simple<00:00:57.850> overhand<00:00:58.850> knot<00:00:59.350> so<00:01:00.350> that's

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
create a simple overhand knot so that's

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.710 
create a simple overhand knot so that's
just<00:01:00.680> a<00:01:00.860> lot<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.040> would<00:01:01.280> use<00:01:01.550> at<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.210> start<00:01:02.510> of

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
just a lot you would use at the start of

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:11.040 
just a lot you would use at the start of
tying<00:01:03.080> your<00:01:03.620> shoelaces<00:01:08.860> take<00:01:09.860> your<00:01:10.040> main<00:01:10.220> line

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
tying your shoelaces take your main line

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
tying your shoelaces take your main line
and<00:01:12.220> run<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.460> through<00:01:13.730> you<00:01:14.650> your<00:01:15.650> overhand

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
and run that through you your overhand

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.480 
and run that through you your overhand
knot<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.520> run<00:01:17.180> it<00:01:17.330> parallel<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:19.570> your<00:01:20.570> leader

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
knot and run it parallel to your leader

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.770 
knot and run it parallel to your leader
make<00:01:22.490> sure<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:22.820> put<00:01:23.060> enough<00:01:23.090> for<00:01:23.540> you<00:01:23.659> because

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
make sure you put enough for you because

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.250 
make sure you put enough for you because
you're<00:01:24.020> going<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.200> wrap<00:01:24.409> this<00:01:24.620> around<00:01:26.260> your

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
you're going to wrap this around your

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.740 
you're going to wrap this around your
leader<00:01:28.900> so<00:01:29.900> now<00:01:30.050> we're<00:01:30.920> just<00:01:31.070> going<00:01:31.250> to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
leader so now we're just going to

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.399 
leader so now we're just going to
tighten<00:01:32.750> up<00:01:33.159> your<00:01:34.159> leader<00:01:34.990> just<00:01:35.990> enough<00:01:36.260> so

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
tighten up your leader just enough so

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.620 
tighten up your leader just enough so
that<00:01:36.440> it<00:01:36.560> bites<00:01:36.909> so<00:01:37.909> it's<00:01:38.060> not<00:01:38.150> going<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.420> slip

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
that it bites so it's not going to slip

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.580 
that it bites so it's not going to slip
anywhere<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.260> back<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:40.900> then<00:01:41.900> we're<00:01:42.560> just

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
anywhere to you back and then we're just

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.789 
anywhere to you back and then we're just
going<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:42.950> create<00:01:43.190> a<00:01:43.550> quick<00:01:43.970> loop<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.960> this

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
going to create a quick loop and this

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.780 
going to create a quick loop and this
will<00:01:49.010> become<00:01:49.130> power<00:01:49.610> in<00:01:49.940> a<00:01:50.299> minute

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
will become power in a minute

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.110 
will become power in a minute
so<00:01:53.140> with<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.290> lid<00:01:54.409> gripped<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:55.670> take<00:01:55.909> your

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
so with the lid gripped you take your

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:05.410 
so with the lid gripped you take your
line<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.570> come<00:01:57.020> over<00:01:57.290> one<00:01:58.870> two<00:02:01.240> three<00:02:03.340> four

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
line you come over one two three four

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.650 
line you come over one two three four
five<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.740> six<00:02:10.490> then<00:02:11.490> on<00:02:11.640> your<00:02:11.820> last<00:02:11.970> turn

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
five and six then on your last turn

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.770 
five and six then on your last turn
you<00:02:13.440> bring<00:02:13.650> your<00:02:13.770> tag<00:02:14.010> end<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.570> you'll<00:02:15.570> come

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
you bring your tag end and you'll come

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.060 
you bring your tag end and you'll come
back<00:02:15.990> through<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:16.440> loop<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.740> you've

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
back through this loop that you've

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.300 
back through this loop that you've
created<00:02:17.280> some<00:02:18.090> coming<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.510> through<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> back

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
created some coming in through the back

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:29.090 
created some coming in through the back
and<00:02:20.310> come<00:02:20.700> not<00:02:20.910> through<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:26.010> gently<00:02:28.100> pull

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
and come not through and you gently pull

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.520 
and come not through and you gently pull
this<00:02:29.280> together<00:02:31.850> pull<00:02:32.850> each<00:02:33.030> bit<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:34.440> will

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
this together pull each bit and it will

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.360 
this together pull each bit and it will
start<00:02:34.740> tightening<00:02:35.130> up<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.520> itself<00:02:40.220> what<00:02:41.220> you

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
start tightening up on itself what you

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.720 
start tightening up on itself what you
would<00:02:41.459> do<00:02:41.640> with<00:02:42.209> your<00:02:42.780> main<00:02:42.959> line<00:02:43.520> is<00:02:44.520> you'll

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
would do with your main line is you'll

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.120 
would do with your main line is you'll
wet<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.090> with<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.360> bit<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.660> saliva<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.800> help

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
wet this with a bit of saliva just help

00:02:47.130 --> 00:03:03.760 
wet this with a bit of saliva just help
it<00:02:47.400> slide<00:02:48.120> down<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.660> itself

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.339 

now<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.400> have<00:03:04.610> it

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:14.539 

obviously<00:03:08.249> think<00:03:08.670> clearly<00:03:09.209> taggings<00:03:13.549> may

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
obviously think clearly taggings may

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.739 
obviously think clearly taggings may
have<00:03:14.879> a<00:03:15.180> nice<00:03:15.599> strong<00:03:15.900> knot<00:03:16.939> as<00:03:17.939> I<00:03:18.060> say<00:03:18.299> this<00:03:18.569> is

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:18.749 
have a nice strong knot as I say this is

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.080 
have a nice strong knot as I say this is
not<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:19.109> I<00:03:19.139> would<00:03:19.439> use<00:03:19.939> whenever<00:03:20.939> I'm

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
not that I would use whenever I'm

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.179 
not that I would use whenever I'm
connecting<00:03:21.569> a<00:03:21.629> higher<00:03:21.810> diameter<00:03:22.079> line<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:23.069> my

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:23.189 
connecting a higher diameter line to my

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.839 
connecting a higher diameter line to my
main<00:03:23.400> line<00:03:23.989> well<00:03:24.989> that's<00:03:25.139> it<00:03:25.319> for<00:03:25.469> me<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.889> hope

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
main line well that's it for me I hope
