00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello to all and we find ourselves on 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.920
 time shift hours as it's marked here 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.569
 which was done in 48 hours and 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.660
 it's a game with a concept because I love 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.929
 it's that kind of game me and so we 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.299
 must basically we must influence wholesale 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.400
 we arrive in a level well they go 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.720
 tell us here we come in a level 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.699
 and we can see the advanced time or 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.750
 stop it but I believe that everything is 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.250
 takes place over ten seconds 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.420
 see it's all about ten 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.099
 seconds and basically you have to play with 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.660
 time for power and bin and well 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.640
 move 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.890
 and ben me it looks nice to me this concept 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 so we will see what it already gives 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.399
 the piano music that I 'll be able to there 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.670
 to go good there is the high level point 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.870
 we will see after that becomes harder I 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.520
 understand a little if this post ok then 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.950
 throws click on the platform for the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.270
 curly and for the straightening hockey 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.260
 only the colorful platforms 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.180
 can be taken and accor alas 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 I have to play with the name 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:05.640
 I have to play with time but 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.880
 I'm close to the green no anti play 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880
 means 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.460
 thil it must mean blue cyan I 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.650
 do not know what but it reminds you 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.110
 something for sure it's so I do not 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.830
 can not the frieze the garlic the laser that makes 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.460
 wrong is to discover him listen 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.460
 so I'm close to this one 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:39.080
 a game m at the lowest 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:44.990
 I free you touch of freeze is it 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.010
 that I can jump so in fact I know 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.000
 not at all if it happens on ten 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.200
 seconds but wait i'm a 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.030
 big shit what an agreement but there 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.020
 so I curled the blue here okay 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.640
 so suddenly it allowed me to move 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.050
 I agree frieze and several 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.310
 at the same time see I curled that one 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.480
 So it's my pay not that at age 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.160
 free of this one and I get 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.920
 ok then you can not curl or any 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.340
 friezes of remote platforms 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.550
 so here I can I can alas I can 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:18.590
 more ok I guess I come in mode 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:22.100
 warriors totally wrong yeah ok ok 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.810
 have to think these two there must be 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.250
 not that I take the lasers this 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.870
 would that be the thing that actually is who's me 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.730
 would hurt where this platform goes after 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.750
 it comes back it's good yes so in fact 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.860
 it's really 10 seconds yes it 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.360
 moved in 10 seconds but if I stay 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.160
 supported actually you can continue but 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.940
 that one it would be necessary that it does not border 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.330
 it's because I can do it 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.650
 other 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:48.480
 down lasers oh my god i fucked 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.739
 the tooth I believe 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.060
 I did not see you college bammer I hope 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.170
 that they had me from early buddies I'm

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:10.080

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.049
 easy go wrong pitch mode you are 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.680
 sure that's how I have to 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.680
 move breen 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.470
 if you go through the green walls 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.450
 ah yes through that it's like in 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.829
 portal actually if you go through 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.959
 the green walls all the stuff curls go 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.130
 get straightened and I can not curly 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.450

 go this is the time so this the world he 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.750
 I 'd have to put that kind of thing 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.700
 but it's going to get wild after that the only one 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.260
 problem to which so there I can not 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.260
 move to 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.169
 ok ok ok very good very good 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.359
 I have to put myself on the 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.849
 platform already that's the base come 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:24.930
 small dish of foul even small flat 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:28.280
 fund except that there is a problem there 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:35.240
 is surprised they have to be less the 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.240
 it takes 5 me 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:45.790

 ok that was beautiful that that's equal 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.970
 but it's going to be big fail 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:01.700
 less than I can go these big fact 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:04.820

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.060
 expect 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.860
 it can come anywhere the mayor 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.880
 of the most mythical age at all I am 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.900

 game so much that we managed right away 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.159
 what was it but I had not seen 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.409
 panting down I can not be too 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:01.469
 simple as that the guys whose role 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:02.550
 please that's fine I managed with just 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:04.349
 a few clicks ok it was just a 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.219
 level it now I need to 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:10.379
 do the 2o my god 

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:13.500
 oh no ok well I finished the game and ben 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:15.139
 it was more of a sight it was pretty cool 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.629
 no 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:20.219
 in any case good concept the frame so 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:21.750
 that was the thing he said to himself I'm going 

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.830
 nothing to fuck yeah that was clearly that 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.099
 he said hey if I did not care that 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.870
 slab 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:26.699
 and here it is that level 4 in 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.129
 same time it's done in 48 hours 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:30.150
 a good concept 

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:31.830
 now would not have to see you 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.120
 that end it could have lasted twenty 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.319
 minutes would see 20 minutes playing that 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.779
 I can be cool I do not see it lasted 

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:38.190
 four hours either but it's nice 

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:40.319
 the originator and the originator 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.909
 I heard words the concept is 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:45.120
 nice here so thank you for having gone 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:46.800
 and more polar for the future will spring 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.660
 more than anything else from June of others 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.480
 was not going 

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:55.990
 of messenger god a cup of coffee 

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.990
 all over 

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.889
 but who says new Scotland 

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.969
 unique to put in a good mood 

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.610
 but watts 

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:08.620
 are you going to think that music 

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.050
 we see it by bruges totally 

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.280
 stuffed on the buttocks of the equipment 

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:16.240
 coutras and slugs 

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.240
 and pass that number to douala
