00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 This is the number of channels. Everyone like this flash memory watch 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.110
 Is not it 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.960
 I I went quite a way it is the Tteyuu example I'm using this to macbook air 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.859
 And plug example Well Horizontal 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.020
 And if I'm not able to edit video files Toka Oite ThatLookLikeThis 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.730
 Um, I'm sorry this macbook air I have is 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.330
 Because it is not good for specs, it's a bit over-processed 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.530
 Then 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:33.130
 It is time also I a So that it takes about an hour to write the video 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:38.050
 I'm trying to make it possible to put the convenience of the land, though 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:40.010
 This is it and much more videos Export placed in the left ne bag So 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:46.010
 This popped out was this stick memo Re 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:50.180
 There this is I have a not yet and stands out only this this is even a possibility that exit 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:55.070
 It has been found an interesting thing also I'd thought that I can not be helped I 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:59.360
 By the way, it is here to introduce it today. Let's see in detail in a 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.030
 Yes love distribution mini of any p 9 th of this time 3.0 usb 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.290
 This 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.650
 It seems that usb 3.0, but let's open it here too soon 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.000
 Huh Zoa' came in appearance 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.710
 I this is there a this this a ne 303 gb 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.760
 Really further I and probably might want to say that the claws the size of the thumb which attach small 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.290
 I think you feel 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.610
 In the example, I'm going to install it outside macbook air right away. 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.010
 I will feel 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:32.290
 Yo yo I love you 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:37.840
 8 Everyone you will see this is about 7.5 mm I like it is good 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.190
 It is this to understand so well If this is normal, it is here that we purchased this time to here 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.060
 There 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:47.000
 There is not particularly a problem even in the heat Keppanashi this was 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.810
 There are other small things like cats, but this is the main issue 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.650
 It is this speed only with usb 3.0 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:59.630
 After all, writing and reading speed will not be a story 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:04.940
 Let's see what it really is 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.990
 I think I'm roughly 5.5 mind that contains the guy of the ne Well capacity In Yeah here 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.710
 Try to copy and pay 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.600
 Hmm 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:15.690
 Yes it is 1 minute 25 seconds, which was the end still early I very much 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.340
 Let's go here if it's double 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:25.200
 Yes, the delivery time is 4 minutes 19 seconds 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.730
 Although the difference of about 3 times the emmer came out, it can be said that it is within the acceptable range. 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.500
 Then the opposite is eh 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:35.769
 Let's take a look at the reading speed. 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.620
 It was 41 seconds 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:43.040
 Let's go ahead from here to Dare 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.090
 How is it started? 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.780
 It's kind of nice to read this early 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.200
 The early termination method gave a surprising result 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.500
 Well Kedomo I think little bit of error is that there is 37 seconds 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.610
 It is a story that you can win a little while 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.630
 Good Tamaa was there a party feeling 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:07.860
 If you give a point every day, writing is a bit late. 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:13.470
 85.5 seems to mind it took about Netto 4 minutes to 5 minutes 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:16.650
 I not have been perfect it is for the well But you know that reading speed expected to usb 3.0 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.630
 Well this is a great convenience for some people 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.900
 Increasing nothing I, for example, a cat macbook and storage 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.980
 It is a 128 gb model when you look at it without getting caught up 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.790
 Jessica I think it 's capacity-wise , I think that many people say it's a little constant 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.410
 Well there is a cat like external storage for that kind of time though 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.840
 The other pointing leave If this is it even is normal is not it that insert leave difficult 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.620
 But I feel like I can do it 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.220
 Also regarding the first distinction 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:48.409
 I feel particularly good, though I feel like I'm touching it now 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:52.940
 There is no impression that it will heat up to haste , so I spend a little time on it like this 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.599
 I can't use video data or music data. 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.460
 Is not it 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:01.910
 What happens to be 4880 yen but you is the price of you to be here care I do not put 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:07.280
 I am interested in selling here at amazon, but I was interested 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:12.710
 Only child of in the story only inventory when viewed out just please look at me the link below the description field 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.630
 There was no possibility but it might be sold out too more than sculptor usb 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.450
 It was introduction of memory 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.540

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:26.910
