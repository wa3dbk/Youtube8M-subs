00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
thing here it slightly different color

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.160 
thing here it slightly different color
that's<00:00:25.619> because<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.400> basically<00:00:26.880> gave<00:00:27.630> up<00:00:27.930> on

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
that's because I basically gave up on

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.929 
that's because I basically gave up on
the<00:00:28.230> whole<00:00:28.529> thing<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:28.859> decided<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.400> go<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.849> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
the whole thing and decided to go for a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.330 
the whole thing and decided to go for a
turbo<00:00:30.210> controller<00:00:30.710> well<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:31.800> not<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.009> I

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
turbo controller well it's not really I

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
turbo controller well it's not really I
feel<00:00:32.700> bad<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.149> not<00:00:33.270> really<00:00:33.630> cheating<00:00:33.660> that

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
feel bad it's not really cheating that

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.709 
feel bad it's not really cheating that
much<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.250> NES<00:00:35.550> had<00:00:35.820> tons<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.270> turbo

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
much because the NES had tons of turbo

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.660 
much because the NES had tons of turbo
controllers<00:00:37.110> available<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.309> was<00:00:38.399> totally

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
controllers available so it was totally

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.440 
controllers available so it was totally
doable<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.239> cartridge<00:00:39.629> um<00:00:40.760> so<00:00:41.760> but<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.420> I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
doable on a cartridge um so but what I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.900 
doable on a cartridge um so but what I
had<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.170> had<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.550> test<00:00:44.550> out<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> couple

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.760 
had to do is I had to test out a couple

but I saw the Fluke basically right for
you<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.390> level<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.900> back<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> little

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
you in the level if you back a little

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.100 
you in the level if you back a little
bit<00:01:19.860> as<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> flying<00:01:20.400> carpet<00:01:20.700> takes<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.659> down<00:01:21.810> to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
bit as a flying carpet takes you down to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.510 
bit as a flying carpet takes you down to
a<00:01:22.229> place<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> clock<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.250> real<00:01:23.400> life

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
a place with a clock and it's real life

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.200 
a place with a clock and it's real life
on<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.330> bonus<00:01:24.720> pool<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.790> won't<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:27.000> if<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
on a bonus pool so you won't see if it

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.060 
on a bonus pool so you won't see if it
really<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.990> one<00:01:28.140> extra<00:01:28.350> few<00:01:28.500> life<00:01:28.680> but

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
really is it it's one extra few life but

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.719 
really is it it's one extra few life but
I<00:01:29.250> didn't<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.610> was<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.390> now<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
I didn't know was there for now I do and

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.649 
I didn't know was there for now I do and
so<00:01:32.729> there<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.939> go

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
so there you go

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.180 
so there you go
okay<00:01:34.499> now<00:01:34.859> let's<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:35.369> how<00:01:35.579> easy<00:01:35.819> it<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.179> with

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.820 

a<00:01:40.300> turbo<00:01:41.300> controller<00:01:41.510> here<00:01:42.050> we<00:01:42.140> go<00:01:44.830> Messi

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
a turbo controller here we go Messi

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.630 
a turbo controller here we go Messi
gonna<00:01:46.040> save<00:01:46.910> state<00:01:47.270> here<00:01:47.920> with<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.100> town<00:01:49.310> and

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
gonna save state here with the town and

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.960 
gonna save state here with the town and
the<00:01:49.790> scale<00:01:50.150> goes<00:01:50.420> i'm<00:01:50.720> guessing<00:01:51.730> i'll<00:01:52.730> get<00:01:52.880> out

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
the scale goes i'm guessing i'll get out

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.100 
the scale goes i'm guessing i'll get out
when<00:01:53.180> fit<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.140> i'm<00:01:54.320> guessing<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:55.160> will<00:01:55.400> be<00:01:56.110> much

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
when fit so i'm guessing it will be much

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.810 
when fit so i'm guessing it will be much
less<00:01:57.260> aggravating

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.760

mean<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:09.039> couldn't<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.819> would<00:02:10.240> follow<00:02:10.569> him<00:02:10.840> on

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
mean I couldn't I I would follow him on

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.850 
mean I couldn't I I would follow him on
a<00:02:11.050> full<00:02:11.350> loop<00:02:12.900> before<00:02:13.900> how<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.260> follow<00:02:14.620> him<00:02:14.830> a

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
a full loop before how to follow him a

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.820 
a full loop before how to follow him a
full<00:02:15.780> loop<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.110> be<00:02:17.200> able<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.380> hit<00:02:17.500> him<00:02:17.620> what

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
full loop and be able to hit him what

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.390 
full loop and be able to hit him what
barely<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:19.500> surely<00:02:20.500> didn't<00:02:20.800> get<00:02:20.920> in<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.190> hurt

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
barely I surely didn't get in that hurt

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.930 
barely I surely didn't get in that hurt
I<00:02:21.900> now<00:02:22.900> look<00:02:23.110> just<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.370> speed<00:02:24.580> when<00:02:24.760> I

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
I now look just like that speed when I

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.820 
I now look just like that speed when I
mentioned<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.510> was<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:25.900> think<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.380> mentioned<00:02:26.440> it

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
mentioned it was I think I mentioned it

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.110 
mentioned it was I think I mentioned it
anyway<00:02:27.070> there<00:02:27.190> was<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.310> speed<00:02:27.490> run<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.670> saw<00:02:27.880> and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
anyway there was a speed run a saw and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.690 
anyway there was a speed run a saw and
they<00:02:28.600> killed<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:28.989> exactly<00:02:29.380> as<00:02:29.500> fast<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.160> the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
they killed it exactly as fast and the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.670 
they killed it exactly as fast and the
walkthroughs<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.239> read<00:02:31.690> said<00:02:31.959> oh<00:02:32.020> yeah<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:32.500> two

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
walkthroughs I read said oh yeah you two

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.479 
walkthroughs I read said oh yeah you two
almost<00:02:32.890> two<00:02:33.160> full<00:02:33.340> rotations<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:34.030> not<00:02:34.209> missing

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
almost two full rotations of not missing

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.940 
almost two full rotations of not missing
so<00:02:36.489> yeah<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:37.060> mean<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.870> might<00:02:38.140> be<00:02:38.290> maybe<00:02:38.770> two

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
so yeah I mean it might be maybe two

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.590 
so yeah I mean it might be maybe two
before<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.280> was<00:02:39.580> basically<00:02:39.820> putting<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.450> B

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
before I was basically putting the B

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.479 
before I was basically putting the B
button<00:02:40.810> on<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.320> L&amp;R<00:02:41.950> buttons<00:02:42.310> on<00:02:42.459> my

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
button on the L&amp;R buttons on my

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.479 
button on the L&amp;R buttons on my
controller<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.590> pushing<00:02:44.920> with<00:02:45.040> both<00:02:45.190> hands

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
controller and pushing with both hands

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.520 
controller and pushing with both hands
both<00:02:45.730> hands<00:02:46.000> as<00:02:46.209> fast<00:02:46.480> as<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.780> can<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:47.019> good<00:02:47.050> and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
both hands as fast as it can be good and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.890 
both hands as fast as it can be good and
that<00:02:47.650> wasn't<00:02:47.830> nearly<00:02:48.070> got<00:02:48.280> past<00:02:48.580> obviously

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that wasn't nearly got past obviously

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.190 
that wasn't nearly got past obviously
like<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.019> turbo<00:02:50.230> controller<00:02:50.820> is<00:02:51.820> 10<00:02:52.630> or<00:02:52.900> 20

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
like the turbo controller is 10 or 20

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.170 
like the turbo controller is 10 or 20
times<00:02:53.230> faster<00:02:53.530> than<00:02:53.950> is<00:02:54.220> humanly<00:02:54.430> possible<00:02:55.090> i

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
times faster than is humanly possible i

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.820 
times faster than is humanly possible i
think<00:02:55.420> because<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:55.989> was<00:02:56.550> disgustingly<00:02:57.550> easy

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
think because that was disgustingly easy

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.600 
think because that was disgustingly easy
so<00:02:59.830> yeah<00:03:00.810> hippity-hop<00:03:01.810> hippity-hop<00:03:02.459> can<00:03:03.459> be<00:03:03.580> a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
so yeah hippity-hop hippity-hop can be a

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.520 
so yeah hippity-hop hippity-hop can be a
50<00:03:04.000> Cal<00:03:04.150> for<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.480> roller<00:03:04.690> up<00:03:04.870> top<00:03:05.140> see<00:03:05.440> you

sequel that never never made because it

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.289

rotations

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.930 
rotations
I<00:03:47.850> probably<00:03:48.850> won't<00:03:49.090> go<00:03:49.270> back<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.630> do<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:49.860> it

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
I probably won't go back and do that it

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.790 
I probably won't go back and do that it
like<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:51.970> said<00:03:52.090> it<00:03:52.420> was<00:03:52.540> I<00:03:52.720> have<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:53.110> couple<00:03:53.440> like
