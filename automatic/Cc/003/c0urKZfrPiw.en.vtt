got<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.660> flush<00:03:10.930> draw<00:03:10.959> -<00:03:11.410> Allen<00:03:11.769> just<00:03:11.950> pointed

got a flush draw - Allen just pointed
out<00:03:12.370> on<00:03:12.549> I<00:03:12.790> didn't<00:03:13.600> pick<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.810> up<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.250> think

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
out on I didn't pick that up so I think

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.550 
out on I didn't pick that up so I think
it's<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.180> gonna<00:03:16.630> be<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.780> very<00:03:17.019> tough<00:03:17.260> spot<00:03:17.530> for

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
it's a gonna be a very tough spot for

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.150 
it's a gonna be a very tough spot for
him<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:17.890> fold<00:03:18.130> or<00:03:18.250> he<00:03:18.340> shouldn't<00:03:18.670> fold<00:03:19.859> if<00:03:20.859> beau

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
him to fold or he shouldn't fold if beau

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.729 
him to fold or he shouldn't fold if beau
didn't<00:03:21.519> have<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.910> flush<00:03:22.120> draw<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:23.440> would<00:03:23.620> be

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
didn't have the flush draw it would be

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.560 
didn't have the flush draw it would be
interesting<00:03:24.010> if<00:03:24.370> OB<00:03:24.820> shove<00:03:25.060> but<00:03:25.269> I<00:03:25.329> mean<00:03:25.450> with

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.070 

well<00:04:09.730> I<00:04:09.790> mean<00:04:09.940> this<00:04:10.180> is<00:04:10.240> an<00:04:10.480> essence<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:10.990> all

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
well I mean this is an essence and all

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.080 
well I mean this is an essence and all
in<00:04:11.290> here<00:04:11.560> I<00:04:11.680> mean<00:04:11.830> obviously<00:04:11.950> bow<00:04:12.760> it's<00:04:12.940> not

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
in here I mean obviously bow it's not

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.610 
in here I mean obviously bow it's not
gonna<00:04:13.210> you<00:04:13.600> know<00:04:13.660> he's<00:04:13.840> not<00:04:13.930> gonna<00:04:14.080> call<00:04:14.320> and

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
gonna you know he's not gonna call and

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.530 
gonna you know he's not gonna call and
then<00:04:14.710> check<00:04:14.980> fold<00:04:15.280> here<00:04:15.550> it<00:04:16.030> would<00:04:16.180> really<00:04:16.330> be

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
then check fold here it would really be

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.760 
then check fold here it would really be
interesting<00:04:16.900> though<00:04:17.020> if<00:04:17.080> bow<00:04:17.290> did<00:04:17.500> have<00:04:17.650> the

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
interesting though if bow did have the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:37.020 
interesting though if bow did have the
Jack<00:04:18.010> nine<00:04:18.220> without<00:04:18.550> the<00:04:18.700> hearts<00:04:36.000> again<00:04:37.000> I

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
Jack nine without the hearts again I

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.870 
Jack nine without the hearts again I
mean<00:04:37.380> in<00:04:38.380> essence<00:04:38.860> we<00:04:39.040> can<00:04:39.220> treat<00:04:39.460> this<00:04:39.610> as<00:04:39.790> an

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
mean in essence we can treat this as an

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.350 
mean in essence we can treat this as an
all<00:04:40.030> in<00:04:40.240> so<00:04:40.420> it's<00:04:40.540> basically<00:04:40.930> six<00:04:41.470> for<00:04:41.860> 1,300

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.280 

and<00:04:46.360> obviously<00:04:46.660> bow<00:04:47.080> is<00:04:47.700> so<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:49.540> so<00:04:49.930> he's

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
and obviously bow is so so so he's

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.440 
and obviously bow is so so so he's
getting<00:04:50.470> two<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:50.950> one<00:04:51.130> which<00:04:52.000> means<00:04:52.210> he<00:04:52.330> needs

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
getting two to one which means he needs

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.330 
getting two to one which means he needs
about<00:04:52.720> thirty<00:04:53.050> three<00:04:53.260> percent<00:04:53.470> equity<00:04:53.860> in<00:04:54.130> the

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
about thirty three percent equity in the

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.990 
about thirty three percent equity in the
hand<00:04:54.580> here<00:04:55.560> he<00:04:56.560> would<00:04:56.830> have<00:04:57.100> if<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.640> guy<00:04:57.790> had

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
hand here he would have if the guy had

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.120 
hand here he would have if the guy had
ten<00:04:58.270> eight<00:04:58.480> he<00:04:59.320> would<00:04:59.530> have<00:05:00.120> thirteen<00:05:01.120> outs

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.740 

which<00:05:06.130> would<00:05:06.280> probably<00:05:06.760> need<00:05:06.970> means<00:05:07.360> that<00:05:07.600> he

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
which would probably need means that he

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.350 
which would probably need means that he
would<00:05:07.930> need<00:05:08.140> one<00:05:08.710> two<00:05:08.980> three<00:05:09.400> two-and-a-half

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
would need one two three two-and-a-half

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.490 
would need one two three two-and-a-half
the<00:05:10.720> one<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:11.050> call

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
the one to call

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.610 
the one to call
now<00:05:12.040> he's<00:05:12.160> getting<00:05:12.310> two<00:05:12.730> to<00:05:12.880> one<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.090> call<00:05:13.620> but

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
now he's getting two to one to call but

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.160 
now he's getting two to one to call but
is<00:05:15.010> there<00:05:15.280> ever<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.640> hand<00:05:16.030> that<00:05:16.540> this<00:05:16.810> guy<00:05:16.930> might

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
is there ever a hand that this guy might

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.900 
is there ever a hand that this guy might
have<00:05:17.200> that's<00:05:17.620> not<00:05:17.710> ten<00:05:18.040> eight<00:05:18.220> here<00:05:18.640> we<00:05:18.760> can

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
have that's not ten eight here we can

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.970 
have that's not ten eight here we can
see<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:19.270> so<00:05:19.870> with<00:05:20.140> that<00:05:20.290> being<00:05:20.500> said<00:05:20.770> it's

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
see it so with that being said it's

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.160 
see it so with that being said it's
pretty<00:05:21.130> close<00:05:21.460> if<00:05:21.820> the<00:05:22.030> guy<00:05:22.150> flipped<00:05:22.600> over<00:05:22.810> ten

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
pretty close if the guy flipped over ten

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.770 
pretty close if the guy flipped over ten
e<00:05:23.200> then<00:05:24.070> yeah<00:05:24.250> you<00:05:24.340> could<00:05:24.610> fold<00:05:24.820> but<00:05:25.660> if

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
e then yeah you could fold but if

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.720 
e then yeah you could fold but if
there's<00:05:25.960> ever<00:05:26.200> a<00:05:26.410> hand<00:05:26.680> that's<00:05:26.890> not<00:05:27.220> ten<00:05:27.550> eight

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
there's ever a hand that's not ten eight

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.720 
there's ever a hand that's not ten eight
here<00:05:28.000> then<00:05:28.540> you<00:05:28.660> can<00:05:28.870> call<00:05:29.080> and<00:05:29.860> again<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:30.520> think

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
here then you can call and again I think

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.700 
here then you can call and again I think
that<00:05:30.940> this<00:05:31.180> actually<00:05:31.870> might<00:05:32.110> have<00:05:32.230> worked<00:05:32.530> if

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
that this actually might have worked if

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:41.400 
that this actually might have worked if
Bo<00:05:33.070> didn't<00:05:33.400> have<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.640> flush<00:05:33.850> draw<00:05:34.120> oh<00:05:40.410> it's

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
Bo didn't have the flush draw oh it's

what<00:05:47.500> I<00:05:47.530> thought<00:05:47.680> I<00:05:47.740> didn't<00:05:48.010> think<00:05:48.070> it<00:05:48.250> was<00:05:48.340> two

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
what I thought I didn't think it was two

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.100 
what I thought I didn't think it was two
to<00:05:48.550> one<00:05:48.640> it's<00:05:49.000> like<00:05:49.150> four<00:05:49.480> hundred<00:05:49.690> four

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
to one it's like four hundred four

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.600 
to one it's like four hundred four
thirteen<00:05:50.530> he's<00:05:50.680> getting<00:05:50.920> like<00:05:51.040> three<00:05:51.280> to<00:05:51.430> one

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
thirteen he's getting like three to one

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.550 
thirteen he's getting like three to one
even<00:05:51.940> if<00:05:52.030> it<00:05:52.150> got<00:05:52.270> turned<00:05:52.420> out<00:05:52.660> 10<00:05:52.930> e<00:05:52.960> but<00:05:53.440> in

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
even if it got turned out 10 e but in

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.560 
even if it got turned out 10 e but in
essence<00:05:53.980> it's<00:05:54.130> still<00:05:54.310> 400<00:05:54.880> because<00:05:55.030> there's<00:05:55.510> a

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
essence it's still 400 because there's a

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.760 
essence it's still 400 because there's a
hundred<00:05:55.840> behind<00:05:56.080> notice<00:05:56.320> I'm<00:05:56.440> saying<00:05:56.620> it's

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
hundred behind notice I'm saying it's

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.440 
hundred behind notice I'm saying it's
four<00:05:56.950> hundred<00:05:56.980> four<00:05:57.340> thirteen<00:05:57.700> so<00:05:58.330> he's

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
four hundred four thirteen so he's

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.840 
four hundred four thirteen so he's
getting<00:05:58.600> over<00:05:59.230> three<00:05:59.530> two<00:05:59.620> one<00:05:59.800> if<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.730> guy

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850

turned<00:06:01.240> up<00:06:01.540> ten<00:06:01.870> eight<00:06:02.110> he<00:06:02.350> would<00:06:02.470> still<00:06:02.800> have

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
turned up ten eight he would still have

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:32.389 
maybe some of the time you don't you

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:33.790 
maybe some of the time you don't you
don't<00:06:32.510> notice<00:06:33.110> the<00:06:33.200> fact<00:06:33.350> that<00:06:33.440> you<00:06:33.590> backed

don't notice the fact that you backed

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.280 
don't notice the fact that you backed
into<00:06:33.980> a<00:06:34.100> flush<00:06:34.280> draw<00:06:34.720> he<00:06:35.720> never<00:06:35.900> looked<00:06:36.110> at<00:06:36.200> his

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
into a flush draw he never looked at his

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.840 
into a flush draw he never looked at his
cards<00:06:36.530> Ellen<00:06:36.770> saying<00:06:37.010> so<00:06:37.160> I<00:06:37.190> wonder<00:06:37.639> if<00:06:37.669> she

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:37.850 
cards Ellen saying so I wonder if she

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.280 
cards Ellen saying so I wonder if she
didn't<00:06:38.300> notice<00:06:38.480> that<00:06:38.660> he<00:06:38.870> had<00:06:38.990> a<00:06:39.020> flush<00:06:39.260> draw

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
didn't notice that he had a flush draw

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.150 
didn't notice that he had a flush draw
there<00:06:40.840> but<00:06:41.840> I<00:06:41.960> I<00:06:42.020> think<00:06:42.290> that<00:06:42.650> it's<00:06:42.919> the<00:06:43.130> right

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
there but I I think that it's the right

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.690 
there but I I think that it's the right
fold<00:06:43.850> if<00:06:44.389> you<00:06:45.350> didn't<00:06:45.680> have<00:06:45.830> a<00:06:45.860> flush<00:06:46.130> draw<00:06:46.160> I

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.700 
fold if you didn't have a flush draw I

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.640 
fold if you didn't have a flush draw I
think<00:06:47.270> that<00:06:47.389> you're<00:06:47.510> like<00:06:47.780> just<00:06:48.110> basically

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
think that you're like just basically

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.800 
think that you're like just basically
praying<00:06:49.130> that<00:06:49.850> the<00:06:49.970> guy<00:06:50.120> is<00:06:50.180> over<00:06:50.480> playing

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
praying that the guy is over playing

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.570 
praying that the guy is over playing
like<00:06:51.020> six<00:06:51.350> seven<00:06:51.500> with<00:06:51.770> diamonds<00:06:52.190> even<00:06:52.370> if<00:06:52.490> he

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
like six seven with diamonds even if he

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.010 
like six seven with diamonds even if he
has<00:06:52.730> six<00:06:53.000> seven<00:06:53.240> with<00:06:53.389> diamonds<00:06:53.780> he's<00:06:53.870> got<00:06:53.990> a

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
has six seven with diamonds he's got a

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.230 
has six seven with diamonds he's got a
bunch<00:06:54.230> outs<00:06:54.530> but<00:06:55.310> normally<00:06:55.730> that's<00:06:55.850> gonna<00:06:56.060> be

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
bunch outs but normally that's gonna be

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.540 
bunch outs but normally that's gonna be
ten<00:06:56.480> eight<00:06:56.690> or<00:06:57.260> a<00:06:57.380> set<00:06:57.650> of<00:06:57.680> sixes<00:06:58.100> you<00:06:58.370> know<00:06:58.460> if

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
ten eight or a set of sixes you know if

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.130 
ten eight or a set of sixes you know if
you<00:06:58.640> had<00:06:58.760> like<00:06:58.880> a<00:06:58.940> blackjack<00:06:59.270> nine<00:06:59.810> that's<00:07:00.020> a

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:00.140 
you had like a blackjack nine that's a

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.480 
you had like a blackjack nine that's a
tough<00:07:00.290> spot<00:07:00.500> to<00:07:00.560> make<00:07:00.800> but<00:07:01.010> I<00:07:01.040> think<00:07:01.250> you<00:07:01.340> can

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
tough spot to make but I think you can

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.950 
tough spot to make but I think you can
fool<00:07:01.640> but<00:07:01.820> with<00:07:01.970> a<00:07:02.000> hard<00:07:02.240> draw<00:07:02.419> you<00:07:02.660> can<00:07:02.780> never

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
fool but with a hard draw you can never

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.340 
fool but with a hard draw you can never
fold<00:07:03.230> you<00:07:03.830> take<00:07:04.010> a<00:07:04.040> little<00:07:04.130> break
