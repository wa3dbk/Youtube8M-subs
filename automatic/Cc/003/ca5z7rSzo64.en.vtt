00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.570
 the iphone 4s 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.570
 let's start 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.380
 one thing we see the features 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.960

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.010
 the iphone 4s a 3.5 inch screen 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.470
 the galaxy 4.3 color the cheese is 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.440
 practically the same slightly more 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:44.360
 thin the iphone in the upper part 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.790
 we find the headphone jack and also on 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.800
 iphone the power key starts 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.010
 left we find in both the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.040

 to put them in silent parts 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.440
 underlying instead we find the dear one for 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.470
 the insertion of the current and on the iphone 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.410
 microphone and speaker matches be 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.840
 instead on the samsung galaxy we find the 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.630
 power off button on 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.500
 iphone instead of antennas 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.500
 the insertion for the micro sim 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.940
 in both we have the camera of 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.950

 we also have virtual keys 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.460
 we also have brightness sensors 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.800
 proximity and ambient light on iphone 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.140
 implemented in one direction on the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.140
 samsung instead two different sensors 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.280
 we turn them on at the same time 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.740
 iphone we have a display is a tft 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.399
 additionally apple retina display on the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.460
 samsung galaxy with instead we have a 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.680
 display that beyond being bigger is 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.110
 also a super amoled 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.470

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.750
 inches on the samsung galaxy core 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:14.030
 on the iPhone 4s or four we have instead 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:18.920
 an apple tft retina display of 3.5 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:22.730
 inch he turned on a few seconds earlier 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.560
 the samsung galaxy q 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.239
 moreover, now I show myself the keys 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.500
 virtual that are precisely the dart 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.970
 back and the samsung galaxy menu 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.580
 on both we have a camera 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.319
 rear a flash camera mob up 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.900
 galaxy of 5 megapixels on iphone instead 8 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.600
 megapixels on the galaxy we don't even find 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.500
 the speaker on the part just a 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.500
 behind 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.010
 however, we open at the same time to use 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.650
 internet and social part 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.160
 of the other internet and then we go to 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.680
 visit and see who charge before the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.819
 our site was our point to have them 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.769
 dot as they have uploaded the site 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.900
 practically together maybe some 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.330
 thousandth of a second before the samsung 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.090
 the announced to stretch as the 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.500
 run of these two devices is everyone's 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.799
 and two 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.660
 512 megabytes of ram we now open as 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.349
 you saw we opened the site in 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.930
 demo version of alma in web version 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.780
 and now what goes to make a couple of 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.349
 pliers tosi both with iphone and with 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.819
 samsung galaxy q as you see indeed the 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.400
 galaxy tail some small in 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.290
 parliament on iphone instead none 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.019
 tried in this field as 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.370
 social and can be called the ace in the 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.370
 sleeve from the iphone 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.140
 we change the pages so we have that 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.740
 given to the old every two years 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.740
 smartphone 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.170
 let's change the department and then move on to 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.709
 multimedia department and compare the 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.709
 two cameras 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:38.089
 we discard with both devices 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:42.339
 two photos in active flash mode and one 

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:42.339
 evening instead in smart car mode 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.190
 as you can see the photo with flashes 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:01.630
 car came out much better to explain that 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:05.260
 it runs but the active flash photo output 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.620
 much less on iphone than us 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.620
 the real 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.610
 let's move on to youtube and see a 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.309
 video if both devices are in full 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.309
 so let's hear them also the audio 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.010
 Also this video I will end here 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.380
 I remember to leave a nice hunk if 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.180
 or sign up for the dog on the page 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.560
 facebook and the site you will see in 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.480
 overlay 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.260
 so we see each other next 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.860
 video 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:38.800
