hi there if you've got access to a
mailing<00:00:03.959> machine<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:05.930> you<00:00:06.930> need<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.230> make

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
mailing machine and you need to make

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.919 
mailing machine and you need to make
circle<00:00:07.919> plates<00:00:08.160> for<00:00:08.429> any<00:00:08.519> reason<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.540> you're

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
circle plates for any reason and you're

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.870 
circle plates for any reason and you're
not<00:00:10.080> quite<00:00:10.320> sure<00:00:10.349> how<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.830> do<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.250> here<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.849> a

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
not quite sure how to do it here is a

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.820 
not quite sure how to do it here is a
way<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.120> do<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:13.250> start<00:00:14.250> off<00:00:15.529> with<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> piece<00:00:16.800> of

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
way to do it start off with a piece of

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.779 
way to do it start off with a piece of
material<00:00:17.029> with<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.359> circle<00:00:18.960> drawn<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.439> it

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
material with the circle drawn on it

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.980 
material with the circle drawn on it
then<00:00:20.789> all<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:20.939> simply<00:00:21.180> do<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.539> because<00:00:21.900> you've

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
then all you simply do is because you've

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.290 
then all you simply do is because you've
got<00:00:22.109> your<00:00:22.260> Center<00:00:22.590> Point<00:00:22.830> marquee<00:00:23.310> drill<00:00:23.640> the

through it montaigne milling machine
obviously<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.790> live<00:00:33.890> home<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.219> machine<00:00:35.579> at

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
obviously you live home to machine at

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.330 
obviously you live home to machine at
the<00:00:35.820> exact<00:00:36.239> center<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.530> circle<00:00:38.040> you'll

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the exact center of the circle you'll

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.880 
the exact center of the circle you'll
your<00:00:39.260> drill<00:00:40.260> down<00:00:40.500> secure<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.340> your<00:00:42.180> plate<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
your drill down secure it your plate and

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.840 
your drill down secure it your plate and
then<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.820> tell<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.450> software<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:47.160> bring

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
then you just tell you software to bring

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.410 
then you just tell you software to bring
out<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:49.350> cutter<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:50.730> set<00:00:50.969> amount<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
out the cutter the set amount of

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
out the cutter the set amount of
distance<00:00:52.460> from<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.969> center<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.809> plate<00:00:54.989> ie

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
distance from the center of the plate ie

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.610 
distance from the center of the plate ie
your<00:00:56.250> radius<00:00:56.699> say<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.690> instance<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.320> six

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
your radius say for instance it's a six

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.310 
your radius say for instance it's a six
inch<00:00:58.859> circle<00:00:59.480> obviously<00:01:00.480> radius<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
inch circle obviously radius is going to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.889 
inch circle obviously radius is going to
be<00:01:01.410> three<00:01:01.649> entries<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.359> bring<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
be three entries so you bring it the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.469 
be three entries so you bring it the
three<00:01:04.140> inches<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.739> from<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.159> center<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.790> also

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
three inches out from the center I also

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.859 
three inches out from the center I also
allow<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.010> thickness<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.430> your<00:01:08.490> cutter

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
allow for the thickness of your cutter

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.929 
allow for the thickness of your cutter
so<00:01:09.869> adds<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:11.130> your<00:01:11.250> distance<00:01:11.640> from<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
so adds that to your distance from the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.320 
so adds that to your distance from the
center<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:13.369> away<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.400> go<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:15.030> bring<00:01:15.210> you

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
center and away you go just bring you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.140 
center and away you go just bring you
cutter<00:01:15.600> down<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:17.330> spin<00:01:18.330> your<00:01:18.509> material<00:01:19.110> and

each pass round butts in this instance

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.460 
each pass round butts in this instance
I'm<00:01:32.220> using<00:01:32.430> what's<00:01:32.670> called<00:01:32.759> die<00:01:33.119> bond<00:01:33.470> which

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
I'm using what's called die bond which

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.380 
I'm using what's called die bond which
is<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> thin<00:01:35.009> layer<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.280> aluminium<00:01:35.759> than<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
is a thin layer of aluminium than a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.270 
is a thin layer of aluminium than a
composite<00:01:36.930> material<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.740> another<00:01:38.009> thin

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
composite material then another thin

composite material then another thin
layer<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.610> aluminium<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> was<00:01:40.170> able<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.500> do

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
layer of aluminium so I was able to do

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.609 
layer of aluminium so I was able to do
this<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.460> cut<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.770> that's<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:44.610> done<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
this in one cut so that's one done and

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:56.810 
this in one cut so that's one done and
which<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:52.100> M<00:01:53.100> seven<00:01:53.790> inches<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.360> diameter<00:01:55.820> need

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
which is M seven inches in diameter need

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940 
which is M seven inches in diameter need

using the die bonding material which I

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.230 
using the die bonding material which I
mentioned<00:02:28.040> which<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.250> aluminium<00:02:29.610> then

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
mentioned which is aluminium then

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.760 
mentioned which is aluminium then
composite<00:02:30.870> material<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.620> aluminium<00:02:31.920> again

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
composite material and aluminium again

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.440 
composite material and aluminium again
and<00:02:34.770> if<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.220> was<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.640> take<00:02:35.940> him<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:37.880> wheel<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.239> this

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
and if I was to take him a wheel to this

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.410 
and if I was to take him a wheel to this
a<00:02:39.750> sanding<00:02:40.440> wheel<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.890> could<00:02:41.520> take<00:02:41.730> off<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.209> top

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
a sanding wheel I could take off the top

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.800 
a sanding wheel I could take off the top
material<00:02:42.709> then<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:44.850> show<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.570> aluminium

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
material then to show the aluminium

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.490 
material then to show the aluminium
underneath<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:48.180> one<00:02:48.480> just<00:02:48.720> scratched<00:02:49.230> away

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
underneath this one just scratched away

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.199 
underneath this one just scratched away
because<00:02:50.250> they<00:02:50.430> haven't<00:02:50.550> got<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> proper<00:02:51.060> wheel

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
because they haven't got a proper wheel

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.260 
because they haven't got a proper wheel
to<00:02:51.570> do<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.110> but<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.790> dye<00:02:53.940> bond

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
to do it but this is the dye bond

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.640 
to do it but this is the dye bond
material<00:02:55.160> it's<00:02:56.160> quite<00:02:56.400> good<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.820> it's<00:02:56.970> a

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
material it's quite good and it's a

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.259 
material it's quite good and it's a
fairly<00:02:58.650> strong<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:01.850> these<00:03:02.850> need<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.120> be

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
fairly strong so these need to be

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.259 
fairly strong so these need to be
doubled<00:03:03.780> up<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.680> these<00:03:05.430> are<00:03:05.670> think<00:03:05.910> these<00:03:06.030> are

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
doubled up and these are think these are

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.220 
doubled up and these are think these are
approximately<00:03:07.080> 125<00:03:08.959> thousandths<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.019> an<00:03:10.140> inch

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
approximately 125 thousandths of an inch

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.509 
approximately 125 thousandths of an inch
left<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.130> wanted<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:13.070> 250,000<00:03:14.070> quarter

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
left so I wanted it to 250,000 quarter

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.110 
left so I wanted it to 250,000 quarter
of<00:03:14.610> an<00:03:14.670> inch<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.989> these<00:03:16.170> will<00:03:16.440> be<00:03:16.620> doubled<00:03:16.950> up

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
of an inch so these will be doubled up

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.819 
of an inch so these will be doubled up
but<00:03:18.120> they<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:19.049> that's<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.650> show<00:03:19.799> you

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
but they do that's just to show you

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.000 
but they do that's just to show you
something<00:03:20.100> else<00:03:20.430> which<00:03:20.700> have<00:03:20.850> done<00:03:21.030> today

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
something else which have done today

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.400 
something else which have done today
