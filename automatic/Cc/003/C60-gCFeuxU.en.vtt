00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.150 
hey guys fan out here today I have a fix
for<00:00:06.029> my<00:00:06.240> box<00:00:06.690> whopper<00:00:06.960> which<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.529> broken<00:00:07.830> in

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
for my box whopper which is broken in

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.180 
for my box whopper which is broken in
1.5<00:00:09.769> so<00:00:11.059> you<00:00:12.059> can<00:00:12.240> fix<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.809> two<00:00:13.110> ways<00:00:13.190> first

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
1.5 so you can fix it in two ways first

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.129 
1.5 so you can fix it in two ways first
I<00:00:14.400> want<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.610> show<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:15.690> where<00:00:16.020> you

I want to show you this one where you

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.439 
I want to show you this one where you
just<00:00:16.320> place<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.800> sticky<00:00:17.130> pistons<00:00:17.580> or<00:00:17.789> normal

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
just place to sticky pistons or normal

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.720 
just place to sticky pistons or normal
business<00:00:18.810> for<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.109> matter<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.890> those<00:00:20.430> places

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
business for that matter in those places

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.259 
business for that matter in those places
and<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:22.170> got<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.350> replace<00:00:22.769> your<00:00:23.220> block<00:00:23.730> like

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
and you got to replace your block like

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.920 
and you got to replace your block like
so<00:00:24.900> now<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:26.070> work<00:00:26.310> i<00:00:26.730> also<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.810> an

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
so now this work i also have an

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.589 
so now this work i also have an
alternate<00:00:28.260> design<00:00:28.410> which<00:00:28.920> doesn't<00:00:29.730> mess<00:00:30.570> with

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
alternate design which doesn't mess with

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.270 
alternate design which doesn't mess with
the<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:35.000> relative<00:00:36.000> dimensions<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.980> first

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
the the relative dimensions of the first

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.040 
the the relative dimensions of the first
one<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:40.520> yeah<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.030> how<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.210> build<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.719> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
one and yeah this is how to build it you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.869 
one and yeah this is how to build it you
just<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.559> your<00:00:43.590> normal<00:00:44.190> sticky<00:00:44.399> business<00:00:44.579> I

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
just have your normal sticky business I

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.639 
just have your normal sticky business I
out<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.510> three<00:00:45.750> blocks<00:00:46.020> included

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
out with your three blocks included

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.690 
out with your three blocks included
already<00:00:48.620> again<00:00:49.620> through<00:00:49.860> repeaters<00:00:50.370> going

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
already again through repeaters going

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.260 
already again through repeaters going
out<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.210> two<00:00:51.480> tix<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:52.680> make<00:00:53.550> them<00:00:53.760> go<00:00:53.940> into<00:00:54.120> you

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
out on two tix now make them go into you

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.470 
out on two tix now make them go into you
let's<00:00:54.480> done<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:55.430> torch<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.789> either<00:00:57.210> one<00:00:57.420> of

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
let's done a torch on either one of

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.020 
let's done a torch on either one of
these<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.870> block<00:00:58.469> right<00:00:58.680> there<00:00:58.859> facing<00:00:59.670> into

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
these a block right there facing into

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.130 
these a block right there facing into
this<00:01:00.359> block<00:01:01.129> this<00:01:02.129> should<00:01:02.280> extend<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.140> sticky

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
this block this should extend the sticky

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
this block this should extend the sticky
piston<00:01:04.530> facing<00:01:04.739> down<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:07.100> then<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.670> just

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
piston facing down and then you just

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.270 
piston facing down and then you just
want<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.510> place<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:11.540> soon-to-be<00:01:12.540> ceiling

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
want to place your soon-to-be ceiling

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.690 
want to place your soon-to-be ceiling
like<00:01:14.280> so

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
like so

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.370 
like so
and<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:18.280> works<00:01:18.579> as<00:01:18.880> well<00:01:19.079> now<00:01:20.079> the<00:01:20.140> only

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
and that works as well now the only

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.760 
and that works as well now the only
downside<00:01:21.039> of<00:01:21.369> this<00:01:21.670> design<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.600> that<00:01:22.689> it<00:01:23.170> uses

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
downside of this design is that it uses

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.600 
downside of this design is that it uses
the<00:01:24.630> ceiling<00:01:25.630> for<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:26.920> actual<00:01:27.369> circuit<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:30.250> as

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
the ceiling for the actual circuit so as

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.830 
the ceiling for the actual circuit so as
you<00:01:30.670> can<00:01:30.789> see<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:31.060> glass<00:01:31.329> is<00:01:31.539> going<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.780> be

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
you can see the glass is going to be

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.069 
you can see the glass is going to be
your<00:01:31.929> ceiling<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:33.450> yeah<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:34.509> need<00:01:34.810> these

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
your ceiling and yeah you need these

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:41.270 
your ceiling and yeah you need these
blocks<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:35.649> it<00:01:35.799> can<00:01:36.009> be<00:01:36.159> glass<00:01:36.549> or<00:01:40.110> whatever

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
blocks that it can be glass or whatever

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.230 
blocks that it can be glass or whatever
they<00:01:42.280> can't<00:01:42.579> be<00:01:44.429> transparent<00:01:45.429> blocks<00:01:45.759> where

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
they can't be transparent blocks where

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.440 
they can't be transparent blocks where
you<00:01:46.360> can't<00:01:46.630> place<00:01:46.929> redstone<00:01:47.200> wrong<00:01:48.179> so<00:01:49.179> yeah

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
you can't place redstone wrong so yeah

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.330 
you can't place redstone wrong so yeah
that's<00:01:49.720> basically<00:01:49.959> a<00:01:50.259> quick<00:01:50.679> and<00:01:50.830> easy<00:01:50.890> fix

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
that's basically a quick and easy fix

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.639 
that's basically a quick and easy fix
thanks<00:01:52.119> for<00:01:52.240> watching<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:53.229> think<00:01:53.439> you<00:01:53.530> guys
