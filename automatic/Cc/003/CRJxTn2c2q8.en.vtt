00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
you can see where it really you could

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.130 
you can see where it really you could
tell<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> growth<00:01:07.560> difference<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:09.110> then<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

little bit after that you couldn't tell
any<00:01:11.369> growth<00:01:11.640> difference<00:01:12.119> because<00:01:12.570> deer<00:01:13.020> were

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
any growth difference because deer were

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.039 
any growth difference because deer were
eating<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.530> much<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.869> started<00:01:15.869> bringing
