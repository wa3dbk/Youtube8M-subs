00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello I am maria of the little 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.970
 manufacture partners of the beautiful 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.040
 school and I'm going to show you how 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.840
 make a ring with polymer clay 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.599
 to make a wave of polymer clay 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.400
 we are going to need first of all 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.330
 polymer clay found in large 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.970
 surfaces we hedge creative hobbies 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.640
 I use a cane the checkerboard that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.140
 I have previously manufactured we will have 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.670
 need a cutting blade 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.080
 this one is specific for dough 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.210
 polymer but you can use a 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.329
 cutter blade we are going to need 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.370
 of cellophane films of a small wins 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.530
 piece this one is star- shaped this 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.370
 can be what we want a little 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.680
 tool to help with modeling and a 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.570
 small plexi plate for mounting 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.960
 of the ring we will need glues 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.910
 epoxy lee components and a support 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.329
 so offered my ring i'm going to use 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.670
 a little a little block of one of the two 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.719
 colors that I have already used in the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.290
 checkered I chose the green I'm doing a 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.430
 little ball rolling well in the hollow of 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.130
 the hand come warm it up and soften it 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.100
 to be able to overwrite it now with 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.680
 the little plate I crushed it iccat 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.710
 mans being careful that she 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.900
 become too thin and I have the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.150
 sphere slightly larger than my 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.820
 cookie cutter I 'm not there yet I 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:36.979
 continue now I'm going to cover this 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.530
 support with a slice of makan world 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.759
 checkerboard I cut in the checkerboard cane a 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.250
 slice not too thin on the whole 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.240
 height being careful to be 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.420
 regular on the thickness of my slice 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.750
 and this plate before the break and I 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.549
 pulls very lightly to get in shape 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.689
 about the support i'm coming here 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.190
 laid on it I applied it firmly for 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.050
 that they really stick to the support 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.990
 Now I'll cut it with 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.020
 the cookie cutter but before 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.560
 I take cellophane I put it on 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.070
 my job before cutting to 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:28.470
 the cookie cutter what will give us a 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:31.950
 rounded side to the finished piece I support 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.810
 very strong to get to the end I 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.090
 can help me from this support of this 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.330
 little plate I turn a little bit of 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.640
 way to separate the inside of my 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:53.970
 edge is here I remove the cellophane and I 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:57.300
 remove the edge and I have a nice pretty 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.800
 little star in friends to be able 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.980
 to finish bad now I have to 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.260
 crisis so in an electric oven at 130 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.250
 degrees for about fifteen minutes 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.620
 and I could do the editing 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.840
 here is the wave came out of the oven she 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.970
 is cooked it is hard I will be able 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.820
 stuck on its support it's a 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.330
 adjustable support at the back there is a 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.160
 fault that opens it up to the waist 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.860
 from his finger so now I 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:28.680
 position my ring face against the table 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.010
 I prepare my support right next to me 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:36.690
 am going to do my editing with a bi glue 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:39.120
 component that I play uses in parts 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.090
 equal on a piece of cardboard 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.810
 so I have to succeed in having the same 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.820
 volume of the two necks I mix them 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.020
 intimately 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.700
 you really have to make sure that the 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.310
 mixture is well done if not catalysis 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.650
 risk of not taking and the glue of 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.610
 this thing it will never be this one 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.010
 is a quick glue 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.650
 so I hurry up and take a little 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:06.780
 little glue on the stick I come on 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:09.750
 put on the stand and rings and I 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:15.810
 poses on my ring my support in 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:18.109
 pressing and for better holding 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.850
 I will make sure that the glue 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.330
 shows up slightly back on the 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.790
 support 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.970
 I put my support in the right axis 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.580
 according to the ring of its shape and 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.000
 I let quietly take mahb 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.430
 defined I can for a more beautiful effect the 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.990
 to paint here now you know 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.080
 how to make a paste ring 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.080
 polymer
