and<00:01:52.880> we'll<00:01:53.540> just<00:01:53.660> start<00:01:53.840> running<00:01:54.170> our<00:01:54.590> spline

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
and we'll just start running our spline

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.130 
and we'll just start running our spline
go<00:01:55.310> ahead<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:55.520> cut<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.850> spline<00:01:56.180> this<00:01:56.840> piece

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
go ahead and cut you a spline this piece

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.840 
go ahead and cut you a spline this piece
is<00:01:57.320> more<00:01:57.560> than<00:01:57.680> enough<00:01:57.800> but<00:01:58.190> you<00:01:58.340> know<00:01:58.460> enough

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
is more than enough but you know enough

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.250 
is more than enough but you know enough
to<00:01:58.970> get<00:01:59.090> through<00:01:59.270> plus<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.750> little<00:01:59.990> bit<00:02:00.110> on<00:02:00.230> each

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
to get through plus a little bit on each

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.010 
to get through plus a little bit on each
side<00:02:03.070> that's<00:02:04.070> your<00:02:04.370> open<00:02:05.150> piece<00:02:05.360> here<00:02:05.660> just

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
side that's your open piece here just

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.930 
side that's your open piece here just
want<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.200> make<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.350> little<00:02:06.729> kind<00:02:07.729> of<00:02:07.790> try<00:02:07.910> to

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
want to make a little kind of try to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.460 
want to make a little kind of try to

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
use your flat head again and I open that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.480 
use your flat head again and I open that
up<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.260> little<00:02:12.350> bit<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.330> just<00:02:14.330> start<00:02:15.490> pushing

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
up a little bit and just start pushing

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:24.490 
up a little bit and just start pushing
this<00:02:16.580> plan<00:02:16.880> through<00:02:22.750> hung<00:02:23.750> up<00:02:23.870> anywhere<00:02:24.230> try

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
this plan through hung up anywhere try

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.410 
this plan through hung up anywhere try
to<00:02:24.560> tuck<00:02:24.830> in<00:02:25.040> some<00:02:25.310> more<00:02:27.850> yeah<00:02:28.850> I'm<00:02:28.970> gonna

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
to tuck in some more yeah I'm gonna

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.930 
to tuck in some more yeah I'm gonna
going<00:02:29.780> through<00:02:29.990> there<00:02:30.200> yeah<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.670> once<00:02:31.850> it

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
going through there yeah and once it

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.340 
going through there yeah and once it
gets<00:02:32.000> down<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.390> end<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.810> may<00:02:32.959> get<00:02:33.140> caught

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
gets down to the end you may get caught

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.460 
gets down to the end you may get caught
up<00:02:33.500> again<00:02:33.590> on<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.190> seam<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:36.110> that's<00:02:36.350> where

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
up again on that seam so that's where

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.050 
up again on that seam so that's where
your<00:02:36.650> flat-head<00:02:36.860> screwdriver<00:02:37.040> can<00:02:37.730> come<00:02:37.940> in

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
your flat-head screwdriver can come in

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.050 
your flat-head screwdriver can come in
again<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.570> kind<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.780> open<00:02:38.959> up<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.850> open<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:40.940> up

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
again to kind of open up the open it up

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.490 
again to kind of open up the open it up
a<00:02:41.150> little<00:02:41.300> bit<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.660> spline<00:02:42.020> you<00:02:42.170> come<00:02:42.350> all

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
a little bit so that spline you come all

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.310 
a little bit so that spline you come all
the<00:02:42.590> way<00:02:42.620> through<00:02:46.510> just<00:02:47.510> like<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.140> then

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
the way through just like that and then

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:58.120 
the way through just like that and then
trim<00:02:48.590> off

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.100 

you<00:02:59.120> know<00:02:59.180> what<00:02:59.360> I'm<00:02:59.450> gonna<00:02:59.630> do<00:02:59.780> this<00:02:59.870> walk

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
you know what I'm gonna do this walk

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.110 
you know what I'm gonna do this walk
around<00:03:00.410> in<00:03:00.560> front<00:03:00.740> of<00:03:00.980> chair<00:03:01.250> okay<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:04.120> let's

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
around in front of chair okay and let's

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.890 
around in front of chair okay and let's
say<00:03:05.300> come<00:03:05.660> out<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.170> pull<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.800> down<00:03:06.830> way<00:03:07.430> we<00:03:07.580> do

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
say come out and pull it down way we do

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.270 
say come out and pull it down way we do
make<00:03:08.900> sure<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.230> centered<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.950> might<00:03:10.100> have

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
make sure it's centered you might have

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.090 
make sure it's centered you might have
to<00:03:10.460> pitch<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.390> back<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.600> get<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.100> go

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
to pitch it in the back to get it go

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.560 
to pitch it in the back to get it go
through<00:03:13.340> all<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.730> way<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.090> basically<00:03:14.210> just

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
through all the way but basically just

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.240 
through all the way but basically just
what<00:03:14.720> you<00:03:14.870> want<00:03:15.080> it<00:03:15.230> through<00:03:15.470> all<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.830> way<00:03:15.980> you

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
what you want it through all the way you

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.530 
what you want it through all the way you
want<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.460> to<00:03:16.520> ride<00:03:16.820> right<00:03:17.180> there<00:03:17.390> on<00:03:17.510> that

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
want it to ride right there on that

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.600 
want it to ride right there on that
spline<00:03:18.140> that<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.620> got<00:03:18.800> they<00:03:19.160> just<00:03:19.430> put

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
spline that you got they just put

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.560 
spline that you got they just put
through<00:03:19.850> there<00:03:20.120> all<00:03:20.540> right<00:03:23.440> up<00:03:24.440> here

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
through there all right up here

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.360 
through there all right up here
it<00:03:26.570> might<00:03:26.720> get<00:03:26.870> pinched<00:03:27.290> on<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.560> seam<00:03:27.770> so<00:03:28.130> you

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
it might get pinched on the seam so you

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.820 
it might get pinched on the seam so you
got<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:28.910> tuck<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.090> in<00:03:29.390> with<00:03:29.570> your<00:03:29.720> fingers<00:03:30.020> to

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
got to tuck that in with your fingers to

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.470 
got to tuck that in with your fingers to
get<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.010> as<00:03:31.190> much<00:03:31.370> as<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:31.880> can<00:03:32.090> which<00:03:32.300> that's

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
get it as much as you can which that's

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.170 
get it as much as you can which that's
pretty<00:03:33.260> good<00:03:33.530> right<00:03:33.740> there<00:03:36.280> see<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.430> back<00:03:37.670> a

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
pretty good right there see the back a

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.900 
pretty good right there see the back a
little<00:03:39.170> process<00:03:39.740> here<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.280> is<00:03:40.460> if<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:40.790> want

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
little process here this is if you want

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.790 
little process here this is if you want
to<00:03:40.970> catch<00:03:41.090> them<00:03:41.240> from<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.480> side<00:03:41.750> yeah<00:03:42.620> that's

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
to catch them from the side yeah that's

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.100 
to catch them from the side yeah that's
all<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.010> way<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.490> right<00:03:43.730> there<00:03:44.080> nice<00:03:45.080> and

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
all the way in right there nice and

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.520 
all the way in right there nice and
tight<00:03:46.240> and<00:03:47.240> it's<00:03:47.540> a<00:03:47.600> good<00:03:47.750> time<00:03:47.960> now<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.200> try<00:03:48.470> to

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
tight and it's a good time now to try to

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.570 
tight and it's a good time now to try to
you<00:03:48.710> know<00:03:48.770> Center<00:03:49.100> it<00:03:49.220> up<00:03:49.340> as<00:03:49.550> much<00:03:49.700> as<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:49.970> can

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
you know Center it up as much as you can

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.900 
you know Center it up as much as you can
that's<00:03:52.580> pretty<00:03:53.030> good<00:03:53.300> okay<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:54.980> how<00:03:55.580> much<00:03:55.700> do

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
that's pretty good okay so how much do

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.300 
that's pretty good okay so how much do
we<00:03:55.970> got<00:03:56.180> to<00:03:56.300> get<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.630> down<00:03:57.070> before<00:03:58.070> we<00:03:58.190> get

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
we got to get that down before we get

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.860 
we got to get that down before we get
the<00:03:58.460> screws<00:03:58.820> in<00:03:59.150> yeah<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.480> should<00:03:59.720> look

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
the screws in yeah it should look

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.420 
the screws in yeah it should look
something<00:03:59.930> like<00:04:00.230> that<00:04:00.350> and<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:01.010> can<00:04:01.130> see<00:04:01.280> it's

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
something like that and you can see it's
