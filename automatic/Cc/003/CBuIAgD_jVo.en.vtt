say just taking classes and stuff but

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.130 
say just taking classes and stuff but
for<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.700> do<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:35.060> like<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.630> was<00:01:35.810> just<00:01:36.020> very

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
for to do that like it was just very

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.719 
for to do that like it was just very
hard<00:01:36.439> for<00:01:36.560> me<00:01:36.680> because<00:01:36.859> it<00:01:37.009> is<00:01:37.250> like<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.520> can't

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
hard for me because it is like you can't

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.580 
hard for me because it is like you can't
fake<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.479> lyrics<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.109> music<00:01:39.439> was

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
fake that the lyrics to the music was

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.569 
fake that the lyrics to the music was
very<00:01:39.680> very<00:01:40.310> inspiring<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:41.600> it<00:01:41.810> was<00:01:42.140> um

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
very very inspiring and it was um

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.529 
very very inspiring and it was um
she'sshe<00:01:43.579> based<00:01:43.789> it<00:01:43.939> off<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.390> she

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
she'sshe based it off of that and she

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:45.999 
she'sshe based it off of that and she
explained<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:44.899> me<00:01:44.990> that<00:01:45.079> you<00:01:45.530> really<00:01:45.560> have<00:01:45.890> to

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
explained to me that you really have to

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.770 
explained to me that you really have to
listen<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.579> lyrics<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.179> really<00:01:47.659> need

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
listen to the lyrics and you really need

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.160 
listen to the lyrics and you really need
to<00:01:47.960> embody<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:49.909> i<00:01:49.939> guess<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:50.840> helped<00:01:51.079> me

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
to embody it so i guess that helped me

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.770
