00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.670
 the professional repair system 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.889
 for frontex windshields make 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.990
 permanent repairs and proof of 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.570
 air in most windshields 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.000
 breaks of up to one and a quarter of 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.580
 inch on the windshield shaped like 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.100
 Ox-eye stars or combined 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.530
 can be repaired in just minutes 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.960
 using this last system in the 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.690
 technology the repairs should be 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.150
 made in the shade or outside the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.670
 direct sunlight when the windshield 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.190
 The temperature is not hot to touch 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.269
 optimum windshield must be between 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.670
 50 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit is important 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.979
 that the resin does not come in contact with 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.110
 the surface of the termination or 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:57.010
 painting the car because it can 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.690
 cause damage first use the thumbtack 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.210
 included to clean any piece 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.030
 of loose glass in the damaged area then 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.670
 Use the towel dipped in alcohol to 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.130
 clean around the damaged area by 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.990
 inside and outside it is suggested that 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.110
 Place a cloth under the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.530
 windshield to contain any 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.750
 without it falling during the repair 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.240
 remove the protective layer on one side of the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.850
 adhesive disc with tongue towards 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.860
 up aligns the hole in the disc 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.310
 Adhesive with the center of the damaged area 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.110
 Apply the disc to the windshield 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.479
 making sure the whole disk does 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.940
 contact with the windshield looking at the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.460
 disc from the inside of the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.920
 automobile verify there are no bubbles 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.140
 of air is very important that the disc 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.170
 have a clean and free seal 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.330
 air bubbles then remove the layer 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.940
 protective of the other side of the disc 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.520
 adhesive align the pedestal tongue 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.920
 with the tongue of the adhesive disc and 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.530
 press firmly against the disc 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.050
 ensuring that there is a solid seal without 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.840
 air bubbles uncover the tube from the 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.759
 resin with the lid away from your face to the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.100
 same as the painted surface of the 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.470
 automobile I cut the nozzle of the tube 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.959
 about an eighth of an inch 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.600
 to open the same place the mouthpiece 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.880
 inside the pedestal opening and with 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.200
 Careful tighten the tube to load the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.660
 resin in it 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.030
 must apply approximately three 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.580
 quarters of resin on the pedestal 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.580
 clean any residue from the nozzle 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.010
 of the tube cover the tube and save it for 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.290
 future use make sure that the plunger is 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.630
 pushed completely into the syringe 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.900
 Carefully twist the syringe in the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.660
 pedestal the pedestal and the syringe should 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.120
 of being well adjusted holding the 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.860
 syringe with one hand ale the plunger with 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.640
 the other hand until you reach the second 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.099
 lower mark lock the plunger in the 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.650
 lower mark by turning the mark on the 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.930
 plunger towards the clip the clip system 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.480
 with spring so that the plunger remains 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.970
 secured on your site this acts as 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.579
 a vacuum cleaner extracting the air from the 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.130
 break leaving the resins without bubbles 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.040
 of air let stand for 10 minutes 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.220
 these 10 minutes allows the resin 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.310
 settle and move any bubble 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.950
 of remaining air after 10 minutes 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.290
 temporarily remove the syringe from 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.750
 pedestal ensuring that the plunger is 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.830
 keep at the lowest mark this 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.140
 allows me to enter 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.360
 air in the syringe keeping the plunger 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.330
 in the lowest mark with care 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.470
 return the syringe to the pedestal 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.170
 twisting the syringe in the can be 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.510
 as he did previously holding the 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.910
 syringe with one hand with the other hand 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.130
 twist the plunger until it comes out of the 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.190
 lower mark and push delicately 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.340
 down lock the plunger on the mark 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.010
 higher twist the plunger by working it 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.670
 on your site and let stand at least 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.370
 20 minutes this forces the resin to the area 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.650
 damaged after 20 minutes remove the 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.440
 syringe from the pedestal with the help of a 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.620
 razor blade detach the edges and 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.350
 then carefully the pedestal and disc 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.350
 glass adhesive clean any 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.049
 resin residue of the glass remove the 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.299
 Resin tube cap and carefully 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.360
 apply a drop of resin to the hole 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.430
 in the damaged area place the band of 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.280
 yellow cured on the damaged area 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.740
 to contain the resin with the help of 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.590
 a razor blade remove the bubbles 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.160
 of air to smooth the curing band 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.380
 is 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.470
 in the vehicle in direct sunlight 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.240
 and let it sit for about 15 minutes 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.000
 the resin heals with the rays 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.220
 ultraviolet rays of natural sunlight in 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.860
 cloudy days is required at least 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.440
 one hour of healing once the resin 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.320
 has cured carefully remove the band from 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.590
 cured taking off the windshield if 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.930
 the surface of the glass is uniform use 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.420
 a razor blade to remove 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.640
 Any excess of cured resin from 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.710
 windshield clean the windshield 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.890
 again with the towel moistened in 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.170
 alcohol in some cases it is possible that 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.500
 the repair does not completely remove the 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:18.080
 imperfection notwithstanding the area will be 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.390
 repaired thus preventing the breakage
