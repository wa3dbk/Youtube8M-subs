00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.490
 -20 degrees we do not see the sun during 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.340
 two days the idea is that at one time 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.070
 given the young people understand that we are 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.119
 in the discomfort we live tests 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.160
 in a situation of a more body to 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.510
 this evening on the menu 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.270
 it's not an extravagant menu there is that 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.160
 hot water and that's it too 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.100
 we will meet in the mountains if we 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.540
 wants to show them what we are going to live 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.610
 for two years we must also give 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.950
 the example from the start it's in this 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.760
 selection 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.480
 I specify that it is really 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.640
 experimental 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.460
 we never never work from 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.110
 this way there really purpose it was 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.420
 really to tell me good guys they 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.960
 will happen and son will arrive they 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.430
 will climb 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.840
 you will climb what tomorrow there is 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.810
 two way mixed that are beautiful 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.399
 voices that are 30 meters out of 20 is 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.680
 really climbing you are going to 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.810
 to please you and be selected 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.830
 or not because what I thought 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.060
 you will remember 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.590
 long 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.960
 these two days and that's going to be a 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.509
 part that will not necessarily be a 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.040
 suffering or extreme stress but at 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.539
 the less you go you at least go 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.539
 shoot something interesting 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.460
 it's an experience that will last two 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.800
 years behind these two years every 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.800
 all the young people who lived in this group 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.040
 for 20 years remember all the 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.040
 return 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.650
 which they are ok mountaineering 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.820
 from climbing 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.830
 many did until the gym dance 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.120
 swimming cliff but the mountain is 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.399
 something that know me since 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.220
 not very long finally and so 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.540
 and how he sees their 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.000
 progression in there how do they get 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.140
 project behind on their lives 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.980
 so what is it going to bring them 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.769
 in their life and then behind they go 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.120
 integrate a group so how does it 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.799
 sees the group how they are 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.120
 see them in the group 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.269
 what can the group 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.060
 bring what can they come 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.319
 to the group 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.640
 we talk a lot about the esprit de corps of 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.939
 the granted accord is something 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.530
 recurrent mountaineering me 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:46.159
 today what I want is to have 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.260
 a team is no longer a rope and that 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.209
 this team she makes it constitutes 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.859
 a rope and complete 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.099
 there are nine individuals and the six strings and 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.099
 of girl 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.700
 you two 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.950
 m 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.370
 the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.370
 I
