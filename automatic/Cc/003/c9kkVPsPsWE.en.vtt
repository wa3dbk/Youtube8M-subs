and they're going to take this exact
shape<00:01:15.540> we're<00:01:15.869> gonna<00:01:15.990> move<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.320> back<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.860> one

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
shape we're gonna move it back not one

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.399 
shape we're gonna move it back not one
fret<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:17.939> two<00:01:18.299> frets<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.780> whole<00:01:19.140> step

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
fret but two frets so whole step

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.250 
fret but two frets so whole step
backwards

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
backwards

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.360 
backwards
it<00:01:22.100> should<00:01:22.400> form<00:01:22.640> this<00:01:22.790> shape<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.420> for<00:01:23.900> for<00:01:24.560> to

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
it should form this shape so for for to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.790 
it should form this shape so for for to
open<00:01:25.870> open<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.780> then<00:01:30.200> finally<00:01:30.620> we're<00:01:30.740> gonna

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
open open and then finally we're gonna

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.550

move<00:01:31.100> everything<00:01:31.940> back<00:01:32.240> another<00:01:32.900> half<00:01:33.230> step

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
move everything back another half step

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.790 
move everything back another half step
so<00:01:34.300> we'll<00:01:35.300> get<00:01:35.450> into<00:01:35.570> this<00:01:35.780> shape<00:01:36.050> and<00:01:36.530> then<00:01:36.680> we

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
so we'll get into this shape and then we

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.620 
so we'll get into this shape and then we
just<00:01:36.980> want<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.190> move<00:01:37.310> our<00:01:37.520> ring<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.180> our<00:01:38.420> pinky

back<00:01:39.020> another<00:01:39.500> half<00:01:39.800> step<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:40.370> now<00:01:40.910> we<00:01:40.970> have

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
back another half step so now we have

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.880 
back another half step so now we have
open<00:01:42.950> LOI<00:01:43.190> our<00:01:43.780> ring<00:01:44.780> finger<00:01:44.810> on<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.410> second
