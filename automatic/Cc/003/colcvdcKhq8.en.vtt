turns<00:01:04.140> out<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> well-run<00:01:05.070> recycling

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
turns out that a well-run recycling

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.100 
turns out that a well-run recycling
program<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.150> actually<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.750> cheaper<00:01:06.960> than

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
program can actually be cheaper than

program can actually be cheaper than
landfilling

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
landfilling

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.770 
landfilling
here's<00:01:08.460> why<00:01:08.700> landfills<00:01:09.330> are<00:01:09.450> owned<00:01:09.630> by

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
here's why landfills are owned by

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.390 
here's why landfills are owned by
private<00:01:09.960> companies<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.710> cities<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.280> pay

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
private companies and cities have to pay

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.950 
private companies and cities have to pay
money<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.939> dump<00:01:12.150> their<00:01:12.270> garbage<00:01:12.299> into<00:01:12.810> them

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
money to dump their garbage into them

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.200 
money to dump their garbage into them
it's<00:01:13.290> kind<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.650> buying<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.979> condo<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.670> condo

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
it's kind of like buying a condo a condo

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.730 
it's kind of like buying a condo a condo
for<00:01:15.240> garbage<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.960> probably<00:01:16.350> used<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> be

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
for garbage it probably used to be

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.530 
for garbage it probably used to be
cheaper<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.130> dump<00:01:17.400> our<00:01:17.549> waste<00:01:17.729> awhile<00:01:18.060> ago<00:01:18.240> but

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
cheaper to dump our waste awhile ago but

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.090 
cheaper to dump our waste awhile ago but
we<00:01:18.900> also<00:01:19.080> used<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.439> dump<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> lot<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.830> garbage

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
we also used to dump a lot of garbage

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.890 
we also used to dump a lot of garbage
into<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> ocean<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.479> probably<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.869> good

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
into the ocean so it's probably a good

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.359 
into the ocean so it's probably a good
thing<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> system<00:01:22.740> has<00:01:22.830> changed<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> bit

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369

question does recycling save us energy

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.100 
question does recycling save us energy
the<00:02:05.610> answer<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.030> yes<00:02:06.210> well<00:02:06.479> probably<00:02:06.719> doesn't

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the answer is yes well probably doesn't
