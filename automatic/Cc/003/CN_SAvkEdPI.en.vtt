 and then people this time we go with a video 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.349

 during the match will be the same in the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.930
 two games 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 good staff first of all would 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.199
 to warn that the launch of the two 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.020
 games are made in very 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.570
 different but in both games are 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.550
 balanced and has a dynamic of 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.550
 totally different game from one another 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.600
 dota understanding your 'dollar game has 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.510
 a rpf characteristic neither the team 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.700
 debut of then let's say that in note no 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.800
 just have players you need to know 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.989
 deal with strategies keep an eye on 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.940
 a certain hero when he has 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.039
 last year have a look at the map 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.250
 constantly foresees actions of enemies 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:13.680
 and have dota contingency plans 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.780
 really complex for beginners but 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.100
 offers a wide range of solutions for 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.780
 all the problems 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.810
 totta strategy starts in the pitots 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.940
 dota certain heroes 067 farm 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.759
 game game some people call up 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.399
 from ileret game are very strong 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.840
 It was like a girl and team can even be 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:40.740
 opponents up to two skills at 1 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.569
 if you think small but is worth but 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.130
 these latter skills usually have 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.280
 take care of the records that I mentioned earlier 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.319
 you deal with a river time strategy is 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.630
 need to know if positioning look 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.929
 map and queue if you really have 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.849
 careful you can very easily 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.700
 escapades like these avoiding skills 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:02.520
 and his probable death league of legends 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.319
 longer light alloy have a more dynamic 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.750
 friendly used to be more 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.390
 balanced from the beginning of the game but 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.760
 the care as mentioned above 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.520
 how to look at map positioning skills 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.849
 are also very important in the game 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.830
 the game does not have a puzzle so go so 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.019
 advantageous for the months 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.900
 although some have twice 15 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.900
 High damage and shorter is less hardcore 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.630
 I called many good gangs. 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.480
 and gold to invest in app 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.100
 oab thus increasing the status of your 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.660
 dora character a totta videogame is 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.240
 a more important stage for the heroes 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.960
 You want these heroes to make a game? 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.490
 good or regular and keep on forming in 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.380
 Note these heroes are usually 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.970
 militias and needs items to 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.520
 get really strong 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.940
 is a phase where the strategies of the teams 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.020
 should also start working 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.020
 strategies such as a team 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.209
 pull a team considered pull is going to do 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.920
 your maximum to win the match yet 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.290
 at this stage of the game because 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.000
 has more magic heroes in the team 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.280
 magical heroes differently and 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:21.040
 I started to lose strength after 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:25.730
 this step of the game in front of the bird river 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.680
 test league of legends of legends 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.870
 unlike calls dollars 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:36.830
 of kells are the three rivers note in the low and 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.450
 pay as much as possible in the game with 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.209
 help from scratch and support to get 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.430
 mini game with some basic items and 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.070
 really need ideas to cause 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.269
 because it usually has a single 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.720
 that I hurt 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:53.330
 so the badense game change can 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.010
 cost victory is also at this stage of 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.970
 game movies are often played 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.200
 to move 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.390
 gantz pull become common and with this the 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.430
 simba all the damage of the heroes if 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.430
 keep very balanced and wanting 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.630
 much of each player 's blake 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.790
 endow the milk game boot to the 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.970
 means is a terrible phase because the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:21.140
 opponents have life and 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.390
 with this after using the same save the 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.260
 your skills and come back to 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.169
 Cuba 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.360
 already the kerry teams and the cars are more 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.970
 strong and possess is due to the time of 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.729
 game and gold increase per minute 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.729
 then items like bkb that leave a hero 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.910
 In Munich there are bush spells as they are 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.490
 used and the attack 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.800
 a very powerful weapon to reach the milk 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.620
 game note is the guarantee of a match 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.080
 with lots of fighting gameplay was on 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.910
 there are many usable items that 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.660
 abruptly increase the gameplay of 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.060
 game 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.870
 Furthermore teams with training and emails 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:10.460
 cm carlos and wants to take advantage of this 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:11.840
 stage of the game continues very well 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.800
 balanced for all types of 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.420
 characters months can sometimes kill 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.340
 very easily the target 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.960
 this type of balancing by states 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.600
 united giving the freedom of a month of 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.740
 increase your attack power with ap 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.020
 proportional players a dynamic 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.060
 friendly and does not require too much 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.550
 thing that I do the same 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.650
 The game is based on beginning and end 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.100
 ability of team and players 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.920
 with simple damage balancing 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.150
 similar for all 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.740
 different from the note that while riding a 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.650
 team you already have to have a 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.840
 strategy you draw on the link you 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.710
 just make good plays with your 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.570
 team 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.610
 maybe so some do not rate 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.350
 nine lesbians like r10 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.640
 but the fact is that it is still a 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.640
 very competitive game 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.419
 ah ah ah ah
