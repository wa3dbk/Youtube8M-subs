this<00:00:36.969> is<00:00:37.329> technically<00:00:39.420> combination<00:00:40.420> of<00:00:40.690> sin

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
this is technically combination of sin

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:46.380 
this is technically combination of sin
and<00:00:41.769> of<00:00:42.219> soda<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:45.179> actually<00:00:46.179> this

and of soda and actually this

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.660 
and of soda and actually this
combination<00:00:47.320> is<00:00:48.129> natural<00:00:48.909> in<00:00:49.030> some<00:00:49.899> places<00:00:50.670> in

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670

the world like for example in Syria you
can<00:00:55.059> literally<00:00:55.479> go<00:00:55.839> out<00:00:55.869> of<00:00:56.079> your<00:00:56.109> house<00:00:56.469> and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
can literally go out of your house and

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.000 
can literally go out of your house and
dig<00:00:57.850> up<00:00:58.030> some<00:00:58.269> dirt<00:00:58.299> put<00:00:59.140> it<00:00:59.260> in<00:00:59.409> a<00:00:59.469> pot<00:00:59.680> and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
dig up some dirt put it in a pot and

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.950 
dig up some dirt put it in a pot and
