00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
insanely hard to control that was the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.500 
insanely hard to control that was the
one<00:02:57.280> thing<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.520> knew<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.820> just<00:02:58.090> noticed<00:02:58.360> about

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
one thing I knew I just noticed about

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.360 
one thing I knew I just noticed about
this<00:02:58.630> game<00:02:58.840> was<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.170> was<00:02:59.350> insanely<00:03:00.100> difficult

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
this game was it was insanely difficult

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.740 
this game was it was insanely difficult
to<00:03:00.790> control<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.210> car<00:03:01.390> because<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.630> are

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
to control this car because you are

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.510 
to control this car because you are
going<00:03:02.080> through<00:03:02.230> five<00:03:02.440> different

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
going through five different

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.500 
going through five different
specifications<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:03.700> everything<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.300> so

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
specifications and everything is so

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.090 
specifications and everything is so
different<00:03:04.540> yeah<00:03:05.320> then<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.620> go<00:03:05.740> from<00:03:05.920> like

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
different yeah then you go from like

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.880 
different yeah then you go from like
circuit<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.300> raid<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.780> perform<00:03:08.170> it's<00:03:08.350> true

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
circuit to raid to perform it's true

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.340 
circuit to raid to perform it's true
yeah<00:03:09.310> whatever<00:03:09.610> no<00:03:09.850> yeah<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.600> just<00:03:10.870> gets<00:03:11.170> kind

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
yeah whatever no yeah it just gets kind

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.330 
yeah whatever no yeah it just gets kind
of<00:03:11.380> crazy<00:03:11.440> that's<00:03:11.830> gonna<00:03:11.950> take<00:03:12.040> some<00:03:12.100> time

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
of crazy that's gonna take some time

for years to come and it certainly has a

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.700 
for years to come and it certainly has a
huge<00:05:48.789> world<00:05:48.969> that<00:05:49.240> I'm<00:05:49.330> like<00:05:49.779> that's<00:05:50.409> it's<00:05:50.650> a

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
huge world that I'm like that's it's a

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.050 
huge world that I'm like that's it's a
neighbor<00:05:50.860> once<00:05:51.250> you<00:05:51.340> get<00:05:51.490> good<00:05:51.610> enough<00:05:51.759> at<00:05:51.969> the
