phones<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.409> there<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.950> they<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
phones in there so that they know to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.920 
phones in there so that they know to
come<00:01:53.700> back<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.240> keep<00:01:54.390> laying<00:01:54.600> their

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.690 
come back here and keep laying their
eggs<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.680> they<00:01:55.890> won't<00:01:56.040> sit<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.310> them<00:01:56.549> because

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
eggs and they won't sit on them because

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.980 
eggs and they won't sit on them because
there<00:01:56.969> aren't<00:01:57.090> enough<00:01:57.210> yet<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:57.810> each<00:01:57.960> day

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
there aren't enough yet because each day

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.170 
there aren't enough yet because each day
we<00:01:58.320> collect<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> five<00:01:58.979> real<00:01:59.280> eggs<00:01:59.520> or<00:01:59.790> three

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.819 
we collect the five real eggs or three
real<00:02:00.360> eggs<00:02:00.570> or<00:02:00.810> sometimes<00:02:01.140> there's<00:02:01.350> even<00:02:01.590> two

and eat them pretty much I don't know if

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.760 
and eat them pretty much I don't know if
you<00:02:05.939> can<00:02:06.060> see<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:07.200> egg<00:02:07.409> here<00:02:07.649> is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.190 
you can see this but this egg here is
actually<00:02:08.220> round<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:09.390> here<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:09.929> it's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
actually round this one here it's it's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.430 
actually round this one here it's it's
not<00:02:10.379> all<00:02:11.510> oblong<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.840> way<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> other<00:02:13.200> ones

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
not all oblong the way the other ones

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.979 
not all oblong the way the other ones
are<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.890> they're<00:02:14.040> each<00:02:14.160> different<00:02:14.550> colors

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
are and they're each different colors

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.760 
are and they're each different colors
pretty<00:02:15.989> much<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:17.629> always<00:02:18.629> get<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.959> one<00:02:19.140> almost

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
pretty much I always get that one almost

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.729 
pretty much I always get that one almost
every<00:02:19.980> day<00:02:20.450> anyway<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.720> love<00:02:22.050> these<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.290> live

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
every day anyway I love these so I live

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.410 
every day anyway I love these so I live
here<00:02:26.040> sort<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.580> lets<00:02:26.849> right<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.209> city

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
here sort of that lets right in the city

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.990 
here sort of that lets right in the city
but<00:02:27.690> we've<00:02:27.959> got<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.319> MKT<00:02:29.190> trail<00:02:29.730> corridor

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
but we've got the MKT trail corridor

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.900 
but we've got the MKT trail corridor
down<00:02:30.300> there<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.129> wetlands<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.430> we

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
down there and the wetlands and so we

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.080 
down there and the wetlands and so we
have<00:02:33.379> every<00:02:34.379> potential<00:02:34.860> hen<00:02:35.340> predator<00:02:35.879> you

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
have every potential hen predator you

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.140 
have every potential hen predator you
can<00:02:36.239> imagine<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.870> know<00:02:36.989> neighborhood<00:02:37.410> dogs

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
can imagine you know neighborhood dogs

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.270 
can imagine you know neighborhood dogs
coyotes<00:02:39.150> raccoons<00:02:40.190> possums<00:02:42.709> hawks<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.099> owls

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
coyotes raccoons possums hawks and owls

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.309 
coyotes raccoons possums hawks and owls
you<00:02:44.730> know<00:02:44.819> all<00:02:44.970> those<00:02:45.150> things<00:02:45.209> are<00:02:45.959> found<00:02:46.230> here

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
you know all those things are found here

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.180 
you know all those things are found here
commonly<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.400> think<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.510> know<00:02:48.599> when<00:02:48.780> people

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
commonly so I think you know when people

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.509 
commonly so I think you know when people
worry<00:02:50.190> about<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:52.140> know<00:02:52.230> people<00:02:52.560> not<00:02:52.709> securing

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
worry about you know people not securing

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.710 
worry about you know people not securing
their<00:02:53.670> hens<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.120> mean<00:02:55.040> basically<00:02:56.120> if<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.480> don't

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
their hens I mean basically if you don't

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.190 
their hens I mean basically if you don't
build<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.409> secure<00:02:59.599> enclosure<00:03:00.599> that's<00:03:01.019> going<00:03:01.140> to

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
build a secure enclosure that's going to

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.540 
build a secure enclosure that's going to
keep<00:03:01.379> them<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.680> you're<00:03:02.040> not<00:03:02.190> going<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.430> have

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
keep them in you're not going to have

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.410 
keep them in you're not going to have
hens<00:03:02.819> for<00:03:03.060> very<00:03:03.239> long<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.560> I'm<00:03:05.420> pretty

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
hens for very long so I'm pretty

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.380 
hens for very long so I'm pretty
confident<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.110> any<00:03:07.879> urban<00:03:08.879> hens<00:03:09.090> are<00:03:09.269> going

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
confident that any urban hens are going

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:19.320 
confident that any urban hens are going
to<00:03:09.450> be<00:03:09.599> well<00:03:09.840> contained

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.390 

and<00:03:19.720> once<00:03:20.020> people<00:03:20.260> have<00:03:20.590> been<00:03:20.800> educated<00:03:21.310> on

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
and once people have been educated on

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400 
and once people have been educated on
what<00:03:21.610> it<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.880> urban<00:03:22.360> hens<00:03:22.690> are<00:03:22.870> about<00:03:23.110> and

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
what it is that urban hens are about and

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.350 
what it is that urban hens are about and
how<00:03:23.530> they're<00:03:23.740> going<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:23.980> be<00:03:24.130> housed<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.880> how

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
how they're going to be housed and how

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.150 
how they're going to be housed and how
they're<00:03:25.540> going<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.870> live<00:03:26.050> their<00:03:26.230> lives<00:03:26.410> then

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
they're going to live their lives then

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.650 
they're going to live their lives then
people<00:03:27.520> tend<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.790> come<00:03:27.970> around<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.420> realize

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
people tend to come around and realize

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.600 
people tend to come around and realize
that<00:03:28.690> it's<00:03:29.140> not<00:03:29.290> going<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.680> be<00:03:29.800> a<00:03:29.830> problem<00:03:30.100> and

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
that it's not going to be a problem and

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.780 
that it's not going to be a problem and
so<00:03:30.910> in<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.450> sense<00:03:31.690> it's<00:03:32.590> just<00:03:32.710> a<00:03:33.070> an

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
so in that sense it's just a an

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.750 
so in that sense it's just a an
education<00:03:34.450> issue<00:03:34.710> which<00:03:35.710> I<00:03:35.860> think<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.310> lot<00:03:36.640> of

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
education issue which I think a lot of

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.020 
education issue which I think a lot of
things<00:03:36.940> are<00:03:37.240> that<00:03:37.390> way<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:38.290> people<00:03:39.190> trying<00:03:39.910> to

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
things are that way and people trying to

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.940 
things are that way and people trying to
figure<00:03:40.150> out<00:03:40.330> well<00:03:41.050> what<00:03:41.200> is<00:03:41.320> it<00:03:41.470> we<00:03:41.560> want<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.830> do

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
figure out well what is it we want to do

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.070 
figure out well what is it we want to do
to<00:03:42.070> change<00:03:42.310> our<00:03:42.550> city<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.450> change<00:03:43.690> our<00:03:43.930> way

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
to change our city and to change our way

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.690 
to change our city and to change our way
of<00:03:44.110> lives<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:45.100> it's<00:03:45.310> more<00:03:45.550> about

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
of lives and it's more about

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.570 
of lives and it's more about
understanding<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.870> processes<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.920> the

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
understanding the processes and the

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.880 
understanding the processes and the
ideas<00:03:48.940> behind<00:03:49.150> what<00:03:49.420> we<00:03:49.630> want<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.930> do<00:03:50.050> then<00:03:50.710> it

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
ideas behind what we want to do then it

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.600 
ideas behind what we want to do then it
is<00:03:50.920> about<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:52.480> actual<00:03:53.110> processes<00:03:53.770> like<00:03:53.950> no<00:03:54.430> we

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
is about the actual processes like no we

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.650 
is about the actual processes like no we
don't<00:03:54.790> want<00:03:54.940> chickens<00:03:55.300> because<00:03:55.450> they're

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
don't want chickens because they're

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.140 
don't want chickens because they're

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
for example there and it's like that all

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.360 
for example there and it's like that all
over<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.430> country<00:04:33.790> so<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.930> have<00:04:35.590> very<00:04:35.890> simple

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
over the country so to have very simple

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.370

well<00:04:36.700> regulated<00:04:37.000> laws<00:04:37.390> here<00:04:37.720> in<00:04:37.810> Columbia<00:04:38.200> is

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
well regulated laws here in Columbia is

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.610 
well regulated laws here in Columbia is
not<00:04:38.680> out<00:04:39.040> of<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.430> norm<00:04:40.170> and<00:04:41.170> yeah<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.470> think

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
not out of the norm and yeah I think

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.100 
not out of the norm and yeah I think
that<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:43.090> if<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.240> City<00:04:43.540> Council<00:04:43.930> does

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
that that if the City Council does

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.980 
that that if the City Council does
approve<00:04:44.580> allowing<00:04:45.580> a<00:04:45.700> few<00:04:45.910> hands<00:04:46.270> per

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
approve allowing a few hands per

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.430 
approve allowing a few hands per
household<00:04:47.470> that<00:04:48.220> they're<00:04:48.670> going<00:04:48.820> to<00:04:48.910> be<00:04:49.440> happy

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
household that they're going to be happy

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.470 
household that they're going to be happy
with<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.710> results<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:51.370> don't<00:04:52.180> think<00:04:52.330> there's

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
with the results I don't think there's

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.530 
with the results I don't think there's
going<00:04:52.600> to<00:04:52.660> be<00:04:52.720> problems<00:04:53.410> there<00:04:54.370> will<00:04:54.550> be<00:04:54.580> you

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
going to be problems there will be you

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.490 
going to be problems there will be you
know<00:04:55.570> there'll<00:04:55.840> be<00:04:55.870> a<00:04:55.960> little<00:04:56.170> learning<00:04:56.290> curve

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
know there'll be a little learning curve

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.140 
know there'll be a little learning curve
there's<00:04:57.070> a<00:04:57.130> lot<00:04:57.280> of<00:04:57.400> groups<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.760> are<00:04:57.880> ready

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
there's a lot of groups that are ready

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.170 
there's a lot of groups that are ready
to<00:04:58.240> do<00:04:58.540> some<00:04:58.840> chicken<00:04:59.830> training<00:05:00.430> classes<00:05:00.760> for

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
to do some chicken training classes for

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.840 
to do some chicken training classes for
people<00:05:01.330> so<00:05:01.750> they<00:05:01.870> know<00:05:02.580> what<00:05:03.580> they're<00:05:03.760> getting

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
people so they know what they're getting

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.640 
people so they know what they're getting
into<00:05:04.120> and<00:05:04.360> how<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:04.900> raise<00:05:05.170> them<00:05:05.410> and<00:05:05.500> how<00:05:05.590> to

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
into and how to raise them and how to

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.310 
into and how to raise them and how to
feed<00:05:05.890> them<00:05:06.040> a<00:05:06.160> care<00:05:06.670> form<00:05:07.030> I<00:05:07.390> think<00:05:08.050> it's<00:05:08.260> a

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
feed them a care form I think it's a

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.750 
feed them a care form I think it's a
good<00:05:08.440> idea<00:05:08.530> for<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:08.950> city<00:05:09.160> of<00:05:09.280> Columbia<00:05:09.670> to

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
good idea for the city of Columbia to

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.280 
good idea for the city of Columbia to
pass<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.120> chicken<00:05:10.330> ordinance<00:05:10.870> so<00:05:11.140> that

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
pass the chicken ordinance so that

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.440 
pass the chicken ordinance so that
people<00:05:11.830> can<00:05:12.010> see<00:05:12.190> where<00:05:12.400> where<00:05:13.150> eggs<00:05:13.330> come

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
people can see where where eggs come

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.440 
people can see where where eggs come
from<00:05:13.660> and<00:05:14.230> the<00:05:14.500> more<00:05:14.820> like<00:05:15.820> if<00:05:16.000> I<00:05:16.120> know<00:05:16.180> where

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
from and the more like if I know where

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.790 
from and the more like if I know where
my<00:05:16.570> egg<00:05:16.720> comes<00:05:16.960> from<00:05:17.230> it's<00:05:17.410> a<00:05:17.500> good<00:05:17.650> idea

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
my egg comes from it's a good idea

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.320 
my egg comes from it's a good idea
because<00:05:18.340> it<00:05:18.550> doesn't<00:05:18.790> come<00:05:18.880> from<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.090> store

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
because it doesn't come from the store

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.270 
because it doesn't come from the store
from<00:05:19.660> long<00:05:20.320> ways<00:05:20.530> away<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:20.920> came<00:05:21.040> from<00:05:21.160> my

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
from long ways away it came from my

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.680 
from long ways away it came from my
backyard<00:05:21.490> I<00:05:21.910> know<00:05:21.970> what<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.270> chicken<00:05:22.420> ate<00:05:22.660> I

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
backyard I know what the chicken ate I

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.940 
backyard I know what the chicken ate I
know<00:05:22.870> where<00:05:23.140> it<00:05:23.230> lives<00:05:23.440> I<00:05:23.710> know<00:05:23.770> what

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
know where it lives I know what

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.219 
know where it lives I know what
conditions<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.520> lives<00:05:24.700> in<00:05:24.940> I<00:05:25.120> think<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:26.050> more

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
conditions it lives in I think the more

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.530 
conditions it lives in I think the more
chickens<00:05:26.590> we<00:05:26.740> have<00:05:26.860> in<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.040> city

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
chickens we have in the city

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.990 
chickens we have in the city
merrier<00:05:27.930> I<00:05:28.460> think<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.520> city<00:05:29.760> of<00:05:29.850> Columbia

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
merrier I think the city of Columbia

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.180 
merrier I think the city of Columbia
should<00:05:30.420> have<00:05:30.540> urban<00:05:30.990> hands<00:05:31.260> because<00:05:32.010> it's

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
should have urban hands because it's

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.190 
should have urban hands because it's
really<00:05:32.340> nice<00:05:32.550> knowing<00:05:33.120> that<00:05:33.150> you<00:05:33.420> have<00:05:33.600> a<00:05:33.900> food

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
really nice knowing that you have a food

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.410 
really nice knowing that you have a food
source<00:05:34.470> in<00:05:34.620> your<00:05:34.770> backyard<00:05:35.270> chickens<00:05:36.270> are<00:05:36.390> a

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
source in your backyard chickens are a
