year and today we will go back and
reapply<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.250> same<00:00:20.609> mission<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.330> have

flown two years earlier in 2009 and we

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.750 
flown two years earlier in 2009 and we
can<00:00:25.170> compare<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.800> data<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.400> collect

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
can compare the data that we collect

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.509 
can compare the data that we collect
today<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.599> our<00:00:27.720> previous<00:00:28.199> data<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.769> also<00:00:29.340> to

measurements there over many years and
this<00:00:35.790> will<00:00:35.969> tell<00:00:36.210> us<00:00:36.360> how<00:00:36.540> much<00:00:36.719> ice<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.260> being

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
this will tell us how much ice is being

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.340 
this will tell us how much ice is being
lost<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.399> West<00:00:38.670> Antarctica<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.600> in

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
lost in West Antarctica and in

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.840 
lost in West Antarctica and in

contributes to sea level rise two weeks
ago<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.329> had<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> another<00:00:46.559> mission<00:00:46.920> over<00:00:47.190> Penang

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
ago we had a another mission over Penang

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.819 
ago we had a another mission over Penang
glacier<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.360> when<00:00:49.110> looking<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
glacier and when looking out of the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.680 
glacier and when looking out of the
window<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> aircraft<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:51.120> noticed<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
window of the aircraft we noticed a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.850 
window of the aircraft we noticed a
fairly<00:00:52.140> large<00:00:52.289> crack<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> ice<00:00:53.820> shelf<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
fairly large crack in the ice shelf and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.040 
fairly large crack in the ice shelf and
I<00:00:55.860> talked<00:00:56.250> back<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.670> colleagues<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> US

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
I talked back to colleagues in the US

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.290 
I talked back to colleagues in the US
that<00:00:58.289> downloaded<00:00:59.070> satellite<00:00:59.550> images<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that downloaded satellite images and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.930 
that downloaded satellite images and
they<00:01:00.899> reported<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:02.010> crack<00:01:02.340> has<00:01:02.910> formed

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
they reported that this crack has formed

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.719 
they reported that this crack has formed
in<00:01:03.600> some<00:01:04.049> time<00:01:04.260> between<00:01:04.409> end<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.949> September<00:01:05.489> or

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
in some time between end of September or

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.830 
in some time between end of September or
early<00:01:06.150> October<00:01:07.909> these<00:01:08.909> things<00:01:09.119> happened<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.780> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
early October these things happened on a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.960 
early October these things happened on a
semi-regular<00:01:10.320> basis<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.159> both<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.549> Arctic

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
semi-regular basis in both the Arctic

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.130 
semi-regular basis in both the Arctic
and<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> Antarctic<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:12.960> still<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and the Antarctic but it's still a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.980 
and the Antarctic but it's still a
fairly<00:01:13.470> large<00:01:13.560> event<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.570> want<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.869> make

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
fairly large event so so we want to make

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.780 
fairly large event so so we want to make
sure<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.229> capture<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.920> much<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.280> process

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
sure we capture as much of that process

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.120 
sure we capture as much of that process
as<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.030> could<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.930> today<00:01:19.439> was<00:01:19.619> our<00:01:19.740> first<00:01:19.920> trip

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
as we could so today was our first trip

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.770 
as we could so today was our first trip
to<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.340> back<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> area<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.630> did

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
to be back in the area and what we did

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.480 
to be back in the area and what we did
was<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.930> modified<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.680> existing<00:01:23.040> flight<00:01:23.250> plan

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
was we modified the existing flight plan

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370 
was we modified the existing flight plan
to<00:01:23.700> add<00:01:23.850> about<00:01:24.000> an<00:01:24.210> extra<00:01:24.450> half<00:01:24.689> an<00:01:24.840> hour<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
to add about an extra half an hour to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.859 
to add about an extra half an hour to
the<00:01:25.439> flight<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:26.340> order<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.670> catch<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.659> flight

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
see how it's developing over time at the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.249 
see how it's developing over time at the
moment<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.490> crack<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.030> about<00:01:39.299> 80<00:01:39.570> meters<00:01:39.990> wide

but if the crack continues to propagate

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.620 
but if the crack continues to propagate
it's<00:01:43.439> about<00:01:43.740> an<00:01:43.950> iceberg<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.790> has<00:01:45.149> an<00:01:45.270> area

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
it's about an iceberg that has an area

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.630 
it's about an iceberg that has an area
of<00:01:45.689> about<00:01:45.840> 800<00:01:46.560> square<00:01:46.710> kilometer<00:01:47.460> that

of about 800 square kilometer that

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.789 
of about 800 square kilometer that
eventually<00:01:48.000> will<00:01:48.360> break<00:01:48.750> off<00:01:48.960> from<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.259> Pine

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
