00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.080
 let's proceed with the start-up 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.940
 of the wifi camera the process is very 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.440
 simple the only thing we need in a 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.650
 principle is to the camera give of 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.409
 power the camera is powered 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.750
 we give you a data shot of the network in 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:20.870
 what we have where the camera is wifi 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.530
 previously you have to do it by cable 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.990
 the router for connecting either a 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.090
 Once we have done this we must wait for a 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.440
 little moment does not even reach 15 seconds 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.909
 until the camera makes a 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.999
 checking the rotation axes 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:40.569
 both horizontally and vertically 

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.569
 Meanwhile 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.110
 on the mobile what we do is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.110
 download how to run the application 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.530
 for viewing the cameras 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.880
 we wait a little while is doing the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.880
 comparison of very well you horizontal 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.940
 once finished making the buyer 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.350
 the movement check 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.640
 horizontal will happen to perform the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.640
 vertical movement check 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.270
 well once finished doing the 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.070
 vertical movement check the 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.869
 procedure process to give of 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.430
 high to the camera in our system is 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.939
 very simple the cameras carry a 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.939
 QR code 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.330
 that we have down here then the only thing 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.200
 What it does in our application is 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:41.580
 hit the camera button and scan the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.220
 qr code then we place 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.810
 position 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.810
 has recognized the QR code 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.900
 you have to assign a password to it 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.759
 password that the camera wants 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.759
 defect are 68 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.460
 we come to enter 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.040
 we give him 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.619
 and we already have here discharged that is 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.500
 right now the camera would already be 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.039
 working and we are getting 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.039
 live images 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.350
 but of course we want to go for wifi 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.010
 to make a milestone for wifi 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.440
 we come to the configuration part of 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.600
 the camera then we can assign a 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.120
 name to identify where it is 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.690
 us in this case 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.690
 to call him 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.160
 systems were banked 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.880
 The next thing we do is assign a 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.900
 password the password that we are going to 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.129
 assign new for example 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.129
 from here you can change 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.250
 once we have changed the password in the 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.520
 camera what you are going to do is make a 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.520
 reset 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.630
 to do the king and the camera is 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.200
 returning to perform 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.420
 the checking movements of the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.960
 rotors both to present and to 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.960
 vertical movement 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.760
 we enter the configuration part 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.260
 and here as we had changed it before 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.460
 the password now we give 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.460
 the new password 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.620
 so that 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.870
 with the new cancÃºn I can enter what 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.870
 next thing we're going to do is put it 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.400
 within the wifi network 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.080
 so let's go into the part of the 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.360
 setting we go to wifi 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.970
 automatically searches for the networks that 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.150
 we have we are inside this 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.150
 net 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.629
 we introduce 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.240
 the patchwork code of the network 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.080
 we have done that 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.560
 from here we can answer 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.560
 regrettable 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.310
 to check the key well 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:46.490
 The first thing he has done has been a text 

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:48.229
 of the microphone 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.000
 the next thing he does again is 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.319
 a test both the horizontal movement 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.319
 as the vertical movement 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.339
 from there 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.120
 I already have 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.909
 my camera image 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.909
 of which 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:15.909
 I can go moving 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.279
 and in a very simple way 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.279
 change 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.289
 the quality
