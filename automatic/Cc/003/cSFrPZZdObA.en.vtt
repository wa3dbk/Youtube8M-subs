it's quirky and it makes the Genesis

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.540 
it's quirky and it makes the Genesis
look<00:02:30.050> super<00:02:30.380> cool<00:02:30.560> when<00:02:30.739> it's<00:02:30.860> perched<00:02:31.160> on<00:02:31.370> top

same thing most of them lock on to

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.690 
same thing most of them lock on to

have to find a thing to destroy those
rocks<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.830> early<00:04:18.100> levels<00:04:18.280> in<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.580> game<00:04:18.609> are

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
rocks the early levels in the game are

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.759 
rocks the early levels in the game are
really<00:04:19.239> easy<00:04:19.479> but<00:04:19.750> then<00:04:19.959> they<00:04:20.140> eventually<00:04:20.380> get

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
really easy but then they eventually get

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.370 
really easy but then they eventually get
tricky<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.419> extremely<00:04:22.419> long<00:04:22.810> it's<00:04:23.140> hard<00:04:23.229> to

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
tricky and extremely long it's hard to

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.560 
tricky and extremely long it's hard to
stay<00:04:23.620> alive<00:04:23.860> especially<00:04:24.040> when<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:24.640> lose<00:04:24.880> some

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
stay alive especially when you lose some

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.210 
stay alive especially when you lose some
of<00:04:25.660> your<00:04:25.750> extra<00:04:26.020> hummingbirds<00:04:26.590> you<00:04:26.800> can't<00:04:27.040> see

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
of your extra hummingbirds you can't see

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.840 
of your extra hummingbirds you can't see
it<00:04:27.340> on<00:04:27.460> screen<00:04:27.760> but<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.300> have<00:04:28.510> extra<00:04:28.900> lives

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.250 

and<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:33.970> problem<00:04:34.270> is<00:04:34.330> if<00:04:34.450> you<00:04:34.540> get<00:04:34.720> killed<00:04:34.990> off

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
and the problem is if you get killed off

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.990 
and the problem is if you get killed off
you<00:04:35.500> then<00:04:35.620> restart<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.040> level<00:04:36.220> and<00:04:36.610> you've

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
you then restart the level and you've

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.880 
you then restart the level and you've
only<00:04:37.150> got<00:04:37.330> one<00:04:37.360> extra<00:04:37.630> life<00:04:37.960> well<00:04:38.620> then<00:04:38.770> it's

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
only got one extra life well then it's

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.730 
only got one extra life well then it's
pretty<00:04:39.010> frustrating

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.020 

you<00:04:44.740> have<00:04:44.890> a<00:04:44.920> lot<00:04:45.130> of<00:04:45.160> cool<00:04:45.400> weapons<00:04:45.850> but

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
you have a lot of cool weapons but

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.640 
you have a lot of cool weapons but
without<00:04:46.240> a<00:04:46.270> scoring<00:04:46.750> system<00:04:46.780> there's<00:04:47.500> not<00:04:47.620> a

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
without a scoring system there's not a

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.380 
without a scoring system there's not a
good<00:04:48.010> reason<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.490> keep<00:04:48.640> coming<00:04:48.700> back<00:04:49.060> and

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
good reason to keep coming back and

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.030 
good reason to keep coming back and
playing<00:04:49.570> Calibri<00:04:50.200> once<00:04:50.380> you've<00:04:50.560> figured<00:04:50.800> it

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
playing Calibri once you've figured it

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.680 
playing Calibri once you've figured it
out<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.880> that's<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.180> game's<00:04:52.330> biggest

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
out and that's the game's biggest

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.390 
out and that's the game's biggest
problem<00:04:53.110> once<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:53.620> novelty<00:04:53.800> wears<00:04:54.130> off

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
problem once the novelty wears off

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.250 
problem once the novelty wears off
you'll<00:04:55.120> move<00:04:55.300> on<00:04:55.420> to<00:04:55.570> something<00:04:55.870> else<00:04:56.020> like

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
you'll move on to something else like

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.470 
you'll move on to something else like
cosmic<00:04:56.740> carnage<00:04:57.010> on<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.490> 32x<00:04:58.060> which<00:04:58.300> is

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
cosmic carnage on the 32x which is

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.260 
cosmic carnage on the 32x which is
infinitely<00:04:59.020> enjoyable<00:04:59.680> but<00:05:00.340> Calibri<00:05:00.940> is<00:05:01.120> a

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
infinitely enjoyable but Calibri is a

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.940 
infinitely enjoyable but Calibri is a
