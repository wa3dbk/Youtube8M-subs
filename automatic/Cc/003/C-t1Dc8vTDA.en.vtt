 A fairly small system as you can see 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.490
 Motherboard is itx 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.599
 I do not need 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:36.640
 Though it is difficult to watch front like Freon though 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.840
 There is Awa grill, but once this 3 minutes product 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.030

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:48.890
 Where there is a cover of this front at 1 year old 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:52.600
 Finally , I have no chance to meet the port of usb 3.0 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.600
 It has been movie control 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.530
 In person 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.250

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.409
 Hmm 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.920
 Electrician 2 with this connector 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.920
 Hey you 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.290

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.310
 Ha ha ha 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.960
 specification 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.030
 From here 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.280
 Not at the wall outlet 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.159
 It is a form of 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.159
 a ten thousand chans are attached 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.970
 Here is the part where the first io panel comes 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.870
 Here is the expansion slot 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.500
 Good Nchon' 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.500
 Unexpected was to 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.750
 Turn 12 at the ends has become a formula 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.840
 Once accessories Ue right 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.769
 Well minimal manual 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.769
 Contains 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.990
 Even the house again 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.370
 Like this 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.370
 We together to 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.370
 Place 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.370
 It is the other side 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.950
 Hey you 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.190
 Six 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.190
 Oh 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.610
 eh 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.380
 First place 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.340
 me 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.340
 Yes 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.610
 Will be part of the content frame in this way 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.470
 Kito 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.470
 It will be Oh this is out 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.960
 In form of personal storage 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.820
 design 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:25.390
 Well, I'd think hard to understand in the do not about this time Nde not about front panel 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.390
 Basically you can not attach an optical drive 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.290
 Ummm 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.290
 There is no slot 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.060
 Optical drive is external with usb 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.220
 I think about the upper part of the board It is a board of this 3rd 5 inch hard disk 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.140
 It's a house or ssd 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.140
 Ida attached and removed 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.540
 Basically , the application is the same for different consideration cats 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.289
 It can be removed like this 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.880
 There was 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.520
 We have received it Is two 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.770
 Oops entered 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.009
 Pom 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.740
 8 well this will be a caress pretty rice e 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.500
 Well itx mini itx 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.230
 Only the board yes 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.169
 ana 2 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.670
 Power supply unit is positive 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.990
 Here is this 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:15.060
 I can not 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.060
 Good size Case next time size 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.699
 9-1 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:28.040
 240250 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.790
 Height 210 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.470
 Is it a 210? 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.990
 Because it is very compact in shape 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:40.000
 The size of the power supply unit is also limited 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:43.689
 Because basically with criticism here 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.770
 Up to about 4 cm in depth 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:49.310
 140 items reduced 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.310
 Recommendation 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.090
 I will also Takasaki power supply here 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.740
 So far people 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:03.729
 First of all, it is a delusion 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:10.139
 Since the house of the space so no record and put 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:10.139
 As we can attach cp store is event figure 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:20.620
 Other small and very go light frame itself light 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.760
 It has become a case 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.760
 Sub machine or something 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:33.219
 Well I work in the office for work 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.219
 I think it is suitable for space-saving PC 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.610
 Thank you very much 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.610
 Ah ah ah ah
