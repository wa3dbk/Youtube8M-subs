start<00:00:28.090> with<00:00:28.240> piston<00:00:28.750> number<00:00:29.109> one<00:00:29.439> which<00:00:30.429> is

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
start with piston number one which is

00:00:30.460 --> 00:01:07.500 
start with piston number one which is
fairly<00:00:31.000> soft

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:02:21.149 

let's<00:01:08.510> try<00:01:08.810> piston<00:01:09.710> number<00:01:10.070> two

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:55.290 

mr.<00:02:22.159> number<00:02:22.489> four

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:43.150 

finally<00:03:06.800> piston<00:03:07.280> number<00:03:07.580> five

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.430 

well<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.400> gives<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.730> tone<00:03:44.940> demonstration<00:03:45.720> SAR

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
well that gives a tone demonstration SAR

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.770 
well that gives a tone demonstration SAR
am<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.650> playing<00:03:46.890> wasn't<00:03:47.430> all<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.580> that<00:03:48.510> great

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
am I playing wasn't all that that great

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.390 
am I playing wasn't all that that great
but<00:03:48.960> at<00:03:49.020> least<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.380> can<00:03:49.560> see<00:03:49.800> what<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.130> tones

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
but at least you can see what the tones

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.230 
but at least you can see what the tones
sound<00:03:51.240> like<00:03:51.450> for<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.720> different<00:03:52.080> place
