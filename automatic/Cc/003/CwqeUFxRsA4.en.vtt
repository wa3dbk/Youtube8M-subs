00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hi, I'm today and I was with the blog. 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.970
 About Me 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.950
 I only ask forgiveness if you fall in love with sanha 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.559
 that I have a sore throat in the river 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.110
 anyway the video of the guerrillas today is only 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.940
 plus a video of builders 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.619
 my last six months counting on 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.330
 this forum of consultants 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.250
 but I received several comments 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.810
 in the fanpage of the year of singing girls 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.010

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.900
 seam 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.789
 so it kind of gave me a wee bit 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.550
 making various little things that the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.309
 people like today will learn how to do 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.680

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.910
 car journey is craft is one of the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.620
 students that inserts 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.809
 but you can use it wherever you want 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.450
 if you want to use hotels comfort 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.910
 or put on the face or objects of hygiene 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.670
 staff as tooth source toothpaste 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.039

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.050

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.210

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.199
 objects and then we roll him to 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.049

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.689
 very cute and serious practice is 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.580
 incredibly easy to do and you 're 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.930
 learning culture now is no excuse 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.790
 for you do not have to make your 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.159
 organizer and remembering that any 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.409
 doubt that you are in a video that 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.240

 try to bring videos and miscellaneous 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.290
 stings because you do not stop 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.990
 be videos and do it yourself but I know 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.850
 that each one there has a taste for it 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.950
 do not forget that every second and fifth 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.659
 had a shop on the canal closed very 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.899
 that you enjoy taking advantage of the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.180
 Tip I love you, we'll give you two. 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.549
 rectangles of the same pattern and one with 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.649
 different print here I used the old one 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.290
 reuse technique have plenty 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.479
 provided with a rectangle of acrylic 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.369
 two daughters 4 centimeters 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.200
 you can do with mine you want 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.509
 but if you wanted to based on my classes 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.920
 will be in the information box as 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.110
 we are taking the physical blanket and 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.719
 accommodating in one of the rectangles with the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.719
 right side up and reserving 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.610
 Now let's work with another one. 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.040
 rectangle and how different print 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.670
 we charge in the middle and we pass a culture 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.670
 straight 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.730
 Let's hide the seam so we do 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.460
 the way I made a video and we settled there 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.260
 l on top of the other on the cloth we hold 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.260
 with fennec and healing 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.480
 we got the assembly version to make two 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.560
 if I did not want to use some tape 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.560
 Make yourself at home 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.140
 measure an inch and spent with hotel 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.310
 to mark this on the other side as well 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.250
 one centimeter 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.000
 I ironed again and then in the 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.000
 middle pitch 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.700
 now the police have no feelings in the 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.730
 the center of the fabric and place the 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:27.270
 is buying with crops and will try 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:29.850
 be firm there, we will accommodate the two 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.010
 parts of the tire we put the tires and 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.350
 leaving an opening of four 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.590
 centimeters later we could 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.590
 to inspire 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:16.540
 now let's take the excess stitching 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:19.320
 the fla and cut 14 continuous and let's 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.320
 turn 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.370
 to close this opening and to give the 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.190
 finish making a line culture nor 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.710
 dog in the countryside four studies 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.750
 patton is missing the coolest part of 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.150
 make the dividers meanwhile you 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.880
 you can make the widths if you 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.600
 cool is tried brush for you 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.950
 have a notion of spacing and we have 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.350
 also give much to the 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:12.840
 straight culture you can put pins 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.840
 or mark with pencil or even the vaio line 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:23.980
 and when it's time to kick back 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.760
 of the play at the end is indispensable and 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.740
 rolls 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.530
 remember that you can conform to the 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.660
 your needs as door brushes 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.840
 toiletries 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.100
