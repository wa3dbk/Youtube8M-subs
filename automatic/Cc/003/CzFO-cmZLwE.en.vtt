00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.250
 so here comes the mister 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.119
 but with his boys a great 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.779
 coin we look something from now on 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.779
 ack assenheim 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.279
 known Roman egger 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.809
 Unfortunately, the aks are seeded at that time mostly 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.870
 Munich was previously found by the Romans 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.520
 and also the Roman horseshoe the hypo 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.239
 sandal found on the field 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.410
 but unfortunately it is still tight right now 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.559
 have even gone to our happiness 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.170
 So we tried very unsuccessfully 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.230
 Today I will not show you something 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.790
 everything was found beautiful 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.620
 we have in nice button that with me 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.370
 some sort of thing I do not know 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.370
 exactly what it is exactly 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.130
 then small Roman coins here 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.890
 There's a little silver up there, too 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.100
 you have to do that a bit later 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.000
 clean because that's pretty over the top 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.580
 years later you have to take citric acid 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.880
 Unfortunately you can not see anything on it 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.880
 here are three cruisers 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:43.619
 three crosses 18 55 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.810
 with the notes on it so here for example 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.810
 now a little Roman 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.180
 where you also a little something 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.740
 Unfortunately , only browsers can recognize 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.330
 roman be found small well now 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.370
 a little bit in a little bit 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.040
 make forest piece 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.560
 he is interesting too 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.490
 some fog or so you know if 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.350
 that is Roman or again clear 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.630
 until later in the detectors forum 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.770
 make and see what that is but one 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.410
 musket ball so now we will be 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.790
 do a bit of the forest and look 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.790
 if in the forest something goes nice 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.400
 We are now in the forest 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:03:03.109
 I have not found a funny part 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:05.939
 now it was pretty round here 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:15.230
 In any case, the funny ornaments 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:21.200
 goes on any ornament 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:25.409
 maybe a fog or something 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.370
 Find out later what the principals are 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.370
 forum ask what you mean 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.989
 Interesting 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:47.019
 so the fund from the forest has 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.160
 specially knocked out and I was 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:56.470
 Of course, what amazed us again 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:04:03.430
 Do not come watch this one 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:19.600
 Ring a Roman place exactly 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:21.790
 so be it really Roman 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.460
 shell is I can now one to 100 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.370
 percent say it is definitely 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.330
 pretty old and I have it in the detector 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.330
 fresh color seen 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.560
 I have but good signal kader 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.690
 must look the same time so that part 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.080
 here will be set later 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.220
 Let's see what is in any case 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:55.930
 so hard could be so big 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:05:00.450
 copper I think sometimes nice up here saw 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.450
 you're up here 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:12.470
 ok, respect, go on
