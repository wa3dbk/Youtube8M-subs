why<00:01:19.189> because<00:01:20.189> green<00:01:20.610> tea<00:01:20.880> actually<00:01:21.830> inhibits

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
why because green tea actually inhibits

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.640 
why because green tea actually inhibits
the<00:01:23.070> absorption<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.939> folic<00:01:24.390> acid<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.080> folic

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the absorption of folic acid and folic

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.770 
the absorption of folic acid and folic
acid<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.130> very<00:01:26.159> very<00:01:26.909> important<00:01:27.390> during<00:01:27.659> your

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
acid is very very important during your

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.020 
acid is very very important during your
pregnancy<00:01:28.369> especially<00:01:29.369> during<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.790> first

pregnancy especially during the first
part<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.390> pregnancy<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.439> found<00:01:31.829> that

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
part of pregnancy we have found that

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.690 
part of pregnancy we have found that
there<00:01:32.400> has<00:01:32.579> been<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.110> 50%<00:01:34.110> reduction<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
there has been a 50% reduction in the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.850 
there has been a 50% reduction in the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
two defects and we believe it's from

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.430 
two defects and we believe it's from
this<00:01:40.230> folic<00:01:40.620> acid<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.330> advise<00:01:42.690> you<00:01:42.720> to

this folic acid so we advise you to

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.070 
this folic acid so we advise you to
