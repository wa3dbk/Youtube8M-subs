00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960 

I

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:12.650 

I<00:00:09.650> think<00:00:10.650> my<00:00:10.800> work<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.190> definitely<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:12.120> mix

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
I think my work is definitely a mix

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.500 
I think my work is definitely a mix
between<00:00:12.890> my<00:00:13.890> traditional<00:00:14.490> craftsmanship<00:00:14.880> and

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510 
between my traditional craftsmanship and

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.870 
between my traditional craftsmanship and
the<00:00:15.570> real<00:00:15.930> hand<00:00:16.470> work<00:00:16.769> with<00:00:17.010> threads<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
the real hand work with threads and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.210 
the real hand work with threads and
needle<00:00:18.180> but<00:00:18.510> at<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.810> certain<00:00:19.259> point<00:00:19.499> there's

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
needle but at a certain point there's

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.399 
needle but at a certain point there's
also<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.789> limitation<00:00:21.509> with<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.839> craftsmanship

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:22.409 
also a limitation with in craftsmanship

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:26.179 
also a limitation with in craftsmanship
and<00:00:23.539> at<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.749> point<00:00:25.079> when<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.470> felt<00:00:25.919> that

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
and at that point when I felt that

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.749 
and at that point when I felt that
frustration<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.239> also<00:00:27.419> opened<00:00:28.079> up<00:00:28.199> my<00:00:28.470> world

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
frustration I also opened up my world

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.330 
frustration I also opened up my world
towards<00:00:29.759> newer<00:00:29.999> techniques<00:00:30.509> and<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.529> think

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
towards newer techniques and I think

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.000 
towards newer techniques and I think
combining<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.149> two<00:00:33.360> really<00:00:34.230> makes<00:00:34.850> my

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
combining the two really makes my

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.040 
combining the two really makes my
abilities<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.880> big<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.390> don't<00:00:39.960> think

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
abilities really big I don't think

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.520 
abilities really big I don't think
science<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.950> carrying<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:42.150> any<00:00:42.570> way<00:00:42.840> somehow

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
science is carrying in any way somehow

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.770 
science is carrying in any way somehow
science<00:00:45.710> makes<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.950> very<00:00:47.130> possible<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.150> dream

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
science makes it very possible to dream

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.530 
science makes it very possible to dream
also<00:00:49.260> towards<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.100> future<00:00:50.540> possibilities

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
also towards the future possibilities

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.580 
also towards the future possibilities
within<00:00:51.810> fashion<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:53.490> science<00:00:53.940> also

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
within fashion I think science also

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.340 
within fashion I think science also
makes<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:57.710> possible<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.070> not<00:00:59.600> see<00:01:00.600> things<00:01:00.990> in

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
makes it possible to not see things in

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.860 
makes it possible to not see things in
one<00:01:01.650> way<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.250> think<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.300> open<00:01:03.570> up

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
one way I think it can really open up

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.250 
one way I think it can really open up
your<00:01:04.140> mind<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:05.060> seeing<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.600> thing<00:01:06.990> from

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
your mind in seeing one thing from

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.590 
your mind in seeing one thing from
different<00:01:07.740> perspectives<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.940> think<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.450> an

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
different perspectives and I think as an

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
different perspectives and I think as an
artist<00:01:10.020> that's<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.860> really<00:01:11.250> valuable<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
artist that's really really valuable and

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.140 
artist that's really really valuable and
magnetic<00:01:12.480> motion<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:14.100> start<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.790> story

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
magnetic motion the start of that story

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.260 
magnetic motion the start of that story
was<00:01:15.510> actually<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> visit<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.590> sayin<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.610> was

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
was actually a visit at sayin it was

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.350 
was actually a visit at sayin it was
definitely<00:01:18.570> much<00:01:19.500> more<00:01:19.970> exciting<00:01:20.970> than<00:01:21.150> I

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
definitely much more exciting than I

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.780 
definitely much more exciting than I
could<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:21.960> imagined<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.040> whole<00:01:23.070> experience

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
could have imagined the whole experience

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.450 
could have imagined the whole experience
of<00:01:24.210> being<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.750> was<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> big<00:01:25.440> influence<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.280> me

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
of being the I was a big influence to me

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.170 
of being the I was a big influence to me
I<00:01:26.670> definitely<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.729> that<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:29.940> can

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
I definitely think that that they can

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.899 
I definitely think that that they can
inspire<00:01:30.600> each<00:01:30.900> other<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.530> Sutekh<00:01:32.400> sure<00:01:32.580> is<00:01:32.700> one

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
inspire each other I Sutekh sure is one

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.240 
inspire each other I Sutekh sure is one
of<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> early<00:01:34.020> aya<00:01:34.229> creative<00:01:35.010> disciplines

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
of the early aya creative disciplines

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.930 
of the early aya creative disciplines
that's<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.270> been<00:01:36.600> starting<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.260> work<00:01:37.470> with

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
that's have been starting to work with

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.450 
that's have been starting to work with
with<00:01:38.940> 3d<00:01:39.270> printing<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.560> time<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.860> didn't

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
with 3d printing at the time I didn't

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.149 
with 3d printing at the time I didn't
really<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:42.180> how<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> use<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.500> technique<00:01:43.950> but

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
really know how to use the technique but

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.010 
really know how to use the technique but
then<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> met<00:01:44.729> an<00:01:44.880> architect<00:01:45.420> called<00:01:45.690> Daniel

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
then I met an architect called Daniel

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.620 
then I met an architect called Daniel
Beatrice<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.650> I<00:01:47.130> started<00:01:47.640> making<00:01:48.090> drawings

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
Beatrice and I started making drawings

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.859 
Beatrice and I started making drawings
and<00:01:49.350> then<00:01:49.500> he<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.890> making<00:01:50.430> them<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
and then he was making them in in the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.410 
and then he was making them in in the
computer<00:01:52.440> into<00:01:52.650> three-dimensional<00:01:53.190> files<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
computer into three-dimensional files I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.370 
computer into three-dimensional files I
must<00:01:55.110> say<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.310> lot<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.880> science<00:01:57.690> is<00:01:57.930> also

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
must say that a lot of science is also

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.880 
must say that a lot of science is also
too<00:01:59.040> complex<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.700> me<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.630> really<00:02:01.049> understand

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
too complex for me to really understand

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.140 
too complex for me to really understand
but<00:02:02.729> sometimes<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:04.020> also<00:02:04.320> nice<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:05.850> try

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
but sometimes it's also nice to to try

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.359 
but sometimes it's also nice to to try
to<00:02:06.210> understand<00:02:07.020> something<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.799> even<00:02:07.979> if<00:02:08.250> you

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
to understand something and even if you

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.360 
to understand something and even if you
don't<00:02:08.580> fully<00:02:08.939> get<00:02:09.299> it<00:02:09.799> you<00:02:10.799> get<00:02:11.009> something

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
don't fully get it you get something

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.089 
don't fully get it you get something
from<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.420> think<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.560> actually<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.950> lot

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
from it I think that is actually a lot

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.380 
from it I think that is actually a lot
of<00:02:14.250> magic<00:02:14.670> in

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
of magic in

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.630 
of magic in
lions
