00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.065
 I promised you that if I ever got ... 

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.810
 ... information about your dad ... 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.840
 ... I would tell you first, right? 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.340
 Last night someone sent a message to the beeper. 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.650
 It came from your dad's office in the playroom. 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.650
 And that? 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.524
 And that? The number has been ... 

00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:36.130
 ... disconnected for twenty years. 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.465
 Two nights before disappearing ... 

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.780
 ...He came to my house. 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.030
 He said he was about to change everything ... 

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:44.550
 ... science, medicine and religion. 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.890
 I would not have abandoned that, Sam. 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.830
 Nor to you. 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.855
 Alan, you act like I'm going to find him ... 

00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:53.240
 ... sitting there working. 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.100
 "Hey, son, I lost track of time." 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.940
 Would not it be an achievement? 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.140
 Father. 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.900
 Sam? 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.440
 Time without seeing us. 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.120
 You have no idea. 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.305
