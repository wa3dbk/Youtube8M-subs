all right as you can see it's quite an
efficient<00:07:25.189> little<00:07:25.339> cutter<00:07:25.759> and<00:07:26.179> it<00:07:26.960> will<00:07:27.139> cut

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:27.439 
efficient little cutter and it will cut

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:29.109 
efficient little cutter and it will cut
as<00:07:27.649> much<00:07:27.860> as<00:07:28.069> you<00:07:28.159> want<00:07:28.339> out<00:07:28.550> very<00:07:29.029> very

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240
