lane<00:00:06.569> this<00:00:06.930> afternoon<00:00:07.639> it<00:00:08.639> opened<00:00:08.910> up<00:00:09.000> at<00:00:09.240> 2:00

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
lane this afternoon it opened up at 2:00

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.600 
lane this afternoon it opened up at 2:00
p.m.<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:10.139> there's<00:00:10.500> no<00:00:10.769> tool<00:00:11.070> for<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.400> first

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
p.m. and there's no tool for the first

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.589 
p.m. and there's no tool for the first
two<00:00:11.790> weeks<00:00:12.650> so<00:00:13.650> we'll<00:00:14.089> see<00:00:15.089> how<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.330> rides

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
two weeks so we'll see how this rides

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.950 
two weeks so we'll see how this rides
out

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:57.069 

and<00:00:22.650> we're<00:00:23.220> now<00:00:23.430> getting<00:00:23.730> on

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.799 

and<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:57.950> this<00:00:58.100> is<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.629> on-ramp<00:00:59.629> the

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
and so this is the on-ramp the

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.820 
and so this is the on-ramp the
transition<00:01:00.469> from<00:01:01.149> 595<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.510> 595<00:01:03.200> express<00:01:03.680> lane

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.700 

and<00:01:47.979> now<00:01:48.460> word<00:01:48.700> about<00:01:49.000> Davi<00:01:49.360> road<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.170> it

possibility of a head-on collision that

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:54.600 
possibility of a head-on collision that
wouldn't<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:25.350> good<00:02:25.380> for<00:02:25.560> them

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.220 

doesn't<00:02:55.030> appear<00:02:55.210> to<00:02:55.270> be<00:02:55.420> much<00:02:55.600> traffic<00:02:56.110> in

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
doesn't appear to be much traffic in

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.980 
doesn't appear to be much traffic in
front<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.560> us<00:02:57.000> we're<00:02:58.000> just<00:02:58.030> now<00:02:58.330> going<00:02:58.600> through

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
front of us we're just now going through

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.870 
front of us we're just now going through
the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.920 

and<00:03:08.939> it<00:03:09.030> took<00:03:09.150> us<00:03:09.269> about<00:03:09.360> three<00:03:09.750> minutes

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and it took us about three minutes

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.199 
and it took us about three minutes
approximately<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.860> get<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.189> this<00:03:11.310> point

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.300 

imagine<00:03:15.019> how<00:03:15.170> much<00:03:15.319> time<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.799> would<00:03:15.920> actually

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
imagine how much time you would actually

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.309 
imagine how much time you would actually
save<00:03:16.609> as<00:03:17.180> opposed<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.629> taking<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.109> main

as the roads on this express lane are as

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.140 
as the roads on this express lane are as

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.649 

that's<00:03:34.280> about<00:03:34.549> how<00:03:34.730> long<00:03:34.969> it<00:03:35.150> take<00:03:35.329> you<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.569> get

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
that's about how long it take you to get

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.629 
that's about how long it take you to get

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
now if memory serves me correctly it's

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.680 
now if memory serves me correctly it's
about<00:04:00.860> a<00:04:00.920> seven<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.400> ten<00:04:01.610> minute<00:04:01.880> drive<00:04:01.910> in

clear traffic from east to west on 595
and<00:04:08.300> I<00:04:08.750> don't<00:04:08.810> know<00:04:09.050> if<00:04:09.170> that's<00:04:09.430> estimated

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
and I don't know if that's estimated

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.800 
and I don't know if that's estimated
based<00:04:10.910> off<00:04:11.180> whether<00:04:11.420> you're<00:04:11.690> speeding<00:04:12.140> or<00:04:12.260> not

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.770 

looks<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.370> be<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.520> small<00:04:39.820> grouping<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.300> cars<00:04:40.570> in

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
looks to be a small grouping of cars in

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.770 
looks to be a small grouping of cars in
front<00:04:40.960> of<00:04:41.110> us

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.480 

not<00:04:46.200> too<00:04:46.410> bad<00:04:46.590> on<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.800> traffic<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.460> course

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
not too bad on the traffic of course

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.490 
not too bad on the traffic of course
this<00:04:47.880> is<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.120> first<00:04:48.240> day<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.960> is<00:04:49.080> two<00:04:49.290> o'clock

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
this is the first day it is two o'clock

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.880 
this is the first day it is two o'clock
in<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.800> afternoon<00:04:49.860> so<00:04:51.680> probably<00:04:52.680> not<00:04:52.770> the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
in the afternoon so probably not the

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.860 
in the afternoon so probably not the
best<00:04:52.950> time<00:04:53.250> tested<00:04:54.210> for<00:04:54.360> rush-hour<00:04:54.720> traffic

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
best time tested for rush-hour traffic

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.399 
best time tested for rush-hour traffic
but<00:04:55.850> general<00:04:56.850> usability

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409 
but general usability

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:27.590 
but general usability
this<00:04:59.889> is<00:05:00.069> what<00:05:00.249> you'd<00:05:00.399> get<00:05:00.759> to<00:05:00.909> experience

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:37.480 

just<00:05:28.260> passed<00:05:28.530> over<00:05:28.740> hiatus<00:05:29.370> Road

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.100 

and<00:05:37.880> of<00:05:38.120> course<00:05:38.449> as<00:05:38.720> fast<00:05:39.110> as<00:05:39.319> that<00:05:39.530> goes<00:05:39.740> by

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
and of course as fast as that goes by

00:05:41.110 --> 00:06:07.850 
and of course as fast as that goes by
Flamengo<00:05:42.110> Road<00:05:42.350> is<00:05:43.539> next<00:05:44.539> hill<00:05:44.750> right<00:05:45.020> here
