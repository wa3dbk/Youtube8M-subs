00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
could have used that space and maybe

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.610 
could have used that space and maybe
done<00:03:34.540> something<00:03:34.900> i<00:03:34.990> don't<00:03:35.140> know<00:03:35.170> maybe<00:03:35.350> like<00:03:35.590> a

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
CD drive there's more than that room you

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.080 
CD drive there's more than that room you

three more of at least two more two more
CD<00:03:46.810> slots<00:03:47.110> could<00:03:47.440> have<00:03:47.530> made<00:03:47.710> it<00:03:47.740> easier<00:03:47.950> for

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
playing because most people in America

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.190 
playing because most people in America
have<00:03:53.470> more<00:03:53.650> than<00:03:53.770> one<00:03:53.920> TV<00:03:54.280> Microsoft

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
obviously not simple enough I made it

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.790
