00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 today it 's about the topic of wrestling resp 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.069
 mostly around spector and i have to 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.870
 say that I used to be nine when I was a kid 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.090
 or ten a giant fan of smackdown 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.300
 Every Friday at 22 Euros on Eurosport 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.740
 see 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.150
 the half-naked men fight best 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.049
 noon and see you way and 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.400
 again the fight between you and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.260
 Well-being garbage just that you know 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.699
 at the time, that would make me feel like a kid 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.740
 Tied up I have time because each 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.150
 Followed and always mitgefiebert at 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.920
 the fight I have to say that even 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 I thought at the beginning of some time that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.680
 that everything is real and I think so too 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.240
 That's why I thought so at the time 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.560
 incredibly horny since I knew that 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.760
 that all likes that has that for me 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.109
 somehow more and more tension lost 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.550
 until I finally stopped 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.290
 to pursue that most struggles 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.940
 were naturally more or less close 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.260
 made but by this knowledge was 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.309
 the tension for me personally 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.170
 somehow out if it was before 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.730
 is denied, it may still so scarce 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.200
 and the comeback will be so good 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.879
 look but it's just always been 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.170
 beforehand if this causes the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.730
 not by any kiss 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.320
 but because it was agreed I was 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.789
 then even addicted to it 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.410
 west we have so at the time with 10 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.789
 that would have been with four people 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.079
 fought and always tried 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.730
 get some cool moves 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.989
 of course, then it was already clear to us 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.609
 that it is like but we drive that 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.530
 still great cool my cool special 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.760
 moves back then the stranglehold 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.199
 seized on the neck and either you 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.339
 give up or you die i think so 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.840
 I have quite a lot of fighting with it 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.220
 I won earlier in the age 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.049
 always with my pokemon and lego 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.060
 figures my own dragonball myself 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.409
 Imitated series I played then 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.700
 sometime out of wood nails and 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.140
 rubber bands from the wrestling ring 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.060
 built and then with the figures themselves 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.500
 fights made but back to the show 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.150
 Back then, as a child, I was the one and only 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.159
 Characters horny have played along 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.509
 at undertaker you just always had 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.430
 fear comes in the ring you knew already 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.799
 fakt thinks the fall seriously this 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.540
 unbelievably horny warm-up music the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.040
 john cena suits my favorite 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.689
 westler was just a cool guy and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.220
 had really something on it rey 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.570
 mysterio and eddie guerrero were too 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.799
 my favorite time just my favorite 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.270
 techteam have the yes then synonymous 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.530
 had won and then had titles 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.150
 but somehow argues and that was 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.710
 everything also cool put on 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.149
 it was a pity that they were there 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.890
 no longer working together or like that 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.240
 this weird african american the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.070
 somehow has nothing on it and always so 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.540
 a bodyguard had faith kaledo 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.880
 It was called that or so I think that has really 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.560
 everybody hated or even big show well ok 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.299
 the ball will fall even if that's all 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.619
 What is of course clear is what is needed 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.210
 you just say that has to 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.310
 actually always really awesome and good 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.990
 look whether now rey mysterio 69 or 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.369
 I have the stalemate too 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.140
 here again some exposing 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.460
 somehow they hit or kick each other 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.410
 in 50 percent of cases 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.270
 and I think you look so amazing 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.680
 obviously that's the fade I mean 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.630
 Of course everybody knows that 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.100
 the more realistic that looks the better 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.810
 especially if you hardly have the opponent 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.430
 meets and is about to die 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.660
 I think so what he played badly 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.430
 are still seen that way 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.500
 actor which I also runnig times 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.170
 this is one of the two noticed 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.180
 Participants almost always ko only on the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.530
 ground lies and the other is his thing and 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.760
 his moves will be done all at once 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.440
 he is just getting on the floor 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.210
 lying the power of a lion and that 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.800
 sheet suddenly finds itself is the 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.000
 others almost could just die to death 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.830
 Consecrated stands for nothing 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.630
 happens the same way if both are such a couple 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.980
 had to take attacks and continue 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.930
 serve on the ground as if they were straight 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.460
 wiped away by peta yes i mean 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.960
 Hobby but you do that for years 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.060
 So always keeps a bit 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.730
 more because it is not very much 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.500
 handsome countries a type half naked on 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.880
 the floor I have extra for 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.290
 the video some matches again 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.000
 looked at and still has to say that 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.560
 I actually fight some pretty much 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.360
 I found you can recommend 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.460
 in any case rey mysterio against john 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.080
 cena from 2003, however, is also available 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.460
 Fight the typical thing for me 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.020
 dragonballs are gap fillers 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.360
 For example, the fight between John 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.220
 Cena and Battista 2010 the fight is going on 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.360
 just under 25 minutes and somehow the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.860
 Half did not happen or not 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.540
 exciting ones are running between the 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.520
 spectators at ten minutes long then 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.050
 both on ground and bla bla bla 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.610
 and I find such struggles again 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.440
 extremely boring and above all things 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.150
 also pulled out of the whole 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.770
 foundations are shipments like spector for 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.060
 me personally was not necessarily first 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.440
 some fights you can look at 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.970
 but I would not do the show right now 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.650
 actively pursuing i found that as a child 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.210
 cool because you're just fighting 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.500
 look at it without you thinking about it 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.880
 whether that is played or 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.170
 not that was just awesome when 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.820
 the mutually on the mat 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.590
 I now see that as an adult 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.060
 somehow different you pay more attention to 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.440
 such small things that are for 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.820
 I do not think that's an example 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.500
 That's why it's so easy 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.820
 matter of taste and mine is true 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.290
 not personally, of course anyway 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.850
 Great respect to the Westerners this 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.470
 sport that very dangerous at least 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.510
 if you are not trained in it and for that 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.770
 many fight really well and 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.870
 that requires years of training 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.850
 That's why I play a tip from me 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.290
 such a thing is never at home with us 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.610
 Although nothing ever happens except that 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.170
 our youngest time against the 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.640
 Metal bar come from laundry place 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.260
 is and has healed but still needs to 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.030
 it is not exhausting what I am 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.380
 By the way, if that would be desirable 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.370
 you finally start to mix with it 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.320
 then you could do that again 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.210
 give what would be cool would be such a 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.950
 western broadcast for us youtuber sets 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.150
 times before first meat 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.920
 the each other in the ring and 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.420
 a month later every youtuber is fighting 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.680
 from our scene against the cia 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.120
 well he will and he block all 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.710
 But the idea would not be too 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.840
 you come to the ring and only me 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.130
 stand there is so full of age then 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.630
 the fight is going on and suddenly 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.790
 crawling under the rain board 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.350
 with peter ernst links and petra germany 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.730
 floppy and minister let's play and lenny 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.440
 like kate out and everybody goes to inca 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.150
 grings at yes that was now 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.040
 klaverkamp and cake taste here 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.910
 Waste of trash again on the boards 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.530
 my friends 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.180
 euro what a close fight both lie 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.070
 on the floor you have no energy 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.570
 more to do something here 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.220
 we look just tried it now 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.050
 to come up where I already that one 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.000
 See the course and the cake 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.650
 tastes again against the head and the 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.750
 very realistic again oh my 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.460
 god both have really no power here 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.140
 that was a very blatant fight what the 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.060
 both have tried now 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.830
 cake taste it again 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.630
 to hew behind but without great success 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.610
 Now he's trying his luck again 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.440
 get and board jumps again 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.510
 my god trash now sees 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.650
 paralyzed and cake taste 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.000
 now also wants to board 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.090
 when does the judge begin to dress 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.040
 my friends 123 that was cake 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.750
 did not like my friends won bass 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.520
 he has an incredible victory here 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.040
 Waste trash has a items 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.870
 falls apart and shortly after his victory 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.610
 after he's almost envious, he's upset 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.200
 Once again this is amazing 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.200
 yes, my friends are realistic
