it's got ap backs snake blades so it's

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.640 
it's got ap backs snake blades so it's
basically<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.330> rock<00:01:15.510> blade<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.020> add<00:01:16.170> extra

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
protection to your feet now pee backs is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.170 
protection to your feet now pee backs is
a<00:01:19.170> plastic<00:01:19.650> polymer<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.430> used<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.850> ski

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
a plastic polymer that is used in ski

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.320 
a plastic polymer that is used in ski
boots<00:01:21.210> basically<00:01:21.990> atomic<00:01:22.440> uses<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.180> but<00:01:24.180> it

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
boots basically atomic uses it but it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.510 
boots basically atomic uses it but it
leaned<00:01:24.480> their<00:01:24.660> ski<00:01:24.870> boots<00:01:25.080> why<00:01:25.410> because<00:01:26.190> it's

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
leaned their ski boots why because it's

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.950 
leaned their ski boots why because it's
thermally<00:01:27.000> neutral<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.630> doesn't<00:01:27.870> get

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
thermally neutral so it doesn't get

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.690 
thermally neutral so it doesn't get
super<00:01:28.320> stiff<00:01:28.620> when<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.100> gold<00:01:29.370> and<00:01:29.580> it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
super stiff when it's gold and it

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.850 
super stiff when it's gold and it
doesn't<00:01:30.120> kind<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.390> mush<00:01:30.720> down<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.470> warm

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
doesn't kind of mush down when it's warm

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.920 
doesn't kind of mush down when it's warm
but<00:01:32.160> it's<00:01:32.340> also<00:01:32.490> extremely<00:01:32.910> bouncy<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
but it's also extremely bouncy and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.390 
but it's also extremely bouncy and
extremely<00:01:34.380> lightweight<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:35.070> basically

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
extremely lightweight it's basically

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.570 
extremely lightweight it's basically
like<00:01:35.610> 20%<00:01:36.120> light<00:01:36.540> lighter<00:01:36.960> than<00:01:37.290> regular<00:01:37.920> TPU

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
like 20% light lighter than regular TPU

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.150 
like 20% light lighter than regular TPU
so<00:01:39.330> that's<00:01:39.510> why<00:01:39.660> we<00:01:39.810> use<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.380> ultra<00:01:40.950> fast

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
so that's why we use it in ultra fast

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.280 
so that's why we use it in ultra fast
pack<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.670> then<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.000> will<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.810> dual

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
pack and then you will have a dual

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.000 
pack and then you will have a dual

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
density

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.030

evie<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> midsole<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.870> VA<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.470> kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.830> like<00:01:47.010> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
evie a midsole so a VA is kind of like a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.670 
evie a midsole so a VA is kind of like a
squishy<00:01:47.400> material<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:48.960> comfort<00:01:49.440> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
squishy material it's for comfort and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.230 
squishy material it's for comfort and
protection<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:51.290> you'll<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:53.240> super

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
paired with a gore-tex membrane is going

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.580 
paired with a gore-tex membrane is going
to<00:02:22.460> give<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.480> lot<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.690> breathability<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.500> the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
to give a lot of breathability to the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.520 
to give a lot of breathability to the
shoe<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:25.250> here<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.670> have<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.820> waterproof<00:02:26.300> shoe
