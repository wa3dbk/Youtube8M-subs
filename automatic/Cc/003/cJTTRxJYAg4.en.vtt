look I really love skiing I do almost
anything<00:00:07.210> to<00:00:07.630> go<00:00:07.779> snow<00:00:08.019> skiing<00:00:08.050> but<00:00:08.650> this<00:00:08.830> is

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.010 
anything to go snow skiing but this is

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.010 
anything to go snow skiing but this is
beyond<00:00:09.340> the<00:00:09.400> pale<00:00:09.670> of<00:00:10.000> course<00:00:10.720> I<00:00:10.810> could<00:00:10.990> just

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.020 
beyond the pale of course I could just

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.050 
beyond the pale of course I could just
sit<00:00:11.410> here<00:00:11.500> in<00:00:11.680> the<00:00:11.740> middle<00:00:11.800> of<00:00:11.980> LA<00:00:12.250> waiting<00:00:12.820> for

sit here in the middle of LA waiting for
it<00:00:13.150> to<00:00:13.180> snow

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
it to snow

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.750 
it to snow
but<00:00:14.200> since<00:00:14.380> it's<00:00:14.530> 20<00:00:14.800> degrees<00:00:14.890> here<00:00:15.430> in<00:00:15.610> the

middle of winter and it's never snow in
here<00:00:17.740> ever<00:00:18.010> I<00:00:18.400> think<00:00:19.030> I'm<00:00:19.180> going<00:00:19.270> to<00:00:19.330> be

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
here ever I think I'm going to be

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.109 
here ever I think I'm going to be
wasting<00:00:19.869> more<00:00:19.960> time<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.400> what<00:00:21.520> do<00:00:21.610> you<00:00:21.670> do<00:00:21.850> if

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
wasting more time so what do you do if

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.370 
wasting more time so what do you do if
you<00:00:22.240> live<00:00:22.360> in<00:00:22.480> a<00:00:22.539> place<00:00:22.660> where<00:00:22.960> it<00:00:23.080> doesn't

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
you live in a place where it doesn't

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.800 
you live in a place where it doesn't
snow<00:00:23.619> and<00:00:23.949> you<00:00:24.190> want<00:00:24.340> to<00:00:24.430> go<00:00:24.520> snow<00:00:24.789> skiing<00:00:24.820> well

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
snow and you want to go snow skiing well

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.180 
snow and you want to go snow skiing well
fortunately<00:00:26.140> for<00:00:26.470> me<00:00:26.560> although<00:00:26.770> there's<00:00:27.070> no

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
fortunately for me although there's no

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.160 
fortunately for me although there's no
snow<00:00:27.490> here<00:00:27.520> about<00:00:28.420> ten<00:00:28.660> yards<00:00:28.960> in<00:00:29.050> that

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
snow here about ten yards in that

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.260 
snow here about ten yards in that
direction<00:00:29.320> there's<00:00:30.010> plenty<00:00:30.460> of<00:00:30.490> it<00:00:30.699> so<00:00:31.090> let's

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
direction there's plenty of it so let's

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.450 
direction there's plenty of it so let's
get<00:00:31.420> all<00:00:31.539> this<00:00:31.630> nonsense<00:00:32.079> off<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.829> go<00:00:33.010> to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
get all this nonsense off and go to

00:00:33.460 --> 00:01:10.679 
get all this nonsense off and go to
where<00:00:33.640> the<00:00:34.030> snow<00:00:34.210> is

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.990 

as<00:01:11.689> you<00:01:11.900> can<00:01:11.990> see<00:01:12.310> Thevenin<00:01:13.310> is<00:01:13.460> a<00:01:13.490> purely

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
as you can see Thevenin is a purely

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.030 
as you can see Thevenin is a purely
artificial<00:01:14.450> mountain<00:01:14.990> underneath<00:01:15.830> that

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
artificial mountain underneath that

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.789 
artificial mountain underneath that

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
slope our refrigeration pipes by piping

slope our refrigeration pipes by piping
liquids<00:01:19.130> through<00:01:19.250> that<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.670> can<00:01:19.820> keep<00:01:19.970> all

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
liquids through that you can keep all

this<00:01:20.240> snow<00:01:20.479> nice<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:21.020> crisp<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:21.440> frozen<00:01:21.740> all

this snow nice and crisp and frozen all

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.070 
this snow nice and crisp and frozen all
the<00:01:22.520> year<00:01:22.729> round<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.690> doesn't<00:01:23.899> matter<00:01:23.990> how

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
the year round so it doesn't matter how

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.139 
the year round so it doesn't matter how
hot<00:01:24.440> it<00:01:24.560> gets<00:01:24.680> out<00:01:24.920> there<00:01:24.950> how<00:01:25.580> sunny<00:01:25.939> it<00:01:26.030> is

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
hot it gets out there how sunny it is

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.180 
hot it gets out there how sunny it is
outside<00:01:26.630> inside<00:01:27.560> there's<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.979> year-round

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
outside inside there's a year-round

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.609 
outside inside there's a year-round
scheme<00:01:28.700> once<00:01:29.570> you<00:01:29.690> down<00:01:29.840> here<00:01:30.110> it's<00:01:30.259> very<00:01:30.320> easy

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
scheme once you down here it's very easy

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.289 
scheme once you down here it's very easy
this<00:01:31.070> would<00:01:31.190> be<00:01:31.280> go<00:01:31.399> over<00:01:31.610> there<00:01:31.789> there's<00:01:32.149> an

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
this would be go over there there's an

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.060 
this would be go over there there's an
escalator<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:33.259> takes<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.590> all<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.740> way<00:01:33.799> up<00:01:33.979> to

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
escalator it takes you all the way up to

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.499 
escalator it takes you all the way up to
the<00:01:34.130> top<00:01:34.280> again<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.759> around<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:35.210> around<00:01:35.270> you

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
the top again and around and around you

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.350 
the top again and around and around you
go<00:01:35.979> well<00:01:36.979> what<00:01:37.130> makes<00:01:37.340> this<00:01:37.460> all<00:01:37.700> possible<00:01:37.729> is

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
go well what makes this all possible is

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.389 
go well what makes this all possible is
of<00:01:38.690> course<00:01:38.899> this<00:01:39.110> white<00:01:39.320> stuff<00:01:39.680> but<00:01:40.039> it's<00:01:40.190> not

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
of course this white stuff but it's not

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.580 
of course this white stuff but it's not
snow<00:01:40.729> it's<00:01:41.030> Hermus<00:01:41.869> no<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.960> if<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.170> take<00:01:45.350> water

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
snow it's Hermus no so if you take water

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.430 
snow it's Hermus no so if you take water
and<00:01:45.979> you<00:01:46.159> freeze<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.789> get<00:01:47.119> this<00:01:47.509> just<00:01:48.289> a

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
and you freeze it you get this just a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.889 
and you freeze it you get this just a
solid<00:01:48.830> block<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.280> ice<00:01:49.429> there<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.149> is<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.840> of

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
solid block of ice there it is and of

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.359 
solid block of ice there it is and of
course<00:01:50.929> that's<00:01:51.259> done<00:01:51.560> here<00:01:51.770> too<00:01:52.009> it's<00:01:52.190> done

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
course that's done here too it's done

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.649 
course that's done here too it's done
over<00:01:52.640> there<00:01:54.220> if<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:55.490> flood<00:01:55.789> a<00:01:55.819> large<00:01:56.119> pan<00:01:56.479> with

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
over there if you flood a large pan with

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.480 
over there if you flood a large pan with
water<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.110> put<00:01:57.530> refrigeration<00:01:58.250> pipes

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
water and put refrigeration pipes

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.100 
water and put refrigeration pipes
through<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:58.819> it'll<00:01:59.090> turn<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.420> ice<00:01:59.569> and<00:01:59.960> it

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
through it it'll turn to ice and it

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.990 
through it it'll turn to ice and it
makes<00:02:00.259> a<00:02:00.350> skating<00:02:00.649> rink<00:02:00.800> although<00:02:01.789> you<00:02:01.880> can

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
makes a skating rink although you can

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.219 
makes a skating rink although you can
get<00:02:02.119> round<00:02:02.299> on<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:02.630> very<00:02:02.750> well

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
get round on it very well

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.990 
get round on it very well
you<00:02:03.319> can<00:02:03.440> only<00:02:03.590> do<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:03.860> with<00:02:03.890> skates<00:02:04.429> you<00:02:04.640> can't

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
you can only do it with skates you can't

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.350 
you can only do it with skates you can't
ski<00:02:05.450> on<00:02:05.780> ice<00:02:06.200> for<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:07.850> need<00:02:08.030> your<00:02:08.209> ice

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
ski on ice for that you need your ice

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.600 
ski on ice for that you need your ice

now<00:02:27.140> polymers<00:02:27.620> are<00:02:27.680> interesting<00:02:28.100> for<00:02:28.340> many

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
now polymers are interesting for many

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.130 
now polymers are interesting for many
reasons<00:02:28.880> one<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.359> them<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:29.870> they<00:02:29.959> can

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
reasons one of them is that they can

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.720 
reasons one of them is that they can
absorb<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.590> huge<00:02:30.980> amount<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.400> water

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
absorb a huge amount of water

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.310 
absorb a huge amount of water
they're<00:02:31.970> used<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.299> babies<00:02:32.660> nappies<00:02:33.019> for<00:02:33.049> that

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
they're used in babies nappies for that

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.140 
they're used in babies nappies for that
reason<00:02:33.620> they<00:02:33.890> absorb<00:02:34.280> water<00:02:34.430> but<00:02:34.850> they<00:02:34.940> seem

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
reason they absorb water but they seem

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.420 
reason they absorb water but they seem

their way through the liquid when you

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
will the granules will stick together

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.220 
will the granules will stick together
