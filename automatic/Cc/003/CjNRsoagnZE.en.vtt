 configuration the exo 910 is approved in 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.280
 as a jet and integral 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.289
 other than that this headset is equipped with a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 cheek inflation system called air 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.270
 did what justifies the denomination air 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.820
 from exo 910 the pump is directly 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.979

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.830
 deflates with a thumbs up to fit 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.240
 the inside of the helmet to the face 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.740
 it's ideal for hollow cheeks and 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.780
 skulls end we now go to 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.909
 two screens become a classic of the genre 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.659
 internal sunscreen remembers what 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.100

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.299

 UV protection 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.600
 on the other hand we have a little more noise and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.640
 air when rolling chin guard 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.890

 side aeration again it's 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.579

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.040
 there is only one setting on the input 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.439

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.860
