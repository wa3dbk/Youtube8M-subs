00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.070 
run over the same way on the passenger
side<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:14.090> when<00:02:14.210> you<00:02:14.270> run<00:02:14.390> your<00:02:14.540> wire<00:02:14.690> make<00:02:14.960> it

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
side so when you run your wire make it

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.600 
side so when you run your wire make it
direct<00:02:15.380> route<00:02:15.620> as<00:02:15.800> possible<00:02:16.280> because<00:02:16.370> there's

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
direct route as possible because there's

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.120

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
we run it up to the battery runner wire

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.610 
we run it up to the battery runner wire
to<00:02:40.940> our<00:02:40.970> positive<00:02:41.450> side<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.870> battery<00:02:41.900> we'll

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
to our positive side of a battery we'll

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.990 
to our positive side of a battery we'll
be<00:02:42.709> attaching<00:02:42.920> one<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.280> these<00:02:43.430> terminals<00:02:43.640> here
