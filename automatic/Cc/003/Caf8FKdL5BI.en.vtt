00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.390
 the found that is saved after 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.360
 used must be well kneaded to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.000
 which is maintained in good condition 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.430
 Fondant tends to harden by use 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.430
 of cornstarch or sugar when extending 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.100
 also by the heat of the hand when 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.379
 it is amassing to recover 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.920
 fondant the first thing we should 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.870
 determine which areas are completely 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.870
 hardened 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.430
 with a knife we remove the areas that 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.430
 they are completely hard 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.680
 and proceed to knead to soften it 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.680
 all 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.220
 when there are some parts that still 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.580
 they have a lot of hardness 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.510
 with a roller pressing we try 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.510
 fade 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.610
 this serves for those particles that 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.850
 They are hard but they can still be 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.850
 talk 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.850
 we take the roller to the edges 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.190
 to try to fade completely 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.190
 any hardness that has 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.990
 ah 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.110
 to not know we can use a 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.910
 little fat in the inn and in the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.060
 hands so that it does not stick so much 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.060
 background 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.470
 in this way we recover the fund 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.930
 recovers the elasticity and serves to 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.930
 save and be able to use it again 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.490
 that were good conditions for 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.490
 hold it and reuse it 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.170
 If any particle does not fade there is 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.170
 than withdraw it 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.530
 is that we collect excess of fondant 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.690
 to keep we must have fun 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.360
 protect it with plastic bag put it in 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.400
 a container with a lid away from the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.400
 humidity of light and heat
