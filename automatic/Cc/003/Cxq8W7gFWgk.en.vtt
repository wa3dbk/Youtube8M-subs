00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
become obsolete well we'll have to see

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.130 
become obsolete well we'll have to see
what<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
what this is going to be like in the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
patch but it does mean that shells are

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.050 
patch but it does mean that shells are
going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.380> very<00:01:52.409> expensive<00:01:52.920> hmm<00:01:53.759> maybe
