00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.780
Snap!

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.360
Yay! I won!

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.040
Woo-hoo

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.400
I'm bored, can we play something else?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.080
Hmmm

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.800
Oh, I know what we can do!

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.380
Do you want to build a snowman?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.680
Go away Anna!

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.360
How many times do I have to tell
you!

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.409
You can't build a snowman in the middle of spring!

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.529
Just let it go!

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.120
OK bye!

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.360
Oh, oh, I know!

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.000
Let me show you something...

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.640
Come on, come on, let's go!

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.120
Wow, what's that?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.900
That looks amazing!

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500
So what exactly is this, Anna?

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.100
Well, Elsa...

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.220
This is My AG Monopoly

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.700
You can make it yourself

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.560
We printed the pictures of our favourite dolls and stuck them on

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.540
See...

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.540
We've got a GOTY street...

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.540
...a Princess street

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.229
...and our favourite Customs street

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.429
...AND a Historical street too!

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.390
Each one has a different price

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.030
and you play it just like normal Monopoly!

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.890
What a better way to buy dolls...

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.120
without spending any real money!

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.420
You know Anna, for the first time in forever, I think you're onto something!

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.320
Let's play it then!

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.960
(approaching footsteps)

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.140
Wait a minute!

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.520
Who put me on three hundred &amp;
fifty dollars?!?

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.980
I should be four hundred dollars!!! I should
have a bit of respect around here

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.460
I am the most expensive doll! Not McKenna!

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.120
There, all sorted! (huffs)

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.969
Sorry Kanani, we didn't mean to upset
you!

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.129
Let's all play together then!

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.080
Thanks for watching guys!

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.640
Bye!
