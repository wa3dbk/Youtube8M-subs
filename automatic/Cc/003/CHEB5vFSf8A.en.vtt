00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.900
 ah 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.640
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.170
 my channel I am dashiell and in the video 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.030
 today I will try to explain a 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.950
 Simple way how to start playing 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.529
 this fantastic game without involving 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.750
 an excessive difficulty all this with the 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.520
 Don's help removes as soon as the 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.260
 departure we will leave the first mission 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.180
 that we must perform but we are going 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.830
 moment to calm down a bit and explain the 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.140
 interface so let's give the 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.730
 pause and what is now pointed is nothing 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.890
 more and nothing less than the life meter 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.770
 and of our character's energy what of 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.989
 now they are quick access to be able 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.000
 put any kind of object is a 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.129
 very important thing that is our 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.890
 amount of money pixels are called in 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.470
 the game and here we have a quick access 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.120
 to see the quest and others we can 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.000
 also perform different interactions 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.210
 how to smile and cry with crossarms 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.699
 of the keyboard we move with the blue v / s 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.380
 and how you are already seeing a 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.810
 thing in the game can interact 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.940
 with multiple objects for this we can 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.220
 hit the alt key so everything 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.440
 highlight but now let's go to the trunk 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.720
 that you just saw click the e that is 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.010
 the key that is used main and we are going to 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.110
 select all the objects that 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.240
 we have in that 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.210
 and place it in our inventory or in 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.070
 the hot keys up now 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.740
 we see that we have just overcome the mission 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.810
 that simply consisted of grabbing a 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.490
 of the main tools that is 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.560
 which is shaped like a yellow ouija board 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.600
 now let's see one of the aspects 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.760
 more curious about this game that is going to 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.860
 give the possibility of traveling to others 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.200
 planets here we are seeing how 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.760
 we can look for planets at random as 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.280
 we can select one to be 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.740
 our home and travel to them but for 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.600
 that we need to have gasoline and that's 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.360
 get for example with the trees that 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.880
 later we are going to cut down just 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.040
 we put the unrefined wood there and now 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.259
 we can travel and visit another galaxy 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.330
 but now we are going to carry out the mission 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.550
 and for this we have to travel already 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.709
 first time to the planet to get down precisely 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.630
 we simply give wings to the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.030
 platform and we want to go back 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.070
 to the ship we can press that icon 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.080
 that this one was on screen but we're going to 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.780
 go back down and concentrate on what 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.970
 Now it's time to get wood for 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.459
 craft table eo and is that this object 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.860
 so necessary you just need to 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.110
 this material as at the moment we have 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.850
 an ax that would make the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.850
 work we are going to use the tool 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.800
 basic you will see that all the zones 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.780
 which we can access with it are going 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.520
 to see illuminated a blue color 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.060
 while the areas that we reach 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.490
 will appear in a red tone this is 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.890
 a job as you are seeing that it takes 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.100
 a little but that at the beginning you have 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.500
 what to do like that if I know unless 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.570
 have a friend pass you an ax 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.340
 improved but as of now these 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.990
 they are simply basic concepts 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.510
 we have to base on collecting all the 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.280
 material by ourselves once 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.240
 have done that let's see another 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.550
 instrument that will not come quite 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.280
 ok another tool in the flashlight and 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.290
 those targets that are useful and 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.780
 indispensable for the creation of 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.060
 bandages and a bow something that at 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.520
 principle is necessary since you have to 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.860
 see also how they are placed for example 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.540
 the torches are simply selected 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.920
 and the main tool is going to 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.470
 serve quite well for that process 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.140
 they are blue you can place red zone not 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.620
 and what is the key to access the 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.530
 Laser craft panel for the table 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.750
 craft eo you need to have wood but 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.910
 refined woods not just such 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.220
 which you get from trees 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.280
 we give to that button and now little by little 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.230
 we can go creating it like that until the 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.600
 corresponding number that appears by 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.330
 course always indicated in the object 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.450
 what we want to create are 25 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.640
 we need 25 refined wood and 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.550
 we just created the table now he plays 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.740
 place it and the next mission is already 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.540
 get meat from the enemies that we 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.080
 we can find by the way but 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.830
 first of all we are going to place the table 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.140
 because now we're going to need 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.730
 also the creation of the arch with the arch 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.950
 the possibility of power increases 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.720
 get meat from the bugs we go 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.700
 to kill though when we kill them with 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.370
 normal weapons there is also a small 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.720
 percentage of getting one of the 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.640
 good things is that we can also 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.010
 get skins that are necessary for 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.450
 the creation of some armor some 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.820
 that will be very good for us 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.980
 first phase of game I recommend if 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.410
 At first it costs you to kill with the bow 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.750
 to lower the life of bugs a bit 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.170
 the main weapon but then finish them 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.910
 with the bow is a tactic that works 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.650
 well since after all we need 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.140
 a technique that helps us to fulfill 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.210
 our goal and once we have 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.910
 for example a few pieces of meat 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.810
 we simply build the camp of 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:00.380
 fire for that to call it the bonfire the 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.960
 campfire and put it on the map to 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.900
 access any kraft table eh or 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.000
 material that we just placed we have 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.340
 that illuminate the tail of the cursor and press 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.680
 the and the interaction key as it happens 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.440
 exactly the same with the campfire there 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.530
 let's have a space to place in 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.950
 this case the chops to give to 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.620
 to cook and that already happens may be very 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.570
 more appetizing once we have it 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.810
 list we can place it in one of the 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.090
 quick access to feed us 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.890
 remember that in the game if you do not eat then 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.630
 you are going to lose life and you are going to die 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.900
 surely that can also happen 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.480
 as commented we give space and click 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.520
 left so we feed ourselves and by the 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.840
 night happens another thing is that the bugs 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.740
 that we are going to appear are stronger 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.740
 so it's usually advisable to be in 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.570
 a protected space one of the last 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.220
 things already to finish this tutorial is 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:01.470
 get for example the tools 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.990
 basic minar be it a pick and an ax 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.820
 because if we are not going to see as our 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.310
 kraft time eo to get the 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.100
 materials have increased a 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.220
 very silly way so we look at the 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.100
 stone with the basic tool we're going to 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.110
 the craft table eo and as fast as 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.940
 we can back just cut down 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.720
 how many trees and to get a bit of 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.940
 stone 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.250
 we make the necessary materials 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.940
 remember that at the beginning it is usually 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:33.720
 most needed an ax and a peak the peak 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:36.720
 for minerals the stone for gold 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.840
 for all that kind of stuff 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.130
 the ax for the trees and the osx we 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.960
 it's good for later when we go to 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.440
 cultivate us for our own 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.810
 food 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.020
 Now for you to see the difference 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.120
 to try to finish here the creators of 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.580
 game announced that in addition now in 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.880
 the new update was going to be a bit 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.560
 faster to eliminate there are different 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.340
 types of materials you already know axes 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.430
 gold stone so good little by little 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.570
 this has been a very basic tutorial 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.100
 soon you will see others about how 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.780
 make small constructions a little 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.000
 simple and I hope you find it 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.660
 entertaining to see and good luck in 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.660
 this fantastic game 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.690
 ah 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.690
 Y
