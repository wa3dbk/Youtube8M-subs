00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.859 
told
distance<00:01:05.220> between<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.820> buttons<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
distance between the buttons in the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.370 
distance between the buttons in the
turntable<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.979> seems<00:01:08.400> arcade<00:01:09.090> which<00:01:09.570> I'm<00:01:10.200> not

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
turntable it seems arcade which I'm not

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.870 
turntable it seems arcade which I'm not
used<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.650> I'm<00:01:10.740> used<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.520> original

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
used to I'm used to I'm the original

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.350 
used to I'm used to I'm the original
controller<00:01:12.409> styled<00:01:13.640> distance<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
controller styled distance so I have a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.749 
controller styled distance so I have a
little<00:01:15.540> bit<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.750> trouble<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
little bit of trouble with that and a

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.670 
little bit of trouble with that and a
little<00:01:17.759> bit<00:01:17.850> higher<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.080> arcade

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
little bit higher up to just like arcade

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.429 
little bit higher up to just like arcade
and<00:01:19.860> assuming<00:01:20.189> say<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.210> FB<00:01:21.450> 7<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:22.020> smaller

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and assuming say the FB 7 is smaller

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.249 
and assuming say the FB 7 is smaller
than<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.009> Platinum<00:01:23.490> Edition<00:01:24.259> revolution

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
than the Platinum Edition revolution

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.200 
than the Platinum Edition revolution
against<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.590> called<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.090> only

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
against it's called and the only

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.350 
against it's called and the only
difference<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.990> turntable<00:01:28.439> smaller<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
difference is the turntable smaller and

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.420 
difference is the turntable smaller and
the<00:01:30.360> buttons<00:01:30.600> are<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> same<00:01:31.049> panel<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the buttons are on the same panel as the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.950 
the buttons are on the same panel as the
certain<00:01:32.820> sector<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> same<00:01:33.360> panel<00:01:33.600> as<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
certain sector of the same panel as the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.029 
certain sector of the same panel as the
7<00:01:34.229> keys<00:01:34.380> where

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
7 keys where

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.370 
7 keys where
by<00:01:35.610> them<00:01:35.789> understand<00:01:36.750> evolution<00:01:36.869> they're<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
by them understand evolution they're a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.779 
by them understand evolution they're a
little<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:37.710> higher<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.399> a<00:01:38.430> separate

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
little bit higher up and on a separate

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.910 
little bit higher up and on a separate
panel<00:01:39.750> see<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.439> far<00:01:40.649> as<00:01:40.740> functionality<00:01:40.890> goes

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
panel see as far as functionality goes

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.730 
panel see as far as functionality goes
works<00:01:43.920> pretty<00:01:44.159> good<00:01:44.450> all<00:01:45.450> buddies<00:01:45.869> click<00:01:46.590> like

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
works pretty good all buddies click like

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.919 
works pretty good all buddies click like
they<00:01:46.890> should<00:01:47.130> these<00:01:47.729> are<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> DJ<00:01:48.390> tab<00:01:48.600> buttons

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
they should these are the DJ tab buttons

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.770 
they should these are the DJ tab buttons
and<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.950> think<00:01:50.909> cherry<00:01:51.270> microswitches

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and I think cherry microswitches

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.649 
and I think cherry microswitches
whatever's<00:01:52.229> default<00:01:52.590> I'm<00:01:52.829> not<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> collector

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
whatever's default I'm not a collector

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.169 
whatever's default I'm not a collector
and<00:01:54.799> yes<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:55.920> when<00:01:56.039> I<00:01:56.069> got<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.700> key<00:01:57.000> are

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
and yes so when I got it this key are

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.819 
and yes so when I got it this key are
here<00:01:57.509> stuck<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> little<00:01:58.409> bit<00:01:58.500> if<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.649> have

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
here stuck a little bit if you have

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.649 
here stuck a little bit if you have
pushed<00:01:59.039> it<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.460> pushed<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.729> up<00:01:59.880> go<00:02:00.509> ahead

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
pushed it in and pushed it up go ahead

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.370 
pushed it in and pushed it up go ahead
stick<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:00.990> place<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> took<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.850> apart<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.390> up

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
stick in place so I took it apart and up

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.089 
stick in place so I took it apart and up

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
a little bit of oil around it and I sit

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.650 
a little bit of oil around it and I sit
like<00:02:08.099> couple<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.489> buttons<00:02:08.729> actually<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
like couple of buttons actually have a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.150 
like couple of buttons actually have a
sound<00:02:10.049> like<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> little<00:02:10.500> bit<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.679> us<00:02:10.769> you<00:02:11.039> can

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
sound like a little bit of us you can

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.280 
sound like a little bit of us you can
hear<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> spring<00:02:11.640> vibrating<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.750> one<00:02:12.989> on<00:02:13.260> a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
hear the spring vibrating this one on a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.319 
hear the spring vibrating this one on a
nose<00:02:13.440> ears<00:02:14.120> see<00:02:16.099> yeah<00:02:17.099> that's<00:02:18.000> one<00:02:18.150> problem

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
nose ears see yeah that's one problem

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.610 
nose ears see yeah that's one problem
with<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.660> but<00:02:18.840> I'm<00:02:18.989> sure<00:02:19.019> that<00:02:19.170> could<00:02:19.380> be<00:02:19.470> fixed

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
with it but I'm sure that could be fixed

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.949 
with it but I'm sure that could be fixed
if<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:19.829> just<00:02:19.980> took<00:02:20.099> it<00:02:20.160> apart<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.569> I<00:02:21.750> move

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
if I just took it apart and and I move

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.890 
if I just took it apart and and I move
the<00:02:22.079> spring<00:02:22.260> around<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.799> lock<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.099> be<00:02:23.250> sure

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
the spring around and lock that be sure

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.580 
the spring around and lock that be sure
yeah<00:02:24.930> another<00:02:25.590> problem<00:02:25.799> with<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.489> the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
yeah another problem with it is the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.380 
yeah another problem with it is the
decal<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:29.069> turntable<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.150> one<00:02:30.299> right

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
decal on the turntable this one right

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.830 
decal on the turntable this one right
here<00:02:30.599> is<00:02:31.160> not<00:02:32.160> stuck<00:02:32.549> on<00:02:32.670> right<00:02:32.970> it's<00:02:33.239> lifting

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
here is not stuck on right it's lifting

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.289 
here is not stuck on right it's lifting
up<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.260> I'll<00:02:35.010> push<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.340> down<00:02:35.579> and<00:02:35.880> then<00:02:36.030> five

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
up so I'll push it down and then five

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.300 
up so I'll push it down and then five
minutes<00:02:36.329> later<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:37.440> edges<00:02:37.739> will<00:02:37.890> be<00:02:37.920> lifted

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
minutes later the edges will be lifted

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.590 
minutes later the edges will be lifted
up<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.610> think<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.880> need<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.060> glue<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.420> down

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
up so I think I need to glue that down

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.140 
up so I think I need to glue that down
again<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:40.459> don't<00:02:41.459> know<00:02:41.579> what<00:02:41.730> kind<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:41.970> glue<00:02:42.120> to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
again I don't know what kind of glue to

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.490 
again I don't know what kind of glue to
use<00:02:42.359> for<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.750> not<00:02:42.870> be<00:02:42.930> completely

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
use for it to not be completely

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.590 
use for it to not be completely
permanent<00:02:43.920> cuz<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.130> would<00:02:44.220> be<00:02:44.280> bad<00:02:44.519> if<00:02:45.480> you

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
permanent cuz that would be bad if you

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.539 
permanent cuz that would be bad if you
need<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.870> do<00:02:45.989> any<00:02:46.109> service

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
need to do any service

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.890 
need to do any service
yeah<00:02:47.549> this<00:02:47.700> thing<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.030> really<00:02:48.480> easy<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.780> work

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
yeah this thing is really easy to work

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.380 
yeah this thing is really easy to work
on<00:02:49.109> there's<00:02:49.889> just

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.570 

okay<00:02:54.930> there's<00:02:55.110> just<00:02:55.290> twelve<00:02:56.040> or<00:02:56.220> fourteen

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
okay there's just twelve or fourteen

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.020 
okay there's just twelve or fourteen
screws<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.870> bottom<00:02:57.990> you<00:02:58.350> just<00:02:58.530> take<00:02:58.740> off

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
screws on the bottom you just take off

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.360 
screws on the bottom you just take off
bottom<00:03:00.030> panel<00:03:00.300> comes<00:03:00.480> off<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:01.190> you've<00:03:02.190> got

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
bottom panel comes off and you've got

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.570 
bottom panel comes off and you've got
all<00:03:02.460> your<00:03:02.580> innards<00:03:02.850> so<00:03:03.330> yeah<00:03:04.610> that's<00:03:05.610> what's

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
all your innards so yeah that's what's

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.580 
all your innards so yeah that's what's
their<00:03:08.580> kill<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.600> when<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.840> got<00:03:09.990> in<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.140> Box<00:03:10.350> pin

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
their kill and when I got in the Box pin

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.180 
their kill and when I got in the Box pin
it<00:03:10.710> was<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:12.800> parallel<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:14.270> ps2<00:03:15.270> adapter<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.560> has

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
it was a parallel to ps2 adapter and has

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.000 
it was a parallel to ps2 adapter and has
two<00:03:17.580> ports<00:03:17.910> on<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.150> which<00:03:18.420> if<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.530> have<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> real

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
two ports on it which if you have a real

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.290 
two ports on it which if you have a real
Edition<00:03:20.430> you'll<00:03:20.580> probably<00:03:20.850> need<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.180> two

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
Edition you'll probably need the two

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.030 
Edition you'll probably need the two
ports<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:21.870> need<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.080> one<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.470> don't<00:03:22.920> have<00:03:23.010> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
ports I just need the one I don't have a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.560 
ports I just need the one I don't have a
parallel<00:03:23.430> port<00:03:23.670> on<00:03:23.730> my<00:03:23.760> computer<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.330> this<00:03:24.420> is

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
parallel port on my computer so this is

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.260 
parallel port on my computer so this is
what<00:03:25.050> tickles<00:03:25.290> me<00:03:25.470> right<00:03:25.680> now<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.490> this<00:03:27.150> is

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
what tickles me right now and this is

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.500 
what tickles me right now and this is
kind<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:27.540> odd<00:03:27.690> but<00:03:28.080> I<00:03:28.140> got<00:03:28.380> an<00:03:28.590> extra<00:03:28.920> PCB<00:03:29.640> which

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
kind of odd but I got an extra PCB which

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.710 
kind of odd but I got an extra PCB which
is<00:03:30.780> apparently<00:03:31.200> not<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.800> standard<00:03:32.250> advice

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
is apparently not the standard advice

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.630 
is apparently not the standard advice
yeah<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.870> came<00:03:34.140> with<00:03:34.290> mine<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:35.100> guess<00:03:35.489> in

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
yeah it came with mine so I guess in

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
yeah it came with mine so I guess in
case<00:03:35.790> mine<00:03:36.030> no<00:03:36.980> they<00:03:37.980> got<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.220> one<00:03:38.660> yeah

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
case mine no they got this one yeah

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.120 
case mine no they got this one yeah
that's<00:03:39.840> pretty<00:03:40.050> much<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.590> looks<00:03:41.510> good

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
that's pretty much it it looks good

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.490 
that's pretty much it it looks good
no<00:03:44.130> misfires<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:45.000> turntable<00:03:45.600> works

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
no misfires the turntable works

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.530 
no misfires the turntable works
perfectly<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.310> looks<00:03:47.970> beautiful

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
perfectly and it looks beautiful

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.199 
perfectly and it looks beautiful
yeah<00:03:48.870> you're<00:03:49.410> interested<00:03:49.920> in<00:03:50.100> a<00:03:50.400> sb7

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
yeah you're interested in a sb7

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.350 
yeah you're interested in a sb7
controller<00:03:52.050> for<00:03:52.380> VNA<00:03:52.800> 2<00:03:52.920> DX<00:03:53.130> should<00:03:53.459> probably

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
controller for VNA 2 DX should probably

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.440 
controller for VNA 2 DX should probably
go<00:03:54.570> for<00:03:54.780> it
