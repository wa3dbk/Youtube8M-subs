hey guys tonight marine here with
another<00:00:02.700> MLS<00:00:03.480> profile<00:00:03.840> today<00:00:04.020> tackle<00:00:04.410> up<00:00:04.470> the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
another MLS profile today tackle up the

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.930 
another MLS profile today tackle up the
13<00:00:05.480> 16<00:00:06.480> s<00:00:06.720> metalworkers<00:00:07.649> these<00:00:08.519> guys<00:00:08.730> are

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
13 16 s metalworkers these guys are

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.580 
13 16 s metalworkers these guys are
basically<00:00:09.059> welders<00:00:09.690> they<00:00:11.870> will<00:00:12.870> fix<00:00:13.320> anything

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
basically welders they will fix anything

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.810 
basically welders they will fix anything
I<00:00:13.889> imagine<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.429> requires<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.179> weld

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
I imagine that requires you to weld

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.340 
I imagine that requires you to weld
there's<00:00:17.820> not<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> ton<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.510> them<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.869> really<00:00:19.199> don't

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
there's not a ton on them I really don't

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.900 
there's not a ton on them I really don't
know<00:00:19.439> how<00:00:19.650> many<00:00:19.710> welders<00:00:20.250> at<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> rink<00:00:20.730> are

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
know how many welders at the rink are

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.130 
know how many welders at the rink are
actually<00:00:21.210> employees<00:00:21.650> but<00:00:23.840> basically<00:00:24.840> here<00:00:25.080> it

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
actually employees but basically here it

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.890 
actually employees but basically here it
says<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.939> you'll<00:00:26.939> basically<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.720> come

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
says that you'll basically have to come

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.359 
says that you'll basically have to come
up<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.830> build<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.070> know<00:00:29.189> how<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
up with you have to build to know how to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.120 
up with you have to build to know how to
come<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:30.289> drawing<00:00:31.289> some<00:00:31.590> work<00:00:31.769> orders

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
come up with drawing some work orders

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.950 
come up with drawing some work orders
for<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> different<00:00:32.969> stuff<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.660> plan<00:00:33.840> on

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
for the different stuff to plan on

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.900 
for the different stuff to plan on
building<00:00:34.370> then<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.460> got<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.730> able<00:00:35.790> to

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
building then you got to be able to

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.400 
building then you got to be able to
determine<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.360> sequence<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.809> operations

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410

to perform basic maintenance how to do
some<00:00:56.789> basic<00:00:56.820> repairs<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.620> imagine<00:00:58.770> if

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
some basic repairs on it I imagine if

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.200 
some basic repairs on it I imagine if
some<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.219> your<00:00:59.280> stuff<00:00:59.430> gets<00:00:59.640> really<00:00:59.820> broken

they'll either replace it or send it up
to<00:01:02.760> somebody<00:01:02.940> hire<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.420> fix<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.049> you're

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
to somebody hire to fix it but you're

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.350 
to somebody hire to fix it but you're
expected<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:05.760> least<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.030> little<00:01:06.060> bit

of<00:01:06.420> how<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.869> that

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
of how to do that

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.210 
of how to do that

and yeah I mean I can't imagine the
Welding<00:01:25.680> school<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.009> way<00:01:26.159> too<00:01:26.220> long<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.759> would

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
Welding school is way too long I would

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.480 
Welding school is way too long I would
say<00:01:27.000> maybe<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.270> month<00:01:28.130> but<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.220> doesn't<00:01:29.400> really

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
say maybe a month but it doesn't really

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.140 
say maybe a month but it doesn't really
say<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:30.439> possibly<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.680> more<00:01:32.150> but

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
say here possibly a little more but

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.210 
say here possibly a little more but
there's<00:01:33.390> only<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.600> much<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.710> teach<00:01:35.040> on

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
there's only so much you can teach on

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.710 
there's only so much you can teach on
welding<00:01:35.400> before<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.150> send<00:01:36.329> people<00:01:36.390> out
