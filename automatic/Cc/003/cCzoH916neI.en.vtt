00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 do not 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.459
 in case the current one was not clear 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.379
 tendency to create wearable devices 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.450
 the cess was reached first and then 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.000
 mobile world congress to confirm what 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.590
 that it was an open secret the fever for 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.239
 quantify and measure any activity 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.220
 continues to rise today so much the big 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:27.250
 as the little ones want to place their 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.740
 devices the ampa 5 in addition to the s5 and 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.439
 the jr fit also brought us the gear 2 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.420
 neo this new smart watch loses the 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.750
 nickname galaxy because it leaves 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.670
 Android pro for the thyssen platform 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.890
 the gear 2 neo presents a clear improvement 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.960
 with respect to its predecessor abandoning 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.690
 this time if the gaps that the first 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.489
 model of the brand presented this smart 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.789
 watch will be an alternative series to 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.019
 sony model and at the same pib the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.180
 Much was said about the lack of ergonomics 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.460
 even poor design of the galaxy gear 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.469
 this feedback has been collected by the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.149
 Koreans who have created a device 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.649
 that although very similar shows 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.869
 differences that have endowed 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.840
 greater ergonomics improving the weight that 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.610
 reaches 55 grams although the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.979
 polycarbonate and a material similar to 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.660
 Teflon predominate throughout the whole 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.530
 touch is nice although it has 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.680
 seemed something 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.869
 sober and no frills physically little 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.060
 more we can appreciate except a single 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.270
 button like yesterday fit and the issuer 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.270
 infrared 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.780
 its 163-inch super amoled screen 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.080
 diagonal reaches a resolution of 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.070
 320 x 320 pixels which gives an 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.420
 density of 278 pixels per inch 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.300
 one complete specifications 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.910
 315 milliamp battery connectivity 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.070
 bluetooth 4.0 and sensors for 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.020
 quantify physical activity as 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.050
 gyroscope accelerometer and pedometer 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.260
 heart rate monitor does not have 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:58.030
 forgotten ip67 certification giving it 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.030
 of resistance to dust and water 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.250
 the relationship with our smartphone 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.080
 galaxy is very intuitive getting 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.510
 match it easily thanks to 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.550
 the bluetooth connectivity just like 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.050
 it happened to us with the gear fit maybe 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.240
 match we should submit it to 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.010
 software updates that improve 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.080
 small mistakes 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.640
 german yesterday is an intuitive environment and in 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.470
 the one with a few clicks of 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.060
 screen we can have access and 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.460
 configure all the functions that 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.110
 we need in the screen menu of 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.270
 start we can customize the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.840
 visualization by changing the backgrounds of 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.400
 screen or fitness watches widget us 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.830
 will allow to check the status of 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.200
 our activities as steps taken on 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.280
 exercise performed heart rate 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.280
 or our sleep time 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.580
 like good smart watch notifications 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.350
 they are part of their functions being able 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.570
 select any application 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.770
 unlike gear fit we 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.140
 we find two sections 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.910
 completely new in the first of 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.680
 they will find the applications 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.600
 some of which have the 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.060
 possibility of being configured though 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.120
 will be the least in the other section 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.800
 we found the samsung apps in it is 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.600
 possible to download applications from 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.150
 different thematic of both payment and 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.850
 free all from the store of 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.160
 we Koreans will also find a 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.140
 very practical function is about looking 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.090
 mayer with which we can locate 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.130
 our smart watch if we do not know where 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.320
 we have left it 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.210
 in the adjustments section we will find 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.610
 some options how to set the 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.870
 double click on your button or how to activate the 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.870
 smart watch with a gesture 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.510
 and if the feed surprised us the gear 2 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.950
 neo has not been less like smart watch 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.270
 we will find the functions of 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.940
 call registration notification 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.830
 contacts or a handy marker with the 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.900
 that we can launch the call from the 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.880
 smart watch and even talk through 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.590
 of it if at any time 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.580
 we need privacy in the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.920
 conversation 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.430
 we can directly pass the call to 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.430
 Our telephone 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.400
 when we use it to measure our 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.770
 physical activity and we need 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.440
 accompaniment for the same has 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.120
 control for the music player in 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.240
 the adjustments section we will find 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.650
 how to set the home screen 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.720
 Sound notifications or settings 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.520
 of screen among others how 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.440
 quantifier will be a very device 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.540
 complete with each and every one of the 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.570
 functions of models like joe with app 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.130
 fitbit or night fuel the pedometer and the 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.960
 heart rate monitor will be two functions very 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.740
 useful when we go running to give a 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.180
 ride to go cycling or hiking 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.070
 also with xbox we can issue 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.200
 commands through the voice and that the 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.220
 smart watch do it for us 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.220
 I love Juan 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.050
 do not 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.949
 the neo gear 2 is quite a surprise 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.600
 after past experiences it is about 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.550
 of a smart watch really 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.139
 complete with all the functions that 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.169
 this one should have adding the 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.610
 intended to quantify our 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.199
 devices like this will make those who 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.570
 they abandon their quantifier at six 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.490
 months of use consider it an extension 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.580
 of your phone and not a mere gadget 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.590
 dispensable a sober design with some 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.690
 materials that convey a sensation 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.030
 of quality although it is true that we 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.250
 would lack that premium touch in terms of 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.710
 Design and under our point of view apk 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.330
 sober since it can be a little 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.620
 boring and maybe too discreet 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.200
 notifications called heart rate monitor 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.030
 pedometer a refined environment and one more 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.190
 that pleasant experience of use or a 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.990
 outstanding fluency will be the points 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.990
 that stand out from this little clock 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.540
 anyway his battery is one 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.100
 of his main handicaps since with 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.260
 intensive use we will arrive with 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.360
 difficulty at two days and with a use 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.400
 moderate we'll just finish the room 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.530
 it is also another negative point its 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.570
 compatibility limited only to 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.570
 galaxy devices and not the entire range 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.870
 For its part, the price leaves us a bit 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.790
 ambiguous since many of you can raise 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.650
 that may seem too high 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.450
 but taking into account the functions 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.750
 that offers we consider it within the 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.750
 segment 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:08.860
 surprise from the nickname that better 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:10.749
 define the gear 2 neo this wearable is 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.119
 comes very close to the concept of smart 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:15.159
 watch beating the sony model and 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:18.629
 being very close to models so 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.629
 outstanding like pib him
