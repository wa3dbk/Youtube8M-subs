another<00:00:47.809> significant<00:00:48.409> change<00:00:48.710> is<00:00:48.949> the<00:00:49.100> use<00:00:49.249> of

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
another significant change is the use of

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.180 
another significant change is the use of
42<00:00:50.059> millimeter<00:00:50.480> carburetors<00:00:51.199> in<00:00:51.589> place<00:00:51.949> of

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
the 48 millimeters used on the VTR but

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.209 
the 48 millimeters used on the VTR but
don't<00:00:56.479> be<00:00:56.659> fooled<00:00:56.690> into<00:00:57.079> thinking<00:00:57.229> that<00:00:57.620> the

don't be fooled into thinking that the

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.309 
don't be fooled into thinking that the
power<00:00:58.460> of<00:00:58.729> this<00:00:58.940> motor<00:00:59.269> has<00:00:59.510> been<00:00:59.569> completely

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
very very capable machine it'll still

produce 94 brake horsepower which is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.730 
produce 94 brake horsepower which is
about<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.240> dozen<00:01:08.509> or<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:08.780> less<00:01:09.229> than<00:01:09.530> a

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
about a dozen or so less than a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.560 
about a dozen or so less than a
firestorm<00:01:10.340> but<00:01:10.579> it's<00:01:10.700> still<00:01:10.880> better<00:01:11.180> than

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
firestorm but it's still better than

anything else in this giant trailer
class<00:01:14.509> another<00:01:15.320> modification<00:01:16.100> on<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:16.280> engine

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
class another modification on the engine

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.580 
class another modification on the engine
is<00:01:16.729> down<00:01:17.000> at<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.180> bottom<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.049> sump<00:01:18.350> the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
is down at the bottom so the sump the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.190 
is down at the bottom so the sump the
sump<00:01:18.829> is<00:01:19.009> smaller<00:01:19.369> on<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.789> Varadero<00:01:20.420> got<00:01:20.990> less

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
sump is smaller on the Varadero got less

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.649 
sump is smaller on the Varadero got less
capacity<00:01:21.399> and<00:01:22.399> that's<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.850> provide<00:01:23.180> more

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
capacity and that's to provide more

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.480 
capacity and that's to provide more
ground<00:01:23.990> clearance<00:01:24.350> because<00:01:24.860> this<00:01:25.130> thing<00:01:25.340> is

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
ground clearance because this thing is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.600 
ground clearance because this thing is
supposed<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:25.939> look<00:01:26.149> like<00:01:26.780> an<00:01:26.960> off-road<00:01:27.320> bike

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
supposed to look like an off-road bike

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.639 
supposed to look like an off-road bike
well<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:29.030> does<00:01:29.329> look<00:01:29.570> like<00:01:30.109> an<00:01:30.289> off-road<00:01:30.619> bike

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
well it does look like an off-road bike

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.620 
well it does look like an off-road bike
the<00:01:31.039> fact<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.369> it's<00:01:31.520> completely<00:01:32.420> hopeless

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
the fact that it's completely hopeless

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.539 
the fact that it's completely hopeless
off-road<00:01:33.380> is<00:01:33.590> besides<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.219> point

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
off-road is besides the point

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.060 
off-road is besides the point
the<00:01:34.880> problem<00:01:35.210> is<00:01:35.329> it's<00:01:35.509> simply<00:01:35.780> too<00:01:36.200> big<00:01:36.469> and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
the problem is it's simply too big and

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.859 
the problem is it's simply too big and
it's<00:01:37.250> far<00:01:37.520> too<00:01:37.850> heavy<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.420> cope<00:01:38.600> with<00:01:38.719> any

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
it's far too heavy to cope with any

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.260 
it's far too heavy to cope with any
serious<00:01:39.500> terrain<00:01:40.009> any<00:01:40.640> serious<00:01:41.030> rough

terrain few potholes and cobble streets

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.190 
terrain few potholes and cobble streets
not<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.060> problem<00:01:44.479> but<00:01:44.630> if<00:01:44.719> the<00:01:44.810> going<00:01:45.020> gets

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
not a problem but if the going gets

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.050 
not a problem but if the going gets
tough<00:01:45.439> don't<00:01:46.219> bother<00:01:46.369> trying<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:46.820> on<00:01:46.909> one<00:01:47.030> of

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
tough don't bother trying it on one of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.880 
tough don't bother trying it on one of
these<00:01:47.240> there's<00:01:47.840> no<00:01:48.020> point<00:01:48.320> having<00:01:48.530> an

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
these there's no point having an

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.950 
these there's no point having an
off-road<00:01:49.219> bike<00:01:49.250> that<00:01:50.210> you<00:01:50.299> can't<00:01:50.479> even<00:01:50.659> pick

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
off-road bike that you can't even pick

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.830 
off-road bike that you can't even pick
up<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.520> must<00:01:52.670> be<00:01:52.759> good<00:01:52.909> at<00:01:53.030> something<00:01:53.240> well

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
up so it must be good at something well

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.349

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
come off why does it not flip back or

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.290 
come off why does it not flip back or
hinge<00:04:33.499> or<00:04:33.740> something<00:04:34.309> I<00:04:34.430> don't<00:04:34.520> know<00:04:34.759> there's

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
no reason for it to come off it's just a

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.489 
no reason for it to come off it's just a
nuisance<00:04:37.729> and<00:04:38.539> not<00:04:38.719> just<00:04:38.900> that<00:04:39.080> but<00:04:39.139> when<00:04:39.409> you

00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:39.499
