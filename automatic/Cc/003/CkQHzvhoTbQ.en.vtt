00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.480
 flavian 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.930
 distinguished 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.780
 creator of brazil 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.410
 boateng is a pure action game in combats in the style consecrated by 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.599
 classic series final fight 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.079
 the plot exists only to include 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.820
 the young man had taken his life normally 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.859
 until he saw a young woman in trouble after SÃ£o Paulo 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.100
 but it was no match for the fringe 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.829
 and had his right arm and been talked to 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.079
 because they belonged to a gang 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.899
 and under the pretext of hunting down governments 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.649
 beings that have the power of the gods motivate people or give 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.530
 she imagined that olivia the young woman was saved by him is exactly the power of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.799
 grant divine power and so he returns to have two arms again 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.489
 however 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.379
 his torment was only beginning as groups pursuing 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.230
 bloggers 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.650
 but they were after you with a friend like Liya, nobody needs to 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.190
 enemies 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.000
 the premise is not at all cool, but a script driven with scenes 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.530
 of an amount such as the pastel threat yet understands the following in its 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.580
 all terrain is an easy and simple game instead 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.530
 This is one of the most challenging fighting games of recent times paulo 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.659
 many parties 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.010
 for an average player 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.010
 it is practically impossible to pass on the first attempt 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.370
 mainly against the jets 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.880
 the slopes system has some differences compared to other games 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.000
 of the genus 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.320
 here it does not only matter with the fia as the elusive ones are of extreme relevance 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.369
 more than 100 bags available 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.760
 and can be edited by the player 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.330
 creating several combos 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.130
 when setting up a plot you should start with 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.740
 both parties followed by movements with increasing reach but also 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.270
 certain speed 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.820
 and ending with one has a powerful 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.399
 in fact the variety of blows and a half 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.100
 and the combinations even more 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.299
 who likes fights can spend hours avoiding 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.459
 in every moment 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.559
 perhaps the most important moment in the detente belenenses 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.409
 done through the right analog 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.199
 the enemies catch up to some extent but then started to defend themselves 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.649
 and that goal if it does not act fast on a counterattack from stealing 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:32.309
 to beat the lock the back is another pass the guard said this for 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.949
 made their attacks become more powerful 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.349
 if they start attacking the way it's getting out of the way 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.859
 because there is no brat here 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.099
 Teresa 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.099
 it will be the agency 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.299
 the character still has two types of powerful attacks 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:54.230
 like cordovil 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.000
 and subdivides into other very funny movements like the famous 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.449
 kick in the low parts 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.519
 many blue opponents of so much pain 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.189
 in another the fighter makes three ways to throw a baseball 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.259
 and ends with a year 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:12.779
 the most powerful on top of the enemy 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:18.369
 the other attack and the pension / release that is accumulated in the struggles spent 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:22.429
 in that special moment for a moment his fighter 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.719
 in principle of its much faster and powerful blows 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.019
 had a chapter 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.959
 the player can pass - said cassel 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.449
 to buy placed items to play with various games of chance 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.889
 the function of money my hope to get exclusive items 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:45.119
 the game is difficult but over time studying the behavior of 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:48.119
 enemies all challenges can be overcome 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:52.990
 but then to talk to the player the current one also has time in DM 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.339
 it is an exaggeration that there is an easier modality 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:59.719
 the staff of power and still basic 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.299
 without much polishing 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.399
 mainly in a scenario 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:08.049
 as that compensating the poor environments the team focused on the characters 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.469
 these ends bringing the level of detail but the club really wanted is yours 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:18.769
 artistic design inspiration is the old american west with the manga 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:19.769
 of fights 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.620
 the animation mainly of guinea is excellent vettel its movements of fight 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.910
 despite this generated in peace me real martial arts 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.430
 in his fourth among employees 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.370
 the musical track is also noteworthy 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.189
 inspired by classic rock 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:40.539
 with a similar levada carry forward narrowly the theme of 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:41.439
 opening 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:43.180
 November 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.600
 late afternoon without worrying about being epic having a sophisticated story 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.090
 here what counts is the action 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.800
 and in this matter is very well served without falling into the trap of being the last to 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.029
 get paid 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.840
 It takes more skill. 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.520
 even bunch buds 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.000
 nor does it cease to have defects 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.969
 because it starts getting more dragged at the end 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.569
 arrived without much pretense but extensive possessions that make up a good wine 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.699
 brazilian does 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.809
 He was also the one who gave the 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:19.259
 do not lose 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:20.629
 the construction is better
