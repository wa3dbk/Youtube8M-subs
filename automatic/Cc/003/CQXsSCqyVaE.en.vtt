let's exclude mods from this because we

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.310 
let's exclude mods from this because we
know<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:48.120> know<00:00:48.270> what<00:00:48.510> our<00:00:48.539> PC<00:00:48.930> friends<00:00:49.200> got

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
going on but anything of it like this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.860 
going on but anything of it like this
like<00:00:51.870> GTA<00:00:52.410> fours<00:00:52.940> lifespan<00:00:53.940> after<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> gamers

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
like GTA fours lifespan after the gamers

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.510 
like GTA fours lifespan after the gamers
release<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.320> lasted<00:00:55.680> maybe<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.920> year<00:00:56.250> or<00:00:56.309> two

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
release it lasted maybe a year or two

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.660 
release it lasted maybe a year or two
but<00:00:57.030> GTA<00:00:57.390> 5<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.870> been<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:58.440> 34<00:00:59.190> yet<00:00:59.640> I

but<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.459> really<00:03:45.209> hope<00:03:45.390> they<00:03:45.570> don't<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:45.989> kind<00:03:46.380> of

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
but I I really hope they don't I kind of

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.440 
but I I really hope they don't I kind of
have<00:03:47.250> my<00:03:47.280> fingers<00:03:47.730> crossed<00:03:47.760> for<00:03:48.120> red<00:03:48.420> dead

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
have my fingers crossed for red dead

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.210 
have my fingers crossed for red dead
redemption<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.440> think<00:03:49.770> that's<00:03:49.980> what's

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
redemption to and I think that's what's

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.040 
redemption to and I think that's what's
going<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.550> be<00:03:50.640> happening<00:03:50.750> for<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.780> few<00:03:52.020> reasons

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
going to be happening for a few reasons

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.780 
going to be happening for a few reasons
what<00:03:52.500> it's<00:03:52.650> obviously<00:03:53.070> not<00:03:53.160> going<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.430> be<00:03:53.489> GTA

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
what it's obviously not going to be GTA

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.330 
what it's obviously not going to be GTA
6<00:03:53.910> seem<00:03:54.840> as<00:03:54.959> though<00:03:55.080> GTA<00:03:55.560> 5<00:03:55.830> has<00:03:56.100> at<00:03:56.220> least

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
6 seem as though GTA 5 has at least

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.160 
6 seem as though GTA 5 has at least
another<00:03:56.610> five<00:03:56.940> years<00:03:56.970> in<00:03:57.420> its<00:03:57.510> lifetime<00:03:57.750> or

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
another five years in its lifetime or

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.020 
another five years in its lifetime or
not<00:03:58.320> five<00:03:58.560> years<00:03:58.770> in<00:03:58.890> its<00:03:58.980> lifetime<00:03:59.190> but<00:03:59.910> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
not five years in its lifetime but the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.000 
not five years in its lifetime but the
game<00:04:00.270> is<00:04:00.420> going<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.600> be<00:04:00.750> big<00:04:01.290> for<00:04:01.590> probably

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
game is going to be big for probably

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.760 
game is going to be big for probably
another<00:04:02.130> two<00:04:02.489> more<00:04:02.730> years<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.239> then<00:04:03.810> at<00:04:04.560> least

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
another two more years and then at least

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.260 
another two more years and then at least
three<00:04:05.070> years<00:04:05.310> after<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.610> is<00:04:05.850> how<00:04:05.940> long<00:04:06.120> it's

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
three years after that is how long it's

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.430 
three years after that is how long it's
going<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.450> take<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:06.780> rockstar<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.200> really

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
going to take for rockstar to really

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.590 
going to take for rockstar to really
have<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.650> game<00:04:07.980> fully<00:04:08.250> polished<00:04:08.520> so<00:04:09.360> what<00:04:09.510> I'm

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
have a game fully polished so what I'm

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.479 
have a game fully polished so what I'm
thinking<00:04:09.630> is<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.830> it<00:04:11.070> could<00:04:11.190> be<00:04:11.220> something

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
thinking is that it could be something

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.310 
thinking is that it could be something
like<00:04:11.670> red<00:04:11.910> dead<00:04:12.060> redemption<00:04:12.209> or<00:04:12.600> maybe<00:04:12.810> mafia

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
like red dead redemption or maybe mafia

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.490 
like red dead redemption or maybe mafia
and<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:14.250> don't<00:04:14.910> want<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.180> be<00:04:15.330> mafia<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.930> really

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
and I don't want it to be mafia I really

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.949 
and I don't want it to be mafia I really
don't<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.919> liked<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.730> like<00:04:18.090> mafia<00:04:18.330> three<00:04:18.930> I

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
don't I liked I like mafia three I

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.300 
don't I liked I like mafia three I
played<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.560> little<00:04:19.919> or<00:04:19.980> might<00:04:20.100> have<00:04:20.220> been

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
played that a little or might have been

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.490 
played that a little or might have been
mafia<00:04:20.580> two<00:04:20.790> but<00:04:21.480> I<00:04:21.660> really<00:04:21.989> want<00:04:22.169> them<00:04:22.289> to<00:04:22.380> go

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
mafia two but I really want them to go

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.900 
mafia two but I really want them to go
red<00:04:22.710> dead<00:04:22.860> redemption<00:04:23.010> because<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.520> think<00:04:23.729> rock

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
red dead redemption because I think rock

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.760 
red dead redemption because I think rock
stars<00:04:24.150> had<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.360> lot<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.600> fun<00:04:24.840> developing<00:04:25.650> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
stars had a lot of fun developing the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.879 
stars had a lot of fun developing the
urban<00:04:26.130> environment

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
urban environment

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.920 
urban environment
at<00:04:26.949> grand<00:04:27.370> theft<00:04:27.460> auto<00:04:27.639> 5<00:04:27.879> took<00:04:28.090> place<00:04:28.330> but<00:04:28.900> I

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
at grand theft auto 5 took place but I

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.809 
at grand theft auto 5 took place but I
think<00:04:29.199> they'd<00:04:29.379> it<00:04:29.620> they<00:04:30.430> would<00:04:30.580> want<00:04:30.729> to

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
think they'd it they would want to

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.119 
think they'd it they would want to
change<00:04:30.849> after<00:04:31.569> that<00:04:31.719> something<00:04:32.199> that<00:04:32.409> isn't

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:33.129 
change after that something that isn't

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.040 
change after that something that isn't
in<00:04:33.189> such<00:04:33.370> an<00:04:33.490> urban<00:04:33.789> environment<00:04:33.849> and<00:04:34.449> a<00:04:34.659> red

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
in such an urban environment and a red

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.739 
in such an urban environment and a red
dead<00:04:35.199> redemption<00:04:35.349> Westerner<00:04:36.129> would<00:04:36.789> supply

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:37.749 
dead redemption Westerner would supply

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:39.839 
dead redemption Westerner would supply
that<00:04:38.259> perfect<00:04:38.770> change<00:04:39.039> that<00:04:39.249> Rockstar<00:04:39.669> might

focus<00:05:19.180> too<00:05:19.330> much<00:05:19.659> on<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.229> multiplayer<00:05:20.650> so

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
focus too much on the multiplayer so

that<00:05:21.400> way<00:05:21.490> they<00:05:21.639> can<00:05:21.759> kind<00:05:21.909> of<00:05:22.029> get<00:05:22.150> in<00:05:22.240> that

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
that way they can kind of get in that

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.179
