00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.590
 accused sometimes of exploiting the same 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.199
 sagas and characters one of another time 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.089
 nintendo launches a title to the market 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.000
 innovative and with a known character 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:41.430
 but little protagonist all at last 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.079
 has his own game accompanied his 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.079
 adventure to pursue treasures 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.700
 born as a result of some small phases in 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.050
 'super mario' free the world and we believe 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.780
 that also because of the multiple 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.450
 requests in universe captain touch 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.120
 tracer tracker is a complete title 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.190
 where to enjoy more than 70 levels at 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.860
 style of what we saw in the game of 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.930
 Mario in the title there are no dialogues nor 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.690
 just tutorials since it's very 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.060
 intuitive the little story of the game is 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.610
 account through scenes in your search 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.130
 of touch stars locates dt they look 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.320
 surprised by a huge bird that does not 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.210
 he only steals the treasure but he 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.850
 takes the companion of the gang leader 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.850
 and this will not hesitate to go to your rescue 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.670
 the basic idea is that each level is itself 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.560
 same a puzzle are distributed from 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.899
 so we need to move the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.820
 camera constantly to be able to see 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.490
 all the angles and secrets that 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.830
 they hide the sight on more than one occasion 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.869
 cheats us at a first glance and 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.420
 we will have to rotate in all the ways 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.040
 possible the camera to find that 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.470
 hidden object that we lack 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.780
 to complete the stage only 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.940
 you need to get the star but 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.160
 they all invite you to collect three gems 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.710
 extra that are also necessary for 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.110
 to be able to open new phases each level 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.600
 includes a challenge that goes from not suffering 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.340
 damage eliminate all enemies or 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.420
 something more special related to 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.420
 mechanics of that level 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.660
 everything can not jump which limits a lot 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.310
 your actions and we can only run and 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.620
 make use of your flashlight 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.959
 this will have the typical use of harming the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.840
 ghosts but be careful because 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.090
 alert to the saigas to develop 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.160
 better there are objects like turnips with which 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.170
 defeat enemies or a peak of use 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.690
 temporary with which to tear down also 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.069
 walls another power up known from which 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.069
 we will make use is duplicity 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.090
 if for something it stands out the game is for the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.950
 use of the game to not only move the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.990
 camera that can do so much with the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.330
 right stick like moving to the right 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.550
 but because it takes advantage of the screen 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.490
 tactile to paralyze enemies or move 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.890
 microphone platforms for blowing of 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.020
 the vibration to detect objects and 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.090
 we have even been surprised by moments in 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.220
 first person to have another 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.290
 scenario perspective the only 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.180
 negative is that there is no option 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.790
 to deactivate the movement of the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.520
 camera with the control sensor sometimes 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.500
 it can be annoying also expected 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.870
 an update in March to be able 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.150
 play a new game mode with the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.000
 encouragement of everything 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.709
 it's hard to get bored with captain top and 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.900
 is that each level exploits an idea 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.030
 simple that is not often repeated and in 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.459
 this reminds us of the best titles 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.739
 of the plumber but the game is in 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.170
 general very easy and can be completed 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.689
 quickly without realizing the title 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.959
 It is divided into three parts plus some phases 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.939
 extra thematic when completing a part 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.829
 in full a time is enabled 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.019
 beat on each level that challenges us to 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.359
 overcome it complete one hundred percent 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.299
 including these time trial can 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.159
 take about 18 hours or less this 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.739
 structure partly made us think 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:05.109
 if you wanted to distribute the game only in 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.510
 the jce or through chapters 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.540
 maybe it would have been a better idea with a 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.180
 good price we think that 35 euros 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.710
 approximate costs of the title are not 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.110
 justified 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.080
 captain touch will not stand out for its 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.000
 graphics but yes for its beauty is a 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.790
 nice game where we will surely go up 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.730
 catch my bears to share those 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.190
 moments more children by the way we would have 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.500
 grateful for a special integration with 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.240
 the social network of nintendo music 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.790
 fulfills its purpose with melodies 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.000
 nice and familiar in the saga 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.520
 captain touch tracer tracker is a good 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.380
 snack time to start the year 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.290
 where are these good games 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.990
 also expresses how very few the 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.690
 gamepad technology thing that 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.150
 thanks and refreshes the catalog is a 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.980
 ideal title for the little ones but 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.650
 also for those who stayed with 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.840
 want more in super mario 3d world without 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.090
 be too ambitious with what you 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.640
 you will find as it is intended for 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.640
 short or sporadic game sessions
