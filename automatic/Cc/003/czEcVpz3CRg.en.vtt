00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
tires and we're going to make a few

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.050 
tires and we're going to make a few
wraps<00:01:20.810> over<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.320> top<00:01:21.950> these<00:01:22.159> by<00:01:22.400> Ott's<00:01:22.610> now

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
wraps over the top these by Ott's now

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.730 
wraps over the top these by Ott's now
what<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.270> like<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:23.600> do<00:01:23.720> is<00:01:23.840> position<00:01:24.080> them<00:01:24.470> a

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
what I like to do is position them a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.160 
what I like to do is position them a
little<00:01:25.250> bit<00:01:25.490> on<00:01:25.700> my<00:01:25.759> side<00:01:26.479> of<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.750> hook<00:01:26.900> that

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
little bit on my side of the hook that

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.510 
little bit on my side of the hook that
way<00:01:27.380> as<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.009> thread<00:01:28.340> wraps<00:01:29.030> them<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:30.860> kind<00:01:31.369> of

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
way as the thread wraps them it kind of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.719 
way as the thread wraps them it kind of
tends<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.270> twist<00:01:32.630> them<00:01:32.900> back<00:01:33.560> towards<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.340> top

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
tends to twist them back towards the top

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.969 
tends to twist them back towards the top
of<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.000> hook<00:01:35.210> now<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:36.049> put<00:01:36.290> them<00:01:36.380> on<00:01:36.530> top<00:01:36.740> to

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
of the hook now you put them on top to

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.800 
of the hook now you put them on top to
start<00:01:37.250> off<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:37.670> they<00:01:37.729> end<00:01:37.880> up<00:01:38.030> too<00:01:38.270> far<00:01:38.540> on<00:01:38.720> the

start off and they end up too far on the
far<00:01:38.990> side<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.409> hook<00:01:39.560> it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
far side the hook it

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.080 
far side the hook it
look<00:01:40.270> as<00:01:40.420> good<00:01:40.680> okay<00:01:41.680> at<00:01:41.770> that<00:01:41.920> point<00:01:42.310> we<00:01:42.580> can

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
look as good okay at that point we can

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.270 
look as good okay at that point we can
just<00:01:43.540> clip<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:44.020> excess<00:01:44.410> off<00:01:44.650> from<00:01:44.860> these<00:01:45.070> by

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
just clip the excess off from these by

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:54.330 
just clip the excess off from these by
oats<00:01:45.550> oh<00:01:51.390> now<00:01:52.390> I've<00:01:52.540> got<00:01:52.690> this<00:01:53.320> is<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.560> size<00:01:53.890> 12

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
oats oh now I've got this is a size 12

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.820 
oats oh now I've got this is a size 12
so<00:01:55.030> for<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.630> size<00:01:55.900> 12<00:01:56.260> i'm<00:01:56.440> going<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.620> use<00:01:56.800> a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
so for a size 12 i'm going to use a

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.750 
so for a size 12 i'm going to use a
medium<00:01:57.670> copper<00:01:58.300> wire<00:01:58.770> size<00:01:59.770> 14<00:02:00.250> i<00:02:00.280> use<00:02:00.610> the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
medium copper wire size 14 i use the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.500 
medium copper wire size 14 i use the
brassy<00:02:01.210> size<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:03.640> bigger<00:02:03.850> flies<00:02:04.180> like<00:02:04.480> a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
brassy size and for bigger flies like a

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.060 
brassy size and for bigger flies like a
10<00:02:04.840> that's<00:02:05.050> about<00:02:05.260> as<00:02:05.410> big<00:02:05.590> as<00:02:05.620> I<00:02:05.800> tie<00:02:06.010> this

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
10 that's about as big as I tie this

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.280 
10 that's about as big as I tie this
I'll<00:02:06.700> stick<00:02:07.090> with<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.300> medium<00:02:07.780> copper<00:02:08.020> wire

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
I'll stick with the medium copper wire

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.080 
I'll stick with the medium copper wire
but<00:02:08.979> I'm<00:02:09.100> going<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.310> tie<00:02:09.430> it<00:02:09.490> in<00:02:09.640> on<00:02:09.760> the<00:02:09.880> far

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
but I'm going to tie it in on the far

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.950 
but I'm going to tie it in on the far
side<00:02:10.300> of<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.450> hook<00:02:10.630> just<00:02:12.060> create<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.420> little

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
side of the hook just create it a little

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.290 
side of the hook just create it a little
bit<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.380> thread<00:02:15.100> base<00:02:15.340> so<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.030> when<00:02:16.270> we

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
bit of a thread base so that when we

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.690 
bit of a thread base so that when we
dubbed<00:02:16.600> this<00:02:16.750> fly<00:02:17.020> thing<00:02:17.380> it'll<00:02:18.250> help<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.550> be<00:02:18.670> a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
dubbed this fly thing it'll help it be a

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.510 
dubbed this fly thing it'll help it be a
little<00:02:18.850> more<00:02:19.060> even<00:02:20.040> okay<00:02:21.040> next<00:02:21.220> we're<00:02:21.430> going

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
little more even okay next we're going

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.240 
little more even okay next we're going
to<00:02:21.580> take<00:02:21.820> just<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.120> little<00:02:22.390> bit<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.630> natural

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
to take just a little bit of natural

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.010 
to take just a little bit of natural
dubbing<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.430> say<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.360> little<00:02:25.570> bit<00:02:25.750> we're

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
dubbing I say a little bit we're

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.210 
dubbing I say a little bit we're
actually<00:02:26.140> going<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.500> dub<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.830> whole<00:02:26.980> body

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
actually going to dub the whole body

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.650 
actually going to dub the whole body
just<00:02:27.310> fly<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.720> we<00:02:28.960> can<00:02:29.110> go<00:02:29.230> ahead<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:30.660> start

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
just fly so we can go ahead and start

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.750 
just fly so we can go ahead and start
off<00:02:31.780> with<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.050> thin<00:02:32.530> amount<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.340> dubbing

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
off with a thin amount of dubbing

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.990 
off with a thin amount of dubbing
towards<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:35.110> top<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.680> thread<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.820> way

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
towards the top of the thread that way

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.820 
towards the top of the thread that way
when<00:02:37.210> we<00:02:37.330> start<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.780> apply<00:02:38.020> it<00:02:38.140> onto<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.500> fly

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
when we start to apply it onto the fly

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.600 
when we start to apply it onto the fly
it'll<00:02:39.190> be<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.310> nice<00:02:40.410> tapered<00:02:41.410> body<00:02:41.710> and<00:02:42.220> it'll

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
it'll be a nice tapered body and it'll

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.449 
it'll be a nice tapered body and it'll
gradually<00:02:42.910> get<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.360> little<00:02:43.980> thicker<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.280> we

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
gradually get a little thicker as we

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.640 
gradually get a little thicker as we
move<00:02:45.670> towards<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.900> front<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.410> fly

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
move towards the the front of the fly

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.460 
move towards the the front of the fly
there<00:02:48.630> up<00:02:49.630> towards<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.170> bead<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:53.080> just<00:02:53.320> a

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
there up towards the bead so just a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.730 
there up towards the bead so just a
slight<00:02:54.660> slight<00:02:55.660> taper<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.470> fly

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
slight slight taper to this fly

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.680 
slight slight taper to this fly
I'm<00:02:58.160> sure<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.580> cover<00:02:58.790> up<00:02:59.030> all<00:02:59.210> that<00:02:59.390> red

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
I'm sure you cover up all that red

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:07.900 
I'm sure you cover up all that red

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
now one thing I like to do on these

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.920 
now one thing I like to do on these
flies<00:03:10.380> since<00:03:11.280> we're<00:03:11.430> going<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.610> put<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:12.120> white

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
flies since we're going to put a white

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.140 
flies since we're going to put a white
wing<00:03:13.230> over<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.650> top<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.370> like<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.910> take

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
wing over the top of it I like to take

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.390 
wing over the top of it I like to take
the<00:03:15.330> dubbing<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.930> make<00:03:16.650> sure<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.190> goes

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
the dubbing and make sure that it goes

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.720 
the dubbing and make sure that it goes
tight<00:03:17.850> against<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.690> bead<00:03:19.130> right<00:03:20.130> here<00:03:20.550> that

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
tight against the bead right here that

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.760 
tight against the bead right here that
way<00:03:20.940> when<00:03:21.120> we<00:03:21.240> tie<00:03:21.420> those<00:03:21.600> buyouts<00:03:21.900> on<00:03:22.320> they

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
way when we tie those buyouts on they

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.950 
way when we tie those buyouts on they
don't<00:03:22.890> stick<00:03:23.310> straight<00:03:23.610> up<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:23.970> air<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
don't stick straight up in the air the

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.960 
don't stick straight up in the air the
bigger<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.320> gap<00:03:25.500> between<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:26.460> dubbing<00:03:26.820> and

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
bigger the gap between the dubbing and

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.670 
bigger the gap between the dubbing and
the<00:03:27.030> bead<00:03:27.240> the<00:03:27.870> straighter<00:03:28.230> those<00:03:28.440> buyouts

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
the bead the straighter those buyouts

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.080 
the bead the straighter those buyouts
are<00:03:28.920> going<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.160> stick<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.550> I<00:03:29.580> don't<00:03:29.760> like<00:03:29.880> that

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
are going to stick and I don't like that

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.420 
are going to stick and I don't like that
as<00:03:30.270> much<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.960> kind<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.680> avoid<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.280> I'm

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
as much so to kind of avoid that I'm

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.430 
as much so to kind of avoid that I'm
going<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.610> take<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.090> take<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:33.960> dubbing<00:03:34.320> out

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
going to take and take that dubbing out

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.620 
going to take and take that dubbing out
tight<00:03:34.680> against<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.010> beat<00:03:35.420> okay<00:03:36.420> at<00:03:36.540> this

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
tight against the beat okay at this

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.420 
tight against the beat okay at this
point<00:03:36.750> we're<00:03:36.990> going<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.170> just<00:03:37.380> take<00:03:38.190> our

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
point we're going to just take our

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.230 
point we're going to just take our
ribbing<00:03:38.850> material<00:03:39.330> this<00:03:39.480> wire<00:03:39.720> here<00:03:41.210> make<00:03:42.210> a

ribbing material this wire here make a

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.760
