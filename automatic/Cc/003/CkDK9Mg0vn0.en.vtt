00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
think about is how can I make them do or

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.210 
think about is how can I make them do or
go<00:03:53.209> someplace<00:03:53.600> that<00:03:54.380> they<00:03:54.530> didn't<00:03:54.890> think<00:03:54.950> was

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
go someplace that they didn't think was

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.940 
go someplace that they didn't think was
possible<00:03:55.400> when<00:03:55.820> they<00:03:56.000> walked<00:03:56.239> in<00:03:56.450> right<00:03:56.950> like

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
possible when they walked in right like

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.289 
possible when they walked in right like
I<00:03:58.070> said<00:03:58.280> they're<00:03:58.820> going<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.000> start<00:03:59.209> to

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
I said they're going to start to

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.479 
I said they're going to start to
associate<00:03:59.660> you<00:03:59.959> with<00:03:59.989> that<00:04:00.440> positive<00:04:01.100> feeling

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
associate you with that positive feeling

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.310 
associate you with that positive feeling
and<00:04:01.610> so<00:04:02.090> all<00:04:02.329> you<00:04:02.510> want<00:04:02.660> them<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.900> do<00:04:02.989> is<00:04:03.110> walk

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
and so all you want them to do is walk

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.660 
and so all you want them to do is walk
away<00:04:03.530> feeling<00:04:03.709> better<00:04:04.040> than<00:04:04.400> when<00:04:04.430> they

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
away feeling better than when they

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.110 
away feeling better than when they
started

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
started

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.030 
started

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
but what if you can take that up a notch

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.130
