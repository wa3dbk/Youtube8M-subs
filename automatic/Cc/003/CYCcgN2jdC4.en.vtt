guess<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.170> leads<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.800> overriding

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
guess this leads to the overriding

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.060 
guess this leads to the overriding
question<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:12.990> had<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.500> beginning<00:00:13.620> is

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
question that we had at the beginning is

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.779 
question that we had at the beginning is
it<00:00:14.849> being<00:00:15.059> booked<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.960> set<00:00:16.590> up<00:00:16.740> sort<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.340> badly

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
it being booked and set up sort of badly

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.640 
it being booked and set up sort of badly
is<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.510> there's<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.990> sense<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.619> know

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
is that there's a sense that you know

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.900 
is that there's a sense that you know
when<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.949> throw<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.310> into<00:00:20.550> them<00:00:20.730> it's

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
when you throw this into them it's

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.040 
when you throw this into them it's
combined<00:00:21.270> with<00:00:21.359> what<00:00:21.660> has<00:00:21.750> happened<00:00:22.020> with

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
combined with what has happened with

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.570 
combined with what has happened with
Daniel<00:00:22.260> Bryan<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.800> how<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.039> looks<00:00:23.369> like

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
Daniel Bryan and how that looks like

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.390 
Daniel Bryan and how that looks like
it's<00:00:23.820> kind<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.090> just<00:00:24.210> changed<00:00:24.630> direction<00:00:25.400> very

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
it's kind of just changed direction very

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.310 
it's kind of just changed direction very
quickly<00:00:26.670> because<00:00:27.029> they<00:00:27.119> realize<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.660> there<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
quickly because they realize is there a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.259 
quickly because they realize is there a
sense<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.010> old<00:00:29.160> WrestleMania<00:00:29.970> where

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
sense that the old WrestleMania where

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.209 
sense that the old WrestleMania where
Vince<00:00:30.570> used<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.960> plan<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.500> advance<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
Vince used to plan it in advance and

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.250 
Vince used to plan it in advance and
people<00:00:32.489> knew<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> year<00:00:33.059> ahead<00:00:33.270> exactly<00:00:34.140> what

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
people knew a year ahead exactly what

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.690 
people knew a year ahead exactly what
they<00:00:34.350> were<00:00:34.410> doing<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.920> well<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.370> truly<00:00:35.430> out

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
they were doing is well and truly out

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.330 
they were doing is well and truly out
the<00:00:35.820> window<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.710> guess

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the window and it is that just a I guess

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.670 
the window and it is that just a I guess
a<00:00:38.550> consequence<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.360> new<00:00:39.690> media<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
a consequence of new media and the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.650 
a consequence of new media and the
changes<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.370> happen<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.969> pro<00:00:42.120> wrestling<00:00:42.149> or

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
changes that happen in pro wrestling or

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.380 
changes that happen in pro wrestling or
is<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.320> an<00:00:43.500> indication<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.309> maybe<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
is this an indication that maybe the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.360 
is this an indication that maybe the
creative<00:00:45.780> direction<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> w/e<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.160> more

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
creative direction of the w/e and more

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.880 
creative direction of the w/e and more
importantly<00:00:47.700> Triple<00:00:48.210> H<00:00:48.329> may<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.590> may<00:00:49.829> be

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
importantly Triple H may this may be

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.650 
importantly Triple H may this may be
some<00:00:50.250> Stephen<00:00:50.550> problems<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.090> learning<00:00:51.329> how<00:00:51.600> to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
some Stephen problems in learning how to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.360 
some Stephen problems in learning how to
build<00:00:51.930> up<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.860> Vince<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.250> done

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
build up just just like Vince is done

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.389 
build up just just like Vince is done
before<00:00:53.460> him<00:00:53.760> i<00:00:53.879> think<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.829> i'm<00:00:55.829> not<00:00:55.980> sure<00:00:56.219> i

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
before him i think that i'm not sure i

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.040 
before him i think that i'm not sure i
mean<00:00:56.550> i<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> look<00:00:57.539> back<00:00:57.719> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
mean i think that if you look back to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.529 
mean i think that if you look back to
Wrestlemania<00:00:58.710> 15<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.520> example<00:00:59.910> where<00:01:00.059> austin

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
Wrestlemania 15 for example where austin

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.450 
Wrestlemania 15 for example where austin
and<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> rock<00:01:00.840> faced<00:01:01.140> each<00:01:01.289> other<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.770> don't

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and a rock faced each other I don't

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.310 
and a rock faced each other I don't
think<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.730> main<00:01:02.910> event<00:01:03.210> was<00:01:03.539> set<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.019> place

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
think that main event was set in place

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.969 
think that main event was set in place
until<00:01:04.909> relatively<00:01:05.909> late<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.180> 98<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.710> think

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
until relatively late in 98 and I think

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.840 
until relatively late in 98 and I think
that<00:01:08.130> that's<00:01:08.250> jet<00:01:08.729> tended<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.850> that's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
that that's jet tended to be the that's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.240 
that that's jet tended to be the that's
tended<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.960> sort<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.500> pattern<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:14.100> that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
tended to be the sort of pattern is that

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.429 
tended to be the sort of pattern is that
the<00:01:14.400> random<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.299> Survivor<00:01:15.659> Series<00:01:15.780> start<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the random at Survivor Series start to

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.690 
the random at Survivor Series start to
make<00:01:16.590> their<00:01:16.770> decisions<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.369> what<00:01:17.520> they're

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
make their decisions for what they're

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.399 
make their decisions for what they're
going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:17.970> at<00:01:18.060> WrestleMania<00:01:18.630> properly<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
going to do at WrestleMania properly I

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.910 
going to do at WrestleMania properly I
just<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.610> year<00:01:20.850> round<00:01:21.259> I<00:01:22.259> think

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
just think that this year round I think

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.260 
just think that this year round I think
actually<00:01:23.100> instead<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> being<00:01:23.790> booked

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
actually instead of it being booked

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.149 
actually instead of it being booked
badly<00:01:24.720> or<00:01:24.840> they're<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.049> doing<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.500> good<00:01:25.530> job<00:01:25.680> I

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
badly or they're not doing a good job I

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.010 
badly or they're not doing a good job I
think<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.909> they've<00:01:27.150> responded<00:01:27.450> very<00:01:27.900> well

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
think that they've responded very well

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.859 
think that they've responded very well
to<00:01:28.229> them<00:01:28.829> doing<00:01:29.009> having<00:01:29.820> their<00:01:29.939> initial<00:01:30.360> plans

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
to them doing having their initial plans

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.539 
to them doing having their initial plans
not<00:01:31.350> look<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:31.799> were<00:01:31.829> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> work<00:01:32.220> I

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
not look like they were going to work I

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.700 
not look like they were going to work I
think<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.329> they<00:01:33.689> had<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> plan<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.229> mind<00:01:34.470> they

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
think that they had a plan in mind they

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.990 
think that they had a plan in mind they
thought<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.189> looks<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> good<00:01:35.759> card

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
thought all this looks like a good card

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.960 
thought all this looks like a good card

Undertaker and Cena Bray Wyatt we think

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.160

Wyatt<00:01:43.409> as<00:01:43.530> well<00:01:43.680> as<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.890> new<00:01:44.040> star<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.640> know

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
Wyatt as well as a new star you know

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.410 
Wyatt as well as a new star you know
we've<00:01:44.880> got<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.810> then<00:01:47.060> January's<00:01:48.060> Rumble

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
we've got that and then January's Rumble

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.359 
we've got that and then January's Rumble
happened<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.290> thought<00:01:49.470> actually<00:01:49.740> this

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
happened and they thought actually this

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.100 
happened and they thought actually this
isn't<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> work<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.479> then<00:01:51.540> Punk<00:01:51.869> left

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
isn't going to work and then Punk left

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.859 
isn't going to work and then Punk left
and<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:53.729> those<00:01:53.850> two<00:01:54.060> things<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.540> think<00:01:54.750> they

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and so those two things I think they

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.450 
and so those two things I think they
just<00:01:54.899> thought<00:01:55.259> actually<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.950> need<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.250> change

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
just thought actually we need to change

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.649 
just thought actually we need to change
something<00:01:56.759> here<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.180> isn't<00:01:57.450> going<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.600> work

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
something here this isn't going to work

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.420 
something here this isn't going to work
this<00:01:57.990> isn't<00:01:58.290> gonna<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.890> what<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.130> want<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.399> to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
this isn't gonna do what we want it to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.399 
this isn't gonna do what we want it to
do<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.149> think<00:02:00.360> as<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> consequence<00:02:01.229> they

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
do and I think as a consequence they

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.880 
do and I think as a consequence they
responded<00:02:01.829> well<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.149> they

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
responded well to that I think that they

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.990 
responded well to that I think that they
could<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:04.950> could<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.399> stayed<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> course

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
could have could have stayed the course

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.850 
could have could have stayed the course
than<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.509> would<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.630> been<00:02:06.750> much<00:02:06.869> worse<00:02:06.930> one

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
than it would have been much worse one

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.320 
than it would have been much worse one
