00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.770
 welcome to motocard.com agv presents 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.559
 a whole revolution in the field of 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.990
 screens for helmet this is the gv 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.450
 viewer with technology and ting that is 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.499
 a screen that is able to change 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.439
 dark light by just pressing a button 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:24.230
 no need to change the screen 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.659
 let's analyze it in the market and 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.509
 We have lots of helmets 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.429
 that have a solar viewer built into 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.060
 the shell are easy to operate 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:37.190
 intuitive quick and they work very 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.670
 good especially in the helmet segment 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.890
 touring and sport touring but there is this 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.930
 segment of sportier helmets than 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.600
 they need require rigidity 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.050
 structural very very strict as well as 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.160
 a great lightness and this is where the agv 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.930
 viewer can be an ideal solution is a 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.350
 viewfinder that I have weighed on the scale so 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.920
 only increases by 20 grams the weight of the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.289
 helmet screen is a decisive factor 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.650
 when buying it if we have 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:12.990
 a helmet 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.970
 light as is this track gp this 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.830
 screen is also marketed with 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.980
 other helmets of the Italian brand as 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.770
 are the corsa w and the gtm loce the three 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.990
 most sports helmets of the brand and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.780
 let's explain a little how it works 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.660
 the screen just by pressing a button 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.970
 we will go from the dark screen to the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.000
 clear from the light to the dark always 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.790
 manual by pressing a button as for the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.520
 autonomy of this screen must be said 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.270
 that is fully charged with two hours 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.530
 of charge thanks to this cable in usb and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.720
 that we can connect to any 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.869
 charging device either a computer 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.140
 that is, a loading device using 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.830
 One USB port full charge in two 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.920
 hours and this offers 50 hours of 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.380
 autonomy with the clear screen and with the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.230
 Painted screen up to 12 hours 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.300
 autonomy 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.540
 this screen also has a 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.680
 anti-scratch and anti-fog treatment and 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.450
 comment that the screen is not 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.330
 approved to be carried in hours 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.910
 nocturnal because because still in mode 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.870
 of course the screen is already polarized 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.870
 say that decreases 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.640
 the beam of light that enters the interior 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.560
 Of the same 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.760
 for any doubt or comment what 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.760
 you can leave in this video
