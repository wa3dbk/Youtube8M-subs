00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 good evening dear friends we are 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.549
 welcome all fans 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.799
 vegetarian cuisine effect lovers 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.880
 lead a healthy lifestyle in general it 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.670
 this by 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.360
 creativity of her flight for any cook 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.920
 not to mention the very vegetarian 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.410
 simple recipes that are very helpful 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.900
 for cooking any hot dish 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.470
 we almost always use butter and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.660
 not fats 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.779
 but when it comes to oil quality 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.349
 there is a sharp contrast between 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.750
 high quality fats 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.500
 from herbal products and 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.660
 refined chemical 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.630
 low quality converted fats 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.100
 which prevail in our products we 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.530
 carefully read the labels on the packages 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.750
 food but rarely think 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.070
 about quality and components strongly 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.899
 refined vegetable oils 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.629
 who have been on shelves for months 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.180
 supermarkets can be compared to white flour 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.469
 of which the recycling process 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.600
 all useful vitamins disappear completely 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.579
 and mineral elements the greatest 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.620
 the danger is fraught with oil which 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.430
 underwent additional processing and 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.350
 purchased 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.199
 solid state is first of all 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.119
 margarine and hard fats so we 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.170
 always recommend using homemade 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.170
 melted butter 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.890
 Alek neighbors and take there what they 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.770
 never need what i did 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.820
 yesterday I tore there nettles so today we 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.370
 were spitting on the ear 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.830
 and the recipe is very simple potatoes 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.560
 Usually Russian Siberian nettle from 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.480
 clean place pepper and your 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.000
 and a little bit put off the oil now i'm 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.740
 show it all done so well have 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.580
 Such are put with the more when 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.590
 bosses 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.850
 Here the head knew the inspectors 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.750
 companies like you 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.610
 there and there are two boxes 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.260
 are under my masters and while I'm with 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.330
 I speak you mean to find 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.550
 bone hurts or coil me 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.560
 it remains to help the nettle itself 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.610
 the opposite is why we will start now for 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.610
 you will need a soul 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.800
 Feels a bit like scales 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.750
 crucian and cheeks 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.030
 even the most serious work behind crocs 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.320
 my assistant is here now without you 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.420
 On more black on will but until she 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:26.370
 rinsed 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.370
 clean water we begin to fry until 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.709
 the ear was fragrant and tasty and we need 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.440
 fry a little you no we melt 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:44.950
 oil the legs and add replace garlic 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:48.400
 name yes and it is we achieve oil 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.209
 a little bit already this we omit such that 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.209
 a little bit 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.220
 if you still use the process 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.350
 cooking concentrated fats and 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.560
 oils choose those that have passed 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.790
 minimal industrial processing 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.250
 unrefined saturated oil 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.320
 cold pressed best natural 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.050
 they have a rich color and 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.280
 buy a rich, pleasant smell 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.500
 oil which is to avoid 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.170
 light contact packed outside 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.910
 transparent bottles of vegetable fat be 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.700
 then whole foods or vegetable 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.200
 oils in most cases is 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.480
 unsaturated the fat is no longer saturated 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.370
 the faster it will oxidize that 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.650
 can lead to the formation of poisonous 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.600
 food chemicals 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.390
 then there is an unpleasant smell and taste 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.270
 and food spoil to some extent this 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.460
 the process is a sign of nature which 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.670
 wants to save us from using food 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:57.920
 reedless reel 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:59.989
 roast you while we stalks 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.340
 already cut off the leaves of retired outfit they 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.860
 choose ear will be clean like 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.959
 cheeks 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.310
 mostly elderly robbed exterminated by us 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.959
 stand behind him what 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.720
 scalding is necessary because if you 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.049
 scald for turn like medicine she 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.730
 there is little that all good properties of the goods 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:37.600
 vodka beer gave our 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:40.600
 Here we are trying to salon still ready to fill 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.600
 by water 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:54.610
 I promise not to mix and close 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.770
 we will probably wait 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.920
 chapter 20 then the real persuade 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.320
 lost and so to cook 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.910
 vegetarian ear instead of pike us 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.310
 need a young nettle 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.910
 half a kilo of potatoes dill and salt 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.950
 pepper to taste and 50 grams of homemade 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.710
 ghee giving essence for the sum 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:27.680
 you can add sour cream responsible 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:29.689
 time and control what we have here as 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.379
 always late 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.379
 we build our dishes 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.200
 Now that the goal will go channels 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.200
 so 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:18.300
 I myself also want to note that about the market 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.290
 many advantages as said 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.320
 Nadezhda Vitalevna 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:25.800
 we eat and never like let 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.160
 to all 20 now no voice runs in not 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.160
 robbed
