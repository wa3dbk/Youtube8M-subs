I<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:20.250> trying<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.370> see<00:01:21.580> if<00:01:21.730> there's<00:01:21.910> a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
I just trying to see if there's a

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.930 
I just trying to see if there's a
specific<00:01:22.390> light<00:01:23.020> pattern<00:01:23.620> there<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:24.610> yellow

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
specific light pattern there that yellow

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.240 
specific light pattern there that yellow
one<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.450> blue<00:01:25.750> one<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.560> other<00:01:26.740> one<00:01:26.950> seems

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
one and the blue one the other one seems

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.510 
one and the blue one the other one seems
to<00:01:27.400> go<00:01:27.550> away

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
to go away

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.970 
to go away
let<00:01:30.520> me<00:01:30.610> just<00:01:30.760> watch<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.300> second

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
let me just watch it a second

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.780 
let me just watch it a second
the<00:01:32.980> blue<00:01:33.220> one<00:01:33.370> seems<00:01:33.940> to<00:01:35.460> change<00:01:36.460> let<00:01:36.730> me

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
the blue one seems to change let me

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.490 
the blue one seems to change let me
change<00:01:37.000> angle<00:01:37.480> just<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.780> little<00:01:38.020> maybe<00:01:38.200> that's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
change angle just a little maybe that's

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.430 
change angle just a little maybe that's
yeah<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.610> yellow<00:01:39.790> one<00:01:40.080> seems<00:01:41.080> to<00:01:41.170> change

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
yeah so the yellow one seems to change

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.500 
yeah so the yellow one seems to change
the<00:01:41.710> most<00:01:41.950> there's<00:01:42.550> like<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.730> pattern<00:01:43.240> in<00:01:43.330> here

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
the most there's like a pattern in here

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.900 
the most there's like a pattern in here
somewhere<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:47.160> can't<00:01:48.160> get<00:01:48.310> it<00:01:48.400> too<00:01:48.550> close<00:01:48.580> to

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
somewhere I can't get it too close to

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:56.070 
somewhere I can't get it too close to
the<00:01:49.000> camera<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.360> have<00:01:49.570> a<00:01:49.600> hard<00:01:49.810> time<00:01:49.840> focusing

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.470 

now<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.140> back<00:01:57.410> has<00:01:57.740> no<00:01:58.400> chick<00:01:58.820> taste<00:01:59.090> so<00:01:59.300> maybe

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
now the back has no chick taste so maybe

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:08.889 
now the back has no chick taste so maybe
they'll<00:01:59.660> make<00:01:59.750> a<00:02:00.460> difference

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.280

to refocus here hold on a second that's
a<00:02:33.870> little<00:02:34.050> bit<00:02:34.200> better<00:02:34.849> never<00:02:35.849> gonna<00:02:36.120> really

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
a little bit better never gonna really

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.440 
a little bit better never gonna really
100%<00:02:37.349> focus<00:02:38.040> because<00:02:38.459> it's<00:02:38.610> moving<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.180> fast

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
100% focus because it's moving so fast

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.260 
100% focus because it's moving so fast
the<00:02:39.750> camera<00:02:40.489> can't<00:02:41.489> pick<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.700> all<00:02:41.910> up<00:02:41.940> right

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
the camera can't pick it all up right

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.850 
the camera can't pick it all up right
away<00:02:47.540> well<00:02:48.540> there<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.840> go<00:02:48.959> let<00:02:49.350> me<00:02:49.410> go<00:02:49.440> back<00:02:49.680> to

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
away well there you go let me go back to

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.800 
away well there you go let me go back to
light<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.250> we'll<00:02:50.459> recap<00:02:50.910> well<00:02:51.390> there<00:02:51.569> you<00:02:51.690> go

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810

light and we'll recap well there you go
I<00:02:52.019> think<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.069> dark<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.730> coolest

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
I think in the dark is the coolest

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.830 
I think in the dark is the coolest
effect<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:55.260> inner<00:02:55.470> peace<00:02:55.800> looks<00:02:56.130> like

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
effect that inner peace looks like

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.630 
effect that inner peace looks like
elongated<00:02:57.840> oval<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:59.190> you'll<00:02:59.340> see<00:02:59.519> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
elongated oval and then you'll see the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.670 
elongated oval and then you'll see the
red<00:02:59.819> light<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.060> red<00:03:00.390> light<00:03:00.600> too<00:03:01.200> on<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.470> left

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
red light the red light too on the left

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.059 
red light the red light too on the left
and<00:03:01.890> one<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.370> middle<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.530> one<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
and one in the middle so that one in the

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.729 
and one in the middle so that one in the
middle<00:03:05.190> was<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.269> yellow<00:03:06.660> then<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.530> upper

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
middle was the yellow then the upper

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.440 
middle was the yellow then the upper
one's<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.100> blue<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:09.230> then<00:03:10.230> green<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.489> red

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
one's the blue and then green and red

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.800 
one's the blue and then green and red
and<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> top<00:03:13.350> one<00:03:13.530> was<00:03:13.709> maybe<00:03:14.700> orange<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.450> think

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
and the top one was maybe orange I think

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.890
