00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
direction the width one right now is

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.870 
direction the width one right now is
this<00:02:06.520> way<00:02:08.070> see<00:02:09.070> that<00:02:09.250> by<00:02:09.399> these<00:02:09.550> crushed-up

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
this way see that by these crushed-up

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.460 
this way see that by these crushed-up
leaves<00:02:11.459> blowing<00:02:12.459> that<00:02:12.760> way<00:02:13.260> that's<00:02:14.260> why<00:02:14.440> I

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
leaves blowing that way that's why I

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.960 
leaves blowing that way that's why I
took<00:02:14.560> my<00:02:14.860> hole<00:02:15.070> right<00:02:15.250> here<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.670> way<00:02:15.850> the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
took my hole right here that way the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.479 
took my hole right here that way the
wind<00:02:16.209> will<00:02:16.300> feed<00:02:16.540> into<00:02:16.570> this<00:02:16.989> whole<00:02:17.280> fan<00:02:18.280> that

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
wind will feed into this whole fan that

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.060 
wind will feed into this whole fan that
fire<00:02:18.840> making<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.050> really<00:02:20.230> hostile<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:20.830> doesn't

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
fire making it really hostile it doesn't

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.979 
fire making it really hostile it doesn't
give<00:02:21.190> off<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.370> lot<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.700> smoke<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.570> can<00:02:22.720> see<00:02:22.870> it's
