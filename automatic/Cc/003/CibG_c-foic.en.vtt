00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.980
 in this video tutorial I'll show you tame 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:20.119
 loops with all the secrets that can 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.770
 you come in handy as you can see i started with 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.770
 board preparation 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.580
 since i don't have a started product i 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.100
 looping into pieces of cloth 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.370
 half of your cup will be considered 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.650
 chopping off half of a single cut 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.200
 under the board 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.590
 dubbing glue at intervals of 5 millimeters 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.900
 along the edge line on the selection 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.050
 glue the box cut from 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.900
 dublerin or special which 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.850
 sold in stores and will not allow 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:01:01.510
 your board will stretch out in a caress and 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.510
 lightly boron 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:10.619
 markup produces button diameter 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.229
 this is a delicate matter and I will tell you more 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.479
 to you about it when we will sew a coat 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.340
 and now pull back the diameter of the buttons from 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.420
 conditional bead 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.280
 work vertical and plan on it 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.979
 loop location after which 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.470
 we restrict the loops in length again 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:41.509
 it's me and the diameter of the stupor 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.640
 around the loop markup we reel boron 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:49.130
 so that the layers of fabric do not move until we 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.590
 working on a chromite loop 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.600
 cut the loop can be two 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:01.289
 ways and both are very accurate first 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.050
 way to stick gypsy in the beginning and 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.460
 end of the loop 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:10.700
 and with a sharp knife or blade this hatch 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.860
 cut and then cut a piece 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:19.990
 scissor second way to rule the verb 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.610
 punch and here's the hole testaments loop 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.340
 scissors 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.140
 note that scissors should 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.140
 good to cut the ends 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.750
 the next operation is very simple 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.990
 need a louse loop with thin threads somewhere 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.630
 min thin needle trying to 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:48.300
 dub not peeking between layers of fabric 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:52.650
 and the most interesting thing we need 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.720
 good thread types of garrus present 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.310
 garrus is top thread worth of 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.150
 natural silk 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.780
 it is this thread that is the key to success 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.269
 loops if you know where to buy inform 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.820
 I must 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.130
 one of the articles I take off normal 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.840
 threads which are used for 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.000
 finishing lines 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.010
 and the second thick nylon thread 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.430
 I have no others 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.000
 thread in two needles and not tied 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.000
 knots 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:32.019
 the first thread to be framed 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.139
 we fix at the beginning of the loop 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.319
 that from which side does not bear loading 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:43.540
 fasteners and stack it along the loop 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:49.349
 securing the needle then we tack the loop 2 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.349
 not moving along the gimp thread 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.620
 completing the laying out doing tack 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.220
 and evil lucky mickey is literally one 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.600
 stitch 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:48.350
 and then from framed pulling it to 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:54.970
 the loop is not stretched in the sock hide 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.970
 ends between product layers and trim 

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:47.990
 after this loop should cover the cross 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.439
 on the pancake in the same place as we saluted the frame 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.949
 for ironing does not call him them only from 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:53.949
 peephole 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:07.819
 boil and dry waits no 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.879
 it remains to compare the manual and machine 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:15.090
 loops here's a loop that I you metal on 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:18.870
 wave and eyes a few days ago have two 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:23.220
 gangway and zipped up 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:27.710
 once and here's a loop on my trousers 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:31.169
 husband who is not one year old 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.960
 summarize hand loop 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:37.729
 if you are not you honey go out loop every 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:41.870
 day will seem pretty ugly 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:46.169
 but since you cut Judah 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:49.379
 the sweeping tone surpasses the swept out 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:54.180
 on household sewing machine durability and 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:56.759
 wear resistance many times i'm not 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.129
 talking about loop machines 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:02.219
 worth a few thousand dollars 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:03.590
 which loop like a salmon game 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:08.460
 spawning time 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:10.910
 only your 100 loop will not be better 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.350
 what be patient 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:16.950
 and I say goodbye 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:21.380
 before your likes and comments with you 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.380
 olkhovskaya faith so far
