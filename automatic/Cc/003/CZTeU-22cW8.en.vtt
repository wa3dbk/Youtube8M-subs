00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.770 
assess their running mechanics okay we
we<00:01:52.290> make<00:01:52.439> them<00:01:52.590> more<00:01:52.740> efficient<00:01:53.509> from<00:01:54.509> their

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
we make them more efficient from their

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.780 
we make them more efficient from their
work<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.560> more<00:01:55.950> explosive<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
work on more explosive more of a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.490 
work on more explosive more of a
strength<00:01:57.090> build<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.930> all<00:01:58.049> depends<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
strength build but it all depends on the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.020 
strength build but it all depends on the
athlete<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.860> comes<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.250> every<00:01:59.369> athlete<00:01:59.850> it's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
athlete that comes in every athlete it's

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.370 
athlete that comes in every athlete it's
not<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> cookie<00:02:00.360> cutter<00:02:00.479> program<00:02:01.110> they<00:02:01.259> all

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
not a cookie cutter program they all

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.870 
not a cookie cutter program they all
have<00:02:01.649> their<00:02:01.799> strengths<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.280> weaknesses<00:02:02.369> so

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
have their strengths and weaknesses so

have their strengths and weaknesses so
we<00:02:02.969> work<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.960> Cory<00:02:04.229> that's<00:02:04.320> what<00:02:04.530> our

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
we work on that and Cory that's what our
