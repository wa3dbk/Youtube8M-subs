00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
piece would be the silicon layer and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.700

cleaning<00:01:33.980> cloth<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.580> squeegee<00:01:35.560> so<00:01:36.560> that's

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
cleaning cloth and squeegee so that's

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.100 
cleaning cloth and squeegee so that's
extra<00:01:37.940> layer<00:01:38.090> protection<00:01:38.540> right<00:01:38.750> there<00:01:38.810> so

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
extra layer protection right there so

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.140 
extra layer protection right there so
you<00:01:39.170> got<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.410> 2k<00:01:39.980> two<00:01:40.460> pieces<00:01:40.790> at<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.030> your

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
case right here and then here's the I

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.600 
case right here and then here's the I
think<00:01:44.420> OtterBox<00:01:44.780> should<00:01:45.020> include<00:01:45.710> these

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
think OtterBox should include these

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.940 
think OtterBox should include these
keyboard<00:01:47.090> protectors<00:01:47.600> with<00:01:47.780> your<00:01:48.500> cases

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
keyboard protectors with your cases

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.740 
keyboard protectors with your cases
because<00:01:49.160> this<00:01:49.370> thing<00:01:49.580> is<00:01:49.610> really<00:01:49.880> nice<00:01:50.150> guys<00:01:50.420> I

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
because this thing is really nice guys I

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.510 
because this thing is really nice guys I
think<00:01:51.500> our<00:01:51.680> about<00:01:51.950> should<00:01:52.100> sell<00:01:52.370> these

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
think our about should sell these

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.980

with the defender case which I will have
a<00:02:10.790> review<00:02:11.120> on<00:02:11.380> coming<00:02:12.380> up<00:02:12.500> pretty<00:02:12.710> soon<00:02:12.830> but

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
a review on coming up pretty soon but

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.830 
a review on coming up pretty soon but
we're<00:02:14.060> going<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.210> be<00:02:14.300> looking<00:02:14.420> at<00:02:14.630> the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
we're going to be looking at the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.960 
we're going to be looking at the
community<00:02:15.830> series<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.400> here's<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.760> first

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
community series and here's the first

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.710 
community series and here's the first
layer<00:02:17.270> which<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.720> silicone<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.970> silicon

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
layer which is the silicone so silicon

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.560 
layer which is the silicone so silicon
it<00:02:22.000> bounces<00:02:23.000> away<00:02:23.150> impact<00:02:23.960> from<00:02:24.800> your<00:02:25.570> phone

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
it bounces away impact from your phone

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.800 
it bounces away impact from your phone
so<00:02:26.989> you<00:02:27.640> don't<00:02:28.640> damage<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.180> when<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.420> drop<00:02:29.630> it

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
so you don't damage it when you drop it

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.160 
so you don't damage it when you drop it
and<00:02:29.930> then<00:02:30.140> get<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.760> hard<00:02:31.760> outer<00:02:31.880> layer<00:02:32.270> which

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
and then get the hard outer layer which

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.690 
and then get the hard outer layer which
makes<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.560> easy<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.890> slide<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.400> out<00:02:34.520> your

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
makes it easy to slide in and out your

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.920 
makes it easy to slide in and out your
pocket<00:02:35.030> which<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.239> really<00:02:35.420> like<00:02:35.720> because

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
pocket which I really like because

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.380 
pocket which I really like because
usually<00:02:36.200> silicone<00:02:36.800> cases<00:02:37.010> by<00:02:37.730> itself<00:02:38.000> gets

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
usually silicone cases by itself gets

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.880 
usually silicone cases by itself gets
stuck<00:02:38.600> in<00:02:38.630> your<00:02:38.870> pocket<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.470> out<00:02:39.560> it's<00:02:39.800> a

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
stuck in your pocket in and out it's a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.620 
stuck in your pocket in and out it's a
little<00:02:39.980> bit<00:02:40.190> harder<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.730> take<00:02:41.209> in<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.540> out

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
little bit harder to take in and out

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.510 
little bit harder to take in and out
your<00:02:41.810> pocket<00:02:42.140> as<00:02:42.260> I've<00:02:42.680> noticed<00:02:43.070> when<00:02:43.220> using

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
your pocket as I've noticed when using

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.810 
your pocket as I've noticed when using
this<00:02:43.670> case<00:02:43.959> they<00:02:44.959> basically<00:02:45.350> this<00:02:46.250> offers

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
this case they basically this offers

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.870 
this case they basically this offers
like<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.570> minimum<00:02:48.020> of<00:02:48.110> smoke<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.370> impact

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
like the minimum of smoke but the impact

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.160 
like the minimum of smoke but the impact
series<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.270> actually<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.720> little<00:02:50.810> bit<00:02:51.020> thinner

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
series is actually a little bit thinner

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.530 
series is actually a little bit thinner
this<00:02:52.130> is<00:02:52.250> in<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.459> middle<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.790> both<00:02:53.270> of<00:02:53.480> those

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
this is in the middle of both of those

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.720 
this is in the middle of both of those
cases<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.989> defender<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.560> impact<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.459> offers

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
cases the defender and impact it offers

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.220 
cases the defender and impact it offers
really<00:02:56.120> little<00:02:56.420> bulk<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.810> comes<00:02:56.989> in<00:02:57.110> a

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
really little bulk and it comes in a

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.500 
really little bulk and it comes in a
notch<00:02:57.410> park<00:02:57.709> really<00:02:57.920> nice<00:02:58.209> without<00:02:59.209> adding

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
notch park really nice without adding

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.690 
notch park really nice without adding
too<00:02:59.540> much<00:02:59.720> bulk<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.170> your<00:03:00.230> device<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:01.550> here's
