a<00:00:00.589> few<00:00:01.589> moments<00:00:01.739> ago<00:00:02.190> I<00:00:02.220> placed<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.940> wreath<00:00:03.120> at

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
a few moments ago I placed a wreath at

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.740 
a few moments ago I placed a wreath at
the<00:00:03.360> Tomb<00:00:03.630> of<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.810> Unknown<00:00:03.900> Soldier<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:05.630> as<00:00:06.630> I

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and as I

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.280 
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and as I
stepped<00:00:07.259> back<00:00:07.820> and<00:00:08.820> stood<00:00:09.450> during<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.990> moment

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
stepped back and stood during the moment

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.230 
stepped back and stood during the moment
of<00:00:10.380> silence<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:10.980> followed

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
of silence that followed

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.890 
of silence that followed
I<00:00:12.330> said<00:00:13.050> a<00:00:13.080> small<00:00:13.290> prayer<00:00:14.450> and<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.570> occurred<00:00:15.870> to

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
I said a small prayer and it occurred to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.250 
I said a small prayer and it occurred to
me<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.199> each<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.400> my<00:00:17.630> predecessors<00:00:18.630> has<00:00:19.020> had

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
me that each of my predecessors has had

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.650 
me that each of my predecessors has had
a<00:00:19.289> similar<00:00:19.619> moment<00:00:20.090> and<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.180> wondered<00:00:21.480> if<00:00:21.570> our

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
a similar moment and I wondered if our

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.080 
a similar moment and I wondered if our
prayers<00:00:22.020> weren't<00:00:22.349> very<00:00:22.710> much<00:00:23.040> the<00:00:23.279> same<00:00:23.520> if

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
prayers weren't very much the same if

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.939 
prayers weren't very much the same if
not<00:00:24.330> identical<00:00:25.669> we<00:00:26.669> celebrate<00:00:27.439> Veterans<00:00:28.439> Day

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
not identical we celebrate Veterans Day

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.720 
not identical we celebrate Veterans Day
on<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.449> anniversary<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:32.099> armistice<00:00:32.699> that

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
on the anniversary of the armistice that

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.869 
on the anniversary of the armistice that
ended<00:00:32.940> World<00:00:33.449> War<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:35.340> armistice<00:00:35.850> that

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
ended World War one the armistice that

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.119 
ended World War one the armistice that
began<00:00:36.330> on<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> 11th<00:00:36.930> hour<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> 11th<00:00:37.860> day

of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.519> 11th<00:00:39.120> month<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.190> wonder<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.610> fact

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
of the 11th month and I wonder in fact

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.420 
of the 11th month and I wonder in fact
if<00:00:42.089> all<00:00:42.269> Americans<00:00:42.330> prayers<00:00:43.230> aren't<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.220> same

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
if all Americans prayers aren't the same

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.990 
if all Americans prayers aren't the same
as<00:00:44.940> those<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.239> mentioned<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.870> moment<00:00:45.989> ago<00:00:47.000> for

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
as those I mentioned a moment ago for

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.990 
as those I mentioned a moment ago for
all<00:00:48.720> we<00:00:49.049> can<00:00:49.260> ever<00:00:49.470> do<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:49.739> our<00:00:50.100> heroes<00:00:50.519> is

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
all we can ever do for our heroes is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.259 
all we can ever do for our heroes is
remember<00:00:51.720> them<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:52.879> remember<00:00:53.879> what<00:00:54.059> they<00:00:54.239> did

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
remember them and remember what they did

remember them and remember what they did
and<00:00:55.159> memories<00:00:56.159> are<00:00:56.190> transmitted<00:00:57.030> through

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and memories are transmitted through

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.799 
and memories are transmitted through
words<00:00:58.309> we<00:00:59.309> see<00:00:59.549> these<00:00:59.760> soldiers<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.390> our<00:01:00.479> mind

I think sometimes of general Matthew
Ridgway<00:02:02.570> who<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.920> night<00:02:04.130> before<00:02:04.340> d-day

tossed Sleepless on his cot and talked
to<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.869> Lord<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.429> listened<00:02:10.429> for<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.640> promise
