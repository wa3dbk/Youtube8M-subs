pine nuts I put on top these nuts are
great<00:01:40.290> they're<00:01:40.560> 30%<00:01:41.460> protein<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
great they're 30% protein they have a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.840 
great they're 30% protein they have a
lot<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> fiber<00:01:43.079> they<00:01:43.649> are<00:01:43.829> expensive<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.700> it's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
lot of fiber they are expensive but it's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.340 
lot of fiber they are expensive but it's
because<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.240> takes<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.570> long<00:01:45.720> time<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:46.140> harvest

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
because it takes a long time to harvest

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.780 
because it takes a long time to harvest
but<00:01:46.740> what<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.070> love<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.640> they're

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
but what I do love is that they're

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.550 
but what I do love is that they're
readily<00:01:48.210> available<00:01:48.329> I'm<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.530> to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
readily available I'm just going to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.330 
readily available I'm just going to
toast<00:01:49.799> them<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.009> some<00:01:50.280> olive<00:01:50.460> oil<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:51.200> and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
just be careful in toasting the pine

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.660 
just be careful in toasting the pine
nuts<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.680> don't<00:01:55.979> keep<00:01:56.189> them<00:01:56.369> over<00:01:56.579> the

nuts that you don't keep them over the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.459 
nuts that you don't keep them over the
heat<00:01:56.850> very<00:01:57.149> long<00:01:57.420> because<00:01:57.689> they<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.229> burn

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
heat very long because they can burn

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.920 
heat very long because they can burn
rather<00:01:58.740> quickly<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.790> say<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.479> minute<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
rather quickly so I say just a minute to
