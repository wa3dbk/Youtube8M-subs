00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
mainframe might be the answer so the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.429

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
actually picked it up was that the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.510 
actually picked it up was that the
network<00:01:42.060> guys<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.140> had<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:44.219> didn't

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
network guys I think we had we didn't

official<00:01:46.439> Xerox<00:01:46.799> movers<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.610> as<00:01:47.790> they<00:01:48.329> were

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
official Xerox movers and as they were

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.819 
official Xerox movers and as they were
driving<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> Houston<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.530> were<00:01:49.619> finding

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
driving at the Houston they were finding

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.709 
driving at the Houston they were finding
it<00:01:49.979> was<00:01:50.130> rolling<00:01:50.579> around<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:51.090> little<00:01:51.240> bit<00:01:51.420> so

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
it was rolling around a little bit so

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.510 
it was rolling around a little bit so
somebody<00:01:52.229> had<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> idea<00:01:52.710> well<00:01:53.130> let's<00:01:53.369> just

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
somebody had the idea well let's just

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
somebody had the idea well let's just
flip<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:53.939> its<00:01:54.000> side<00:01:54.180> Italy<00:01:54.840> stop<00:01:55.079> rolling

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
flip it on its side Italy stop rolling

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.350 
flip it on its side Italy stop rolling
around<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.700> flipped<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.180> its<00:01:57.210> side

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
around so you flipped on its side

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.319 
around so you flipped on its side
brought<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.500> Houston<00:01:58.950> when<00:01:59.789> we<00:01:59.909> set<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.119> up

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
brought to Houston when we set it up
