00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.249
 good afternoon speaks to them crous there 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.100
 today I want to talk to you in an easy way 

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:11.110
 and simple to do karting and racing well 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.200
 like resetting the basic attack of 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.560
 your champion this is called this of the 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.160
 step for walking your concept is very 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.960
 simple all walking a concept 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.150
 invented in dota 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.880
 this one was based on castilla manually 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.369
 your order spells then you expected 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.710
 until you see the projectile in the air of your 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.110
 song to move 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.350
 this is known as cancel the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.690
 animation of the champion you clearly have 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.730
 to be in the enemy's range like that 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.420
 when he moves you follow him 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.920
 to not lose rank this concept 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.409
 can also be included in the castle 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.620
 of skills since reaching a 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:57.160
 skill you'll see the animation and it's 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.800
 convenient to position yourself 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.480
 to avoid this is and always be 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.260
 close to your enemy in a strong way 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.920
 a clear example of a ap 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.520
 can be positioned safely there are 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.770
 castellar skills stick 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.869
 one of the benefits of port walking 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.210
 is that you can facilitate and optimize the 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.500
 number of basic attacks that you hit 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.250
 enemy 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:29.120
 this can also be applied top in 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.860
 mid and in boat everywhere already 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.740
 explained that it is the pride that 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.200
 we will explain the use of the key 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.730
 Attack movement of the player and click 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.700
 of the player's attack movement 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.500
 the player's attack movement 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.340
 is normally assigned in the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.350
 in observing when you press the key gives me 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.690
 the opportunity to select my 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.000
 enemy 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.470
 to then press it with the click 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.080
 left 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.900
 here I am making several attacks 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.840
 basic so they can observe better 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.790
 the tool many of you will be 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.270
 in right click to attack the enemy 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:15.080
 The disadvantages of using the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.050
 right click is that first you do not 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.180
 shows the maximum range of your song in 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.270
 the circle that is displayed around 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.460
 song in the maximum range and second if 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.410
 you fail the click when selecting your 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.319
 enemy you will go directly to 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.319
 them what causes certain death 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.319
 using the key this will never go back to 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.389
 happen since without fail the key to 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.829
 they click left 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.380
 it will simply attack the enemy more 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:47.020
 close to reaching its maximum range 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.230
 the champion's maximum range you can 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:54.010
 configure in escape 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.690
 pass interface and enable where it says 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.820
 show range of attack 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.340
 now there is a faster and easier way 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.800
 to perform their tasks which is 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.370
 known as click of the movement of 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.530
 indicator attack 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.720
 in the version is key marks 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.209
 in my case I have it configured in the 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.630
 left mouse button applied from 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.920
 perform by guo qingping so 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.650
 faster and gentler 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.230
 the task would be to press the click 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.989
 left then the right and so 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.300
 successively to position in 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.520
 reality is very simple 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.709
 It should be noted that it takes a lot of time 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.470
 in getting used to me I take 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.660
 about 20 games but at 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.540
 perfect this technique you 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.959
 will greatly facilitate the kite and will be a 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.959
 good decade 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.700
 ok finally if you want to have the same 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.879
 configuration that I have I do not you 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.280
 worry is very simple you only have 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.790
 to go to the hard drive where you have the 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.750
 league of legends you go to the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.370
 binder 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.739
 you go into conflict 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.050
 then there you will find a file that 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.479
 it's called input this file is the one 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.150
 saves all your settings 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.800
 keyboard as you can see it 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.560
 found in English which is why it is very 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.290
 difficult to set manually in the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.770
 video description I'll leave you 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.960
 a link with my input now if you have 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:46.479
 fear or you just do not like the 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:49.350
 configuration of this input you can create 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:52.290
 in the league of legends folder 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.920
 folder that is called inputs there you go to 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:05:00.360
 save your configuration and you will create 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.640
 a new folder where you have the 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.140
 clean input file that is the 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.550
 league of legends configuration by 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.960
 defect then you have your input and 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.670
 you have the input of league of legends 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:17.460
 clean just in case it gets damaged 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.529
 or to lose or you just do not like the 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.100
 configuration that 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:25.670
 will show you today 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.460
 and well that 's all for 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:33.700
 this video so I hope you have them 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.700
 liked and see you another time
