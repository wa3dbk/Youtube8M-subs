00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.600 
of course moving on to jak 2 and 3 they
took<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:51.229> series<00:01:51.439> in<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.679> much<00:01:51.830> more<00:01:52.069> mature

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
took the series in a much more mature

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.389 
took the series in a much more mature
approach<00:01:53.000> because<00:01:53.330> they<00:01:53.420> wanted<00:01:53.659> to

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
approach because they wanted to

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.990 
approach because they wanted to
experiment<00:01:55.399> with<00:01:55.490> different<00:01:55.580> game<00:01:55.880> mechanics

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
experiment with different game mechanics

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.929 
experiment with different game mechanics
like<00:01:56.450> gunplay<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.259> having<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.280> zoom<00:01:58.640> or<00:01:58.819> that

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
like gunplay and having a zoom or that

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.149 
like gunplay and having a zoom or that
you<00:01:59.030> can<00:01:59.270> Jack<00:02:00.110> at<00:02:00.289> any<00:02:00.409> time<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.799> drive<00:02:01.009> around

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
you can Jack at any time to drive around

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
ultimately chose not to do this because

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.779 
ultimately chose not to do this because
it<00:04:47.469> got<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.860> point<00:04:48.039> where<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:48.400> didn't<00:04:48.669> feel

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
it got to the point where it didn't feel

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.820
