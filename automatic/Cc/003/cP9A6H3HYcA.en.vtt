light at an angle just like I did there

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.210 
light at an angle just like I did there

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
that's why we disengaged the left one

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.190 
that's why we disengaged the left one
and<00:05:53.740> that<00:05:54.550> will<00:05:54.700> allow<00:05:55.000> you<00:05:55.060> to<00:05:55.270> walk<00:05:55.870> up<00:05:56.080> the
