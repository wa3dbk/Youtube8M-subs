00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:03.310
 and it is the spirit of the Antichrist 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.280
 heard of the money that he is coming 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.280
 and now he is already in the world 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.560
 a true prophet thus believes in the Incarnation of the Son of God 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.730
 and he did not want anyone to doubt that Jesus was in the fallen human 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.349
 Nature came to us 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:23.449
 in our 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.039
 fallen meat 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.589
 the bible says that every person or church declaring that Jesus prof 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.399
 some other kind came into this world 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.530
 as in the fallen flesh as she and I have it 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.170
 this one has the spirit of the antichrist 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.470
 in other words, the true solo benefits that she and I »these 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.970
 human nature he often had 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.320
 understand correctly 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.080
 for wide values ​​and believed the correct 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.080
 Biblical definition of human nature Christian 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.489
 He came into this world in our nature 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.180
 in our fallen human flesh 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.180
 but he did not follow any temptation 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.670
 he was gone 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.829
 she and I can also be victorious over every sin in our lives 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.329
 through the power of his blood and the power of the Holy Spirit Jesus 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.990
 Christ wants to give us he has become our perfect example 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.790
 the Brier 4 Verse 15 For we do not have a high priest for not pity 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.150
 could have kept up with our weak 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.619
 The approximately one Adam did not know what to say before the Fall 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.759
 therefore Christ took to our weakness No we read on 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.590
 in the same way 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.600
 like beer 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.230
 has been tried 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.200
 without sin 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.550
 recognize her now 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.120
 that such perfect life on earth is an encouraging example of discipleship 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.420
 has become for us 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.219
 first Peter 2 verse 21 for this was called to them 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.359
 yet Christ has asked for you and set an example with you 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.220
 he follows his footsteps 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.690
 this first test makes it absolutely clear that God's goods are ambassadors 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.780
 the possible victory 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.780
 Be taught about sin 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.879
 readings 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.139
 perfect life is not alone 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.079
 for us representative 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.409
 but also our examples 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:19.829
 if she's fine 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.829
 Christ was our representative on Golgotha 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.109
 but his perfect life is 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.219
 our exemplary role model 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.679
 see the difference 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.689
 So we can really stop by the power and power of Jesus 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.399
 sin 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:38.739
 Yes friends 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.599
 in the power of God's Judas 24 to the worker without any stumbling 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.860
 Preserve and rejoice perfectly before His Holiness 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.649
 Hintze can make 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:53.939
 there is not a single sin in our lives that is not about us Jesus 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.429
 could give the victory 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.779
 If there is one we should make God Lüner 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.559
 By believing in Jesus, they can win the victory over any sin 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.539
 have their lives when they surrender to him 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:07.949
 fixed number twelve 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.039
 at Thiersee also 15 to 20 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.839
 But beware of the false prophets 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.399
 the most crucial unfortunately come in Zurich 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:20.029
 but not they are travelers wolves at their fruits you become them 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:21.659
 recognize 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.820
 in other words 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.980
 pay attention to what their clerical leaders are preachers 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.340
 or bring up drivers if they care about everything they do 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.930
 go watch or have a nice time with community festivals 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.459
 with coffee gossip and so on 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.680
 and they spend their time and people summon money to them 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.190
 send 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.830
 since I put him in the authority of God's Word these persons are one 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.089
 false prophet 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.849
 They can be these tests on all were prophets of the Bible applications 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:47.660
 find out 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.650
 that will equip them all with over natural authority signs 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.109
 and she was faithful to the Word of God 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.659
 they were after the Hannes the writer of the revelation in the year 100 after 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:58.359
 Christ 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.049
 all people who were God's mouthpiece for his church 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.730
 God has now among others through the prophet Mallya Prix in Maria Veen 3 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:09.939
 Verse 19 to 23 for the last time and may also before the terrible day 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.569
 His court announced a prophet in Elijah 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.949
 as you will see on our last broadcast 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:19.989
 the time of the divine final report begins at the end of 2300 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.939
 predicted years 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:26.389
 this period ended in 1844 where this race time Prophet was supposed to occur 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.290
 and this prophet who fulfills all twelve tests of a true prophet is at 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.039
 River Ellen Key far 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.249
 from 18 and 27 to 19 15 meters 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.860
 Look at these wonderful texts of the Bible which give us the need 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.909
 show a prophet 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.469
 Hamas 3 verse 7 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:46.689
 because the Lord does not do anything unless he has his secret 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:47.400
 subjugate 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.860
 revealed the Prophet 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.990
 second chronicle 20 20 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.669
 believe in him new gold 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.169
 then you will pass 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.659
 believe his prophet then you will succeed 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:59.540
 can you see it 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.460
 this need for our time of spiritual confusion 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.520
 they recognize the consequences of the rejection of the Holy Spirit 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.349
 everything we have to do 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.680
 is the spirits to consider 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.919
 we have to see if what we see is of God 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.919
 for as we reject it, we reject the Holy Ghost 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.059
 I'm sorry for people who say so 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:27.539
 give me the bible and only the bible 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.180
 no modern times prophets 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.039
 only the Bible alone 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.800
 that will be convincing and quite convincing 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.969
 but there is a problem with friends 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.549
 You can not separate the two because the Bible always tells us 

00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:42.629
 and always prophets ahead for the last days 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.319
 So if they accept the Bible as the true Word of God then they have to 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:51.080
 The goods of gift of prophecy acknowledge the Bible 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.059
 shown they have 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:58.490
 July 2 verse 28 to 29 and after that it will happen that I turn my mind off 

00:05:58.489 --> 00:06:00.400
 Pour over all meat 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.509
 and your sons and daughters will know that your old ones will become dreams 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.040
 have your young men are seen face 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.540
 and even about the farmhands and the markets 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.540
 I'll pour my mind out in those days 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:16.830
 to friends 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.910
 God gave the goods the gift of prophecy to his children through all ages older 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:22.409
 to lead safely 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.409
 and in these last days we need this more than ever 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.619
 how are we going to flee 

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:31.979
 if we have such a great salvation 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.900
 disregard 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.800
 would like to bid with me 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.029
 dear heavenly father 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.939
 I know 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:43.499
 that many people are surprised and unsure about the message the 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:46.770
 they've just heard they do not know who Ellen White was 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.899
 and they have never heard their name before 

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:53.110
 This helps the people who have seen this program today 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.039
 to read and study this for themselves 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.369
 and that they are not dominated by the deceptions of Satan 

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:01.130
 your Warren prophets 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.569
 and to recognize your true church 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:08.779
 We thank you and ask you to stand the power for the truth 

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:09.599
 in these 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:10.809
 hard times 

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:12.409
 because this power 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:14.849
 alone of you 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:17.849
 in the name of Jesus we ask these things 

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:25.409
 in our next episode we talk about the last and most important 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:28.419
 Message that was ever proclaimed on earth 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:30.349
 the triple angel's message
