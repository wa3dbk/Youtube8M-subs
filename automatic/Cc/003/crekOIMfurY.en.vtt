00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.009 
sure
doesn't<00:02:13.140> match<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.709> hate<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:15.420> try<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.750> pay<00:02:15.870> our

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
doesn't match I hate to try and pay our

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.900 
doesn't match I hate to try and pay our
foundations<00:02:16.680> that's<00:02:16.920> why<00:02:17.099> I<00:02:17.129> did<00:02:17.310> not<00:02:17.459> wear<00:02:17.730> it

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
foundations that's why I did not wear it

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.360 
foundations that's why I did not wear it
because<00:02:18.379> it's<00:02:19.379> just<00:02:19.470> too<00:02:19.620> complicated<00:02:19.890> to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
because it's just too complicated to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.140 
because it's just too complicated to
find<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.790> right<00:02:20.940> shade<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.400> think<00:02:23.849> this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
find the right shade so I think this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.009 
find the right shade so I think this
when<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.390> also<00:02:25.110> says<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:25.800> cool<00:02:26.099> toned<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.730> guess

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
when I also says it's cool toned I guess

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.910 
when I also says it's cool toned I guess

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
they're on camera anyway I'm with the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.960 
they're on camera anyway I'm with the
hall<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.769> l'oreal<00:03:20.549> true<00:03:20.579> match

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
hall is the l'oreal true match

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.379 
hall is the l'oreal true match
foundation<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.190> was<00:03:23.459> originally<00:03:23.970> I

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
foundation and this was originally I

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.759 
foundation and this was originally I
think<00:03:24.720> 11<00:03:25.079> or<00:03:25.319> 12<00:03:25.560> 99<00:03:26.060> but<00:03:27.060> since<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.170> was<00:03:28.349> so

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
think 11 or 12 99 but since it was so

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.250 
think 11 or 12 99 but since it was so
heavily<00:03:29.010> discounted<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.090> got<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.900> forward

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
heavily discounted I got it forward

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.640 
heavily discounted I got it forward
think<00:03:32.540> 383<00:03:33.540> or<00:03:33.720> something<00:03:34.049> he<00:03:34.139> was<00:03:34.260> under<00:03:34.470> four

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650
