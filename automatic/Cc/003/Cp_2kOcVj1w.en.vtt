00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.500
 this is the normal aspect of a 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.190
 switch and in the market they are sold 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.949
 so you will never be able to see them open 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.150
 it is simply a control switch 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:24.250
 of power and the internal mechanism 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.020
 let's say what it is is that these 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.360
 switches are riveted so 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.789
 that can never be opened in principle 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.760
 although as you can see this is open well 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.890
 at first the current thread that 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.460
 take our housing will enter by this 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.370
 take up and the electricity will do the 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.960
 next entry tour for this 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.620
 copper filament is a small plate 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.659
 and it will turn around and if it's off as 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.929
 is the case simply that it is already 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:55.960
 here it will go below and you will reach this 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.339
 small black piece that happens all 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.429
 electrifies this electromagnet that 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:03.810
 it is simply at rest and does not act 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:08.610
 but if we activate the switch 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:11.040
 as we see this piece here of copper makes 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.880
 Contact with electricity counts and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.940
 get to spend all that power his 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.740
 intensity up to this copper filament 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.380
 that was varnished with silver 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.950
 this filament makes contact in turn 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.610
 with this copper plate that is welded 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.229
 with this plate called metallic bird in 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.789
 this metal plate the property that 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.180
 has is that its two walls are the 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.880
 conductive and the interior is simply 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.539
 a step that does not count at all in 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.390
 this wall here we can see how there 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.150
 a new copper filament the silver 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.360
 and makes connection with this little plate and 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.550
 directly would pass the intensity to 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.930
 cable that would be inserted here and that 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.970
 will distribute the whole house 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.560
 why the switches 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.990
 jump is very basic is the expression of 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.760
 rectors for example in this case can 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.230
 endure an intensity of up to 35 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.030
 amps and if we do not exceed that range 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.280
 will never jump 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.530
 then the power to carry this 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.060
 metal plate and here against more power 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.150
 we have more is going to stick and more 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.190
 serious and going to be folding these plates 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.660
 are fully controlled and measured 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.570
 perfection so that at the moment in 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.690
 that get to 35 amps this plate will 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.090
 double enough for this 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.239
 small screw that we have here double 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.180
 the plate and trigger that mechanism that 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.280
 make jump the switch as you have 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.610
 seen this little plate has moved what 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.300
 just like to make the electromagnet 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.290
 residing here enough to move 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.660
 so that the plunger that has inside 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.100
 attract this plate from here to back and 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.790
 release the circuit 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.769
 we have the circuit normally open 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.780
 Why these pieces that you see here 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.189
 this stone extinguishes sparks the one that there is 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.379
 below and this general pay is not to burn 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:16.340
 the switch to have a lowering of 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.350
 so great tension in a fraction of 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.600
 second 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.060
 of the tension goes back to the 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.400
 Initial conduit and when you get paid 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.390
 sparks this area what it does is 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.480
 consume all that tension did not 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.390
 very fast and prevent the switch 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.530
 burn because if we would not have all 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.650
 our switches that the one who 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.510
 jump light and totally burned in 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.730
 principle there are no big differences 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.710
 between the switches that distribute 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.500
 electricity to an area to a single 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.330
 area of ​​the house as well as the bathroom floor 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.640
 the lighting and between which is the 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.800
 general switch of the apartment the 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.070
 aspect is the same and there are no big 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.070
 differences
