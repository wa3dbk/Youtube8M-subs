00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 cube 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.000
 in front 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 hello dear friends today to your 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.030
 Attention review 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.410
 already third generation crossover 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.710
 mercedes benz ml this ml can be called 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.050
 absolutely new car despite 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.919
 that it is based on a platform from 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.660
 his predecessor, many do not even immediately 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.900
 understand that they face new penalties 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.759
 although in fact the novelty has 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.719
 absolutely new body looks like 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.710
 predecessor and only generally they are in 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.249
 details 

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:34.389
 this is our view successfully worked in 

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:36.109
 designers maintain continuity 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:37.320
 generations 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.250
 currently online 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.190
 offered in Russia in four 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.710
 modifications 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.460
 first thought 356 ruff six strong 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.570
 petrol 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.880
 second 1 0350 secretary two hundred fifty 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.500
 eight strong diesel also 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.340
 modification ml500 in this case the crossover 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.170
 equipped with three hundred eighty eight 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.300
 strong gasoline engine but 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.960
 the sports version stands alone 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.430
 Enamel 63 half g under the hood of such a machine 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.180
 gasoline engine installed 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.670
 serious power of 525 forces for our tas 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.670
 then we chose a motorist three hundred 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.930
 six strong petrol 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.119
 motor as base 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.119
 version million 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.090
 very conditional despite the fact that 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.220
 little white seats 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.380
 adjust the percentage of workplace 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.200
 the driver is very easy here 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.789
 so what is the most important thing is natural here in 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.899
 spacious because all the same car in 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.970
 my family n mercedes benz ml is very large 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.860
 concerning 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.090
 in common 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.650
 car feeling mood not 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.350
 exchanged 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.750
 and experience with the previous generation, it can 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.859
 be even club shinnik 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.259
 new reminds her 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:15.659
 predecessor is even more than just 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.449
 when you look at the experiments 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:19.219
 there is an american 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.079
 valko which hints at the root 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.779
 all class and main market 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.379
 in fact, this notorious valko 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.479
 not at all annoying the only thing 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.579
 can sway back passengers 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.009
 even with the lack of extreme suspension like 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:34.639
 our system case is precisely controlled but 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.359
 This of course for full size 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.089
 crossover handling 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:39.359
 really high 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.900
 the only thing you can find fault so 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.019
 it's a slightly blurred reaction to turns 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:44.579
 steering wheel 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.219
 and now let's look at consciousness 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.019
 moments our hero 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.319
 first of all I want to remember a 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.959
 driver's and combat x5 crossover 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.709
 four rings on the bridge can 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.209
 boast the same equipment katya 100 mg 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.879
 and about the same price as in the IMF, too 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.370
 there are three hundred six strong gasoline 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.180
 motor is true this power of meat from three 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.999
 liters they sleep a half like u 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:08.889
 our yamal 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:09.839
 generally by the majority 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.399
 The parameters of these machines are very similar 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.309
 the court decides rather a matter of taste and 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.189
 attachment to 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.219
 eventually 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:20.349
 I want to say that instead of the viewer is not 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.109
 began to look for good from good 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.109
 second generation million 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.089
 and therefore probably specialists 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.609
 the Germans are nowhere 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.609
 bring all this fundamentally new 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:41.679
 introduction machine 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:45.930
 in front
