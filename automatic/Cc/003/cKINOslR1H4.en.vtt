00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.840
 hi friends from youtube i'm bea 'rubÃ©n and 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.059
 we were in a tutorial in which they 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.330
 I'm going to teach new gems sheets and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.099
 new art gems in which to give 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.410
 quite a few gems and it worked for me 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.050
 ok let's go to the link choose depending 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.930
 of the video that is just this ok 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.180
 first of all it's going to take you to this 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.189
 link and what we have to do is 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.450
 unlock the summit and let's give it 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.460
 here where I do not know what he says what he 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.740
 sinks in ok we have to wait for the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.950
 five insurance and we're going to practicality what 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.600
 that we are going to repeat it more once and 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.699
 it also expects you what to expect 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.420
 again reynoso and I want to tell you that 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.670
 thank you very much for the fire are giving 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.699
 of those that you need, like a lot 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.739
 they are supporting a lot and really 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.670
 thanks for that support 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:08.690
 now post that I was going to upload it 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:13.100
 hack at 50 likes and it was a 50 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.140
 where 50 the jce and apart that was going to go up 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.119
 a video of finestrat a freddy el tras 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.990
 first night let's see how it's going 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.670
 what fear but let's see let's go to 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.200
 what you do is introduce what 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.940
 I can tell you often that we were going to 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.770
 get to our bronze and we're going to give 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.380
 right click let's see font frame 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.340
 Here we will open and as this will 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.340
 they will know on line 5 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.720
 and we're going to paste it for the session and 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.610
 let's go through to this window and the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.890
 let's control more and we're going to press 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.020
 keys and let's write the word 65 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.170
 and very well positioned the word session 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.820
 with double s and let's copy it and what 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.590
 we paste ok now we have to introduce 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.409
 the captcha the capture no more serves to 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.290
 that so you do not get better sooner 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.930
 no and there is not as much saturation in 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.110
 he then on the page ok 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.479
 it's here where it says it turns 2 and I do not 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.769
 daban is not going to throw the games for the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.959
 results because they communicate to this 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:14.019
 Place crutch will give a little bit and as you can see 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.519
 of 287g plus I now have 210 and no 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.090
 leave behind as you see it works 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.550
 perfectly the hack and is very good 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.580
 again let's give it one more time we're going 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.470
 to go to block what is the summit 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.380
 ok very important 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.790
 now let's give again we are and 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.100
 I'm nervous I'm anxious to be able 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.770
 play to not be for eddie I want to see 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.130
 how that feeling puts me on hold 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.190
 of judo puts on the skin that you are 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.050
 I do not know 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.080
 it's the sensation that you accelerate 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.210
 heart and is waiting to see what is going to 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.440
 come out I swear that that's what I 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.270
 Like and hate at the same time is that I like 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.000
 but I hate 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.920
 is that it is not fear and I am not afraid 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.520
 of that data so terror with 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.950
 ghosts or someone who is not afraid 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.670
 for me the movies is not scary the 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.180
 I do not like scare because it scares you 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.180
 at the moment 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:26.880
 and this is what pays me that touches me 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.800
 like but not and so good to see two 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.660
 and two and nothing 205 fernando as you see 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.310

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.940
