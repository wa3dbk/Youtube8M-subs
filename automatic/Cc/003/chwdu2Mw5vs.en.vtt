is the impact on mines that might not be

cost<00:02:58.410> production<00:02:59.780> right<00:03:00.780> now<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:02.250> kind

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
cost production right now so it's kind

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.790

more<00:03:05.250> gold<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.730> there<00:03:05.850> might<00:03:05.970> be<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.210> supply

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
shortage in the near future what do you

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.120 
shortage in the near future what do you
think<00:03:09.000> about<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.360> yeah<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:10.350> is<00:03:10.620> very<00:03:10.890> tough

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
think about that yeah it is very tough

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.190

for the binding industry right now but

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.930 
for the binding industry right now but
one<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.650> reasons<00:03:14.010> why<00:03:14.190> gold<00:03:14.490> preserves

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
one of the reasons why gold preserves

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.640 
one of the reasons why gold preserves

purchasing power over long periods of

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.130 
purchasing power over long periods of

bottom<00:04:18.509> I'd<00:04:18.900> have<00:04:19.079> probably<00:04:19.199> said<00:04:19.620> yes<00:04:19.859> with<00:04:20.130> a

ten percent probability we could take it

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.290 
ten percent probability we could take it
at<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:23.070> best<00:04:23.250> thing<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.610> could<00:04:23.729> happen<00:04:23.880> now

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
at the best thing that could happen now

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.749 
at the best thing that could happen now
is<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:25.080> we<00:04:25.229> see<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.440> V<00:04:25.710> bottom<00:04:26.160> in<00:04:26.340> other<00:04:26.550> words

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
is that we see a V bottom in other words

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.390 
is that we see a V bottom in other words
we've<00:04:26.910> come<00:04:27.150> down<00:04:27.330> sharply<00:04:27.360> below<00:04:28.139> 1180<00:04:29.009> I'd

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
we've come down sharply below 1180 I'd

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.310 
we've come down sharply below 1180 I'd
like<00:04:29.580> to<00:04:29.610> see<00:04:29.850> us<00:04:29.970> go<00:04:30.120> back<00:04:30.300> sharply<00:04:30.630> back

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
like to see us go back sharply back

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.249 
like to see us go back sharply back
above<00:04:31.710> 1180<00:04:32.490> preferably<00:04:33.090> above<00:04:33.419> 1,200<00:04:33.960> if

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
above 1180 preferably above 1,200 if

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.260 
above 1180 preferably above 1,200 if
that<00:04:34.500> happens<00:04:34.680> by<00:04:35.039> the<00:04:35.100> end<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.550> year<00:04:35.820> then

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
that happens by the end of the year then

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.719 
that happens by the end of the year then
I<00:04:36.300> think<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:37.139> level<00:04:37.350> of<00:04:37.590> confidence<00:04:38.460> that

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
I think the level of confidence that

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.760 
I think the level of confidence that
this<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.660> final<00:04:39.990> bottom<00:04:40.350> of<00:04:40.650> this

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
this is the the final bottom of this

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.040 
this is the the final bottom of this
correction<00:04:41.310> that<00:04:41.430> began<00:04:41.699> three<00:04:41.970> years<00:04:42.000> ago<00:04:42.240> I

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
correction that began three years ago I

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.170 
correction that began three years ago I
think<00:04:43.530> then<00:04:43.740> we're<00:04:44.190> probably<00:04:44.370> safe<00:04:44.940> and

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
think then we're probably safe and

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.370 
think then we're probably safe and
saying<00:04:45.419> that<00:04:45.600> yeah<00:04:45.780> we're<00:04:45.930> going<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:46.110> start

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
saying that yeah we're going to start

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.409 
saying that yeah we're going to start
resuming<00:04:46.740> this<00:04:47.340> bull<00:04:47.550> market<00:04:47.580> that<00:04:48.120> began

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
resuming this bull market that began

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.140

many<00:04:48.900> many<00:04:49.110> years<00:04:49.199> ago<00:04:49.699> what<00:04:50.699> do<00:04:50.789> you<00:04:50.850> think<00:04:51.060> is

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
many many years ago what do you think is

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.240 
many many years ago what do you think is
a<00:04:51.180> chance<00:04:51.570> to<00:04:51.810> break<00:04:51.990> through<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.500> 1000

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250
