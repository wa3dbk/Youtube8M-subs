00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 hello today we have a review yet 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:11.730
 one machine gun company battle 060 b we already 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.679
 did a review of a similar machine 060 a but 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.190
 we did not so detailed review 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.230
 how do we make this time so complete 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.869
 we see the instruction which shows 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.850
 how is the machine going but our machine 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.859
 slightly different from the one drawn in 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.359
 this model has a system 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.210
 hop-up about which we'll talk a little later 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.620
 shown sight adjustment 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:40.290
 adjustable butt and miscellaneous 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.050
 additional equipment to weapons from 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.719
 boxes we get the adapter on 8 and 4 volts 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.370
 800mAh battery 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.610
 hour key for shops plastic 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.610
 lever 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.760
 magazine with adjustable bullets and 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:10.290
 ada staff 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:12.479
 machine on the days we saw the ramrod take 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.270
 automatic and more understand it 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.790
 by moving the spring you can remove the strips and 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.240
 install additional equipment 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.610
 What could be done as the model 060 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.740
 dismantling handguard we do not see here 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.100
 wires to connect to 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.009
 the battery noticed that the machine is 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.619
 the ability to regulate the front sight itself 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.600
 regulated only left and right in 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.500
 telescopic butt can also 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.590
 adjust 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.860
 and in form it differs from model 060 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.990
 aaaa you can get him out of a weapon 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.800
 see where in this model is inserted 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.800
 battery 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.760
 one of the drawbacks is that 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.720
 The battery is inserted for a very long time and 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.400
 hard to push to the end 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:20.380
 so the butt could not stand on his 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:23.739
 the initial place we set the handle and 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.170
 go to the hop-up system by clicking on 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.020
 latch pull on the bolt handle 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.260
 the frame that opens the pair of protective 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.130
 cover here we see the pop-up system u 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.200
 which is the adjustment of the rotational type 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.320
 scrolling clockwise main gear 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.160
 shooter we can adjust shots 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.680
 as shown in the figure we collect again 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.800
 raw materials and set the bar on your 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.800
 a place 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.400
 take the store and consider it 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.920
 more 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.650
 This shop will charge melodramas 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.440
 since he has an adjustment 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.250
 filing bullets that can be adjusted 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.430
 by hand or by using the key that was walking 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.430
 in set 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:32.440
 let us sleep balls scrolling key with 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.510
 we advance balls up shops 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.680
 noticing the first ball you can say that 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.680
 the store is ready to fire 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.090
 look inside and see how it works 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:54.290
 the mechanism of weapons in the video can be clearly 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.290
 see this in a cut 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:18.269
 it was unpacking and review machine 060 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.030
 bm made on the basis of this model 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:25.350
 m41 and in the next video we will check it 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.350
 power and firing range
