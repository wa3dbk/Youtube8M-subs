move from the surgery and the pharmacy

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.610 
move from the surgery and the pharmacy
to<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:22.040> supermarket<00:03:22.520> checkout<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.959> -<00:03:24.350> to

that there's a wonderful scientist

called Phil James who has been looking
at<00:03:36.950> this<00:03:37.040> issue<00:03:37.190> for<00:03:37.490> a<00:03:37.550> long<00:03:37.730> time<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.120> he's

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
at this issue for a long time and he's

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.360 
at this issue for a long time and he's
interested<00:03:38.690> in<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.840> way<00:03:38.930> in<00:03:39.080> which<00:03:39.370> economic

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
interested in the way in which economic

has shared some data with me which i
think<00:03:46.160> is<00:03:46.340> very<00:03:46.400> very<00:03:46.760> interesting<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:47.270> shows

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
think is very very interesting it shows

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.590 
think is very very interesting it shows
how<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:48.200> MIS<00:03:49.040> allocation<00:03:49.850> of<00:03:49.970> agricultural

how the MIS allocation of agricultural

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.020 
how the MIS allocation of agricultural
subsidies<00:03:51.110> has<00:03:51.650> led<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.400> production<00:03:52.730> of

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
its revenue neutral the government isn't

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.970 
its revenue neutral the government isn't
spending<00:04:17.690> anymore<00:04:18.080> but<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.410> price<00:04:18.650> of<00:04:18.830> some

spending anymore but the price of some

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.070 
spending anymore but the price of some
items<00:04:19.250> comes<00:04:19.489> down<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:20.000> others<00:04:20.450> go<00:04:20.600> up<00:04:20.840> and

items comes down and others go up and

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.540 
items comes down and others go up and
these<00:04:21.560> are<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:21.799> kinds<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.160> things<00:04:22.400> that

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
these are the kinds of things that

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.780 
these are the kinds of things that
change<00:04:22.970> people's<00:04:23.650> shopping<00:04:24.650> patterns<00:04:25.280> and

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
change people's shopping patterns and

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.510 
change people's shopping patterns and
then<00:04:26.419> consumption<00:04:27.050> patterns<00:04:27.520> systematically

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
then consumption patterns systematically

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.360 
then consumption patterns systematically
and<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:29.060> believe<00:04:29.390> that<00:04:29.540> that's<00:04:29.690> one

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
and I believe that that's one

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.780 
and I believe that that's one
the<00:04:30.460> ways<00:04:30.639> we<00:04:31.360> should<00:04:31.600> really<00:04:31.810> make<00:04:32.110> progress

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
the ways we should really make progress

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.760 
the ways we should really make progress
the<00:04:33.790> other<00:04:34.360> area<00:04:34.960> where<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.139> think<00:04:35.380> we<00:04:35.500> do<00:04:35.620> need

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
the other area where I think we do need

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.560 
the other area where I think we do need
to<00:04:35.860> make<00:04:35.949> progress<00:04:36.220> is<00:04:36.639> to<00:04:37.560> re-educate<00:04:38.560> the

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
to make progress is to re-educate the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.370 
to make progress is to re-educate the
regulator's<00:04:40.570> who<00:04:41.020> are<00:04:41.350> fighting<00:04:43.229> if<00:04:44.229> they

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
regulator's who are fighting if they

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.100 
regulator's who are fighting if they
directed<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.860> kind<00:04:45.070> of<00:04:45.160> Maginot<00:04:45.639> Line<00:04:46.110> it's

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
directed a kind of Maginot Line it's

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.750 
directed a kind of Maginot Line it's
it's<00:04:47.410> pretty<00:04:47.620> hopeless<00:04:48.100> all<00:04:48.250> they're<00:04:48.430> doing

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
it's pretty hopeless all they're doing

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.000 
it's pretty hopeless all they're doing
is<00:04:48.990> retarding<00:04:49.990> slowing<00:04:50.440> progress<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:51.330> in<00:04:52.330> the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
is retarding slowing progress and in the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.770 
is retarding slowing progress and in the
process<00:04:54.010> I<00:04:54.340> believe<00:04:54.490> harming<00:04:55.240> many<00:04:55.419> people's

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
process I believe harming many people's

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.629 
process I believe harming many people's
health<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:56.199> see<00:04:56.350> what<00:04:56.500> they<00:04:56.650> do<00:04:56.710> they<00:04:57.490> have<00:04:57.520> a

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
health you see what they do they have a

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.939 
health you see what they do they have a
broadly<00:04:58.030> pharmaceutical<00:04:58.720> model<00:04:58.990> they<00:04:59.680> look

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
broadly pharmaceutical model they look

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.770 
broadly pharmaceutical model they look
at<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.220> infinitesimally<00:05:00.820> small<00:05:01.300> possibility

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
at the infinitesimally small possibility

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.420 
at the infinitesimally small possibility
that<00:05:02.440> some<00:05:02.710> of<00:05:02.770> these<00:05:02.860> kinds<00:05:03.190> of<00:05:03.250> supplements

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
that some of these kinds of supplements

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.969 
that some of these kinds of supplements
might<00:05:03.850> do<00:05:04.000> harm<00:05:04.380> but<00:05:05.380> they<00:05:05.470> don't<00:05:05.650> look<00:05:05.800> at<00:05:05.949> it

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
might do harm but they don't look at it

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.600 
might do harm but they don't look at it
in<00:05:06.190> any<00:05:06.340> context<00:05:06.940> what<00:05:07.389> they<00:05:07.510> should<00:05:07.810> be<00:05:07.930> doing

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
in any context what they should be doing

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.550 
in any context what they should be doing
is<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.850> balance<00:05:10.030> against<00:05:10.660> that<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.139> far

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
is to balance against that the far

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.950 
is to balance against that the far
greater<00:05:12.100> harm<00:05:12.580> that<00:05:13.270> is<00:05:13.419> currently<00:05:13.900> being

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
greater harm that is currently being
