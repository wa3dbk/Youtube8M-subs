changes that we made is that it was
actually<00:00:37.469> built<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.980> two<00:00:38.160> different<00:00:38.370> phases

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
actually built in two different phases

actually built in two different phases
phase<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.870> 1971<00:00:40.770> phase<00:00:41.129> two<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.489> 1979<00:00:42.329> we

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.779 
phase one in 1971 phase two in 1979 we
decided<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> cut<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> fraud<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.550> half

decided to cut the fraud for the in half
you<00:00:45.390> create<00:00:45.719> two<00:00:45.840> different<00:00:45.870> communities<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you create two different communities and

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.180 
you create two different communities and
I'll<00:00:46.890> tell<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.100> why<00:00:47.190> soon<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:47.940> get<00:00:48.030> inside

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
I'll tell you why soon as we get inside

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.130 
I'll tell you why soon as we get inside
all<00:00:50.190> right<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.670> when<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.539> originally<00:00:51.719> bought

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
all right so when we originally bought

c- product was eighty-four percent

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.470 
c- product was eighty-four percent
occupied<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.699> filled<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.300> lot<00:01:00.449> of

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
occupied and it was filled with a lot of

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.209 
occupied and it was filled with a lot of
undesirable<00:01:01.260> tenants<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> previous

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
undesirable tenants the previous

undesirable tenants the previous
ownership<00:01:02.460> was<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:03.300> out<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.480> state<00:01:03.780> did<00:01:04.170> not

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
ownership was was out of state did not

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.740 
ownership was was out of state did not
have<00:01:04.470> good<00:01:04.500> management<00:01:04.799> company<00:01:05.309> down<00:01:05.460> here

have good management company down here
so<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.780> got<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.159> good<00:01:08.310> price<00:01:08.540> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
so we got it a really good price and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.620 
so we got it a really good price and
after<00:01:10.320> looking<00:01:10.680> at<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.890> realizing<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.909> this

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
after looking at it realizing that this

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.499 
after looking at it realizing that this
part<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> project<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:13.860> built<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.509> 1971

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
part of the project with built in 1971

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.100 
part of the project with built in 1971
and<00:01:17.000> this<00:01:18.000> part<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.390> project<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.869> built

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and this part of the project was built

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.740 
and this part of the project was built
in<00:01:19.229> nineteen<00:01:19.259> seventy<00:01:19.770> nine<00:01:20.180> we<00:01:21.180> actually<00:01:21.600> had

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
in nineteen seventy nine we actually had

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.070 
in nineteen seventy nine we actually had
two<00:01:22.110> different<00:01:23.299> two<00:01:24.299> different<00:01:24.330> types<00:01:24.810> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
two different two different types of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.410 
two different two different types of
buildings<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.100> building<00:01:26.340> materials<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.939> we

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
buildings of building materials so we

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.490 
buildings of building materials so we
thought<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.689> ourselves<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.080> cut<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
thought to ourselves so we cut the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.010 
thought to ourselves so we cut the
project<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.009> half<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.369> could<00:01:29.400> actually

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
project in half we could actually

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.569 
project in half we could actually
perhaps<00:01:31.020> gate<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.100> make<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.549> a

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
perhaps gate this one make this one a

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.190 
perhaps gate this one make this one a
beef<00:01:32.909> broth<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.360> any<00:01:33.479> upgraded<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> B

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
beef broth for any upgraded to a B

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.260 
beef broth for any upgraded to a B
status<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.610> will<00:01:35.729> probably<00:01:35.790> stay

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
status and this one will probably stay

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.440 
status and this one will probably stay
at<00:01:36.360> about<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> CC<00:01:37.049> c<00:01:37.619> plus<00:01:37.890> status<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
at about a CC c plus status so we this

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
at about a CC c plus status so we this
was<00:01:39.630> 132<00:01:40.320> units<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.799> cut<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.040> right<00:01:41.189> down<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
was 132 units we cut it right down the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.090 
was 132 units we cut it right down the
middle<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> approximately<00:01:43.229> 256

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
middle and this is a approximately 256

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.370 
middle and this is a approximately 256
total<00:01:44.280> complex<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.909> 340<00:01:45.840> something<00:01:46.170> can't

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
total complex is 340 something can't

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.740 
total complex is 340 something can't
remember

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
remember

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.720 
remember
 so<00:01:48.260> that's<00:01:49.100> what<00:01:49.280> we<00:01:49.370> did<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.610> you'll

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
 so that's what we did and you'll

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.460 
 so that's what we did and you'll
notice<00:01:49.910> by<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.120> paint<00:01:50.450> we<00:01:51.080> completely

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
notice by the paint we completely

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.110 
notice by the paint we completely
separate<00:01:51.920> originally<00:01:52.400> it<00:01:52.550> was<00:01:52.580> all<00:01:52.910> the<00:01:53.090> same

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
separate originally it was all the same

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.110 
separate originally it was all the same
color<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.170> we<00:01:54.440> made<00:01:55.040> this<00:01:55.160> an<00:01:55.310> ice<00:01:55.430> cream<00:01:55.760> color

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
color so we made this an ice cream color

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.180 
color so we made this an ice cream color
with<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.390> white<00:01:56.630> trim<00:01:57.050> we<00:01:57.770> did<00:01:57.890> all<00:01:58.070> the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
with a white trim we did all the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.950 
with a white trim we did all the
upgrades<00:01:58.370> necessarily<00:01:59.270> we<00:01:59.390> put<00:01:59.570> in<00:01:59.690> a<00:01:59.780> lot<00:01:59.900> of

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
upgrades necessarily we put in a lot of

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.240 
upgrades necessarily we put in a lot of
the<00:02:00.200> trees<00:02:01.330> new<00:02:02.330> trees<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:03.200> foliage<00:02:03.770> we<00:02:04.130> got

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
the trees new trees and foliage we got

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.430 
the trees new trees and foliage we got
new<00:02:04.400> signage<00:02:04.820> over<00:02:05.090> there<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:06.200> on<00:02:06.320> this

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
new signage over there and on this

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.790 
new signage over there and on this
particular<00:02:06.590> side<00:02:07.360> what<00:02:08.360> we<00:02:08.480> did<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:09.080> we<00:02:09.230> gated

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
particular side what we did is we gated

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.530 
particular side what we did is we gated
the<00:02:09.890> community<00:02:10.400> so<00:02:10.700> now<00:02:10.850> we<00:02:10.910> have<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.180> gated

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
the community so now we have a gated

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.060 
the community so now we have a gated
community<00:02:11.570> be<00:02:12.350> honest<00:02:12.590> with<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.770> on<00:02:12.920> this

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
community be honest with you on this

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.710 
community be honest with you on this
side<00:02:13.340> originally<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.420> where<00:02:14.600> all<00:02:14.630> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
side originally this is where all the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.990 
side originally this is where all the
drug<00:02:15.080> activity<00:02:15.650> was<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.700> where<00:02:16.850> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
drug activity was this is where the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.030 
drug activity was this is where the
derelict<00:02:17.420> tenants<00:02:17.810> were<00:02:17.900> living<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.890> this

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
derelict tenants were living and this

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.220 
derelict tenants were living and this
was<00:02:19.190> our<00:02:19.310> biggest<00:02:19.490> challenge<00:02:20.090> over<00:02:20.300> there<00:02:20.510> so

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
was our biggest challenge over there so

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.050 
was our biggest challenge over there so
we<00:02:21.560> gated<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:22.190> community<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:22.820> we<00:02:22.850> can

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
we gated this community so we can

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.820 
we gated this community so we can
attract<00:02:23.420> our<00:02:23.570> B<00:02:23.840> tenants<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.440> they<00:02:24.560> wouldn't

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
attract our B tenants and they wouldn't

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.410 
attract our B tenants and they wouldn't
they<00:02:25.100> wouldn't<00:02:25.400> fear<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.030> other<00:02:26.180> side

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
they wouldn't fear the other side

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.910 
they wouldn't fear the other side
because<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.840> was<00:02:26.960> a<00:02:27.020> reputation<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.620> we<00:02:27.770> had

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
because it was a reputation that we had

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.910 
because it was a reputation that we had
to<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:29.270> we<00:02:29.390> had<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.570> get<00:02:29.690> over<00:02:29.720> as<00:02:29.990> well<00:02:30.200> but

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
to that we had to get over as well but

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.320 
to that we had to get over as well but
not<00:02:31.100> anymore<00:02:31.340> because<00:02:31.640> we've<00:02:31.970> got<00:02:32.120> that

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
not anymore because we've got that

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.710 
not anymore because we've got that
property<00:02:32.690> filled<00:02:32.900> with<00:02:33.050> good<00:02:33.260> tenants<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.480> but

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
property filled with good tenants so but

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.640 
property filled with good tenants so but
we<00:02:35.840> gated<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.470> we<00:02:37.160> painted<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.650> much

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
we gated this we painted this a much

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.140 
we gated this we painted this a much
different<00:02:39.890> color<00:02:40.190> than<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.490> other<00:02:40.640> side<00:02:40.880> so

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
different color than the other side so

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.250 
different color than the other side so
it<00:02:41.240> shows<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.630> there<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.140> is

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
it shows that there it that it is

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.200 
it shows that there it that it is
separated<00:02:42.440> we<00:02:43.160> separated<00:02:43.670> with<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.210> city<00:02:44.480> and

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
separated we separated with the city and

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.460 
separated we separated with the city and
we<00:02:47.210> basically<00:02:47.330> upgraded<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.080> tenant<00:02:48.380> base

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
we basically upgraded the tenant base

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.770 
we basically upgraded the tenant base
here<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.220> that's<00:02:50.180> one<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.540> strategies

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
here and that's one of the strategies

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.070 
here and that's one of the strategies
what<00:02:51.140> our<00:02:51.350> extra<00:02:51.680> strategy<00:02:52.270> was<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.300> come<00:02:53.900> in

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
what our extra strategy was to come in

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.330 
what our extra strategy was to come in
originally<00:02:54.590> was<00:02:54.800> when<00:02:54.980> we<00:02:55.070> bought<00:02:55.220> the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
originally was when we bought the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.460 
originally was when we bought the
property

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
property

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.110 
property
take<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.710> c-<00:02:57.190> proper<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.640> bring<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:57.880> up<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.060> a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
take a c- proper to bring it up to a

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.390 
take a c- proper to bring it up to a
c-plus<00:02:58.800> reposition<00:02:59.800> it<00:02:59.920> put<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.130> back<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:00.340> the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
c-plus reposition it put it back in the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.740 
c-plus reposition it put it back in the
marketplace<00:03:00.790> make<00:03:01.210> a<00:03:01.240> boatload<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.600> money

marketplace make a boatload of money

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.380 
marketplace make a boatload of money
then<00:03:02.470> after<00:03:02.830> taking<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.250> look<00:03:03.430> at<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.820> you<00:03:04.270> know

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
then after taking a look at it you know

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.330 
then after taking a look at it you know
things<00:03:05.170> change<00:03:05.260> everything<00:03:06.100> not<00:03:06.310> everything

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
things change everything not everything

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.800 
things change everything not everything
is<00:03:06.640> black<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.820> white<00:03:07.030> in<00:03:07.180> this<00:03:07.240> business<00:03:07.600> and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
is black and white in this business and

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.240 
is black and white in this business and
we<00:03:08.290> realize<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.680> we<00:03:09.070> could<00:03:09.220> actually

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
we realize that we could actually

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.640 
we realize that we could actually
separate<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.000> two<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:10.630> that<00:03:11.050> side<00:03:11.410> we're

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
separate the two and that side we're

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.230 
separate the two and that side we're
actually<00:03:11.800> going<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.160> sell<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.370> earlier<00:03:12.850> give

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
actually going to sell it earlier give

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.580 
actually going to sell it earlier give
our<00:03:13.480> investors<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.930> bunch<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.290> their<00:03:14.440> money

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
our investors a bunch of their money

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.740 
our investors a bunch of their money
back<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:15.550> then<00:03:15.610> possibly<00:03:15.940> hold<00:03:16.330> on<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.660> this

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
back and then possibly hold on to this

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.390 
back and then possibly hold on to this
one<00:03:16.930> long<00:03:17.110> term<00:03:17.350> maybe<00:03:17.590> three<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:17.890> five<00:03:18.100> years

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
one long term maybe three to five years

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.880 
one long term maybe three to five years
so<00:03:19.270> that<00:03:19.780> was<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.050> whole<00:03:20.200> idea<00:03:20.230> behind<00:03:20.620> this

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
so that was the whole idea behind this

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.500 
so that was the whole idea behind this
particular<00:03:21.190> purchase<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.910> that's<00:03:22.090> another

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
particular purchase and that's another

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.810 
particular purchase and that's another
issue<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.230> route<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.310> 7000<00:03:25.030> scenic
