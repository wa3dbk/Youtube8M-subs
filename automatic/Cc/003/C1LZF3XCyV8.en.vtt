ruckus now features that same skull core
now<00:00:55.080> with<00:00:55.260> fangs<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.830> handy<00:00:56.160> little<00:00:56.309> pin<00:00:56.550> in

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
now with fangs and a handy little pin in

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
now with fangs and a handy little pin in
his<00:00:56.790> forehead<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.450> the<00:00:57.960> other<00:00:58.170> nightmare

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
his forehead as the other nightmare

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.640 
his forehead as the other nightmare
series<00:00:59.250> but<00:00:59.790> it<00:00:59.880> has<00:01:00.060> the<00:01:00.270> new<00:01:00.480> class<00:01:00.990> 8f

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
series but it has the new class 8f

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.980 
series but it has the new class 8f
reactive<00:01:02.520> cover<00:01:02.730> suck<00:01:03.060> which<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.810> of<00:01:03.900> an

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
reactive cover suck which is a bit of an

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.630 
reactive cover suck which is a bit of an
improvement<00:01:04.380> on<00:01:04.800> the<00:01:05.009> brutal<00:01:05.309> nightmare

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
improvement on the brutal nightmare

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.830 
improvement on the brutal nightmare
cover<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:06.780> else<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.140> new<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.250> has<00:01:08.400> a

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
cover so what else is new in it it has a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.590 
cover so what else is new in it it has a
medium<00:01:09.840> RG<00:01:10.650> asymmetric<00:01:11.430> core<00:01:11.670> which<00:01:12.149> means<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
medium RG asymmetric core which means it

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600 
medium RG asymmetric core which means it
doesn't<00:01:12.990> quite<00:01:13.200> dig<00:01:13.440> in<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.860> early<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
doesn't quite dig in as early as the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.510 
doesn't quite dig in as early as the
other<00:01:15.020> nightmare<00:01:16.020> line<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.590> has<00:01:16.649> a<00:01:16.830> high

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
other nightmare line it has a high

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.920 
other nightmare line it has a high
differential<00:01:18.180> which<00:01:18.300> means<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.630> got<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> high

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
differential which means it's got a high

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.570 
differential which means it's got a high
flare<00:01:19.170> potential<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.070> has<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> low

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
flare potential and that has a low

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.639 
flare potential and that has a low
intermediate<00:01:21.259> differential<00:01:22.259> which<00:01:22.410> means

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
intermediate differential which means

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.219 
intermediate differential which means
that<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:24.030> bit<00:01:24.149> slower<00:01:24.570> response

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
that it's a little bit slower response

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.139 
that it's a little bit slower response
to<00:01:25.410> friction<00:01:25.800> so<00:01:26.369> why<00:01:26.490> don't<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.640> take<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.970> down

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
to friction so why don't we take it down

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.060 
to friction so why don't we take it down
to<00:01:27.450> how<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:27.899> had<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.200> drilled<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.830> how<00:01:28.950> it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
to how we had it drilled and how it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.830 
to how we had it drilled and how it
looked<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> lanes<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.450> how<00:01:30.660> it

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
looked on the lanes so we can see how it

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.910 
looked on the lanes so we can see how it
stacked<00:01:31.110> up

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.940 

you

plays<00:02:05.520> much<00:02:05.759> farther<00:02:06.030> he's<00:02:06.390> usually<00:02:06.659> playing

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
plays much farther he's usually playing

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.859 
plays much farther he's usually playing
downtown<00:02:07.860> or<00:02:08.039> down<00:02:08.190> 15<00:02:08.849> he's<00:02:09.509> had<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.750> move

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
downtown or down 15 he's had to move

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.380 
downtown or down 15 he's had to move
into<00:02:10.080> control<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.799> power<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.549> ball<00:02:11.879> yeah

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
into control the power of this ball yeah

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.319 
into control the power of this ball yeah
it's<00:02:12.629> very<00:02:13.500> strong<00:02:14.480> smooth<00:02:15.480> reaction<00:02:17.090> now<00:02:18.090> one

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
it's very strong smooth reaction now one

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.000 
it's very strong smooth reaction now one
thing<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:18.780> often<00:02:19.019> gets<00:02:19.380> lost<00:02:19.560> when<00:02:19.799> you<00:02:19.860> move

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
thing that often gets lost when you move

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.559 
thing that often gets lost when you move
in<00:02:20.130> with<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> strong<00:02:20.579> ball<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.360> it'll

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
in with a strong ball like this is it'll

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.120 
in with a strong ball like this is it'll
over<00:02:21.900> hook<00:02:22.079> as<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.349> goes<00:02:22.500> through<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.769> pocket

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
over hook as it goes through the pocket

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.940 
over hook as it goes through the pocket
and<00:02:23.220> start<00:02:23.310> leaving<00:02:23.670> some<00:02:23.849> 9<00:02:24.060> pins<00:02:24.390> or<00:02:25.170> slapped

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
and start leaving some 9 pins or slapped

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.850 
and start leaving some 9 pins or slapped
ends<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:27.269> this<00:02:27.720> ball<00:02:27.959> is<00:02:27.989> still<00:02:28.319> continuing

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
ends and this ball is still continuing

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.500 
ends and this ball is still continuing
through<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.250> pins<00:02:29.489> really<00:02:29.819> nicely<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.390> them

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
through the pins really nicely for them

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.110 
through the pins really nicely for them
makes<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.650> move<00:02:31.829> and<00:02:32.099> then<00:02:32.340> bang

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
makes the move and then bang

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.199 
makes the move and then bang
there<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.930> very<00:02:34.470> good<00:02:35.190> pin<00:02:35.400> reaction<00:02:35.579> keeping

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
there is very good pin reaction keeping

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.400 
there is very good pin reaction keeping
everything<00:02:36.450> low<00:02:36.780> which<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:39.019> not<00:02:40.019> well

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
everything low which I like not well

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.319 
everything low which I like not well
yeah<00:02:40.799> it's<00:02:41.040> not<00:02:41.130> super<00:02:41.640> angular<00:02:42.030> off<00:02:42.209> the

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
yeah it's not super angular off the

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.509 
yeah it's not super angular off the
breakpoint<00:02:42.840> which<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.170> nice<00:02:43.349> it's<00:02:44.010> making<00:02:44.400> its

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
breakpoint which is nice it's making its

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:52.100 
breakpoint which is nice it's making its
move<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.030> then<00:02:45.150> just<00:02:45.360> arcing<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.870> yeah

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
second arrow very nice controlled arc

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.580 
second arrow very nice controlled arc
this<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.210> more<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.600> his<00:03:12.870> style<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.380> ball
