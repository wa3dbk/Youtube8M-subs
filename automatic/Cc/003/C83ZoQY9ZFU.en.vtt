00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 here 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.690
 with the last fm2 presented 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.690
 recently and in the absence of 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.730
 update in the fx range just like 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.080
 already announced at the beginning this March there 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.730
 media presents its last batch of 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.330
 processors for the new platform to 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.510
 m1 have been a total of four models 2 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.520
 semprúm and two will go there for the month of 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.529
 March advanced prices that would be around 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.510
 the 60 euros the set formed by 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.100
 motherboard and processor this without 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.960
 specify what the models would be 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.199
 chosen and the characteristics of the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.430
 same way recently from a non - md 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.440
 the four models were delivered 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.210
 of the processor that we have analyzed and 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.720
 together with them we got the 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.739
 associate 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:56.750
 mini tx format amv 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:58.550
 138 50 and 26 50 and athlon 51 50 and 53 50 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.269
 are the names that have received these 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.269
 new processors 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.990
 here you can see all your 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.010
 specifications we see as denominator 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.050
 common happening 25-watt fish tank are 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.820
 to highlight its integrated graphics the 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.260
 which will allow us in all cases 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.840
 run content in high definition 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.250
 in a fluid way and even small 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.250
 games in the high-end athlon 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.260
 this is the testing environment that we have 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 used to test the performance of 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.090
 these equipment 1600 memory 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.040
 megahercios a kingston ssd or a 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.680
 core source is made up in the bank of 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.659
 test used comment that we know that the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.979
 used power supply is more than 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.630
 enough to get a correct 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.310
 operation but many of you 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.360
 you already know that in which we use so 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.930
 usual in our tests of 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.930
 components 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.740
 the certain thing is that the obtained yield 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.479
 is what has surprised us and has been 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.330
 much more satisfactory than expected 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.100
 even in the small always a 26 50 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.850
 content in high definition with 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.500
 movies in mkv format web browsing 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.180
 Firmat tasks and similar cases do not 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.720
 will pose no problem of execution in 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.720
 these teams 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.300
 these are results that the three 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.580
 synthetic fish of sea eight and three of 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.110
 sea ​​have thrown us a performance 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.180
 remarkable for the purpose that they have been 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.310
 created these teams take into account 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.870
 that his two hundred euros are converted 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.720
 at a more than attractive price if 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.160
 we look for a pc to consult the mail 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.500
 navigation playback of movies in 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.930
 high definition or similar 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.550
 that yes you must take into account that they have not 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.680
 been created to play the most games 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.290
 current but we can run 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.810
 retro titles or whose requirements are 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.459
 limited 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.590
 the temperatures have also been 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.360
 really low if we consider the 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.850
 dimensions of the heatsink that incorporates 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.380
 the latter was expected very noisy but 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.700
 The truth is that it has turned out to be more 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.440
 Silent than we expected 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.090
 a very interesting platform 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.530
 especially for aspects like its low 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.480
 consumption with the consequent savings 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.950
 energetic the possibility of 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.720
 update because they have not 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.280
 opted for the use of soc and have 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.890
 bet to include the processor by 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.200
 separated a really adjusted price of 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.120
 the whole or a small size 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.430
 that allows us to place it behind 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.640
 from a monitor a television or the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.500
 device that we choose 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.970
 if there is a med it is the protagonist in a crowd 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.190
 of occasions for having a high 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.459
 consumption in your hardware as is the case 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.530
 of the r 92 90 x the fx processors of 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.450
 more high- end on this occasion have 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.690
 bet for a low consumption for this 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.580
 that m1 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.560
 in addition to this they have created a platform 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.570
 that will bring the PC closer to all 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.940
 public thanks to the low cost that 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.860
 will have the whole set we leave you 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.240
 links in the description so you can see 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.810
 the price of each of the models 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.810
 analyzed
