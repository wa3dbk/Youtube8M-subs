round left and if it's round right this
is<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.090> 5.1<00:01:49.569> system<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:51.280> sub<00:01:51.520> they<00:01:51.729> have<00:01:51.910> is

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
is a 5.1 system and the sub they have is

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.770 
is a 5.1 system and the sub they have is
their<00:01:52.929> sub<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.710> flush<00:01:53.979> mount<00:01:54.600> that's<00:01:55.600> how<00:01:55.720> you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
their sub to flush mount that's how you

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.249 
their sub to flush mount that's how you
do<00:01:55.929> it

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
do it

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.690 
do it
so<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.759> point<00:01:58.030> on<00:01:58.679> is<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.920> four<00:02:00.160> strand<00:02:00.550> by

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
so that point on is the four strand by

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.139 
so that point on is the four strand by
the<00:02:00.759> way<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.920> from<00:02:03.190> that<00:02:03.369> point<00:02:03.580> on<00:02:03.759> you<00:02:04.030> would

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
the way so from that point on you would

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.840 
the way so from that point on you would
put<00:02:04.390> this<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:05.050> you<00:02:05.280> put<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.310> in<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.700> back

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850
