their focus and their time has been

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.760 
their focus and their time has been
spent<00:01:37.640> on<00:01:37.729> that<00:01:37.969> and<00:01:38.270> not<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:39.109> worry<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.530> the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
spent on that and not the worry and the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.679 
spent on that and not the worry and the
concern<00:01:40.159> maybe<00:01:40.460> have<00:01:40.700> not<00:01:40.850> been<00:01:41.149> out<00:01:41.270> there<00:01:41.539> in

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
concern maybe have not been out there in

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.559 
concern maybe have not been out there in
the<00:01:41.780> past<00:01:42.049> so<00:01:42.850> last<00:01:43.850> year<00:01:44.119> was<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.270> great

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
the past so last year was a great

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.749 
the past so last year was a great
learning<00:01:44.749> experience<00:01:45.079> that<00:01:45.799> you<00:01:46.280> know<00:01:46.369> six

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
learning experience that you know six

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.520 
learning experience that you know six
really<00:01:47.090> core<00:01:47.539> guys<00:01:47.780> that<00:01:48.139> have<00:01:48.229> been<00:01:48.380> out

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
really core guys that have been out

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.919 
really core guys that have been out
there<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:48.829> played<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.429> been<00:01:50.299> a<00:01:50.329> part<00:01:50.630> of<00:01:50.749> last

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
there and played and been a part of last

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.080 
there and played and been a part of last
year's<00:01:51.229> group<00:01:51.469> so<00:01:51.679> I<00:01:51.740> think<00:01:52.039> experience<00:01:52.819> is

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
year's group so I think experience is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.039 
year's group so I think experience is
everything<00:01:53.270> then<00:01:54.139> I<00:01:54.259> think<00:01:55.630> being<00:01:56.630> through

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
everything then I think being through

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.429 
everything then I think being through
that<00:01:57.289> and<00:01:57.649> having<00:01:58.310> having<00:01:58.869> time<00:01:59.869> to<00:01:59.899> really

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
that and having having time to really

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.139 
that and having having time to really
