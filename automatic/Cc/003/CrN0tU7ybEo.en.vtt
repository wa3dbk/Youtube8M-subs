that great on pc you know we're not

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.740 
that great on pc you know we're not
going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> make<00:02:03.780> GTA<00:02:04.200> 5<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.920> priority<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:05.820> maybe

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
going to make GTA 5 a priority but maybe

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.430 
going to make GTA 5 a priority but maybe
if<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:06.990> made<00:02:07.110> gta4<00:02:07.890> run<00:02:08.190> better<00:02:08.670> rockstar

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440

well<00:02:14.219> known<00:02:14.489> fact<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.090> GTA<00:02:15.629> 4<00:02:16.049> was<00:02:16.349> a

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
well known fact that GTA 4 was a

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.119 
well known fact that GTA 4 was a
piss-poor<00:02:17.280> port<00:02:18.170> but<00:02:19.170> whatever<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.650> point<00:02:20.010> of
