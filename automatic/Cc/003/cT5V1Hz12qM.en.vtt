on<00:00:32.520> bricklink<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.350> end<00:00:34.500> result<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:35.070> a

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
on bricklink so the end result is a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.090

about<00:02:04.440> four<00:02:04.740> months<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.130> build<00:02:07.399> I<00:02:08.399> got<00:02:08.790> the

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
about four months to build I got the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.490 
about four months to build I got the
idea<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.210> my<00:02:09.330> mom<00:02:09.540> actually<00:02:09.810> she<00:02:10.200> said<00:02:10.470> I

idea for my mom actually she said I

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.060 
idea for my mom actually she said I
should<00:02:11.010> build<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.490> by<00:02:12.530> using<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.680> parts<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.010> my

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
should build it by using the parts of my

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.980 
should build it by using the parts of my
leghul<00:02:14.340> bin<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.670> buying<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.600> rest<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:15.960> I
