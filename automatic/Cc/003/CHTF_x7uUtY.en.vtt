00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
half real quick you look at that bench

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.860 
half real quick you look at that bench
play<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.520> was<00:00:35.730> all<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.210> bench<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.660> built

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
play it was all the bench that built

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the big lead they lost it and then

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.110
