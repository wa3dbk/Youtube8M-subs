00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.230
 sofa and legs for honey extractor 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:19.689
 removed the ring from 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:23.410
 sty honeybee straight in size 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.410
 cut it two boards 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:49.299
 crosswise cut them here so now 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:53.559
 I'll put the ends on the screws of the ships 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:53.559
 make spoons 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:13.660
 cut four legs right now 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:13.660
 screw this way 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:27.759
 so the height of the legs measured just to 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:31.399
 became a little bucket could 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:37.179
 tilt the honey prick screwed the legs 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:42.350
 And it turned out such a prefix with legs 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:51.369
 so plump is this ring with 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:51.369
 bottom of the honey extractor now go 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:03.580
 put under the honey extractor 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:10.970
 Well, I set pretty 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:15.880
 tight came here does not swing worth 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.880
 good though on four legs 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.780
 like that 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.580
 that is, you can work
