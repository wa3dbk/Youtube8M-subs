00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
that's always good to have on a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.599 
that's always good to have on a
mid-range<00:00:22.830> mid<00:00:23.670> price<00:00:24.029> range<00:00:24.390> stick<00:00:25.609> also

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
mid-range mid price range stick also

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.830 
mid-range mid price range stick also
it's<00:00:27.420> really<00:00:27.930> light<00:00:29.119> like<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.539> has<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> good

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it's really light like and it has a good

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.490 
it's really light like and it has a good
feel<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> puck<00:00:34.579> next<00:00:36.079> there's<00:00:37.079> like<00:00:37.320> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
feel for the puck next there's like a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.200 
feel for the puck next there's like a
different<00:00:38.010> type<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.190> weave<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> blade

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
different type of weave in the blade

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.060 
different type of weave in the blade
that<00:00:39.480> they'd<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.989> differently<00:00:40.620> from<00:00:40.800> other

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
that they'd have differently from other

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.670 
that they'd have differently from other
warrior<00:00:41.460> sticks<00:00:42.020> this<00:00:43.020> has<00:00:43.200> like<00:00:43.350> small

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
warrior sticks this has like small

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.590 
warrior sticks this has like small
squares<00:00:43.950> big<00:00:44.370> squares<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:45.030> rectangles

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
squares big squares and like rectangles

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.440 
squares big squares and like rectangles
the<00:00:46.500> usual<00:00:46.860> ones<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.610> checkerboard

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the usual ones just like a checkerboard

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.360 
the usual ones just like a checkerboard
pattern<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.640> see<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:52.370> don't

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
pattern so if you can see that I don't

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.750 
pattern so if you can see that I don't
know<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.670> can't<00:00:53.910> Yeah<00:00:54.300> right<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:55.760> it's

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
know if you can't Yeah right there it's

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.540 
know if you can't Yeah right there it's
not<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.230> usual<00:00:58.620> checkerboard<00:00:59.160> pattern

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
not just the usual checkerboard pattern

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.849 
not just the usual checkerboard pattern
so<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.510> changed<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.020> up<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.530> make<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.800> i

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
so they changed it up just to make it i

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.840 
so they changed it up just to make it i
guess<00:01:02.039> more<00:01:02.250> sturdy<00:01:03.470> other<00:01:04.470> than<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
guess more sturdy other than that

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.020 
guess more sturdy other than that
there's<00:01:05.850> grip<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.979> lines<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.580> grip<00:01:08.820> on

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
there's grip on like lines of grip on

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.490 
there's grip on like lines of grip on
the<00:01:10.020> back<00:01:10.260> side<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.220> bottom<00:01:11.369> side<00:01:12.500> like

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the back side and the bottom side like

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.940 
the back side and the bottom side like
these<00:01:13.770> two<00:01:13.950> sides<00:01:14.220> oh<00:01:15.259> they<00:01:16.259> did<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.740> because

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
these two sides oh they did that because

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.370 
these two sides oh they did that because
it's<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.630> when<00:01:18.630> you're<00:01:18.780> holding<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> with

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
it's like when you're holding it with

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.310 
it's like when you're holding it with
your<00:01:19.590> glove<00:01:20.509> they<00:01:21.509> don't<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:21.900> didn't<00:01:22.110> want

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
your glove they don't they didn't want

grip<00:01:22.500> all<00:01:22.740> over<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:24.509> um<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.920> sticks<00:01:26.520> really<00:01:26.820> so

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
grip all over so um it sticks really so

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.450 
grip all over so um it sticks really so
it<00:01:27.780> has<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> nice<00:01:28.400> that's<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.640> pretty<00:01:30.540> good<00:01:30.720> idea

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
it has a nice that's a pretty good idea

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.289 
it has a nice that's a pretty good idea
um<00:01:33.439> there's<00:01:34.439> also<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.920> taper<00:01:37.369> like<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:39.030> gets

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
um there's also a taper like it gets

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.800 
um there's also a taper like it gets
smaller<00:01:39.990> as<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> go<00:01:40.650> down<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.659> see

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
smaller as you go down so if you can see

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.859 
smaller as you go down so if you can see
that<00:01:42.990> gets<00:01:43.770> smaller<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.670> thinner<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:46.040> I<00:01:47.869> have
