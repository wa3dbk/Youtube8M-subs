00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
to dress I think because I grew up

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.020 
to dress I think because I grew up
wearing<00:01:02.900> a<00:01:03.230> uniform<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:04.010> blazers<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.850> that

wearing a uniform and blazers and that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.400 
wearing a uniform and blazers and that
kind<00:01:05.239> of<00:01:05.270> thing<00:01:05.330> but<00:01:05.540> I<00:01:05.600> always<00:01:05.840> had<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.050> twist

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
kind of thing but I always had a twist

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.280 
kind of thing but I always had a twist
to<00:01:06.619> it<00:01:06.650> like<00:01:07.040> Doc<00:01:07.910> Marten<00:01:08.330> boots<00:01:08.360> but<00:01:08.990> with<00:01:09.170> the

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
to it like Doc Marten boots but with the

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.080 
to it like Doc Marten boots but with the
little<00:01:09.530> uniform<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.130> blazer<00:01:10.340> or<00:01:10.759> you<00:01:10.970> know

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090

lots<00:01:11.270> of<00:01:11.479> bracelets<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:12.710> I<00:01:12.740> think<00:01:12.860> I<00:01:13.130> grew

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
lots of bracelets and so I think I grew

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.940 
lots of bracelets and so I think I grew
up<00:01:14.080> always<00:01:15.550> starting<00:01:16.550> from<00:01:16.729> a<00:01:16.820> preppy<00:01:17.270> kind<00:01:17.720> of

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
up always starting from a preppy kind of

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.280 
up always starting from a preppy kind of
aesthetic<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.310> then<00:01:19.520> making<00:01:20.330> my<00:01:20.630> own<00:01:20.660> twist

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
aesthetic and then making my own twist

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.930 
aesthetic and then making my own twist
on<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:21.890> that's<00:01:22.160> what<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:22.399> think<00:01:22.729> modern
