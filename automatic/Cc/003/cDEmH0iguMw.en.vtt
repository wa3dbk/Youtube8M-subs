today we are going to create a simple

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.190 
today we are going to create a simple
game<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.680> test<00:00:08.069> your<00:00:08.309> memory<00:00:08.520> in<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.900> project

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
game to test your memory in this project

game to test your memory in this project
I'll<00:00:10.559> be<00:00:10.710> using<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.160> teensy<00:00:11.580> board<00:00:11.790> if<00:00:12.510> you<00:00:12.690> want

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
I'll be using a teensy board if you want

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.540 
I'll be using a teensy board if you want
to<00:00:12.990> know<00:00:13.170> more<00:00:13.440> about<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.889> board<00:00:14.160> make<00:00:14.370> sure

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550 
to know more about this board make sure

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.339
