00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
okay once you have that part done we

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.519 
okay once you have that part done we
want<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.760> go<00:00:02.879> ahead<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:03.240> take<00:00:03.990> out<00:00:04.200> all<00:00:04.380> the

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
want to go ahead and take out all the

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.880 
want to go ahead and take out all the
pins<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:06.140> then<00:00:07.140> we're<00:00:07.290> going<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.440> make<00:00:07.620> sure

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
pins and then we're going to make sure

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.970 
pins and then we're going to make sure
that<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.580> came<00:00:08.849> out<00:00:09.000> before<00:00:09.480> we<00:00:09.690> do<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:09.980> it's

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
that it came out before we do that it's

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.890 
that it came out before we do that it's
a<00:00:11.010> good<00:00:11.130> idea<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.429> trim<00:00:11.759> your<00:00:11.790> corners<00:00:12.269> just<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
a good idea to trim your corners just a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.079 
a good idea to trim your corners just a
little<00:00:13.049> bit<00:00:13.290> because<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.400> corners<00:00:14.700> will<00:00:14.880> fill

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
little bit because the corners will fill

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.870 
little bit because the corners will fill
out<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.240> little<00:00:15.480> better<00:00:15.690> than<00:00:16.850> generally<00:00:17.850> I

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
out a little better than generally I

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.250 
out a little better than generally I
don't<00:00:18.060> worry<00:00:18.240> about<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.720> other<00:00:18.750> parts

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
don't worry about the other parts

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.790 
don't worry about the other parts
usually<00:00:19.710> do<00:00:20.250> just<00:00:20.520> fine<00:00:21.350> and<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.529> want<00:00:22.710> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
usually do just fine and you want to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.130 
usually do just fine and you want to
turn<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.130> inside<00:00:23.519> out<00:00:25.130> and<00:00:26.720> make<00:00:27.720> sure<00:00:27.750> all

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
turn it inside out and make sure all

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.570 
turn it inside out and make sure all
your<00:00:28.320> straps<00:00:28.769> are<00:00:29.099> where<00:00:29.369> they're<00:00:29.519> supposed

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
your straps are where they're supposed

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.299 
your straps are where they're supposed
to<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.090> make<00:00:30.359> sure<00:00:30.539> they're<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:30.840> caught<00:00:31.309> and

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
to be make sure they're not caught and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.780 
to be make sure they're not caught and
anything<00:00:32.669> else<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:35.070> then<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.309> are<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.460> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
anything else and then we are going to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.720 
anything else and then we are going to
iron<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.620> after<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.649> make<00:00:37.860> sure<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.070> pull<00:00:38.430> all<00:00:38.579> the

even and then you iron this part flat
and<00:02:01.469> when<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.710> stitch<00:02:01.979> around<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.340> edges<00:02:02.490> you

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
and when we stitch around the edges you

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.920 
and when we stitch around the edges you
would<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:02.969> stitch<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.479> too<00:02:03.689> i<00:02:03.719> would
