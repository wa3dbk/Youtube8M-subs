00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.490 

basically<00:00:05.970> there<00:00:06.240> are<00:00:06.269> two<00:00:06.450> types<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.960> muscle

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
basically there are two types of muscle

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.029 
basically there are two types of muscle
fibers<00:00:07.859> slow<00:00:08.309> twitch<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.820> fast<00:00:09.480> which<00:00:10.049> slow

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:11.039 
fibers slow twitch and fast which slow

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:12.830 
fibers slow twitch and fast which slow
twitch<00:00:11.280> fibers<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:11.940> used<00:00:12.240> when<00:00:12.600> the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
twitch fibers are used when the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.689 
twitch fibers are used when the
intensity<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.650> what<00:00:13.859> you<00:00:13.980> were<00:00:14.070> doing<00:00:14.369> is<00:00:14.490> low

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:14.699 
intensity of what you were doing is low

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.509 
intensity of what you were doing is low
like<00:00:15.180> for<00:00:15.570> example<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.350> jogging<00:00:16.740> or<00:00:17.039> when<00:00:17.400> you

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:17.519 
like for example in jogging or when you

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.509 
like for example in jogging or when you
are<00:00:17.640> able<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.060> lift<00:00:18.750> weight<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:19.680> more<00:00:20.070> than<00:00:20.220> 20

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:20.519 
are able to lift weight for more than 20

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.189 
are able to lift weight for more than 20
repetitions<00:00:20.820> when<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.449> do<00:00:21.570> an<00:00:21.689> exercise

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
repetitions when you do an exercise

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.009 
repetitions when you do an exercise
while<00:00:23.099> fast<00:00:23.609> twitch<00:00:23.849> fibers<00:00:24.269> are<00:00:24.419> used<00:00:24.449> when

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
while fast twitch fibers are used when

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.399 
while fast twitch fibers are used when
the<00:00:25.230> intensity<00:00:25.829> is<00:00:26.039> high<00:00:26.249> for<00:00:27.060> example<00:00:27.409> when

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:28.409 
the intensity is high for example when

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:30.559 
the intensity is high for example when
you<00:00:28.560> do<00:00:28.679> heavy<00:00:28.890> bench<00:00:29.220> pressing<00:00:29.730> or<00:00:29.909> try<00:00:30.509> to

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:30.569 
you do heavy bench pressing or try to

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:34.819 
you do heavy bench pressing or try to
jump<00:00:31.050> up<00:00:31.259> to<00:00:31.499> the<00:00:31.589> basket<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.540> basketball<00:00:33.829> in

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
jump up to the basket in basketball in

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.670 
jump up to the basket in basketball in
summary<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.970> can<00:00:36.000> put<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.600> together<00:00:37.200> like

fast<00:01:09.720> twitch<00:01:09.990> fibers<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:11.369> there<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.610> two

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
fast twitch fibers but there are two

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.020 
fast twitch fibers but there are two
more<00:01:11.940> differences<00:01:12.540> between<00:01:12.960> two<00:01:13.649> of<00:01:13.799> them<00:01:14.030> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
more differences between two of them the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.740 
more differences between two of them the
first<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:16.250> fast<00:01:17.250> twitch<00:01:17.550> fibers<00:01:18.000> use<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
first is that fast twitch fibers use a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.520 
first is that fast twitch fibers use a
lot<00:01:19.050> of<00:01:19.259> fuel<00:01:19.590> at<00:01:19.920> once<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.690> your<00:01:21.690> body<00:01:21.929> can't

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
lot of fuel at once and your body can't

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.310 
lot of fuel at once and your body can't
keep<00:01:22.890> delivering<00:01:23.610> enough<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.539> fuel<00:01:25.050> on

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
keep delivering enough of that fuel on

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.550 
keep delivering enough of that fuel on
time<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.429> keep<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.910> muscle<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.380> is

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
time to keep that muscle going this is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.399 
time to keep that muscle going this is
what<00:01:28.710> happens<00:01:29.130> when<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.820> use<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.390> weight<00:01:31.020> where

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
what happens when you use a weight where

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.800 
what happens when you use a weight where
you<00:01:31.590> go<00:01:31.800> to<00:01:31.860> failure<00:01:32.220> after<00:01:32.970> doing<00:01:33.300> ten

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you go to failure after doing ten

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.130 
you go to failure after doing ten
repetitions<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:35.490> movement<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:37.020> other

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
repetitions of a movement the other

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.469 
repetitions of a movement the other
difference<00:01:37.649> is<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:38.700> other<00:01:38.789> difference<00:01:39.270> is

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
difference is the other difference is

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.999 
difference is the other difference is
that<00:01:40.819> fast<00:01:41.819> twitch<00:01:42.090> fibers<00:01:42.569> as<00:01:42.750> those<00:01:43.319> that

that fast twitch fibers as those that

make you bulky slow twitch fibers don't

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.479 
make you bulky slow twitch fibers don't

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:50.489 
need to grow very much to go longer but

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:52.880 
need to grow very much to go longer but
fast<00:01:50.880> twitch<00:01:51.179> fibers<00:01:51.630> are<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.989> ones<00:01:52.200> that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
fast twitch fibers are the ones that

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.460 
fast twitch fibers are the ones that
make<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.340> look<00:01:53.759> bigger<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.420> they<00:01:55.200> need

the last interesting question of courses
if<00:02:06.830> you<00:02:07.190> can<00:02:07.370> influence<00:02:07.700> how<00:02:08.149> much<00:02:08.450> of<00:02:08.630> each

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
if you can influence how much of each

if you can influence how much of each
type<00:02:09.050> of<00:02:09.080> muscle<00:02:09.560> fiber<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:10.220> have<00:02:10.460> for

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
type of muscle fiber you have for

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.790 
type of muscle fiber you have for
example<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.930> bodybuilder<00:02:12.500> would<00:02:12.650> be

example a bodybuilder would be

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.740 
example a bodybuilder would be
interested<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.550> having<00:02:13.700> more<00:02:14.030> fast<00:02:14.510> twitch

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
interested in having more fast twitch

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.870 
interested in having more fast twitch
fibers<00:02:15.200> because<00:02:15.650> those<00:02:16.130> are<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.400> ones<00:02:16.670> that

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
fibers because those are the ones that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.390
