charges the play touch so you can

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.260 
charges the play touch so you can
actually<00:00:59.290> charge<00:00:59.739> it<00:00:59.980> off<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.280> computer<00:01:00.790> as

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
actually charge it off the computer as

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.160 
actually charge it off the computer as
far<00:01:01.570> as<00:01:01.870> this<00:01:02.200> little<00:01:02.470> socket<00:01:02.800> is<00:01:03.040> concerned

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
far as this little socket is concerned

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.050 
far as this little socket is concerned
you<00:01:05.170> get<00:01:05.470> this<00:01:05.770> plug<00:01:06.189> with<00:01:06.820> it<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:08.670> also<00:01:09.670> on

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
you get this plug with it and also on

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.649 
you get this plug with it and also on
the<00:01:11.670> plug<00:01:12.670> there<00:01:13.360> is<00:01:13.570> this<00:01:13.750> little<00:01:14.020> sticker

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the plug there is this little sticker

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.560 
the plug there is this little sticker
which<00:01:16.659> shows<00:01:17.080> you<00:01:17.470> that<00:01:17.710> you<00:01:17.920> are<00:01:18.310> not<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:19.270> plug

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
which shows you that you are not to plug

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.860 
which shows you that you are not to plug
this<00:01:20.170> lead<00:01:20.590> in<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.760> play<00:01:21.970> touch<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.630> then

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
this lead in to the play touch and then

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.800 
this lead in to the play touch and then
into<00:01:23.110> your<00:01:23.260> computer<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:25.150> what<00:01:25.299> it<00:01:25.390> actually

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
into your computer but what it actually

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.890 
into your computer but what it actually
shows<00:01:26.080> you<00:01:26.320> on<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.620> other<00:01:26.710> side<00:01:27.040> is<00:01:27.640> that<00:01:28.600> it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
shows you on the other side is that it

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.120 
shows you on the other side is that it
is<00:01:29.380> for<00:01:29.740> charging<00:01:30.340> only<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:32.320> I've<00:01:32.620> compared

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
is for charging only now I've compared

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.870 
is for charging only now I've compared
this<00:01:33.580> lead<00:01:33.909> because<00:01:34.360> it<00:01:34.450> is<00:01:34.570> very<00:01:34.810> similar<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
this lead because it is very similar to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.260 
this lead because it is very similar to
the<00:01:37.450> one<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.659> comes<00:01:38.020> with<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.229> play<00:01:38.430> sport<00:01:39.430> and

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
the one that comes with a play sport and

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.840 
the one that comes with a play sport and
I've<00:01:40.390> compared<00:01:40.840> this<00:01:41.020> lead<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:42.400> play

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
I've compared this lead to the play

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.539 
I've compared this lead to the play
sports<00:01:43.210> lead<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.920> little<00:01:45.220> connector

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
sports lead and this little connector

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.410 
sports lead and this little connector
here<00:01:46.030> at<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.299> end<00:01:46.510> is<00:01:46.900> actually<00:01:47.799> smaller<00:01:48.420> than

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
here at the end is actually smaller than

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.510 
here at the end is actually smaller than
the<00:01:49.570> play<00:01:49.780> sport<00:01:50.110> so<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.530> can't<00:01:50.860> interchange

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
the play sport so you can't interchange

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.210 
the play sport so you can't interchange
them<00:01:51.729> so<00:01:52.450> obviously<00:01:52.630> Kodak<00:01:53.500> has<00:01:53.710> made<00:01:53.950> this

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
them so obviously Kodak has made this

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.170 
them so obviously Kodak has made this
lead<00:01:55.200> specifically<00:01:56.200> for<00:01:56.890> charging<00:01:57.549> only

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
lead specifically for charging only

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.280 
lead specifically for charging only
right<00:01:58.810> so<00:01:59.680> I<00:02:00.150> might<00:02:01.150> have<00:02:01.180> to<00:02:01.330> move<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.080> camera

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
right so I might have to move the camera

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.070 
right so I might have to move the camera
for<00:02:02.619> this<00:02:02.710> next<00:02:03.040> bit<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:04.450> right<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:04.900> as<00:02:04.990> you

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
for this next bit all right so as you

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.429 
for this next bit all right so as you
can<00:02:05.259> see<00:02:05.320> there<00:02:05.920> is<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.790> plug<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.420> here<00:02:08.170> is

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:08.439 
can see there is the plug and here is

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:14.269 
can see there is the plug and here is
the<00:02:09.090> lead<00:02:10.799> here<00:02:11.799> is<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.400> code<00:02:12.610> at<00:02:12.790> play<00:02:13.060> touch

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:14.279 
the lead here is the code at play touch

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:19.280 
the lead here is the code at play touch
now<00:02:15.279> what<00:02:15.549> we<00:02:15.669> do<00:02:15.879> is<00:02:16.329> we<00:02:16.900> stick<00:02:17.499> this

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
now what we do is we stick this

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.840 
now what we do is we stick this
into<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:22.120> play<00:02:22.360> touch<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:24.310> as<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.610> can<00:02:24.790> see

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
into the play touch and as you can see

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.890 
into the play touch and as you can see
by<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.660> flashing<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.980> means<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.760> is

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
by that flashing it means that it is

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.450 
by that flashing it means that it is
charging<00:02:28.900> now<00:02:29.670> turn<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.850> on<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:32.250> there<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.370> is

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
charging now turn it on and there it is

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.320 
charging now turn it on and there it is
turned<00:02:33.910> on<00:02:34.590> now<00:02:35.590> what<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:35.830> do<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.400> take<00:02:36.940> this

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
turned on now what I do is take this

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.010 
turned on now what I do is take this
back<00:02:37.690> bit<00:02:37.960> off<00:02:38.940> take<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.150> battery<00:02:40.510> out<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:43.020> it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
back bit off take the battery out and it

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
back bit off take the battery out and it
is<00:02:44.260> still<00:02:44.710> on<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.810> let's<00:02:47.410> try<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:47.800> bit<00:02:48.010> of

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
is still on so let's try a bit of

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.310 
is still on so let's try a bit of
recording<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:50.320> there<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.710> am<00:02:50.830> recording<00:02:52.320> the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
recording so there I am recording the

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.120 
recording so there I am recording the
floor

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
floor

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.150 
floor
get<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.120> battery<00:02:56.430> stick<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.520> battery<00:02:57.910> in

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
get the battery stick the battery in

the<00:03:17.680> battery<00:03:18.150> inside<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.740> would<00:03:21.370> imagine

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
the battery inside so I would imagine

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:29.420 
the battery inside so I would imagine
that<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.950> external<00:03:25.860> battery<00:03:26.860> pack<00:03:27.310> that

that the external battery pack that
fishy<00:03:30.430> comics<00:03:30.940> was<00:03:31.630> showing<00:03:31.990> you<00:03:32.760> would

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
fishy comics was showing you would

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.060 
fishy comics was showing you would
actually<00:03:34.180> work<00:03:34.870> with<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.590> code<00:03:35.770> at<00:03:35.890> play

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
actually work with the code at play

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.970 
actually work with the code at play
touch<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.610> I<00:03:37.180> would<00:03:37.690> by<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.350> looks<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.770> it<00:03:38.920> it

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
touch I I would by the looks of it it

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.970 
touch I I would by the looks of it it
looks<00:03:39.160> like<00:03:39.490> it<00:03:39.640> would<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.620> that's<00:03:41.620> my<00:03:41.770> little

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
looks like it would so that's my little

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.280 
looks like it would so that's my little
test<00:03:42.280> now<00:03:42.790> at<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.810> other<00:03:43.959> end<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.590> this<00:03:45.430> plug

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
test now at the other end of this plug

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.520 
test now at the other end of this plug
is<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.350> USB<00:03:47.800> lead<00:03:48.420> now<00:03:49.420> I<00:03:49.450> would<00:03:49.690> imagine<00:03:49.810> by

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
is a USB lead now I would imagine by

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.720 
is a USB lead now I would imagine by
what<00:03:50.830> I've<00:03:50.920> seen<00:03:50.980> all<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:51.700> fishy<00:03:51.910> comics<00:03:52.560> video

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
what I've seen all of fishy comics video

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.310 
what I've seen all of fishy comics video
that<00:03:54.730> if<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.360> can

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
that if you can

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.050 
that if you can
I<00:03:56.380> think<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.790> zi8<00:03:58.530> plug<00:03:59.530> has<00:03:59.890> got<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.310> USB<00:04:00.640> at

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
I think the zi8 plug has got a USB at

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.479 
I think the zi8 plug has got a USB at
the<00:04:01.150> end<00:04:01.330> of<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.570> so<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:02.470> would<00:04:02.800> imagine<00:04:02.920> that

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
the end of it so I would imagine that

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.670 
the end of it so I would imagine that
you'd<00:04:03.670> be<00:04:03.880> able<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.090> stick<00:04:04.420> that<00:04:04.690> into<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
you'd be able to stick that into the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.430 
you'd be able to stick that into the
external<00:04:06.310> power<00:04:06.520> pack<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.170> connect<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.320> up<00:04:08.380> to

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
external power pack and connect it up to

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.979 
external power pack and connect it up to
the<00:04:08.620> plate<00:04:08.890> arch<00:04:09.190> in<00:04:09.580> the<00:04:09.790> same<00:04:10.030> way<00:04:10.270> as

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
the plate arch in the same way as

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.210 
the plate arch in the same way as
fishing<00:04:11.410> comics<00:04:11.739> has<00:04:11.980> done<00:04:12.340> with<00:04:13.150> his<00:04:13.270> EIA<00:04:14.220> so

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
fishing comics has done with his EIA so

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.479 
fishing comics has done with his EIA so

yet because I've got most of my charge
by<00:05:01.810> using<00:05:02.290> this<00:05:03.120> then<00:05:04.120> you've<00:05:04.450> got<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:04.870> little

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
by using this then you've got the little

USB thing there which you can connect to
the<00:05:08.890> mains<00:05:09.160> but<00:05:09.550> again<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.240> would<00:05:10.480> say<00:05:10.750> like<00:05:11.470> the

up<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:13.930> your<00:05:14.200> computer<00:05:15.000> so<00:05:16.000> there<00:05:16.270> you<00:05:16.360> go<00:05:16.510> that

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
up to your computer so there you go that

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.080 
up to your computer so there you go that
is<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.230> two<00:05:17.590> ways<00:05:17.770> that<00:05:17.830> you<00:05:18.130> can<00:05:18.220> charge<00:05:18.700> the

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
play touch from what I've seen is very

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.140 
play touch from what I've seen is very
similar<00:05:22.510> to<00:05:22.890> what<00:05:23.890> fishy<00:05:24.280> comics<00:05:24.700> has<00:05:24.880> said
