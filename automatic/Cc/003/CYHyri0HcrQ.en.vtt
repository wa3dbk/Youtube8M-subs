is the back of the seat rail is right up

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.700 
is the back of the seat rail is right up
against<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.350> thing<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.390> about<00:00:37.020> exactly

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
against the thing and it's about exactly

level<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> seat<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.540> that's<00:00:39.660> pretty

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
level with the seat so that's pretty

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.190 
level with the seat so that's pretty
nice<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:41.160> got<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> coin<00:00:41.820> sorting<00:00:42.809> thing<00:00:43.050> that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
nice it's got a coin sorting thing that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.990 
nice it's got a coin sorting thing that
I'm<00:00:43.260> actually<00:00:43.440> using<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.690> I<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.960> ordered<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
I'm actually using and I just ordered a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.569 
I'm actually using and I just ordered a
CD<00:00:48.000> player<00:00:48.030> mouth<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:49.050> should<00:00:49.230> go<00:00:49.579> under

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
CD player mouth that should go under

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.529 
CD player mouth that should go under
here<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.660> place<00:00:51.960> those<00:00:52.260> clamps<00:00:53.329> so<00:00:54.329> it'll<00:00:54.510> look

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
here in place those clamps so it'll look

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.760 
here in place those clamps so it'll look
better<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.800> it'll<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.579> still<00:00:57.390> hidden

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
better and it'll be still hidden

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.430 
better and it'll be still hidden
somewhat<00:00:58.820> back<00:00:59.820> there<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.690> will<00:01:01.199> probably

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
somewhat back there so it will probably

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.850 
somewhat back there so it will probably
be<00:01:01.620> less<00:01:01.829> visible<00:01:02.370> than<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.359> was<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:04.439> you

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
be less visible than if it was there you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.780 
be less visible than if it was there you
know<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.280> um<00:01:08.900> mm-hmm<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:11.400> gas<00:01:11.850> leak<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.600> gone

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
know and um mm-hmm the gas leak is gone

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.249 
know and um mm-hmm the gas leak is gone
and<00:01:14.790> let<00:01:14.909> started<00:01:15.330> leaking<00:01:15.509> again<00:01:15.840> I'm<00:01:16.140> gonna

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
and let started leaking again I'm gonna

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.660 
and let started leaking again I'm gonna
have<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> check<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.100> my<00:01:17.400> fuel<00:01:17.759> gauge<00:01:17.790> is

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
have to check because my fuel gauge is

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:28.399 
have to check because my fuel gauge is
now<00:01:20.670> down<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:26.630> marys<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.840> because<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> car

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
now down to marys just because the car

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.170 
now down to marys just because the car
was<00:01:28.439> turned<00:01:28.799> off<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.000> gonna

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
was turned off because now it's gonna

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.830 
was turned off because now it's gonna
back<00:01:30.329> up<00:01:30.509> toward<00:01:30.780> full<00:01:32.509> okay<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> think<00:01:33.659> that's

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
back up toward full okay I think that's

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.640 
back up toward full okay I think that's
all<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.140> was<00:01:34.200> wrong<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:35.070> i'll<00:01:35.159> check<00:01:35.369> anyway

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
all that was wrong but i'll check anyway

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.760 
all that was wrong but i'll check anyway
okay<00:01:37.650> okay<00:01:38.520> sounds<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.299> plan<00:01:39.590> let's<00:01:40.590> go
