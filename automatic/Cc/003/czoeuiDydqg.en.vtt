00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
I I did what I should have probably done

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.369 
I I did what I should have probably done
the<00:00:15.030> day<00:00:15.179> they<00:00:15.330> got<00:00:15.540> here<00:00:15.750> yesterday<00:00:15.990> which

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
the day they got here yesterday which

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.189 
the day they got here yesterday which
was<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.650> weighed<00:00:16.920> them<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:18.300> weighed<00:00:18.539> 10<00:00:18.930> out

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
was I weighed them and I weighed 10 out

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.429 
was I weighed them and I weighed 10 out
of<00:00:19.230> tub<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.340> 10<00:00:20.699> out<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.000> tub<00:00:21.210> B<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
of tub a and 10 out of tub B and the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.710 
of tub a and 10 out of tub B and the
average<00:00:22.920> per<00:00:23.160> duckling<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:24.060> point<00:00:24.449> eight

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
average per duckling was one point eight

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.060 
average per duckling was one point eight
one<00:00:24.960> ounces<00:00:25.760> I<00:00:26.760> would<00:00:27.510> bet<00:00:27.840> there's<00:00:28.260> probably

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
one ounces I would bet there's probably

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.040 
one ounces I would bet there's probably
somewhere<00:00:29.400> around<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.179> half<00:00:30.390> at<00:00:30.779> hatch

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
somewhere around one and a half at hatch

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.840 
somewhere around one and a half at hatch
so<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> little<00:00:31.769> bit<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.949> gain<00:00:32.130> already<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.669> would

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
so a little bit of gain already I would

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.000 
so a little bit of gain already I would
guess<00:00:33.180> they<00:00:34.170> certainly<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.649> eaten<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> lot<00:00:34.890> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
guess they certainly have eaten a lot of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.450 
guess they certainly have eaten a lot of
food<00:00:35.420> they've<00:00:36.420> eaten<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:37.340> refilled<00:00:38.340> their

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
food they've eaten I refilled their

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.619 
food they've eaten I refilled their
feeders<00:00:38.700> didn't<00:00:38.910> really<00:00:39.059> need<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.480> did

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
feeders didn't really need it but I did

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.240 
feeders didn't really need it but I did
it<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.140> how<00:00:40.320> much<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.710> consumed<00:00:41.100> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it just to see how much they consumed so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.270 
it just to see how much they consumed so
I<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.430> 25<00:00:41.850> ducks<00:00:42.350> they<00:00:43.350> ate<00:00:43.469> about<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> cup<00:00:44.070> of

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
I have 25 ducks they ate about a cup of

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.520 
I have 25 ducks they ate about a cup of
food<00:00:44.570> which<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.600> quite<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> bit<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.320> such<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
food which is quite a bit for such a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.580 
food which is quite a bit for such a
little<00:00:46.829> bird<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.539> they<00:00:48.539> drain<00:00:48.930> their<00:00:49.200> waters

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
little bird and they drain their waters

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.979 
little bird and they drain their waters
I've<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.070> got<00:00:50.309> proper<00:00:51.030> waterers<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.809> both

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
I've now got proper waterers and both

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.389 
I've now got proper waterers and both
the<00:00:52.170> idea<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.500> using<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.860> feeder<00:00:53.100> didn't

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the idea of using the feeder didn't

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.330 
the idea of using the feeder didn't
really<00:00:53.610> work<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.300> got<00:00:54.510> trained<00:00:54.750> too<00:00:54.899> fast<00:00:55.340> but

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
really work it got trained too fast but

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.860 
really work it got trained too fast but
these<00:00:56.489> were<00:00:56.610> both<00:00:56.820> filled<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.270> morning<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
these were both filled this morning and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.369 
these were both filled this morning and
they're<00:00:58.079> less<00:00:58.410> than<00:00:58.440> half<00:00:58.890> full<00:00:59.250> now<00:01:00.379> last

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
they're less than half full now last

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.869 
they're less than half full now last
this<00:01:01.680> morning<00:01:02.100> when<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> came<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.609> they<00:01:02.789> were

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
this morning when I came out they were

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.250 
this morning when I came out they were
ball<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.210> dry<00:01:03.390> when<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.719> soon<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.989> filled

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
ball and dry when as soon as I filled

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.149 
ball and dry when as soon as I filled
them<00:01:04.549> everybody<00:01:05.549> went<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> melee<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
them everybody went on a melee and

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.130 
them everybody went on a melee and
attacked<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> water<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.970> spilled<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.930> lot<00:01:10.049> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
attacked the water and spilled a lot of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.480 
attacked the water and spilled a lot of
water<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.650> that's<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.220> guess<00:01:11.369> they

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
water and that's because I guess they

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.490 
water and that's because I guess they
were<00:01:11.549> thirsty<00:01:12.000> from<00:01:12.210> emptying<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.080> out

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
were thirsty from emptying it out

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.289 
were thirsty from emptying it out
so<00:01:13.979> I'll<00:01:14.130> refill<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.850> them<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.150> when<00:01:15.270> I

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
so I'll refill it for them here when I

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.050 
so I'll refill it for them here when I
get<00:01:15.390> done<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.930> guys<00:01:17.060> Chronicles
