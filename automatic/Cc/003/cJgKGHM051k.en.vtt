00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.519 

here<00:00:03.130> we've<00:00:03.250> got<00:00:03.280> a<00:00:03.400> walls<00:00:04.000> been<00:00:04.300> rendered<00:00:04.529> and

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:05.529 
here we've got a walls been rendered and

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.320 
here we've got a walls been rendered and
the<00:00:05.560> big<00:00:06.100> problem<00:00:06.250> with<00:00:06.520> rendered<00:00:06.850> walls<00:00:07.060> is

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.330 
the big problem with rendered walls is

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.780 
the big problem with rendered walls is
they<00:00:07.480> tend<00:00:07.690> to<00:00:07.779> be<00:00:07.930> absorbent<00:00:08.469> so<00:00:09.400> this<00:00:09.580> wall

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
they tend to be absorbent so this wall

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.910 
they tend to be absorbent so this wall
when<00:00:10.330> it<00:00:10.420> bends<00:00:10.630> it<00:00:10.870> gets<00:00:10.990> very<00:00:11.170> wet<00:00:11.440> and<00:00:11.740> then

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
when it bends it gets very wet and then

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.190 
when it bends it gets very wet and then
when<00:00:12.070> it<00:00:12.130> gets<00:00:12.280> wet<00:00:12.510> the<00:00:13.510> more<00:00:13.690> you<00:00:13.780> tend<00:00:14.050> to

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
when it gets wet the more you tend to

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.089 
when it gets wet the more you tend to
stay<00:00:14.380> in<00:00:14.410> the<00:00:14.620> wall

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
stay in the wall

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.790 
stay in the wall
sore<00:00:15.700> 23z<00:00:16.209> there's<00:00:16.570> a<00:00:16.599> good<00:00:16.779> chance<00:00:17.020> it's

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
sore 23z there's a good chance it's

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.080 
sore 23z there's a good chance it's
going<00:00:17.950> to<00:00:18.009> start<00:00:18.160> cracking<00:00:18.609> all<00:00:18.730> over<00:00:19.000> the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
going to start cracking all over the

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.090 
going to start cracking all over the
place<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:20.380> what<00:00:20.560> we're<00:00:20.650> going<00:00:20.740> to<00:00:20.800> do<00:00:20.890> is<00:00:20.980> going

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
place so what we're going to do is going

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.640 
place so what we're going to do is going
to<00:00:21.160> paint<00:00:21.490> it<00:00:21.670> but<00:00:22.539> before<00:00:22.810> you<00:00:22.900> paint<00:00:23.109> render

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
to paint it but before you paint render

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.439 
to paint it but before you paint render
you<00:00:24.310> need<00:00:24.460> to<00:00:24.550> seal<00:00:24.760> it<00:00:24.939> version<00:00:25.150> with<00:00:25.359> an

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
you need to seal it version with an

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.179 
you need to seal it version with an
appropriate<00:00:25.990> see<00:00:26.170> look<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:28.180> here<00:00:28.599> we've<00:00:28.779> got<00:00:28.810> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
appropriate see look so here we've got a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.650 
appropriate see look so here we've got a
stabilizing<00:00:30.189> solution<00:00:30.460> which<00:00:31.300> is<00:00:31.420> what<00:00:31.449> you

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
stabilizing solution which is what you

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.049 
stabilizing solution which is what you
paint<00:00:31.869> onto<00:00:32.140> the<00:00:32.290> wall<00:00:32.349> before<00:00:33.250> you<00:00:33.489> apply

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
paint onto the wall before you apply

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.090 
paint onto the wall before you apply
your<00:00:34.090> paint<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.500> we're<00:00:35.649> going<00:00:35.739> to<00:00:35.829> apply<00:00:36.040> this

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
your paint so we're going to apply this

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.100 
your paint so we're going to apply this
to<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.520> end<00:00:36.579> then<00:00:36.790> tomorrow<00:00:37.120> we're<00:00:37.960> going<00:00:38.050> to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
to the end then tomorrow we're going to

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.670 
to the end then tomorrow we're going to
actually<00:00:38.380> paint<00:00:38.559> the<00:00:38.649> wall<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.899> whenever<00:00:41.500> you

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
actually paint the wall so whenever you

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.110 
actually paint the wall so whenever you
use<00:00:41.770> an<00:00:41.890> anything<00:00:42.190> light<00:00:42.309> is<00:00:42.579> essential<00:00:42.850> that

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
use an anything light is essential that

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.000 
use an anything light is essential that
you<00:00:43.239> meet<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.600> safety<00:00:44.170> instructions<00:00:44.500> on<00:00:44.920> the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
you meet the safety instructions on the

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.580 
you meet the safety instructions on the
back<00:00:45.190> sort<00:00:45.520> of<00:00:45.670> red<00:00:46.000> doors<00:00:46.289> I've<00:00:47.289> got<00:00:47.469> me

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
back sort of red doors I've got me

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.799 
back sort of red doors I've got me
safety<00:00:47.890> sunglasses<00:00:48.430> on<00:00:48.610> I've<00:00:49.539> got<00:00:49.690> me

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
safety sunglasses on I've got me

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.920 
safety sunglasses on I've got me
protective<00:00:50.469> gloves<00:00:50.739> on<00:00:51.300> I've<00:00:52.300> given<00:00:52.570> it<00:00:52.690> a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
protective gloves on I've given it a

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.189 
protective gloves on I've given it a
good<00:00:53.770> shake<00:00:54.039> so<00:00:54.550> it's<00:00:54.730> all<00:00:54.850> shake<00:00:55.120> it<00:00:55.300> off<00:00:55.420> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.130 

then<00:00:59.199> I<00:00:59.230> voted<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:01.059> reasonable<00:01:01.480> amount<00:01:01.750> of<00:01:01.960> it

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
then I voted the reasonable amount of it

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.140 
then I voted the reasonable amount of it
into<00:01:02.590> a<00:01:02.620> pair<00:01:03.129> kettle

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.500 

then<00:01:08.080> I've<00:01:08.200> got<00:01:08.320> a<00:01:08.350> decent<00:01:08.530> size<00:01:08.950> brush<00:01:09.510> so

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
then I've got a decent size brush so

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.850 
then I've got a decent size brush so
that<00:01:10.990> what<00:01:11.140> can<00:01:11.230> actually<00:01:11.530> start<00:01:11.770> to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
that what can actually start to

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.370 
that what can actually start to
stabilize<00:01:12.490> this<00:01:13.030> wall<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:14.020> then<00:01:14.110> when<00:01:14.260> it's

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
stabilize this wall and then when it's

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.560 
stabilize this wall and then when it's
dry<00:01:14.530> tomorrow<00:01:14.950> which<00:01:15.430> will<00:01:15.460> be<00:01:15.700> able<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.360> pinch

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
dry tomorrow which will be able to pinch

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.690 
dry tomorrow which will be able to pinch
things<00:01:16.870> on<00:01:17.050> to<00:01:17.230> it<00:01:17.350> so<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:20.650> use<00:01:20.770> a<00:01:20.800> larger

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
things on to it so if you use a larger

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.880 
things on to it so if you use a larger
size<00:01:21.880> bush<00:01:22.180> which<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:22.590> four-inch<00:01:23.590> one<00:01:23.770> of

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
size bush which is a four-inch one of

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.320 
size bush which is a four-inch one of
this<00:01:24.040> it'll<00:01:24.310> make<00:01:24.460> it<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.670> lot<00:01:24.790> easier<00:01:24.850> and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
this it'll make it a lot easier and

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.430 
this it'll make it a lot easier and
you'll<00:01:25.510> get<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.780> earlier<00:01:26.080> cause<00:01:26.260> a<00:01:26.290> lot

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
you'll get the earlier cause a lot

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.210 
you'll get the earlier cause a lot
quicker<00:01:26.680> one<00:01:27.550> thing<00:01:27.790> you<00:01:27.880> can<00:01:28.090> do<00:01:28.270> with

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
quicker one thing you can do with

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.980 
quicker one thing you can do with
stabilizing<00:01:30.220> solution<00:01:30.550> is<00:01:30.790> speed<00:01:31.060> on<00:01:31.300> you've

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
stabilizing solution is speed on you've

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.900 
stabilizing solution is speed on you've
got<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.530> paint<00:01:33.070> it<00:01:33.190> on<00:01:33.310> with<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:33.460> brush<00:01:33.610> I

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
got to paint it on with a brush I

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:40.710 
got to paint it on with a brush I
painted<00:01:34.330> on<00:01:34.420> with<00:01:34.510> a<00:01:34.570> roller<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:40.390> can<00:01:40.570> see

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
painted on with a roller you can see

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.840 
painted on with a roller you can see
immediately<00:01:40.960> that<00:01:41.320> is<00:01:41.770> soft<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.430> straight<00:01:42.670> in

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
immediately that is soft and straight in

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.310 
immediately that is soft and straight in
there<00:01:43.060> because<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.750> surface<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.260> very

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
there because the surface is very

00:01:44.320 --> 00:02:15.350 
there because the surface is very
absorbent

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.850 

so<00:02:16.360> we<00:02:16.540> stabilized<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.170> wall<00:02:17.320> yesterday<00:02:17.560> over

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
so we stabilized the wall yesterday over

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.740 
so we stabilized the wall yesterday over
the<00:02:17.980> stabilizing<00:02:18.580> solution<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.420> today<00:02:19.630> we're

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
the stabilizing solution and today we're

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.850 
the stabilizing solution and today we're
going<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.900> paint<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.290> using<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.680> bursa

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
going to paint it using the bursa

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.880 
going to paint it using the bursa
McCain's<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.780> again<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.440> need<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.680> read<00:02:23.800> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
McCain's so again you need to read the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.420 
McCain's so again you need to read the
instructions<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.520> this<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.800> this<00:02:27.130> particular

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
instructions on this and this particular

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.710 
instructions on this and this particular
paper<00:02:27.790> needs<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.150> give<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.360> good<00:02:28.480> stir

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
paper needs to give it a good stir

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
just going to go all over the place it's

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.220 
just going to go all over the place it's
a<00:03:33.460> lot<00:03:33.580> easier<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:33.910> control<00:03:34.210> the<00:03:34.720> pin<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.080> put

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
a lot easier to control the pin you put

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.710 
a lot easier to control the pin you put
it<00:03:35.320> on<00:03:35.440> if<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.430> keep<00:03:36.940> two<00:03:37.090> about<00:03:37.300> there<00:03:37.510> and

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
it on if you keep two about there and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.950 
it on if you keep two about there and
your<00:03:37.810> brush<00:03:39.300> so<00:03:40.300> I'm<00:03:40.390> just<00:03:40.480> going<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.690> dip<00:03:40.840> it

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
your brush so I'm just going to dip it

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.470 
your brush so I'm just going to dip it
in<00:03:41.050> there<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.470> then<00:03:41.740> clean<00:03:42.010> off<00:03:42.040> any<00:03:42.490> excess

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
in there and then clean off any excess

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.170 
in there and then clean off any excess
on<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.780> side<00:03:44.520> so<00:03:45.520> actually<00:03:45.790> them<00:03:45.910> make<00:03:46.060> it

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
on the side so actually them make it

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.300 
on the side so actually them make it
easier<00:03:46.450> for<00:03:46.480> when<00:03:46.720> you<00:03:46.840> cut<00:03:47.320> it<00:03:47.470> in<00:03:47.590> on<00:03:47.800> edges

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
easier for when you cut it in on edges

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.920 
easier for when you cut it in on edges
like<00:03:48.490> that<00:03:48.520> where<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.420> need<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.660> walk<00:03:49.780> to

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
like that where you need to walk to

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.550 
like that where you need to walk to
something<00:03:51.600> on<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.660> surface<00:03:53.110> like<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.320> you're

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
something on a surface like that you're

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.590 
something on a surface like that you're
gonna<00:03:53.680> have<00:03:53.800> to<00:03:53.920> make<00:03:54.880> sure<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:55.150> work<00:03:55.360> the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
gonna have to make sure you work the

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.290 
gonna have to make sure you work the
pins<00:03:55.810> into<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.200> actual<00:03:56.670> walls<00:03:57.670> on<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.120> wall

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
pins into the actual walls on the wall

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.140 
pins into the actual walls on the wall
so<00:03:59.020> that<00:03:59.230> often<00:03:59.350> means<00:03:59.650> going<00:03:59.830> in<00:04:00.730> several

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
so that often means going in several

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:26.140 
so that often means going in several
directions

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.090 

so<00:04:27.139> when<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.380> come<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.680> point<00:04:27.830> where<00:04:28.040> you

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
so when you come to a point where you

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.170 
so when you come to a point where you
need<00:04:28.220> to<00:04:28.340> cut<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:28.760> if<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:28.880> just<00:04:29.000> use<00:04:29.150> a

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
need to cut it and if you just use a

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.700 
need to cut it and if you just use a
side<00:04:29.479> of<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.720> brush<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.900> just<00:04:33.080> drag<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.590> like

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
side of the brush and just drag it like

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:48.440 
side of the brush and just drag it like
that<00:04:33.949> you<00:04:34.160> should<00:04:34.370> get<00:04:34.460> a<00:04:34.520> neat<00:04:35.150> ish<00:04:35.389> edge

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.850 

if<00:04:49.450> you<00:04:49.600> look<00:04:49.720> on<00:04:49.840> this<00:04:49.900> pillow<00:04:50.200> you'll<00:04:50.710> see

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
if you look on this pillow you'll see

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.120 
if you look on this pillow you'll see
that<00:04:50.920> we've<00:04:51.100> got<00:04:51.220> galvanized<00:04:52.030> angle<00:04:52.600> beading

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
that we've got galvanized angle beading

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.730 
that we've got galvanized angle beading
behind<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.250> vendor<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:55.200> that<00:04:56.200> can<00:04:56.350> cause<00:04:56.530> you

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
behind the vendor and that can cause you

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.060 
behind the vendor and that can cause you
a<00:04:56.770> few<00:04:56.950> problems<00:04:58.050> look<00:04:59.050> a<00:04:59.140> bit<00:04:59.290> lower<00:04:59.770> down<00:04:59.950> on

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
a few problems look a bit lower down on

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.800 
a few problems look a bit lower down on
this<00:05:00.130> angle<00:05:00.340> bead<00:05:00.640> you'll<00:05:01.450> see<00:05:01.570> that<00:05:01.720> it

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
this angle bead you'll see that it

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.680 
this angle bead you'll see that it
started<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.170> go<00:05:02.320> loosely<00:05:02.740> there<00:05:03.390> and<00:05:04.390> that<00:05:04.600> is

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
started to go loosely there and that is

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.200 
started to go loosely there and that is
a<00:05:04.720> very<00:05:05.170> common<00:05:05.530> problem<00:05:05.820> so<00:05:06.820> we<00:05:06.970> need<00:05:07.090> to

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
a very common problem so we need to

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.570 
a very common problem so we need to
address<00:05:07.630> that<00:05:07.750> before<00:05:08.080> we<00:05:08.440> paint<00:05:09.190> over<00:05:09.550> it

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
address that before we paint over it

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.000 
address that before we paint over it
with<00:05:09.730> the<00:05:09.820> mess<00:05:10.000> with<00:05:10.240> pins<00:05:10.830> so<00:05:11.830> what<00:05:11.920> we're

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
with the mess with pins so what we're

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.050 
with the mess with pins so what we're
going<00:05:12.100> to<00:05:12.160> do<00:05:12.250> is<00:05:12.370> going<00:05:12.460> to<00:05:12.520> get<00:05:12.640> a<00:05:12.670> by<00:05:12.820> every

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
going to do is going to get a by every

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.190 
going to do is going to get a by every
option<00:05:13.240> but<00:05:13.330> it's<00:05:13.510> going<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.690> clean<00:05:14.050> up<00:05:14.080> a

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
option but it's going to clean up a

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.290 
option but it's going to clean up a
little<00:05:14.410> bit<00:05:14.590> of<00:05:14.680> lost<00:05:14.980> and<00:05:15.880> then<00:05:16.060> we're<00:05:16.180> going

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
little bit of lost and then we're going

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.350 
little bit of lost and then we're going
to<00:05:16.330> apply<00:05:16.600> some<00:05:17.280> Zinser<00:05:18.280> bullseye<00:05:18.940> one<00:05:19.180> two

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
to apply some Zinser bullseye one two

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.870 
to apply some Zinser bullseye one two
three<00:05:19.600> which<00:05:19.990> is<00:05:20.140> an<00:05:20.230> external<00:05:20.610> cui

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
three which is an external cui

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.200 
three which is an external cui
so<00:05:22.720> once<00:05:23.140> you've<00:05:23.290> painted<00:05:23.440> this<00:05:24.120> onto<00:05:25.120> that

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
so once you've painted this onto that

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.850 
so once you've painted this onto that
bead<00:05:25.620> it<00:05:26.620> will<00:05:27.780> seal<00:05:28.780> it<00:05:29.050> and<00:05:29.170> it'll<00:05:29.440> prevent

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
bead it will seal it and it'll prevent

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.250 
bead it will seal it and it'll prevent
any<00:05:30.160> rust<00:05:30.520> some<00:05:30.790> bleeding<00:05:31.180> through<00:05:31.420> and<00:05:31.870> it

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
any rust some bleeding through and it

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.890 
any rust some bleeding through and it
will<00:05:32.350> also<00:05:32.530> make<00:05:32.920> it<00:05:32.980> waterproof<00:05:33.460> sorsa<00:05:33.970> nor

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
will also make it waterproof sorsa nor

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.660 
will also make it waterproof sorsa nor
water<00:05:35.110> can<00:05:35.410> actually<00:05:35.650> penetrate<00:05:35.800> through<00:05:36.370> and

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
water can actually penetrate through and

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.300 
water can actually penetrate through and
get<00:05:36.850> through<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.300> angle<00:05:37.540> bead<00:05:37.720> again<00:05:38.310> but

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
get through to the angle bead again but

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.890 
get through to the angle bead again but
like<00:05:39.460> all<00:05:39.700> paint<00:05:40.300> you<00:05:40.420> need<00:05:40.570> to<00:05:40.660> read<00:05:40.810> the

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
like all paint you need to read the

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.990 
like all paint you need to read the
instructions<00:05:41.410> first<00:05:41.670> so<00:05:42.670> now<00:05:42.820> we're<00:05:42.970> just

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
instructions first so now we're just

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.460 
instructions first so now we're just
going<00:05:43.210> to<00:05:43.240> get<00:05:43.360> a<00:05:43.420> pair<00:05:43.960> bushing<00:05:44.260> when<00:05:44.380> it's

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
going to get a pair bushing when it's

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.500 
going to get a pair bushing when it's
going<00:05:44.590> to<00:05:44.650> paint<00:05:44.890> down<00:05:45.820> the<00:05:46.030> coin<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.390> out

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
going to paint down the coin and out

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.260 
going to paint down the coin and out
just<00:05:47.110> to<00:05:47.230> seal<00:05:47.440> it<00:05:47.680> and<00:05:47.830> prevent<00:05:48.280> any<00:05:48.490> future

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
just to seal it and prevent any future

00:05:49.270 --> 00:06:02.090 
just to seal it and prevent any future
problems<00:05:49.570> from<00:05:49.870> occurring

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.950 

so<00:06:03.100> now<00:06:03.280> you<00:06:03.340> can<00:06:03.550> see<00:06:03.729> that<00:06:03.970> we've<00:06:04.210> painted

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
so now you can see that we've painted

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.950 
so now you can see that we've painted
both<00:06:05.740> of<00:06:05.919> the<00:06:06.009> edges<00:06:06.130> where<00:06:06.669> the<00:06:06.960> galvanized

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
both of the edges where the galvanized

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.650 
both of the edges where the galvanized
angle<00:06:08.289> bead<00:06:08.470> is<00:06:08.650> and<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:10.060> good<00:06:10.210> thing<00:06:10.449> is<00:06:10.630> that

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
angle bead is and the good thing is that

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.230 
angle bead is and the good thing is that
that<00:06:11.349> particular<00:06:11.919> stand<00:06:12.819> block<00:06:13.030> that<00:06:13.150> we've

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
that particular stand block that we've

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.860 
that particular stand block that we've
used<00:06:13.479> will<00:06:14.050> be<00:06:14.080> dry<00:06:14.349> in<00:06:14.530> 30<00:06:14.770> minutes<00:06:15.190> so<00:06:15.720> in<00:06:16.720> 30

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
used will be dry in 30 minutes so in 30

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.180 
used will be dry in 30 minutes so in 30
minutes<00:06:17.199> time<00:06:17.349> we<00:06:17.500> can<00:06:17.650> give<00:06:17.770> that<00:06:17.889> a<00:06:17.919> course

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
minutes time we can give that a course

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.570 
minutes time we can give that a course
of<00:06:18.370> the<00:06:19.330> motion<00:06:19.660> repent<00:06:20.250> so<00:06:21.250> when<00:06:21.460> you're

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
of the motion repent so when you're

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.309 
of the motion repent so when you're
finished<00:06:21.910> you<00:06:22.509> should<00:06:22.539> end<00:06:22.810> up<00:06:22.900> with<00:06:22.960> a<00:06:23.080> ball

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 
finished you should end up with a ball

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:40.629 
finished you should end up with a ball
looking<00:06:23.650> something<00:06:23.860> like<00:06:24.009> this

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.699 

you
