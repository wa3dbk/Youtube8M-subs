00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.730
 we're 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:22.590
 I wrote about time and about 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:28.040
 water to write it is a purple metal 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.440
 I wrote about the sky and the apple 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.790
 now I write 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.790
 on this line 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:46.410
 according to his handkerchief 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.410
 but of my love 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.990
 now my heart is on the ground in the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.920
 smoke 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:02.210
 from stalingrado 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:07.180
 I know that the old transitional youth of 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.340
 pen as a bound sign 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.210
 unbind his notorious pain for me 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.710
 cry of love to stalin grade 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.710
 I was 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.159
 tired paper 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.450
 I was born to sing to be in grade 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:49.020
 you were with your great dead 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:53.750
 against your own crushed walls 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:59.170
 my voice sounded like a bell and well 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.170
 go to the world fear and stalingrado 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.210
 France returns to the old barricades 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.069
 with canopy of fury in woodland over 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.200
 the freshly dried tears 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:19.720
 He is no longer alone stalingrado 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.269
 discard go the invaders hands 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.019
 crushed the soldier's eyes are 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:31.130
 full of blood the shoes they stepped on 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.870
 your door stalingrado 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.750
 the deep salt 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:42.080
 again another 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.080
 the heart of the sorrowful man 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.590
 be in Granada 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.109
 those who humiliated the curve of the arch and 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.560
 sena waters have drilled with the 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:06.800
 slave feeling they stopped in 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.630
 stalingrado 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.020
 those who bring abella on tears 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.940
 over the mute and betrayed 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:21.760
 they trampled their wounds 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.120
 They died in Stalingrad 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.920
 those who in the Greek caves have 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:34.530
 spit the crystal stalactite 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:39.740
 truncated and its classic rarefied blue 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:43.570
 now where are they that stalin grana 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.940
 those who 'spain burned and broke 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:51.950
 leaving the heart chained by that 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:55.890
 mother of oaks and warriors rot 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:00.470
 your feet stalingrado 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:04.020
 those in holland tulips and water 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.920
 they splashed with bloody mud and 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:11.730
 they scattered the whip and the sword now 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.150
 they sleep in stalingrado 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.430
 those in the white night of norway 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:23.970
 with a howl of soldier jackal 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:28.380
 they burned that frosty spring 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.380
 they fell silent in Stalingrad 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.040
 honor you so 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.050
 whatever 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.050
 to sing and sing 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.000
 pain for 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.290
 and the grandchildren are on engraving 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.759
 pain to the fighter 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.949
 white and leave alone 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.150
 for now the sky 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.480
 the sun stalingrado 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:23.520
 I will keep a piece of violent foam 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.520
 save me a rifle, save me one hour 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:34.040
 that they put it in my grave 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.040
 a tether banishment 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:44.440
 so they know if there is any doubt 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:48.970
 back to side I'll call you 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:54.340
 and if I have not fought in your waist I leave 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:58.890
 in your honor this dark grenade this 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.890
 love song to stalingrado
