00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 what has two big ears a 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.060
 small thin nose and conquered the heart 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.130
 of all the senior forensic here at the by 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.500
 safari but also several guests 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.320
 it's none other than zimbo the little brother 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.450
 who is obviously looking forward to going 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.520
 sleep and you'll know why 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.820
 in this capsule this week about 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.820
 fennecs 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.560
 it is 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.120
 I am currently with sophie dumont 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.690
 and diana to borrow zoologists and to 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.720
 safari park and our zimbo girlfriends 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.720
 the phoenix so we want to talk a little 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.230
 plus hold that so had first of all what 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.190
 phoenix net flex opinion and rumors 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.390
 desert 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.070
 we could clarify with the disorders 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.930
 brain as an example but that's 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.120
 really desert it will live in the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.230
 arid plains have lent it's going to get 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.870
 dig the small burrows into the 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.430
 sand then it's really not a food 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.250
 of forest we really see it right in 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.750
 the deserts and then it's an animal 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.000
 of the desert 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.100
 can somehow be 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.649
 to refresh what I notice 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.000
 it's big ears 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.500
 yes the big ears will help to 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.759
 dissipate body heat in the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.830
 bottom it goes as for the way is 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.660
 refresh there were even paws 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.680
 that we can see slightly here very 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.630
 hairy surrounds 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.700
 it helped protect the pads 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.860
 that will be a way even when I 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.240
 lose heat makes them small 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.090
 hair is really going to protect them from 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 the desert aridity of what feeds 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.140
 a unique fact to calonnix and still 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.119
 omnivorous it's going to take a little bit of 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.039
 all that's eating meat is not going to be 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.619
 a hunter anyway special as a 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.380
 little vador capes and eat 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.530
 scorpions is certainly a little reptile or 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.789
 the name snake speaks of a site we are going 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.380
 talk to them that you will see the 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.160
 landais nor are we going to talk about berries 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.160
 small plant 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:07.829
 good symphonic who was raised to the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.069
 hand so what does that mean 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.690
 to be bred by hand but it does incite that 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.870
 it was the waters logist in great 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.660
 party who took care of it mbow was 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.430
 fed at the beginning to the bottle at 7 was 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.330
 little by little guy from helmand with the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.209
 solid food 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.900
 it was a job of equipped 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.209
 especially you are a welcome 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.269
 much cooperate especially at the level of 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.980
 enrichment and then two dug the 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.750
 to dislike to play with them for 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.360
 last at table it's really cute 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.880
 gimlets personally I will have one to 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.730
 the house but what could I do in 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.980
 to have the house where was not 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.930
 recommended no it is strongly 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.640
 not recommended is especially nanotubes 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.840
 as we can see there we are in full 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.660
 day and in the arms and come 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.060
 he sleeps the exim pose in energy this is the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.400
 evening who spends it does that when 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.489
 even pretty agitated it means a lot 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.430
 to play a lot of stimulation either 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.959
 really high shelves that 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.760
 can jump so that they can run 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.220
 so that they can go from a bastard 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.100
 and dangerous of course that's sleeping makes a 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.840
 not really be disturbing his little 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.450
 routine is still an enemy what 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.730
 eat meat is really gk 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.160
