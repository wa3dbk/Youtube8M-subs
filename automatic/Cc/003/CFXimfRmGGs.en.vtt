Welcome to ONLINE Video Student - today we're going to go a very short
video on how to send more than five

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.590
photos from any of your iOS devices like  your iPad or your iPhone.  In iOS you're

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.119
normally limited to five pictures to be
emailed out at any one time

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.340
but there is a trick around this so
let's take a look. Here you hit edit (or select) and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.610
you can select up to five pictures. We
hit share and you'll see that the mail

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.730
option is showing. if you go back and you
select a sixth one and hit share

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.039
you'll see that the email option is no
longer there. IOS limits you to that so

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.590
we're only selecting five we hit share.
Select email it pops up an email account.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.760
Something really interesting and really
powerful shows up in this in the upper

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.789
right hand corner you'll see that it
says images 617 K and here are the five

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.049
images that I selected to be emailed out
but if I tap on that it opens up a new

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.330
window and I can actually, on the fly, 
manually select the size of the images

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.100
that I want to send. I can select large
actual size which is actually over 10

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.860
Megs, medium or I can even go to really
small and you can see that it does this

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.150
and it does it on the fly which is very
powerful.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.960
Let's hit cancel and we'll delete
that draft and we'll go back to photos.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.790
I've selected five at this point so
I'm going to select another five ---

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.130
Okay that's a total of ten photos. I hit share again and of

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.750
course there's no email option but if I
hit copy, that comes up and then if we

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.049
pop over to mail--- I tap inside, then double

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.469
tap and hit paste. That pastes in all
ten of those images and usually this

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.850
will take a second and you can see that
they're all in there

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.280
all ten of them now again up in the
upper right hand corner we have images

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.980
and it tells you the current size of it
if you tap on that this allows you to

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.160
actually alter the size of the images
again you can go to the small and on the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.610
fly it will reduce them medium large or
go to actual size it's a very powerful

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.210
trick and the best thing about it is
that on the iPad you can actually

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.460
manipulate the size of the photos that
are going out on the iPhone it works

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.130
almost identically you select your
pictures select mail enter the address

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.850
and all the information you want to send
any messages you want to send in the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.170
email but it's not until you actually
hit Send that you get to select the size

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.930
of the pictures going out when you
select more than five you're able to do

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.420
copy paste it into an email you'll enter
all the pictures you enter the address

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.830
where you're going to and again when you
hit Send it will give you the option to

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.860
choose the size of the outgoing pictures
this way you can send more than five and

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.140
you can select the size of them going
out. It's a great iOS trick that not a

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.450
lot of people seem to know about and we
thought we'd share it with you today

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.310
