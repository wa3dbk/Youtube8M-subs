00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
bike I'm kind of the one dissenting

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.789 
bike I'm kind of the one dissenting
opinion<00:01:04.420> here<00:01:04.629> and<00:01:04.989> it<00:01:05.079> doesn't<00:01:05.199> become<00:01:05.530> it

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
opinion here and it doesn't become it

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.469

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
doesn't come from the fact that I don't

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.929 
doesn't come from the fact that I don't
think<00:01:07.630> this<00:01:07.720> is<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.869> rad<00:01:08.049> bike<00:01:08.320> I<00:01:08.759> looked<00:01:09.759> at<00:01:09.909> it

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
think this is a rad bike I looked at it

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.690 
think this is a rad bike I looked at it
appreciate<00:01:10.810> it<00:01:10.990> every<00:01:11.259> angle<00:01:11.439> I<00:01:11.890> get<00:01:12.429> on<00:01:12.549> it

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
appreciate it every angle I get on it

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.249 
appreciate it every angle I get on it
and<00:01:13.289> it<00:01:14.289> really<00:01:14.350> only<00:01:15.009> shines<00:01:15.579> in<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.990> kind<00:01:17.229> of

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
and it really only shines in the kind of

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.469 
and it really only shines in the kind of
terrain<00:01:17.469> that<00:01:17.890> just<00:01:18.100> scares<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.030> hell<00:01:19.329> out

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
terrain that just scares the hell out

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.169 
terrain that just scares the hell out
it's<00:01:20.469> a<00:01:20.530> bike<00:01:20.740> designed<00:01:21.189> to<00:01:21.549> just<00:01:21.969> be

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
it's a bike designed to just be

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.499 
it's a bike designed to just be
unleashed<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:24.189> certainly<00:01:24.729> feel<00:01:25.329> like

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
unleashed and you certainly feel like

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.649 
unleashed and you certainly feel like
need<00:01:26.170> some<00:01:26.469> skill<00:01:27.179> riding<00:01:28.179> down<00:01:28.329> the<00:01:28.359> bikes

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
need some skill riding down the bikes

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.179 
need some skill riding down the bikes
going<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:28.960> ride<00:01:29.079> this<00:01:29.229> bike<00:01:29.289> because<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.979> need

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
going to ride this bike because you need

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.309 
going to ride this bike because you need
to<00:01:30.399> be<00:01:30.520> over<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:30.880> front<00:01:31.119> of<00:01:31.179> it<00:01:31.329> it's<00:01:32.109> not<00:01:32.259> a

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
to be over the front of it it's not a

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.660 
to be over the front of it it's not a
slack<00:01:32.649> headtube<00:01:33.280> angle

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
slack headtube angle

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.859 
slack headtube angle
I<00:01:33.850> think<00:01:34.240> 62<00:01:34.780> yes<00:01:35.259> like<00:01:36.159> a<00:01:36.490> slack<00:01:36.909> kind<00:01:37.090> of<00:01:37.149> deep

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
I think 62 yes like a slack kind of deep

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.559 
I think 62 yes like a slack kind of deep
position<00:01:38.170> which<00:01:38.649> is<00:01:38.799> like<00:01:38.979> almost<00:01:39.670> 63<00:01:40.179> yes

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
position which is like almost 63 yes

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.199 
position which is like almost 63 yes
exactly<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:42.310> definitely<00:01:42.729> on<00:01:42.850> like<00:01:43.060> this

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209 
exactly it's definitely on like this

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.480 
exactly it's definitely on like this
slacker<00:01:43.630> end<00:01:43.959> yeah<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:45.130> if<00:01:45.219> you're<00:01:45.340> riding

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
slacker end yeah and if you're riding

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.760 
slacker end yeah and if you're riding
behind<00:01:45.759> it<00:01:46.209> then<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:47.139> know<00:01:47.229> yours<00:01:47.469> gonna<00:01:47.619> be

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
behind it then you know yours gonna be

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.989 
behind it then you know yours gonna be
watching<00:01:48.069> the<00:01:48.159> front<00:01:48.369> wheel<00:01:48.520> out<00:01:48.639> everywhere

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
watching the front wheel out everywhere

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:50.639 
watching the front wheel out everywhere
you<00:01:49.149> go<00:01:49.299> so<00:01:49.329> you<00:01:49.630> really<00:01:50.079> do<00:01:50.229> need<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.439> be<00:01:50.529> an

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
you go so you really do need to be an

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.529 
you go so you really do need to be an
aggressive<00:01:50.889> rider<00:01:51.219> be<00:01:51.399> comfortable<00:01:52.240> or<00:01:52.420> the

aggressive rider be comfortable or the
front<00:01:52.749> end<00:01:52.959> in<00:01:53.499> order<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.889> you<00:01:54.759> know<00:01:54.789> man<00:01:55.179> have

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
front end in order to you know man have

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.580 
front end in order to you know man have
we<00:01:55.820> weren't<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.270> then<00:01:56.390> why<00:01:56.540> not<00:01:56.720> some<00:01:57.380> people

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
we weren't and then why not some people

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.950 
we weren't and then why not some people
use<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.830> word<00:01:57.860> uncompromising<00:01:58.820> on<00:01:59.690> a<00:01:59.750> bike

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
use the word uncompromising on a bike

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.090 
use the word uncompromising on a bike
like<00:02:00.110> this<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:00.350> don't<00:02:00.560> think<00:02:00.680> it's<00:02:00.800> quite<00:02:00.920> the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
like this I don't think it's quite the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.950 
like this I don't think it's quite the
way<00:02:01.190> because<00:02:01.370> there<00:02:01.520> are<00:02:01.640> some<00:02:01.820> lovely<00:02:02.330> but

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960

quite<00:02:03.230> beautiful<00:02:03.740> compromises<00:02:04.370> in<00:02:04.430> this<00:02:04.550> bike

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
quite beautiful compromises in this bike

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.970 
quite beautiful compromises in this bike
ins<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:05.150> think<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:05.840> is<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.260> the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
ins I think that that is that the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.920 
ins I think that that is that the
adjustments<00:02:07.790> you<00:02:07.880> can<00:02:07.910> make<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.420> other

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930

bike<00:02:09.110> we<00:02:09.410> had<00:02:09.590> our<00:02:09.770> bike<00:02:10.010> in<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.490> shorter<00:02:11.090> rear

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
bike we had our bike in the shorter rear

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.870 
bike we had our bike in the shorter rear
end<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.860> low<00:02:13.040> setting<00:02:13.280> puts<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:13.760> at<00:02:13.850> the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
end and the low setting puts it at the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.480 
end and the low setting puts it at the
bottom<00:02:14.120> bracket<00:02:14.470> 13.6<00:02:15.470> inches<00:02:15.860> high<00:02:15.950> which<00:02:16.250> we

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
bottom bracket 13.6 inches high which we

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.250 
bottom bracket 13.6 inches high which we
taught<00:02:16.700> is<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.210> almost<00:02:17.390> like<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:17.810> trail<00:02:18.080> bike

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
taught is it's almost like a trail bike

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260 
taught is it's almost like a trail bike
that<00:02:18.500> it's<00:02:18.770> certainly<00:02:19.010> like<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.190> really<00:02:19.700> really

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
that it's certainly like a really really

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.150 
that it's certainly like a really really
quite<00:02:20.480> stunning<00:02:21.020> whole<00:02:21.440> mountain<00:02:21.800> bike<00:02:21.980> and

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
quite stunning whole mountain bike and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.630 
quite stunning whole mountain bike and
that<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.850> just<00:02:23.210> makes<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.750> corner<00:02:24.200> with

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
that just it just makes a corner with

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.280 
that just it just makes a corner with
just<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.760> can<00:02:26.240> sink<00:02:26.570> into<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.870> corners<00:02:27.260> and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
just you can sink into the corners and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.050 
just you can sink into the corners and
just<00:02:27.440> really<00:02:27.920> just<00:02:28.160> ripped<00:02:28.550> through<00:02:28.760> them<00:02:28.880> I

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
just really just ripped through them I

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.750 
just really just ripped through them I
thought<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.420> was<00:02:29.590> an<00:02:30.590> awesome<00:02:30.950> cornering<00:02:31.580> like

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
thought it was an awesome cornering like

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.430 
thought it was an awesome cornering like
you<00:02:31.970> put<00:02:32.210> your<00:02:32.240> heels<00:02:32.570> into<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.020> into<00:02:33.350> the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
back end you put your heels in for

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.310 
back end you put your heels in for
corner<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.240> put<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.540> heels<00:02:35.750> into<00:02:35.960> it<00:02:36.230> and

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
corner and you put the heels into it and

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.960 
corner and you put the heels into it and
make<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.590> bike<00:02:36.800> jump<00:02:37.160> in<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.670> sentence

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
make that bike jump in the sentence

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.220 
make that bike jump in the sentence
we've<00:02:38.180> had<00:02:38.330> it<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.600> thought<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.900> was<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.050> really

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
we've had it I thought it was a really

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.710 
we've had it I thought it was a really
playful<00:02:40.120> fun<00:02:41.920> free<00:02:42.920> ride<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.120> dead<00:02:44.450> word

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
playful fun free ride is is a dead word

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.050 
playful fun free ride is is a dead word
but<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.470> couldn't<00:02:45.740> very<00:02:45.980> much<00:02:46.250> free<00:02:46.610> ride<00:02:46.880> on

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
but you couldn't very much free ride on

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.010 
but you couldn't very much free ride on
this<00:02:47.240> bike<00:02:48.140> it's<00:02:48.440> like<00:02:48.950> in<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.220> short<00:02:49.460> position

the pedals in the dirt in the frame

bumpy in as well

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.840 
bumpy in as well
look<00:03:44.110> this<00:03:44.290> way<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.770> didn't<00:03:45.040> find<00:03:45.160> any<00:03:45.370> weird

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
look this way I didn't find any weird

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.230 
look this way I didn't find any weird
moments<00:03:46.600> in<00:03:46.780> English<00:03:47.440> shock<00:03:47.710> there's<00:03:48.400> no<00:03:48.550> told

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
moments in English shock there's no told

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.820 
moments in English shock there's no told
there's<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:49.630> many<00:03:49.750> other<00:03:49.960> bikes<00:03:50.230> have<00:03:50.470> it's

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
there's so many other bikes have it's

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.920 
there's so many other bikes have it's
either<00:03:51.010> difficult<00:03:51.490> to<00:03:51.910> initiate<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.660> travel

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
either difficult to initiate the travel

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.740 
either difficult to initiate the travel
but<00:03:53.050> then<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.230> feels<00:03:53.320> excellent<00:03:53.710> amid<00:03:54.100> stroke

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
but then it feels excellent amid stroke

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.410 
but then it feels excellent amid stroke
or<00:03:55.750> vice<00:03:56.110> versa<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:57.550> this<00:03:57.790> bike<00:03:57.970> just<00:03:58.180> feels

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
or vice versa and this bike just feels

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.690 
or vice versa and this bike just feels
solid<00:03:59.200> throughout<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.040> entire<00:04:00.370> suspension

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
solid throughout the entire suspension

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.500 
solid throughout the entire suspension
range

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
range

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.750 
range
I<00:04:01.540> just<00:04:02.470> felt<00:04:02.680> undergunned<00:04:03.040> you<00:04:03.550> know<00:04:03.670> what

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
I just felt undergunned you know what

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.820 
I just felt undergunned you know what
the<00:04:03.850> brakes<00:04:04.060> receptor<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:04.600> very<00:04:04.690> very<00:04:05.050> it

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
the brakes receptor is very very it

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.120 
the brakes receptor is very very it
makes<00:04:05.860> me<00:04:06.160> question<00:04:06.340> saying<00:04:06.930> like<00:04:08.010> we<00:04:09.010> were

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
makes me question saying like we were

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.400 
makes me question saying like we were
saying<00:04:09.280> it's<00:04:09.550> a<00:04:09.670> fraction<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.180> price<00:04:10.210> is<00:04:10.810> easy

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
saying it's a fraction the price is easy

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.490 
saying it's a fraction the price is easy
choice<00:04:11.950> right<00:04:12.280> huh

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
choice right huh

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.170 
choice right huh
I'll<00:04:14.500> probably<00:04:14.770> go<00:04:14.950> for<00:04:15.100> a<00:04:15.160> Z<00:04:15.310> of<00:04:15.460> a<00:04:15.550> say<00:04:15.700> no<00:04:15.940> I

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
I'll probably go for a Z of a say no I

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.440 
I'll probably go for a Z of a say no I
actually<00:04:16.870> think<00:04:17.080> this<00:04:17.410> here<00:04:17.620> Z<00:04:17.890> is<00:04:17.920> is<00:04:18.450> better

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
actually think this here Z is is better

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.550 
actually think this here Z is is better
than<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.780> last<00:04:20.020> year's<00:04:20.320> st.<00:04:21.540> by<00:04:22.540> leaves<00:04:23.350> and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
than the last year's st. by leaves and

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.400 
than the last year's st. by leaves and
balancing<00:04:23.980> right<00:04:24.460> for<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:25.030> B<00:04:25.170> modulation<00:04:26.170> on

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
balancing right for a B modulation on

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.720 
balancing right for a B modulation on
the<00:04:26.500> brakes<00:04:26.710> is<00:04:26.980> far<00:04:27.940> better<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:30.100> shifting<00:04:30.580> is

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
the brakes is far better the shifting is

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.930 
the brakes is far better the shifting is
great<00:04:32.190> chain<00:04:33.190> slap<00:04:33.460> because<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:35.940> cluster

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
great chain slap because of the cluster

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.330 
great chain slap because of the cluster
Aylor<00:04:37.270> is<00:04:38.130> fantastic

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
Aylor is fantastic

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.730 
Aylor is fantastic
where<00:04:40.150> does<00:04:40.240> it<00:04:40.390> what<00:04:40.810> seems<00:04:40.990> like<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.410> other

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
where does it what seems like the other

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.290 
where does it what seems like the other
thing<00:04:41.950> would<00:04:42.100> contact<00:04:42.430> fine<00:04:42.640> a<00:04:42.670> downer<00:04:43.000> bike

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
thing would contact fine a downer bike

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.330 
thing would contact fine a downer bike
and<00:04:43.510> this<00:04:43.600> is<00:04:43.720> really<00:04:44.290> really<00:04:44.650> important<00:04:45.280> I

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
and this is really really important I

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.340 
and this is really really important I
think<00:04:45.580> on<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.730> downer<00:04:46.000> bike<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:46.600> having<00:04:47.200> the
