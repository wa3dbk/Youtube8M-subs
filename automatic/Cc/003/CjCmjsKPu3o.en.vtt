00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
marrow in your own right so I was

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.080

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
about helping myself write words maybe

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.969 
about helping myself write words maybe
we<00:01:34.270> could<00:01:34.450> use<00:01:34.720> some<00:01:35.110> of<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.320> words<00:01:35.560> we<00:01:35.710> know

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
we could use some of the words we know

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.940 
we could use some of the words we know
to<00:01:36.310> help<00:01:36.520> us<00:01:36.700> write<00:01:36.909> few<00:01:37.119> words<00:01:37.360> so<00:01:38.049> I<00:01:38.380> know

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
to help us write few words so I know

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.880 
to help us write few words so I know
that<00:01:39.610> all<00:01:39.939> of<00:01:40.030> us<00:01:40.270> know<00:01:40.570> these<00:01:40.930> words<00:01:41.229> right<00:01:41.560> we

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
that all of us know these words right we

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:52.529 
that all of us know these words right we
know<00:01:42.039> maybe<00:01:42.549> we<00:01:42.729> should<00:01:42.880> rethink<00:01:43.140> okay<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:51.539> we

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
know maybe we should rethink okay and we

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.690 
know maybe we should rethink okay and we
can<00:01:52.810> use<00:01:53.080> those<00:01:53.350> words<00:01:53.619> to<00:01:53.950> help<00:01:54.190> us<00:01:54.399> write

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
can use those words to help us write

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.389 
can use those words to help us write
other<00:01:55.030> words<00:01:55.479> during<00:01:55.929> our<00:01:56.200> writing<00:01:56.590> time<00:01:56.860> that

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
other words during our writing time that

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:58.949 
other words during our writing time that
was<00:01:57.490> thinking<00:01:57.850> like<00:01:58.000> showing<00:01:58.299> you<00:01:58.479> how<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.690> do

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
was thinking like showing you how to do

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.600 
was thinking like showing you how to do
that<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.289> then<00:01:59.470> you<00:01:59.649> guys<00:01:59.830> could<00:02:00.190> practice

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
that and then you guys could practice

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.919 
that and then you guys could practice
that<00:02:00.850> in<00:02:01.000> your<00:02:01.030> own<00:02:01.299> writing

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
that in your own writing

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.760 
that in your own writing
so<00:02:02.289> it's<00:02:02.470> sinking<00:02:02.860> hmm<00:02:03.459> like<00:02:04.360> one<00:02:04.959> one<00:02:05.500> thing

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
so it's sinking hmm like one one thing

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.680 
so it's sinking hmm like one one thing
