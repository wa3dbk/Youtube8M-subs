ever<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.280> through<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.370> thing<00:00:47.579> together

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
ever I through this thing together

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.150 
ever I through this thing together
pretty<00:00:48.120> fast<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:48.930> when<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.649> think<00:00:49.829> about<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
pretty fast but when you think about it

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.709 
pretty fast but when you think about it
if<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.489> could<00:00:50.670> throw<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.030> together<00:00:51.180> really

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
if I could throw this together really

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.130 
if I could throw this together really
fast<00:00:52.160> then<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.760> mean<00:00:54.329> imagine<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.870> really

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
fast then I mean imagine what really

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
fast then I mean imagine what really
well-constructed<00:00:55.620> ones<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.670> pretty

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
well-constructed ones like so pretty

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.479 
well-constructed ones like so pretty
much<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.300> whole<00:00:57.329> idea<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.840> my<00:00:58.020> deck<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:59.219> use

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
much the whole idea of my deck is I use

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.299 
much the whole idea of my deck is I use
destiny<00:01:00.030> draw<00:01:00.270> discard<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.469> Destiny<00:01:01.980> heroes

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
destiny draw discard the Destiny heroes

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.369 
destiny draw discard the Destiny heroes
i<00:01:02.430> use<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> level<00:01:03.149> 8<00:01:03.300> destiny<00:01:03.719> heroes<00:01:04.019> or

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
i use all the level 8 destiny heroes or

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.840 
i use all the level 8 destiny heroes or
i<00:01:04.439> only<00:01:04.799> use<00:01:04.920> actually<00:01:05.250> i<00:01:05.309> only<00:01:05.489> use<00:01:05.610> plasma

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
i only use actually i only use plasma

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.630 
i only use actually i only use plasma
and<00:01:06.150> dogma<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.590> i<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.860> use<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:08.280> combo

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and dogma but then i can use they combo

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.609 
and dogma but then i can use they combo
with<00:01:08.820> allure<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.150> darkness<00:01:09.479> they<00:01:09.900> combo<00:01:10.350> with

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
with allure of darkness they combo with

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.980 
with allure of darkness they combo with
tradin<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.850> combo<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.299> destiny<00:01:12.750> draw

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
tradin and they combo with destiny draw

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.280 
tradin and they combo with destiny draw
so<00:01:13.560> that's<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:13.979> draw<00:01:14.310> engine<00:01:14.760> +<00:01:15.420> blue<00:01:15.750> eyes<00:01:15.930> now

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
so that's my draw engine + blue eyes now

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.490 
so that's my draw engine + blue eyes now
why<00:01:16.619> run<00:01:16.890> blue<00:01:17.130> eyes<00:01:17.280> over<00:01:18.200> dreadmaster<00:01:19.200> well

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
why run blue eyes over dreadmaster well

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.800 
why run blue eyes over dreadmaster well
here's<00:01:19.770> why<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:21.000> use<00:01:21.119> card<00:01:21.689> of

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
here's why because I can use card of

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.590 
here's why because I can use card of
consonants<00:01:22.439> with<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.250> white<00:01:23.759> zone<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:24.210> Legend

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
consonants with the white zone of Legend

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.440 
consonants with the white zone of Legend
and<00:01:25.250> then<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.520> allows<00:01:26.790> me<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.060> add<00:01:27.150> blue<00:01:27.330> eyes

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and then that allows me to add blue eyes

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.789 
and then that allows me to add blue eyes
to<00:01:27.570> my<00:01:27.659> hands<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.140> since<00:01:28.320> blue<00:01:28.500> eyes<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> so

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
to my hands so since blue eyes is so

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.310 
to my hands so since blue eyes is so
highly<00:01:29.250> searchable<00:01:29.610> that's<00:01:30.270> why<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> use<00:01:30.750> him

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
highly searchable that's why I use him

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.120 
highly searchable that's why I use him
and<00:01:31.880> he<00:01:32.880> combos<00:01:33.240> well<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> trade<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> now

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
and he combos well with the trade so now

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.340 
and he combos well with the trade so now
right<00:01:35.700> here<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.970> make<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> pretty<00:01:36.420> risky<00:01:36.900> play<00:01:37.140> I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
right here I make a pretty risky play I

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.050 
right here I make a pretty risky play I
just<00:01:37.860> go<00:01:38.009> ahead<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.220> play<00:01:38.400> magical<00:01:38.909> mallet

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
just go ahead and play magical mallet

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
just go ahead and play magical mallet
now<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> could<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.170> keep<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.560> Exodia<00:01:40.770> pieces

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
now I could just keep the Exodia pieces

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.800 
now I could just keep the Exodia pieces
in<00:01:41.340> my<00:01:41.369> hand<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.790> only<00:01:41.970> shuffle<00:01:42.299> back<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.600> two

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
in my hand and only shuffle back in two

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.960 
in my hand and only shuffle back in two
cards<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.770> i<00:01:43.829> decided<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.340> shuffle<00:01:44.520> back<00:01:44.759> in

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
cards but i decided to shuffle back in

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.069 
cards but i decided to shuffle back in
my<00:01:45.090> whole<00:01:45.329> hand<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:45.810> when<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.049> think

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
my whole hand because when you think

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.020 
my whole hand because when you think
about<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.189> doesn't<00:01:47.549> matter<00:01:47.610> having

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
about it it really doesn't matter having

doesn't want to go ahead and hit my face
down<00:04:12.370> defense<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:13.000> don't<00:04:13.509> think<00:04:13.599> he<00:04:13.900> knows<00:04:14.079> that

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
down defense I don't think he knows that

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.719 
down defense I don't think he knows that
I<00:04:14.409> don't<00:04:14.500> have<00:04:14.680> all<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.159> blue<00:04:15.340> eyes<00:04:15.489> in<00:04:15.699> my

hand yet
and<00:04:17.230> I<00:04:17.380> think<00:04:17.590> at<00:04:17.680> this<00:04:17.770> point<00:04:17.860> he's<00:04:18.100> just

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
and I think at this point he's just

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.800 
and I think at this point he's just
trying<00:04:18.460> to<00:04:18.520> get<00:04:18.640> like<00:04:18.730> a<00:04:18.760> JD<00:04:19.090> or<00:04:19.360> something

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
trying to get like a JD or something

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.840 
trying to get like a JD or something
that<00:04:19.960> can<00:04:20.080> help<00:04:20.230> them<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.590> he<00:04:21.430> sets<00:04:21.640> another

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
that can help them and he sets another

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.450 
that can help them and he sets another
right<00:04:22.120> go<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.540> then<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:22.960> upstart<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:23.890> I<00:04:24.220> get

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
right go and then I upstart and I get

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.640 
right go and then I upstart and I get
into<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.730> trade<00:04:25.090> in<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.450> then<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.200> trade<00:04:26.500> in

into a trade in and then I trade in
