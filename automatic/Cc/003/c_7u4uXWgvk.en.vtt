and a mediums we have a filter also put
this<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.850> one<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.149> can<00:01:43.299> pop<00:01:43.479> out<00:01:44.250> also<00:01:45.250> what

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
this this one you can pop out also what

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.550 
this this one you can pop out also what
we<00:01:45.729> have<00:01:45.939> that<00:01:46.179> is<00:01:46.329> a<00:01:46.360> graduated<00:01:47.170> liner<00:01:47.439> that

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
we have that is a graduated liner that

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.039 
we have that is a graduated liner that
goes<00:01:47.740> into<00:01:48.280> here<00:01:48.789> it's<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.390> big<00:01:49.569> it<00:01:49.689> can

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
goes into here it's a big it can

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.429 
goes into here it's a big it can
actually<00:01:50.200> measure<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.840> components<00:01:53.380> of

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
actually measure the components of

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.839 
actually measure the components of
whatever<00:01:53.619> they're<00:01:53.920> spraying<00:01:54.159> into<00:01:54.549> the

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
whatever they're spraying into the

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:58.380 
whatever they're spraying into the
system<00:01:55.179> so<00:01:55.929> now<00:01:56.080> what<00:01:56.289> they<00:01:56.409> would<00:01:56.560> do<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:58.090> take

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
system so now what they would do so take

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.160 
system so now what they would do so take
their<00:01:58.569> cup<00:01:58.890> place<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.920> wider<00:02:00.220> wrench<00:02:00.490> would

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
their cup place a wider wrench would

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.960 
their cup place a wider wrench would
place<00:02:02.170> their<00:02:02.380> material<00:02:02.830> into<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.220> whether

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
place their material into it whether

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.639 
place their material into it whether
it's<00:02:04.179> a<00:02:04.240> two<00:02:04.390> part<00:02:04.659> one<00:02:04.720> part<00:02:05.049> doesn't<00:02:05.470> matter

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
it's a two part one part doesn't matter

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.509 
it's a two part one part doesn't matter

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
college one off now if they want to

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.440 
college one off now if they want to
premix<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.170> stage<00:02:18.069> additional<00:02:19.030> material

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
premix and stage additional material

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.979 
premix and stage additional material
what<00:02:19.959> we<00:02:20.049> also<00:02:20.260> have<00:02:20.590> are<00:02:21.190> these<00:02:21.430> plugs<00:02:21.989> that

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
what we also have are these plugs that

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.660 
what we also have are these plugs that
can<00:02:23.140> go<00:02:23.290> into<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.890> top<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.660> also<00:02:26.190> if<00:02:27.190> it's<00:02:27.549> a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
can go into the top and also if it's a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.849 
can go into the top and also if it's a
material<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.150> has<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.450> be<00:02:28.600> mixed<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.170> they

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
material that has to be mixed and they

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.160 
material that has to be mixed and they
have<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> mechanical<00:02:30.579> shaker<00:02:30.819> we<00:02:31.810> have<00:02:31.989> this

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
have a mechanical shaker we have this

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.590 
have a mechanical shaker we have this
color<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.829> can<00:02:33.190> go<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.489> top<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.030> now<00:02:34.209> they

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
color that can go on top and now they

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.879 
color that can go on top and now they
can<00:02:34.750> actually<00:02:35.019> place<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.260> right<00:02:35.560> into<00:02:35.709> the

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:35.889 
can actually place it right into the

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:42.420 
can actually place it right into the
shaker<00:02:37.739> now<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.889> now<00:02:41.889> they<00:02:42.100> have<00:02:42.250> their

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
shaker now so now they have their

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.690 
shaker now so now they have their
material<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:44.260> their<00:02:44.500> cup<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:45.010> they're<00:02:45.579> ready

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
material in their cup and they're ready

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.379 
material in their cup and they're ready
to<00:02:45.819> go<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.660> take<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.870> look<00:02:47.109> at<00:02:47.350> your<00:02:48.389> adapter

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
to go you take a look at your adapter

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.050 
to go you take a look at your adapter

it's<00:03:40.320> now<00:03:40.440> just<00:03:40.709> like<00:03:40.830> as<00:03:40.980> if<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.220> were

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250

as far as painters are concerned

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.410
