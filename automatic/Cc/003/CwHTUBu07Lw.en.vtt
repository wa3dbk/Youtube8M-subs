00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.650
 personal speech beauty a new and 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.380
 this time continuing our series of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.570
 games that marked the 80's is more 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.480
 specifically and this time as people 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.490
 focused on the other previous video plus 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.189
 games released for atari 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.230
 this time we will focus on generation 8 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.750
 bits more specifically games 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.610
 and the master system beauty 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.680
 So that's good 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.930
 beginning with the master system that was the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.620
 the main competitor of the nintendinho in 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.120
 time 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.760
 for starters we have Alex 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.230
 kidd alex kidd initially did a lot 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.000
 console success 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 so much that sega took advantage of its image 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.710
 and turned him into company mascot 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.140
 and make no mistake despite being a game of 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.180
 platform with moderate difficulty 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.210
 game has already left a lot of shell 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.909
 california games summer games is one 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.409
 fun collection of mini games 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.979
 based on various sports such as skateboarding 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.570
 skates and bmx and others that certainly in the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.090
 My opinion was one of the most 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.890
 of the master system black belt a 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.259
 fighting game based on a food of 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.290
 success in Japan had a gameplay 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.490
 very simple but addictive and even a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.560
 some easy way to progress 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.570
 the master system received the various ports 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.180
 arcades for your console 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.100
 one of them was the afterburner a great 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.509
 ship that he placed inside the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.939
 hunting cockpit 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.570
 well at least the arcade version was 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.820
 that 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.610
 despite the limitation of the master system until 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.159
 that the post looked pretty good 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.560
 the revolutionary rpgs h phantasy star 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.840
 which brought incredible graphics to a 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.780
 8-bit console thing that until then 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.479
 nobody expected the art to happen 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.619
 music and perfect gameplay is 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.780
 indispensable for any fan of rpg

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.950
 the themes of some phases are well 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.040
 Similar searches for av 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.170
 the mega drive but the gameplay some 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.959
 mechanics and challenges are totally 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.129

 This game made history in the console. 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.650
 mainly due to its mega difficulty 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.750
