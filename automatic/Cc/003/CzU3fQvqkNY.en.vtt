00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
right now so we have the holes drilled

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.010 
right now so we have the holes drilled
on<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.450> sides<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.410> lighten<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.920> slide<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
on the sides to lighten up the slide and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.410 
on the sides to lighten up the slide and
same<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.530> top<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.399> bottom<00:00:42.170> i

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
same on the top and on the bottom i

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.729 
same on the top and on the bottom i
added<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.629> cocking<00:00:46.260> lever<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.760> can

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
added a cocking lever here so you can

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.290 
added a cocking lever here so you can
cock<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.920> much<00:00:50.100> easier<00:00:50.840> only<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:53.030> appendage<00:00:54.030> i

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
cock it much easier only one appendage i

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.660 
cock it much easier only one appendage i
guess<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.289> could<00:00:55.410> say<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.860> required<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
guess you could say is required to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.900 
guess you could say is required to

so<00:01:13.110> there<00:01:13.530> are<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> couple<00:01:14.100> things<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.729> uh

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
so there are a couple things that uh

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.330 
so there are a couple things that uh
that<00:01:16.970> aren't<00:01:17.970> very<00:01:18.710> satisfactory<00:01:19.710> i<00:01:19.770> guess<00:01:20.100> on

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that aren't very satisfactory i guess on

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.660 
that aren't very satisfactory i guess on
my<00:01:20.400> craftsmanship<00:01:22.790> my<00:01:23.790> drill<00:01:24.950> or<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.369> slide

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
came out of my vice while drilling so

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.249 
came out of my vice while drilling so

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.759 
slide because of the lightened slide and
harder<00:02:28.599> recoil<00:02:29.049> spring<00:02:29.379> this<00:02:30.159> is<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.450> 4.3<00:02:31.769> slide

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
harder recoil spring this is a 4.3 slide

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:40.039 
harder recoil spring this is a 4.3 slide
from<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.519> 4.3<00:02:34.329> desert<00:02:34.780> warrior<00:02:35.079> with<00:02:35.859> a<00:02:36.389> 5.1

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.509 

enhanced<00:02:41.049> recoil<00:02:41.560> springs<00:02:41.829> so<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:42.249> would<00:02:42.400> be

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
enhanced recoil springs so it would be

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.659 
enhanced recoil springs so it would be
enhanced<00:02:43.060> on<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.239> 5.1<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.799> can<00:02:44.980> just<00:02:45.159> tell<00:02:45.250> how

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:45.669 
enhanced on a 5.1 you can just tell how

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.199 
enhanced on a 5.1 you can just tell how
hard<00:02:45.969> it<00:02:46.090> would<00:02:46.180> be<00:02:46.239> on<00:02:46.599> a<00:02:46.689> 4.3<00:02:47.549> very<00:02:48.549> very<00:02:48.849> fast

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
hard it would be on a 4.3 very very fast

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.140 
hard it would be on a 4.3 very very fast
recoil<00:02:50.019> action<00:02:50.169> I<00:02:50.620> was<00:02:51.519> going<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.909> short

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
recoil action I was going to short

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.759 
recoil action I was going to short
stroke<00:02:52.449> it<00:02:52.629> but<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:52.870> don't<00:02:53.139> need<00:02:53.349> to<00:02:53.530> because

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
stroke it but I don't need to because

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.770 
stroke it but I don't need to because
it's<00:02:54.069> so<00:02:54.219> fast<00:02:55.590> it's<00:02:56.590> got<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.919> 5.1<00:02:57.519> barrel<00:02:58.060> so

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
it's so fast it's got the 5.1 barrel so

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.089 
it's so fast it's got the 5.1 barrel so
it's<00:02:58.959> very<00:02:59.109> long<00:02:59.500> and<00:03:01.500> extremely<00:03:02.500> accurate

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
it's very long and extremely accurate

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.099 
it's very long and extremely accurate
like<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.400> said<00:03:04.079> front<00:03:05.079> sights<00:03:06.870> normal<00:03:07.870> front

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
like I said front sights normal front

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.729 
like I said front sights normal front
sights<00:03:08.379> I<00:03:08.709> might<00:03:09.069> get<00:03:09.250> some<00:03:10.530> highlighted<00:03:11.530> ones

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
sights I might get some highlighted ones

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.210 
sights I might get some highlighted ones
I'm<00:03:11.919> not<00:03:12.129> sure<00:03:12.780> same<00:03:14.459> super<00:03:15.459> alpha<00:03:15.819> mag<00:03:16.269> well

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
I'm not sure same super alpha mag well

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.649 
I'm not sure same super alpha mag well
some<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.370> paint<00:03:18.609> got<00:03:18.819> scratched<00:03:19.150> off<00:03:19.389> on

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
some of the paint got scratched off on

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.069 
some of the paint got scratched off on
retaining<00:03:20.349> that<00:03:21.090> same<00:03:22.090> trigger<00:03:22.419> same<00:03:22.840> hammer

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
retaining that same trigger same hammer

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.589

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
like a brand new crystal but i can even

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.020 
like a brand new crystal but i can even
cock<00:04:12.609> this<00:04:12.819> thing<00:04:13.000> with<00:04:13.120> one<00:04:13.299> with<00:04:13.780> one<00:04:13.810> finger
