hi I'm Frank Speer I want to welcome you
to<00:00:13.040> this<00:00:13.160> blog<00:00:13.570> this<00:00:14.570> is<00:00:14.719> going<00:00:14.869> to<00:00:14.930> be<00:00:15.049> our

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
to this blog this is going to be our

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.140 
to this blog this is going to be our
second<00:00:15.619> part<00:00:15.889> of<00:00:16.039> our<00:00:16.189> anterior<00:00:16.580> temporary

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
second part of our anterior temporary

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.179 
second part of our anterior temporary
segment<00:00:17.630> what<00:00:18.349> I'd<00:00:18.439> like<00:00:18.590> to<00:00:18.650> do<00:00:18.890> in<00:00:19.040> this

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
segment what I'd like to do in this

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.040 
segment what I'd like to do in this
segment<00:00:19.490> is<00:00:19.820> talk<00:00:20.060> to<00:00:20.180> you<00:00:20.270> about<00:00:20.360> methods<00:00:20.930> of

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
segment is talk to you about methods of

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.529 
segment is talk to you about methods of
fabrication<00:00:21.880> certainly<00:00:22.880> we<00:00:23.090> can<00:00:23.300> take<00:00:23.509> a

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
fabrication certainly we can take a

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.630 
fabrication certainly we can take a
matrix<00:00:23.869> and<00:00:24.349> we<00:00:24.410> can<00:00:24.439> fabricate<00:00:24.829> our<00:00:25.279> anterior

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
matrix and we can fabricate our anterior

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.370 
matrix and we can fabricate our anterior
temporaries<00:00:26.180> directly<00:00:26.660> in<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:26.869> mouth<00:00:27.050> and

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
temporaries directly in the mouth and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.249 
temporaries directly in the mouth and
it's<00:00:27.860> not<00:00:28.040> infrequent<00:00:28.910> that<00:00:28.969> I<00:00:29.090> do<00:00:29.239> that<00:00:29.630> but<00:00:30.230> I

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
it's not infrequent that I do that but I

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.589 
it's not infrequent that I do that but I
really<00:00:30.710> enjoy<00:00:31.099> in<00:00:31.399> cases<00:00:31.880> where<00:00:32.059> aesthetics

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
really enjoy in cases where aesthetics

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.110 
really enjoy in cases where aesthetics
is<00:00:32.809> really<00:00:33.559> really<00:00:33.739> important<00:00:34.280> I<00:00:34.489> enjoy

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
is really really important I enjoy

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.000 
is really really important I enjoy

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
temporary on and I'm going to actually

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.310 
temporary on and I'm going to actually
do<00:01:07.700> this<00:01:07.850> on<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.060> 10<00:01:08.390> afore<00:01:08.720> missed<00:01:09.050> as<00:01:09.200> an

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
do this on a 10 afore missed as an

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.190 
do this on a 10 afore missed as an
example<00:01:09.979> of<00:01:10.729> what<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:11.300> may<00:01:11.479> be<00:01:11.540> doing<00:01:11.840> in<00:01:12.080> the

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
example of what you may be doing in the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.889 
example of what you may be doing in the
patient's<00:01:12.860> mouth<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:13.790> in<00:01:13.969> fact<00:01:14.240> we're<00:01:14.630> going

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
patient's mouth so in fact we're going

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.950 
patient's mouth so in fact we're going
to<00:01:15.280> make<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.490> model<00:01:16.969> using<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.420> mock<00:01:17.719> 2

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
to make a model using the mock 2

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.959 
to make a model using the mock 2
silicone<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.799> then<00:01:18.920> bite<00:01:19.189> registration

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
silicone and then bite registration

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.060 
silicone and then bite registration
paste<00:01:20.240> as<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.509> base<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:21.590> what<00:01:21.920> the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
paste as a base this is what the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.350 
paste as a base this is what the
silicone<00:01:22.490> model<00:01:22.820> is<00:01:22.880> going<00:01:23.030> to<00:01:23.090> look<00:01:23.329> like

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
silicone model is going to look like

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.120 
silicone model is going to look like
we're<00:01:23.930> going<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.140> then<00:01:24.320> use<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.950> actually

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
we're going to then use it to actually

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.639 
we're going to then use it to actually
make<00:01:25.579> our<00:01:25.759> temporary<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:26.539> literally<00:01:27.439> we'll

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
make our temporary and literally we'll

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.370 
make our temporary and literally we'll
just<00:01:27.890> take<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.130> matrix<00:01:28.840> what<00:01:29.840> I've<00:01:29.990> done<00:01:30.200> is

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
just take a matrix what I've done is

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.929 
just take a matrix what I've done is
make<00:01:30.409> an<00:01:30.740> alginate<00:01:30.920> impression<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.789> the

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
make an alginate impression of the

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.300 
make an alginate impression of the
dennah<00:01:32.119> form<00:01:32.450> pour<00:01:32.810> it<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:33.110> stone<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:33.770> then

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
dennah form pour it in stone and then

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.340 
dennah form pour it in stone and then
pressure<00:01:34.670> form<00:01:35.149> a<00:01:35.329> matrix<00:01:35.539> out<00:01:35.930> of<00:01:36.049> a<00:01:36.110> product

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
pressure form a matrix out of a product

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.719 
pressure form a matrix out of a product
called<00:01:36.649> copy<00:01:36.979> blast

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
called copy blast

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.270 
called copy blast
we'll<00:01:38.420> make<00:01:38.570> sure<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.990> copy<00:01:39.229> plus<00:01:39.590> seats<00:01:40.009> on

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
we'll make sure the copy plus seats on

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.999 
we'll make sure the copy plus seats on
the<00:01:40.399> silicone<00:01:40.880> model<00:01:41.329> will<00:01:42.079> then<00:01:42.289> inject<00:01:42.770> our

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
the silicone model will then inject our

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.099 
the silicone model will then inject our
material<00:01:43.640> or<00:01:43.820> temporary<00:01:44.329> material<00:01:44.750> into<00:01:45.079> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.569 
once it's hard we can lift it off and
then<00:01:53.840> in<00:01:53.990> future<00:01:54.439> segments<00:01:55.039> we'll<00:01:55.189> go<00:01:55.340> through

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
then in future segments we'll go through

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.240 
then in future segments we'll go through
how<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.759> trim<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:56.359> and<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.229> here's<00:01:57.829> a<00:01:57.890> very

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
how to trim it and so here's a very

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.459 
how to trim it and so here's a very
simple<00:01:58.429> way<00:01:58.969> to<00:01:59.000> do<00:01:59.270> it<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.570> simply<00:01:59.990> mix<00:02:00.289> up

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
simple way to do it you simply mix up

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.800 
simple way to do it you simply mix up
your<00:02:00.500> alginate<00:02:01.130> impression<00:02:01.219> material<00:02:01.850> put<00:02:02.719> it

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
your alginate impression material put it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.649 
your alginate impression material put it
in<00:02:02.929> a<00:02:03.049> centric<00:02:03.590> syringe<00:02:04.070> or<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.399> mono<00:02:05.329> jet

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
in a centric syringe or a mono jet

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.710 
in a centric syringe or a mono jet
syringe<00:02:06.109> and<00:02:06.469> now<00:02:07.429> inject<00:02:08.030> your<00:02:08.210> alginate<00:02:08.690> and

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
syringe and now inject your alginate and

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.540 
syringe and now inject your alginate and
then<00:02:08.899> seat<00:02:09.200> your<00:02:09.440> tray<00:02:09.649> over<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.039> top<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.280> it

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
then seat your tray over the top of it

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.870 
then seat your tray over the top of it
and<00:02:11.560> now<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.620> have<00:02:13.070> an<00:02:13.250> alginate<00:02:13.790> impression

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
and now you have an alginate impression

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.360 
and now you have an alginate impression
of<00:02:14.510> your<00:02:14.690> preps<00:02:14.990> typically<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:15.980> would<00:02:16.190> always

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
of your preps typically I would always

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.020 
of your preps typically I would always
do<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:16.940> after<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.599> final<00:02:17.900> impression<00:02:18.470> so

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
do that after the final impression so

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.850 
do that after the final impression so
that<00:02:19.120> I've<00:02:19.240> gotten<00:02:19.540> retractions<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.830> I

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
that I've gotten retractions so that I

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.920 
that I've gotten retractions so that I
know<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.130> should<00:02:21.459> capture<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.120> margins<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.720> my

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
know I should capture the margins of my

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.890 
know I should capture the margins of my
preps<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.590> alginate<00:02:24.330> then<00:02:25.330> we're<00:02:25.810> gonna

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
preps in the alginate then we're gonna

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.380 
preps in the alginate then we're gonna
take<00:02:26.200> our<00:02:26.410> mock<00:02:26.680> two<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:27.459> as<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:27.880> said<00:02:27.940> mock

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
take our mock two and as I said mock

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.600 
take our mock two and as I said mock
slow<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.110> little<00:02:29.410> slower<00:02:29.650> setting<00:02:30.010> mock<00:02:30.400> two

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
slow is a little slower setting mock two

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.120 
slow is a little slower setting mock two
you<00:02:30.760> have<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:31.000> work<00:02:31.150> pretty<00:02:31.390> fast<00:02:31.590> we<00:02:32.590> inject

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
you have to work pretty fast we inject

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.000 
you have to work pretty fast we inject
it<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.610> fills<00:02:34.090> up<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.450> alginate<00:02:35.200> up<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.890> the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
it so it fills up the alginate up to the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.010 
it so it fills up the alginate up to the
gingival<00:02:36.520> margins<00:02:37.030> we<00:02:37.180> basically<00:02:37.510> want<00:02:37.810> the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
gingival margins we basically want the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.500 
gingival margins we basically want the
teeth<00:02:38.319> filled<00:02:38.680> up<00:02:38.920> with<00:02:39.069> mock<00:02:39.340> two<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.880> then

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
teeth filled up with mock two and then

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.199 
teeth filled up with mock two and then
using<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.290> bite<00:02:41.530> registration<00:02:42.340> paste<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:43.000> is

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
using a bite registration paste this is

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.870 
using a bite registration paste this is
a<00:02:43.239> cue<00:02:43.690> flow<00:02:43.989> over<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.950> top<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.580> then

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
a cue flow over the top and then

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.699 
a cue flow over the top and then
inverting<00:02:46.569> it<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.870> putting<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.410> little

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
inverting it and putting it on a little

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.610 
inverting it and putting it on a little
plastic<00:02:47.920> slab<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:49.000> you'll<00:02:49.810> see<00:02:50.050> why<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:50.500> a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
plastic slab and you'll see why in a

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.949 
plastic slab and you'll see why in a
minute<00:02:50.739> I<00:02:50.980> like<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.340> do<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.600> there's<00:02:52.810> the

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
minute I like to do that so there's the

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.420 
minute I like to do that so there's the
bottom<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.470> plastic<00:02:53.980> you<00:02:54.070> can<00:02:54.190> see<00:02:54.280> it's

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
bottom of the plastic you can see it's

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.850 
bottom of the plastic you can see it's
perfectly<00:02:54.580> flat<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.720> now<00:02:56.200> we've<00:02:56.500> got<00:02:56.830> our

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
perfectly flat and now we've got our

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.400 
perfectly flat and now we've got our
model<00:02:57.730> literally<00:02:58.540> within<00:02:58.690> two<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.200> three

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
model literally within two to three

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.990 
model literally within two to three
minutes<00:02:59.739> time<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.280> if<00:03:00.340> there's<00:03:00.519> any<00:03:00.670> little

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
minutes time and if there's any little

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.670 
minutes time and if there's any little
bubbles<00:03:01.570> that<00:03:01.720> were<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.140> alginate<00:03:02.470> you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
bubbles that were in the alginate you

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.729 
bubbles that were in the alginate you
can<00:03:02.860> pick<00:03:03.070> them<00:03:03.280> off<00:03:03.489> now<00:03:04.330> why<00:03:04.900> make<00:03:05.380> the

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
can pick them off now why make the

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.670 
can pick them off now why make the
silicone<00:03:06.430> model<00:03:06.760> on<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:06.880> flat<00:03:07.180> plate<00:03:07.680> because

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
silicone model on a flat plate because

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.740 
silicone model on a flat plate because
when<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.010> see<00:03:09.340> your<00:03:09.760> matrix<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:10.480> want<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.690> be

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
when you see your matrix you want to be

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.290 
when you see your matrix you want to be
able<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.930> push<00:03:11.290> on<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:11.920> if<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.850> silicone

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
able to push on it and if the silicone

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.360 
able to push on it and if the silicone
doesn't<00:03:13.569> have<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> flat<00:03:14.110> base<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.709> can<00:03:14.860> distort

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
doesn't have a flat base it can distort

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.820 
doesn't have a flat base it can distort
so<00:03:16.060> we<00:03:16.209> make<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.660> silicone<00:03:17.080> model<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.590> flat

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
so we make the silicone model on a flat

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.740 
so we make the silicone model on a flat
base<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.370> we<00:03:18.489> can<00:03:18.610> literally<00:03:18.940> put<00:03:19.269> our<00:03:19.360> matrix

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
base so we can literally put our matrix

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.870 
base so we can literally put our matrix
down<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.110> put<00:03:20.260> pressure<00:03:20.470> on<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.130> not<00:03:21.580> have

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
down and put pressure on it and not have

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.720 
down and put pressure on it and not have
the<00:03:22.060> model<00:03:22.420> distort<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.489> here's<00:03:24.489> how<00:03:24.670> that

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
the model distort and here's how that

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.020 
the model distort and here's how that
would<00:03:25.030> look<00:03:26.010> trying<00:03:27.010> in<00:03:27.220> this<00:03:27.340> case<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.790> copy

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
would look trying in this case the copy

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.270 
would look trying in this case the copy
plaster<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:28.690> like<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.079> use<00:03:29.200> clear<00:03:29.560> copy<00:03:29.829> plastic

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
as I can see what I'm doing with it

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.740

about the gingival margin and now go

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.140 
about the gingival margin and now go
ahead<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.530> put<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:44.920> matrix<00:03:45.579> onto<00:03:45.820> the

down on it now it won't distort because

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.849 
down on it now it won't distort because
it's<00:03:53.260> got<00:03:53.410> a<00:03:53.440> flat<00:03:53.709> base<00:03:53.950> on<00:03:54.280> it<00:03:54.870> once<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.170> pro

choice<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:58.840> hardened<00:03:59.260> you<00:03:59.980> can<00:04:00.220> now<00:04:00.370> lift<00:04:00.670> it

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
choice is hardened you can now lift it

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.509 
choice is hardened you can now lift it
off<00:04:01.200> typically<00:04:02.200> again<00:04:02.709> since<00:04:03.040> its<00:04:03.250> silicone

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
and now you simply move your matrix peel

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.229 
and now you simply move your matrix peel
it<00:04:11.049> away<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:11.590> there's<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.430> temporary<00:04:12.940> ready

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.789 
for trimming and you know usually for me
it<00:04:16.299> would<00:04:16.390> be<00:04:16.419> done<00:04:16.539> from<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.989> diagnostic<00:04:17.350> wax

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
it would be done from a diagnostic wax

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.979 
it would be done from a diagnostic wax
up<00:04:18.100> as<00:04:18.250> I<00:04:18.400> said<00:04:18.640> this<00:04:18.820> was<00:04:19.030> done<00:04:19.239> just<00:04:19.269> directly

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
up as I said this was done just directly

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.719 
up as I said this was done just directly

dennah form but a very easy technique to
make<00:04:25.330> temporaries<00:04:25.900> because<00:04:26.590> once<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:27.039> have<00:04:27.130> a

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
make temporaries because once you have a

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.279 
make temporaries because once you have a
model<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.760> work<00:04:28.000> with<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.360> see<00:04:28.720> everything

better you see the occlusal plane you
see

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330

you've enjoyed this segment as I said
this<00:04:52.210> is<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.389> technique<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:52.930> I've<00:04:53.319> used<00:04:53.349> for

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
this is a technique that I've used for

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.490 
this is a technique that I've used for
years<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.490> use<00:04:54.939> stone<00:04:55.360> a<00:04:55.389> lot<00:04:55.780> when<00:04:56.020> I'm<00:04:56.139> not<00:04:56.289> in

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
years I use stone a lot when I'm not in

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.080 
years I use stone a lot when I'm not in
a<00:04:56.590> hurry<00:04:56.770> I'll<00:04:57.069> actually<00:04:57.250> take<00:04:57.639> an<00:04:57.789> impression

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
a hurry I'll actually take an impression

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.179 
a hurry I'll actually take an impression
the<00:04:58.449> second<00:04:58.840> silicone<00:04:59.289> impression<00:04:59.830> not<00:05:00.039> an

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:00.189 
the second silicone impression not an

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.339 
the second silicone impression not an
alginate<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:00.699> pour<00:05:00.969> stone<00:05:01.270> in<00:05:01.479> it<00:05:01.629> but<00:05:02.139> if<00:05:02.259> you

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
alginate and pour stone in it but if you

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.170 
alginate and pour stone in it but if you
want<00:05:02.530> a<00:05:02.590> fast<00:05:02.979> answer<00:05:03.430> or<00:05:03.699> temporary

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
want a fast answer or temporary

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.390 
want a fast answer or temporary
technique<00:05:04.539> that's<00:05:04.810> very<00:05:05.050> effective<00:05:05.400> using

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
technique that's very effective using

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.950 
technique that's very effective using
the<00:05:06.520> mock<00:05:06.729> to<00:05:07.000> model<00:05:07.389> is<00:05:07.509> one<00:05:07.690> of<00:05:07.810> those

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
the mock to model is one of those

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.990 
the mock to model is one of those
techniques<00:05:08.409> so<00:05:09.280> I'll<00:05:09.400> look<00:05:09.550> forward<00:05:09.909> to

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
techniques so I'll look forward to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.309 
techniques so I'll look forward to
seeing<00:05:10.210> you<00:05:10.330> in<00:05:10.449> the<00:05:10.479> next<00:05:10.690> segment<00:05:11.199> when

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:11.319 
seeing you in the next segment when

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.450 
seeing you in the next segment when
we're<00:05:11.469> actually<00:05:11.620> going<00:05:11.889> to<00:05:11.949> start<00:05:12.039> trimming

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
we're actually going to start trimming

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.849 
we're actually going to start trimming
things
