00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
YouTube and really our opponents they

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.280 
YouTube and really our opponents they
weren't<00:03:54.909> playing<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.299> greater<00:03:55.540> defense<00:03:56.049> I

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
weren't playing that greater defense I

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.509 
weren't playing that greater defense I
mean<00:03:56.590> idea<00:03:56.829> how<00:03:56.949> that<00:03:56.979> sent<00:03:57.280> her<00:03:57.340> down<00:03:57.459> there

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
mean idea how that sent her down there

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.159 
mean idea how that sent her down there
and<00:03:57.849> it's<00:03:58.030> pretty<00:03:58.120> difficult<00:03:58.389> to<00:03:58.690> get<00:03:58.840> by<00:03:58.959> him

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
and it's pretty difficult to get by him

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.170 
and it's pretty difficult to get by him
but<00:03:59.680> he<00:03:59.799> was<00:03:59.919> jumping<00:04:00.190> at<00:04:00.310> everything<00:04:00.699> so

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
but he was jumping at everything so

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.610 
but he was jumping at everything so
spark<00:04:01.479> I'm<00:04:01.690> pretty<00:04:01.900> sure<00:04:02.079> he<00:04:02.199> want<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.409> go<00:04:02.470> in

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
spark I'm pretty sure he want to go in

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.319 
spark I'm pretty sure he want to go in
for<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:02.829> layin<00:04:03.010> right<00:04:03.310> there<00:04:03.549> but<00:04:04.000> he<00:04:04.180> made

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
for the layin right there but he made

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.899 
for the layin right there but he made
two<00:04:04.449> jumper<00:04:04.720> anyways<00:04:05.109> and<00:04:05.590> also<00:04:05.769> all<00:04:06.190> pics<00:04:06.489> it
