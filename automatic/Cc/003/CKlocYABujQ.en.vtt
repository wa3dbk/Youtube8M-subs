always<00:01:47.840> kind<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:48.200> been<00:01:48.350> this<00:01:48.890> length<00:01:49.400> and<00:01:49.760> then

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
always kind of been this length and then

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.150 
always kind of been this length and then
this<00:01:50.330> like<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.810> longest<00:01:51.140> piece<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:52.010> that's

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
this like the longest piece so that's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.860 
this like the longest piece so that's
kind<00:01:52.460> of<00:01:52.490> how<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:52.760> always<00:01:52.970> grows<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:53.750> it's
