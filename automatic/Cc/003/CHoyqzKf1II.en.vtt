00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.020
 further drive some wafer battles 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.099
 today again with a multicar with him 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.750
 together and yes it was the last one 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.450
 multicard from last week against marc 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.010
 and dani and a pretty funny one 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.170
 I'll give you the money right away 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.520
 show and for the plan for next 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.320
 week i have whole for next week 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.779
 many 66 fights for you and yesterday 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.510
 added you shall rejoice are 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.210
 some really good fights though 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.980
 I have the best unfortunately lost 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.050
 but I lost the files 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.510
 can save because you then opponents 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.329
 until connected is what I thought was a pity 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.440
 because he was already money but what the heck 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.090
 you can not do anything we catch now 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.239
 just with our fight today 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.670
 against dani and like that again 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.770
 a six against six fight 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.079
 that's why i can not say but it 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.480
 was a double fight multicar better 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.690
 said and ask them the two 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.149
 with your logo and your access and we 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.949
 both begin at our moore and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.990
 kutcher moore the la paz which was quite off 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.920
 you have to say and my respect 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.759
 launcher my little glass 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.560
 yes I 'll just go now 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.960
 try to say the german terms 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.219
 and directly measure the future correctly 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.700
 cool book of the two because they 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:25.740
 Change to the rhine people than to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.920
 certificate at risen 2 really cool 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.179
 but actually the implementation bit 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.560
 failed perhaps would prefer 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.700
 We should start with the two of us 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.049
 a much better team 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.899
 instead of just switching in here 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.459
 be josepha gossip main where you still one 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.759
 But it does not matter a bit 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:45.000
 Choice where you're just horny and 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.649
 that seems to you because actually quite 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.299
 Well, he has to say well 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.920
 server why not thought her 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.630
 always so much falls out of me 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.500
 the good one must say it missed the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.569
 Of course not with the mother 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.060
 so that's how we do it ourselves 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.569
 harm that was not so high because will 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.549
 halved because he is two opponents unfortunately 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.170
 At that time , too, for improved also in the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.429
 third generation not the opponent 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.160
 which we also pretty cool 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.209
 and we have those again 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.180
 cemetery wall in the action 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.730
 freeze-drying an ice on the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.470
 watering one is very effective quite 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.780
 well, there you are not up 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.299
 Thunder Blitz instructed and has so 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.700
 an alternative to ground pokémon 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.030
 then of course against elektra 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.280
 are resistant 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.900
 and at the end also what comes at the end but 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.329
 after both the dance change in 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.370
 of course here ferox rhine included 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:43.019
 your granger your quality increase 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.209
 Steve is actually relatively good 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.239
 So pokémon you can not go wrong 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.950
 because it is too 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.690
 physical side can deal well with 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.519
 cascades all the trimmings but quasi 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.510
 Of course, those are missing 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.910
 physical stage 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.769
 there you have to say that the physical 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.030
 generally the saeco 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.380
 that's not how it really is 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.450
 You can plug in talented punches 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.549
 I believe that a booking of 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.099
 he is mega shadow steers the other 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.069
 is of course in lubbock and as me 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.049
 I thought so directly 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.719
 that has now become a mega pressure and 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.730
 apropos logo my friends logo is 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.200
 now officially back in the uba in the 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.700
 sixth generation that means logo is allowed 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.049
 no longer fight in the standard 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.239
 of course you can 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.859
 use as much as you want in the online 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.180
 rating fight but if you 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.409
 somehow like that and 6 against 6 5 against 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.219
 make someone else or up 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.099
 takes part in tournaments 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:35.540
 So at online tournaments then one is 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.239
 logo now mostly in the future 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.709
 most likely prohibited 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.560
 I do not know how it happened 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.419
 I'm curious what reason tomorrow 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.950
 Actually I find out so easy 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.480
 not overboard speed bus back and forth 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.260
 There are so many other pokémon mystery 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.900
 boost that also have certain their accounts 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.819
 you can say but continue is just like that 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.169
 pokémon where it is unnecessary to fan 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.669
 somehow I do not care if it looks 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.530
 I also have to say that very cool 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:06.199
 the pose, for example, everything and 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.349
 I fire so much fire very much 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.609
 drive aha you and I will first 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.530
 again a bit hurt to knock out 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.730
 at the logos or we both have ourselves 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:19.190
 determined that we first that 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.509
 Go on the vision as a logo account and that 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.909
 logo will also have to plug in well 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.220
 Users in flames flash around my jaw 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:28.190
 unfortunately to defeat kiefers bit 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:34.880
 a fix line so well at 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:36.800
 logo has one opposite iron skull one 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.349
 Unfortunately, resistance and actually as 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.970
 Depp comment and sucker punch 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.300
 also does not really hitting logo and logo 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:48.710
 for users, one is just too slow 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.300
 but somehow authentic on this 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.280
 logo already so far to dampen that me 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.370
 then only my pump rhine to week 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.500
 From the Balkans, earthquakes and earthquakes hit 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.449
 I just place both sides yet 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.520
 once her with her memoir what you 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:05.060
 I'm pretty lazy and I have to 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.160
 a bit later decided only 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.710
 a splitter around this logo 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.240
 yes, but to eventual or 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.540
 less a splitter of construction is easy 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.240
 horny point on it the skill ick det 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.960
 because of that or by what its physical 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.330
 near where by fire and ice hack 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.610
 the half be lowered what is 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.050
 pretty much I like my fans 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.350
 no fire we weaken more or 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.060
 less and ice attack stop it 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.520
 Unfortunately , that's not exactly what it is 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.730
 weakness before weeks still neutral 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.720
 damage and ice attacks are more then 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:45.980
 or less resistances by several 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.990
 walks went pretty cool so if 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.300
 the sticky mega scirocco remains 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.850
 actually there is a bug east 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.920
 water would be quite good with mega scirocco 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:59.630
 peter of course with the remains 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:02.330
 lack of recovery but how do you get 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:06.920
 that met in osterwick you love 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.570
 So yes you so as we said so we 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.600
 and I, as I said first here with 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.690
 was Finnish earthquake can so beautifully 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.020
 It then maintains this risk a 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.920
 step b with live on not stand up and 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.770
 meatier and has a resistance against 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.000
 perpetrators against hover and with that we have 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.380
 won the fight I found the fight 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.900
 pretty yellow so thank you very much 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.110
 marks dani for the fight in portocolom 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.390
 but definitely or or has the hand 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.610
 harder still look or yes exactly on in 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.340
 excel is yes but goes for next 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.830
 should not be a problem anymore 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:43.100
 is only clever of the world 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.600
 is of course subjective and at the end 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.740
 learning the double fight is always 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.260
 handy if you partner one 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.430
 switch off first because it allows you to 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.500
 his two against one situations 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.130
 generate here 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.050
 now is always good double fight and 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.880
 so even here for this 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.020
 next 40 offers pretty crass of 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.580
 kumba is not from bad parents 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.030
 my friends even a hard one 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.590
 well , yes my friends few 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.700
 lamp to come I or battle has 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.610
 you are looking forward to the 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.610
 get ready from the three-master
