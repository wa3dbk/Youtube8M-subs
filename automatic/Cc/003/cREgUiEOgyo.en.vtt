the<00:00:38.210> product<00:00:38.630> code<00:00:38.840> of<00:00:39.260> this<00:00:39.530> it's<00:00:39.860> 70<00:00:40.310> IB<00:00:40.850> and

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
the product code of this it's 70 IB and

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.210 
the product code of this it's 70 IB and
the<00:00:41.210> ivy<00:00:41.630> stands<00:00:41.990> for<00:00:42.170> stainless<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:42.830> you<00:00:42.890> know

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
the ivy stands for stainless so you know

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.620 
the ivy stands for stainless so you know
that<00:00:43.430> there's<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.790> shackle<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:44.540> the

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
that there's the shackle and the

that there's the shackle and the
internal<00:00:45.050> components<00:00:45.650> are<00:00:45.920> stainless<00:00:46.270> so<00:00:47.270> if

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
internal components are stainless so if

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.760 
internal components are stainless so if

weatherproof padlock it comes in one

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.220 
weatherproof padlock it comes in one
size<00:01:00.520> of<00:01:01.520> body<00:01:01.820> but<00:01:02.300> with<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.570> longer<00:01:02.870> shackle

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
size of body but with the longer shackle

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.300 
size of body but with the longer shackle
also<00:01:03.850> it<00:01:04.850> is<00:01:05.059> a<00:01:05.089> fully<00:01:05.479> stainless<00:01:06.310> shackle

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
also it is a fully stainless shackle

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.469 
also it is a fully stainless shackle
it's<00:01:07.939> got<00:01:08.299> a<00:01:08.570> brass<00:01:09.140> non<00:01:09.470> corrosive<00:01:09.770> body<00:01:10.130> and

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
it's got a brass non corrosive body and

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.999 
it's got a brass non corrosive body and
all<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.810> pins<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.229> mechanism<00:01:12.679> were<00:01:12.770> also

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
all the pins and mechanism were also

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.760 
all the pins and mechanism were also
stainless<00:01:13.280> steel<00:01:14.020> then<00:01:15.020> got<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.320> rain<00:01:15.499> cover

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
stainless steel then got the rain cover

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.010 
stainless steel then got the rain cover
basically<00:01:16.729> stops<00:01:17.060> grit<00:01:17.329> and<00:01:17.539> stuff<00:01:17.780> getting

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
basically stops grit and stuff getting

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.789 
basically stops grit and stuff getting
thrown<00:01:18.649> up<00:01:18.799> inside<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.189> mechanism<00:01:20.469> so<00:01:21.469> the

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
thrown up inside the mechanism so the

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.080 
thrown up inside the mechanism so the
thing<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.069> consider<00:01:22.219> when<00:01:22.549> buying<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:22.909> lock

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
thing to consider when buying a lock

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.809 
thing to consider when buying a lock
like<00:01:23.119> this<00:01:23.329> is<00:01:23.869> that<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.829> lock<00:01:25.009> inside<00:01:25.460> does

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
like this is that the lock inside does

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.969 
like this is that the lock inside does
need<00:01:26.119> to<00:01:26.149> be<00:01:26.329> weatherproof<00:01:27.259> otherwise<00:01:27.710> it'll

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
need to be weatherproof otherwise it'll

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.859 
need to be weatherproof otherwise it'll
just<00:01:28.130> sweat<00:01:28.490> inside<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.060> condensation<00:01:29.719> will

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
just sweat inside and condensation will

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.840 
just sweat inside and condensation will
cause<00:01:30.079> it<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.200> rust<00:01:30.409> from<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.679> inside<00:01:30.979> out<00:01:31.009> if

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
cause it to rust from the inside out if

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.459 
cause it to rust from the inside out if
we<00:01:32.060> take<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.859> cheaper<00:01:33.859> copy

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
we take a cheaper copy

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.649 
we take a cheaper copy
inside<00:01:36.469> this<00:01:36.740> is<00:01:36.979> literally<00:01:37.549> just<00:01:37.579> a<00:01:38.179> steel

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
inside this is literally just a steel

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.629 
inside this is literally just a steel
laminated<00:01:39.289> lock<00:01:39.499> that<00:01:39.710> can<00:01:39.920> rust<00:01:40.249> and<00:01:40.549> then

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:40.639 
laminated lock that can rust and then

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:42.069 
laminated lock that can rust and then
they<00:01:40.759> put<00:01:40.939> a<00:01:40.969> case<00:01:41.210> on<00:01:41.389> the<00:01:41.509> outside<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:42.049> make

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
they put a case on the outside to make

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.840 
they put a case on the outside to make
it<00:01:42.259> look<00:01:42.679> like<00:01:43.340> it's<00:01:43.549> going<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.789> be

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
it look like it's going to be

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.669 
it look like it's going to be
weatherproof<00:01:44.329> this<00:01:44.840> will<00:01:45.020> actually<00:01:45.139> be<00:01:45.289> worse

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
weatherproof this will actually be worse

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.480 
weatherproof this will actually be worse
than<00:01:46.490> if<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:46.999> lock<00:01:47.149> was<00:01:47.299> exposed<00:01:47.719> directly<00:01:48.490> so

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
than if the lock was exposed directly so

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.059 
than if the lock was exposed directly so
that's<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.149> abus<00:01:50.569> expedition<00:01:51.439> weatherproof

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
that's the abus expedition weatherproof

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.449 
that's the abus expedition weatherproof
