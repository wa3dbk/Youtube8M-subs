zs3<00:00:13.040> it<00:00:14.030> looks<00:00:14.360> very<00:00:14.450> similar<00:00:14.990> to<00:00:15.230> its

zs3 it looks very similar to its
predecessor<00:00:15.590> the<00:00:16.189> TZ<00:00:16.640> five<00:00:16.850> but<00:00:17.360> this<00:00:17.510> one<00:00:17.660> has

a<00:00:17.810> 12x<00:00:18.410> zoom<00:00:18.470> lens<00:00:18.800> that<00:00:19.070> goes<00:00:19.220> from<00:00:19.610> 25

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
a 12x zoom lens that goes from 25

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.230 
a 12x zoom lens that goes from 25
millimeters<00:00:20.900> to<00:00:21.320> 300<00:00:21.860> millimeters<00:00:22.400> in<00:00:22.580> 35

millimeter equivalent terms that's a

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.189 
millimeter equivalent terms that's a
pretty<00:00:25.610> broad<00:00:25.820> range<00:00:26.150> to<00:00:26.359> cover<00:00:26.570> but

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
pretty broad range to cover but

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.960 
pretty broad range to cover but
panasonic<00:00:27.830> does<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.010> pretty<00:00:28.190> good<00:00:28.310> job<00:00:28.430> the

panasonic does a pretty good job the

lens is pretty sharp and there isn't a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.729 
lens is pretty sharp and there isn't a
lot<00:00:32.059> of<00:00:32.180> distortion<00:00:32.569> that's<00:00:33.440> because

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
lot of distortion that's because

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.709 
lot of distortion that's because
panasonic<00:00:34.370> applies<00:00:34.670> distortion<00:00:35.569> correction

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719

in camera unfortunately you still see a

in camera unfortunately you still see a
few<00:00:38.659> image<00:00:38.899> artifacts<00:00:39.499> because<00:00:39.769> that's<00:00:39.949> one

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
few image artifacts because that's one

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.779 
few image artifacts because that's one
thing<00:00:40.219> they<00:00:40.370> can't<00:00:40.699> fix<00:00:40.999> but<00:00:41.960> overall

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
thing they can't fix but overall

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.189

compared<00:00:43.789> to<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.329> rest<00:00:44.479> of<00:00:44.600> its<00:00:44.749> class<00:00:44.960> it

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
compared to the rest of its class it

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.439 
compared to the rest of its class it
does<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.379> very<00:00:45.559> good<00:00:45.799> job<00:00:45.969> this<00:00:46.969> is<00:00:47.120> a<00:00:47.149> 10

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
does a very good job this is a 10

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.719 
does a very good job this is a 10
megapixel<00:00:47.600> camera<00:00:48.379> but<00:00:48.649> unlike<00:00:49.069> its<00:00:49.339> brother

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
megapixel camera but unlike its brother

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.989 
megapixel camera but unlike its brother
the<00:00:50.059> cs1<00:00:50.629> it<00:00:51.229> uses<00:00:51.620> a<00:00:51.649> 12<00:00:52.010> megapixel<00:00:52.190> sensor

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
the cs1 it uses a 12 megapixel sensor

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.449 
the cs1 it uses a 12 megapixel sensor
instead<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.629> a<00:00:53.690> 10<00:00:53.899> megapixel<00:00:54.049> sensor<00:00:54.799> that

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:55.459 
instead of a 10 megapixel sensor that

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:58.000 
instead of a 10 megapixel sensor that
way<00:00:55.839> panasonic<00:00:56.839> can<00:00:56.959> keep<00:00:57.139> the<00:00:57.289> same<00:00:57.530> angle<00:00:57.949> of

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
way panasonic can keep the same angle of

that<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:45.200> has<00:01:45.230> a<00:01:45.350> nice<00:01:45.530> big<00:01:45.860> LCD<00:01:46.420> unfortunately

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
that it has a nice big LCD unfortunately

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.790 
that it has a nice big LCD unfortunately
I<00:01:47.450> found<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.230> screen<00:01:48.470> was<00:01:48.620> a<00:01:48.650> bit

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
I found that the screen was a bit

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.160 
I found that the screen was a bit
reflective<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:49.490> in<00:01:49.610> direct<00:01:49.909> sunlight<00:01:50.240> it's<00:01:50.930> a

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
reflective so in direct sunlight it's a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.080 
reflective so in direct sunlight it's a
little<00:01:51.500> hard<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:51.770> see<00:01:51.950> especially<00:01:52.460> if<00:01:52.970> you're

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
little hard to see especially if you're

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.730 
little hard to see especially if you're
trying<00:01:53.120> to<00:01:53.420> view<00:01:53.630> things<00:01:53.810> at<00:01:54.110> a<00:01:54.140> slight<00:01:54.500> off
