00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
there now it's very simple from here

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.129 
there now it's very simple from here
there's<00:02:33.700> not<00:02:33.790> going<00:02:33.939> to<00:02:34.000> be<00:02:34.090> any<00:02:34.209> kneading<00:02:34.659> you

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
there's not going to be any kneading you

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.349 
there's not going to be any kneading you
want<00:02:35.379> to<00:02:35.560> distribute<00:02:36.430> these<00:02:36.579> ingredients

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
want to distribute these ingredients

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.170 
want to distribute these ingredients
very<00:02:37.750> well<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.739> once<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.219> have<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.549> pretty

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
very well so once you have it pretty

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.209 
very well so once you have it pretty
firmly<00:02:40.599> mixed<00:02:41.560> together<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.919> you'll<00:02:42.040> see

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:42.219 
firmly mixed together and you'll see

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.489 
firmly mixed together and you'll see
that<00:02:42.370> I'm<00:02:42.489> kind<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.849> lifting<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.930> over<00:02:44.379> on

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:44.499 
that I'm kind of lifting it over on

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.979 
that I'm kind of lifting it over on
itself<00:02:44.919> to<00:02:45.069> make<00:02:45.310> sure<00:02:45.489> there's<00:02:45.700> nothing<00:02:45.989> at

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
itself to make sure there's nothing at

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.509 
itself to make sure there's nothing at
the<00:02:47.049> bottom<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.680> bowl<00:02:47.859> that<00:02:47.889> hasn't<00:02:48.310> been

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
the bottom of the bowl that hasn't been

the bottom of the bowl that hasn't been
mixed<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:50.049> now<00:02:50.139> this<00:02:50.379> thing<00:02:50.650> needs<00:02:50.919> to<00:02:51.040> sit

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
mixed and now this thing needs to sit

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.199 
mixed and now this thing needs to sit
