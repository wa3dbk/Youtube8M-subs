00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
to have 4 spaces between the pleats will

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.630 
to have 4 spaces between the pleats will
end<00:01:37.929> with<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.170> pleat<00:01:38.500> before<00:01:39.190> these<00:01:39.340> last

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
end with a pleat before these last

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.279 
end with a pleat before these last
spaces<00:01:40.239> so<00:01:40.479> 5<00:01:40.780> pleats<00:01:41.170> 4<00:01:41.860> spaces<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:43.050> did<00:01:44.050> 4

spaces so 5 pleats 4 spaces I did 4
inches<00:01:44.590> on<00:01:44.709> each<00:01:44.860> end<00:01:45.160> I<00:01:45.340> want<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.550> have<00:01:45.700> 4

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
inches on each end I want to have 4

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.080 
inches on each end I want to have 4
inches<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.330> each<00:01:46.690> pleat<00:01:47.050> as<00:01:47.229> well<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:48.489> 4

spaces<00:01:49.450> times<00:01:49.899> 4<00:01:50.200> inches<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:51.009> 16<00:01:51.550> inches<00:01:51.910> I'm

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
spaces times 4 inches is 16 inches I'm

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.889 
spaces times 4 inches is 16 inches I'm
going<00:01:52.899> to<00:01:52.989> subtract<00:01:53.380> 16<00:01:54.130> from<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:55.270> 40<00:01:55.690> which

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
going to subtract 16 from the 40 which

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.419 
going to subtract 16 from the 40 which
was<00:01:56.050> between<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.410> last<00:01:56.679> two<00:01:56.950> pins

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
was between the last two pins

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.990 
was between the last two pins
and<00:01:57.550> that<00:01:57.970> leaves<00:01:58.179> 24<00:01:59.170> inches<00:01:59.700> I'm<00:02:00.700> going<00:02:00.759> to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
and that leaves 24 inches I'm going to

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.080 
and that leaves 24 inches I'm going to
have<00:02:01.090> 5<00:02:01.360> pleats<00:02:01.869> so<00:02:02.770> whatever<00:02:03.220> is<00:02:03.520> left<00:02:03.879> over

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
have 5 pleats so whatever is left over

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.839 
have 5 pleats so whatever is left over
that<00:02:04.450> 24<00:02:04.899> inches<00:02:05.200> that's<00:02:05.440> going<00:02:05.739> to<00:02:05.830> be<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.550> 5

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:06.849 
that 24 inches that's going to be the 5

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.710 
that 24 inches that's going to be the 5
pleats<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.770> I'm<00:02:08.860> going<00:02:09.129> to<00:02:09.390> figure<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.660> out

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
pleats so I'm going to figure that out

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.180 
pleats so I'm going to figure that out
I'm<00:02:11.140> going<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.290> use<00:02:11.349> a<00:02:11.440> calculator<00:02:12.040> because

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
I'm going to use a calculator because

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.800 
I'm going to use a calculator because
I'm<00:02:12.430> going<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.580> come<00:02:12.790> up<00:02:12.820> with<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.090> fraction<00:02:13.630> so

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
I'm going to come up with a fraction so

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.540 
I'm going to come up with a fraction so
24<00:02:14.620> divided<00:02:15.520> by<00:02:15.700> 5<00:02:16.390> pleats<00:02:16.960> is<00:02:17.430> 4.8

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
24 divided by 5 pleats is 4.8

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.730 
24 divided by 5 pleats is 4.8
inches<00:02:18.880> in<00:02:19.060> each<00:02:19.180> pleat<00:02:19.570> that's<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.170> great<00:02:20.440> size

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
inches in each pleat that's a great size

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.250 
inches in each pleat that's a great size
a<00:02:20.770> good<00:02:21.580> size<00:02:21.820> for<00:02:22.090> pleat<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.540> around<00:02:22.840> five

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
a good size for pleat is around five

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.790 
a good size for pleat is around five
inches<00:02:23.530> or<00:02:23.980> maybe<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.490> little<00:02:24.640> bit<00:02:24.850> more<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.680> go

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
inches or maybe a little bit more so go

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.650 
inches or maybe a little bit more so go
ahead<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.040> mark<00:02:27.400> in<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.880> spaces<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.570> the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
ahead and mark in the spaces and the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.780 
ahead and mark in the spaces and the
pleats<00:02:29.020> so<00:02:30.010> it's<00:02:30.190> 4.8<00:02:31.740> so<00:02:32.740> that's<00:02:32.920> almost<00:02:33.250> 5

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
pleats so it's 4.8 so that's almost 5

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.390 
pleats so it's 4.8 so that's almost 5
inches<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:35.560> can<00:02:35.590> go<00:02:35.890> back<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.310> adjust

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
inches and you can go back and adjust

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.550 
inches and you can go back and adjust
these<00:02:36.910> later<00:02:37.180> we're<00:02:37.420> just<00:02:37.600> pinning<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.080> in<00:02:38.230> and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
these later we're just pinning it in and

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.190 
these later we're just pinning it in and
then<00:02:39.280> for<00:02:39.940> I'm<00:02:40.420> just<00:02:40.570> going<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.720> stand<00:02:41.050> the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
then for I'm just going to stand the

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.490 
then for I'm just going to stand the
pins<00:02:41.470> up<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:43.230> then<00:02:44.490> mark<00:02:45.490> a<00:02:45.640> space<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.570> then

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
pins up and then mark a space and then

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.980 
pins up and then mark a space and then
marking<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.980> pleat<00:02:49.590> marking<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.680> space<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.990> a

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.560 
marking a pleat marking a space and a
pleat<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:55.120> last<00:02:55.420> space<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:57.270> then<00:02:58.270> here's

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
pleat and the last space and then here's

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.220 
pleat and the last space and then here's
the<00:02:58.720> last<00:02:58.930> pleat<00:02:59.350> here<00:03:00.810> now<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.990> all<00:03:02.110> the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
the last pleat here now that all the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.960 
the last pleat here now that all the
pins<00:03:02.500> are<00:03:02.740> in<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:02.920> can<00:03:03.250> pin<00:03:03.460> all<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.850> way

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
pins are in I can pin all the way

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.810 
pins are in I can pin all the way
through<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:05.170> could<00:03:05.320> also<00:03:05.530> mark<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:06.490> with

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
through you could also mark this with

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.020 
through you could also mark this with
chalk<00:03:07.270> or<00:03:08.260> with<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.400> erasable<00:03:10.360> marker<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.850> all

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
chalk or with a erasable marker so all

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.050 
chalk or with a erasable marker so all
these<00:03:13.240> pens<00:03:14.340> represent<00:03:15.340> my<00:03:15.430> pleats<00:03:15.790> and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
these pens represent my pleats and

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.100 
these pens represent my pleats and
spaces<00:03:17.490> to<00:03:18.490> make<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.970> pleats<00:03:19.270> you're<00:03:19.930> going

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
spaces to make the pleats you're going

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.680 
spaces to make the pleats you're going
to<00:03:20.230> take<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.560> first<00:03:20.860> fleet<00:03:21.730> area<00:03:22.180> bring<00:03:22.570> the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
to take the first fleet area bring the

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:32.000 
to take the first fleet area bring the
two<00:03:22.930> pins<00:03:23.290> together<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:27.510> pin<00:03:28.510> that<00:03:28.540> together

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.729 

take<00:03:33.010> one<00:03:33.160> of<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.340> pins<00:03:33.550> out<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:35.440> like<00:03:35.620> to

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
take one of the pins out and I like to

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.830 
take one of the pins out and I like to
also<00:03:36.100> pin<00:03:36.370> down<00:03:36.760> at<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.030> base<00:03:37.270> of<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.570> pleat

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
also pin down at the base of the pleat

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.260 
also pin down at the base of the pleat
and<00:03:38.080> you<00:03:38.230> can<00:03:38.380> measure<00:03:38.620> down<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.910> make<00:03:40.060> sure

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
and you can measure down to make sure

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.990 
and you can measure down to make sure
you<00:03:40.450> have<00:03:40.630> four<00:03:40.959> inches<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.640> I'm<00:03:42.700> just<00:03:42.850> going

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
you have four inches so I'm just going

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.170 
you have four inches so I'm just going
to<00:03:43.030> stab<00:03:43.270> a<00:03:43.300> pin<00:03:43.660> in<00:03:43.810> there<00:03:44.020> and<00:03:44.640> then<00:03:45.640> pin<00:03:45.970> that

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
to stab a pin in there and then pin that

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.550 
to stab a pin in there and then pin that
in<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.570> helps<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:46.900> keep<00:03:46.989> your<00:03:47.110> fabric<00:03:47.470> from

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
in that helps to keep your fabric from

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.050 
in that helps to keep your fabric from
moving<00:03:47.800> around<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.370> go<00:03:48.520> to<00:03:48.580> stitch<00:03:48.850> it<00:03:48.880> on

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
moving around and you go to stitch it on

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.800 
moving around and you go to stitch it on
the<00:03:49.180> sewing<00:03:49.390> machine<00:03:51.239> so<00:03:52.239> you'll<00:03:52.420> do<00:03:52.570> that<00:03:52.600> for

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
the sewing machine so you'll do that for

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.010 
the sewing machine so you'll do that for
every<00:03:53.610> pleat<00:03:54.610> fold<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.720> two<00:03:55.930> pins<00:03:56.170> together

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
every pleat fold the two pins together

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.479 
every pleat fold the two pins together
use<00:03:59.020> one<00:03:59.290> pin<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.709> hold<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.980> pleat<00:04:00.280> and

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
use one pin to hold the pleat and

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.210 
use one pin to hold the pleat and
together<00:04:01.360> at<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.080> top<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:02.680> this<00:04:02.739> is<00:04:02.920> very

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
together at the top and this is very

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.100 
together at the top and this is very
stiff<00:04:03.610> it's<00:04:03.790> hard<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.150> push<00:04:04.360> a<00:04:04.390> pin<00:04:04.690> in<00:04:04.840> because

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
stiff it's hard to push a pin in because

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.260 
stiff it's hard to push a pin in because
you<00:04:05.230> do<00:04:05.380> have<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.709> buckram<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.940> double

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
you do have the buckram and the double

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.229 
you do have the buckram and the double
fold<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.660> fabric<00:04:08.220> then<00:04:09.220> measure<00:04:09.520> down<00:04:09.850> four

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
fold of fabric then measure down four

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.949 
fold of fabric then measure down four
inches<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:14.730> continue<00:04:15.730> going<00:04:15.970> putting<00:04:16.600> in<00:04:16.720> all

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
inches and continue going putting in all

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.550 
inches and continue going putting in all
of<00:04:17.200> your<00:04:17.590> pleats<00:04:18.989> I'll<00:04:19.989> go<00:04:20.109> ahead<00:04:20.169> and<00:04:20.320> do<00:04:20.380> one

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
of your pleats I'll go ahead and do one

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.370 
of your pleats I'll go ahead and do one
more

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:34.150 

and<00:04:25.380> then<00:04:25.950> measure<00:04:26.220> down<00:04:26.340> four<00:04:26.850> inches

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.560 

so<00:04:35.160> that's<00:04:35.400> what<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.669> looks<00:04:35.699> like<00:04:36.060> before<00:04:36.330> you

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
so that's what it looks like before you

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.629 
so that's what it looks like before you
go<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.900> sewing<00:04:37.139> machine<00:04:37.560> now<00:04:38.250> when<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.520> go

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
go to the sewing machine now when you go

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.420 
go to the sewing machine now when you go
to<00:04:38.669> stitch<00:04:39.090> at<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.300> sewing<00:04:39.720> machine<00:04:40.430> you're

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
to stitch at the sewing machine you're

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.330 
to stitch at the sewing machine you're
going<00:04:41.699> to<00:04:41.820> stitch<00:04:43.280> straight<00:04:44.280> down<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:47.070> four

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
going to stitch straight down to four

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:12.920 
you can crease the other sides and

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.290 
you can crease the other sides and
that's<00:06:13.040> where<00:06:13.220> the<00:06:13.280> buckram<00:06:13.640> comes<00:06:13.880> in<00:06:14.060> handy

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
that's where the buckram comes in handy

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.790 
that's where the buckram comes in handy
the<00:06:14.570> buckram<00:06:14.870> allows<00:06:15.140> you<00:06:15.320> to<00:06:15.410> make<00:06:15.560> those

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
the buckram allows you to make those

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.560 
the buckram allows you to make those
creases<00:06:16.720> squeeze<00:06:17.720> it<00:06:17.840> all<00:06:18.020> together<00:06:18.230> and

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
creases squeeze it all together and

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.050 
creases squeeze it all together and
holding<00:06:20.570> it<00:06:20.690> with<00:06:20.780> one<00:06:20.840> hand<00:06:21.820> start<00:06:22.820> your

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
holding it with one hand start your

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.420 
holding it with one hand start your
needle<00:06:23.330> and<00:06:23.390> thread<00:06:23.510> inside<00:06:24.380> a<00:06:24.410> fold<00:06:24.920> at<00:06:25.220> the

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
needle and thread inside a fold at the

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.160 
needle and thread inside a fold at the
bottom<00:06:25.880> of<00:06:26.060> the<00:06:26.150> buckram<00:06:26.540> so<00:06:26.720> you<00:06:26.840> can<00:06:26.960> see

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
bottom of the buckram so you can see

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.680 
bottom of the buckram so you can see
where<00:06:27.320> the<00:06:27.380> buckram<00:06:27.740> ends<00:06:28.220> it's<00:06:29.180> difficult<00:06:29.600> to

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
where the buckram ends it's difficult to

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.570 
where the buckram ends it's difficult to
stitch<00:06:29.930> into<00:06:30.170> that<00:06:30.440> heavy<00:06:30.830> buckram<00:06:31.310> so<00:06:31.460> I'm

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
stitch into that heavy buckram so I'm

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.780 
stitch into that heavy buckram so I'm
going<00:06:31.700> to<00:06:31.730> stitch<00:06:32.000> just<00:06:32.030> below<00:06:32.690> it<00:06:33.550> over<00:06:34.550> about

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:34.790 
going to stitch just below it over about

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.600 
going to stitch just below it over about
a<00:06:34.820> quarter<00:06:35.210> of<00:06:35.240> an<00:06:35.360> inch<00:06:36.190> starting<00:06:37.190> inside

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
a quarter of an inch starting inside

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.120 
a quarter of an inch starting inside
allows<00:06:38.030> the<00:06:38.300> knot<00:06:38.510> to<00:06:38.810> be<00:06:38.930> hidden<00:06:39.260> down<00:06:39.860> inside

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
allows the knot to be hidden down inside

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.950 
allows the knot to be hidden down inside
the<00:06:40.550> pleat<00:06:40.790> then<00:06:41.180> wrap<00:06:41.390> all<00:06:41.660> the<00:06:41.810> way<00:06:41.840> around

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
the pleat then wrap all the way around

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.500 
the pleat then wrap all the way around
go<00:06:42.920> in<00:06:43.100> on<00:06:43.190> the<00:06:43.310> other<00:06:43.460> side<00:06:43.820> underneath<00:06:44.300> the

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
go in on the other side underneath the

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.960 
go in on the other side underneath the
buckram<00:06:44.900> and<00:06:45.280> all<00:06:46.280> the<00:06:46.490> way<00:06:46.640> back<00:06:46.940> through

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
buckram and all the way back through

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.070 
buckram and all the way back through
since<00:06:49.970> I'm<00:06:50.090> using<00:06:50.300> four<00:06:50.570> strands<00:06:50.900> of<00:06:51.050> thread

since I'm using four strands of thread

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.700 
since I'm using four strands of thread
you<00:06:51.590> can<00:06:51.830> just<00:06:52.040> stitch<00:06:52.280> once<00:06:52.610> or<00:06:52.970> I'll<00:06:53.840> do<00:06:54.620> it
