and and trying to keep with the
eco-friendly<00:00:54.640> concept<00:00:55.540> we<00:00:56.230> looked<00:00:56.440> at

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
eco-friendly concept we looked at

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.889 
eco-friendly concept we looked at
different<00:00:56.880> eco-friendly<00:00:57.880> options<00:00:58.360> for<00:00:58.750> these

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
different eco-friendly options for these

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.190 
different eco-friendly options for these
countertops<00:00:59.620> and<00:01:00.420> although<00:01:01.420> we<00:01:01.719> did<00:01:01.899> find

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
countertops and although we did find

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.510 
countertops and although we did find
quite<00:01:02.500> a<00:01:02.530> few<00:01:02.620> options

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
quite a few options

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.219 
quite a few options
most<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.629> them<00:01:04.800> albeit<00:01:06.090> eco-friendly<00:01:07.229> were

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
most of them albeit eco-friendly were

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.090 
most of them albeit eco-friendly were
pocketbook<00:01:09.220> unfriendly<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.800> after<00:01:11.800> a<00:01:11.830> long

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
pocketbook unfriendly and after a long

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.490 
pocketbook unfriendly and after a long
series<00:01:12.729> of<00:01:13.030> discussions<00:01:13.660> between<00:01:13.899> Joe<00:01:14.320> and

series of discussions between Joe and

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.410 
series of discussions between Joe and
myself<00:01:14.649> we<00:01:15.580> finally<00:01:15.940> came<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.330> conclusion

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
myself we finally came to the conclusion

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.960 
myself we finally came to the conclusion
that<00:01:17.729> concrete<00:01:18.729> was<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.720> answer

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that concrete was the answer

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.210 
that concrete was the answer
now<00:01:21.970> although<00:01:22.180> concrete<00:01:22.990> itself<00:01:23.440> is<00:01:23.770> not<00:01:24.040> an

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
now although concrete itself is not an

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.670 
now although concrete itself is not an
eco-friendly<00:01:24.520> product<00:01:25.270> what<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.320> put<00:01:26.560> in

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
eco-friendly product what you put in

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.670 
eco-friendly product what you put in
with<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.130> can<00:01:27.580> very<00:01:27.909> well<00:01:28.210> be<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.750> in<00:01:29.560> this

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
with it can very well be and in this

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.500 
with it can very well be and in this
particular<00:01:29.920> case<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.939> mix<00:01:31.150> that<00:01:31.330> we've

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
particular case the mix that we've

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.070 
particular case the mix that we've
finally<00:01:31.990> decided<00:01:32.530> on<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.820> is<00:01:34.060> about<00:01:34.360> 82

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
finally decided on this is about 82

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.940 
finally decided on this is about 82
percent<00:01:35.380> post-consumer<00:01:37.200> product<00:01:38.200> there<00:01:38.920> is

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
percent post-consumer product there is

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.810 
percent post-consumer product there is
recycled<00:01:39.939> glass<00:01:40.090> chips<00:01:40.600> in<00:01:40.840> this<00:01:41.530> mix<00:01:41.830> as<00:01:42.549> well

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
recycled glass chips in this mix as well

into fine particles so there's a lot of

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.090 
into fine particles so there's a lot of
glass<00:01:54.850> in<00:01:55.150> this<00:01:55.360> countertop<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.320> there's

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
glass in this countertop and there's

top<00:03:46.730> well<00:03:47.540> what<00:03:47.750> happens<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:48.709> that<00:03:48.739> your

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
top well what happens is is that your

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.300 
top well what happens is is that your
top<00:03:49.280> becomes<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.000> bottom<00:03:50.360> in<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:50.690> mold<00:03:51.310> the

top becomes the bottom in the mold the

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.520 
top becomes the bottom in the mold the
reason<00:03:52.640> for<00:03:52.820> this<00:03:53.000> is<00:03:53.269> is<00:03:53.660> that<00:03:53.930> we<00:03:54.230> want<00:03:54.410> a

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
reason for this is is that we want a

nice flat level surface that we don't

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.270 
nice flat level surface that we don't
have<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.870> screed<00:03:57.230> or<00:03:57.500> do<00:03:57.620> any<00:03:57.769> kind<00:03:58.040> of<00:03:58.070> fancy

quarter inch thick but nice and shiny
this<00:04:07.670> helps<00:04:08.030> release<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.690> mold<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:10.010> there's

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
this helps release the mold so there's

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.940 
this helps release the mold so there's
less<00:04:10.519> trouble<00:04:10.940> with<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.920> course

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
less trouble with that and of course

it's<00:04:13.280> nice<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.700> level<00:04:13.819> and<00:04:14.360> when<00:04:14.510> you<00:04:14.600> do<00:04:14.750> that

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
it's nice and level and when you do that

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.670 
it's nice and level and when you do that
it<00:04:15.380> look<00:04:16.419> decreases<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.570> amount<00:04:17.660> of<00:04:18.079> grinding

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
and I don't want that to be seeping out

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.640 
and I don't want that to be seeping out
through<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.220> edges<00:04:58.640> so<00:04:58.970> all<00:04:59.690> the<00:05:00.110> edges<00:05:00.530> have

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
through the edges so all the edges have

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
been cocked we also have this attribute

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.120 
been cocked we also have this attribute
here<00:05:03.860> this<00:05:04.700> is<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.450> form<00:05:05.780> an<00:05:06.080> area<00:05:06.440> around<00:05:06.800> a

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
here this is to form an area around a

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.430 
here this is to form an area around a

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
quarter wood wall so that this will all

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.670 
quarter wood wall so that this will all
very<00:05:15.320> evenly<00:05:15.830> match<00:05:17.110> so<00:05:18.110> we're<00:05:18.320> about<00:05:18.500> ready

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
very evenly match so we're about ready
