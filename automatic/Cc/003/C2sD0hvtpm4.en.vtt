in the language classroom but not all

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.030 
in the language classroom but not all
games<00:00:39.390> are<00:00:39.600> equal<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.470> let's<00:00:40.650> start<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:40.980> a

of<00:00:45.870> language<00:00:46.170> involved<00:00:46.830> and<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.580> can<00:00:47.850> be

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
of language involved and that can be

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.780 
of language involved and that can be
either<00:00:48.090> active<00:00:48.629> or<00:00:48.720> passive<00:00:49.280> listening<00:00:50.280> with

let's move on to my six points for

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.969 
let's move on to my six points for
playing<00:01:35.820> language<00:01:36.240> games<00:01:36.420> effectively<00:01:37.260> the

playing language games effectively the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.350 
playing language games effectively the
first<00:01:38.190> point<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> make<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.670> games<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
first point to make about games in the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.880 
first point to make about games in the
language<00:01:39.600> classroom<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.740> it's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
language classroom is that it's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.440 
language classroom is that it's
sometimes<00:01:41.250> better<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.640> refer<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.240> them<00:01:42.360> as

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
sometimes better to refer to them as

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.870 
sometimes better to refer to them as

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
activities the word game has the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.390 
activities the word game has the
connotation<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:45.930> being<00:01:46.170> serious<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.890> as

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
connotation of not being serious and as

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.670 
connotation of not being serious and as
a<00:01:47.460> result<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.570> minds<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.869> some<00:01:49.080> students

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
a result in the minds of some students

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.219 
a result in the minds of some students
particularly<00:01:50.310> adults<00:01:50.939> language<00:01:51.659> games<00:01:51.840> can

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
particularly adults language games can

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
particularly adults language games can
be<00:01:52.260> regarded<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.010> not<00:01:53.520> worthwhile<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.240> a

be regarded as not worthwhile and a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.899 
be regarded as not worthwhile and a
waste<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.869> time<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.400> believe<00:01:56.400> nothing<00:01:56.580> could<00:01:56.820> be

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
waste of time I believe nothing could be

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.520 
waste of time I believe nothing could be
further<00:01:57.090> from<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.390> truth<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.409> need

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
further from the truth but if you need

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
further from the truth but if you need
to<00:01:58.680> sell<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> game<00:01:59.220> too<00:01:59.430> skeptical<00:01:59.850> students

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
to sell a game too skeptical students

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.980 
to sell a game too skeptical students
call<00:02:01.080> it<00:02:01.229> an<00:02:01.320> activity<00:02:02.150> okay<00:02:03.150> point<00:02:03.900> number

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
call it an activity okay point number

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.950 
call it an activity okay point number
two<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:05.460> games<00:02:05.700> need<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.869> much

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
two is that games need just as much

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.919

provide you with a way of helping weaker
students<00:02:42.270> by<00:02:42.870> mixing<00:02:43.260> them<00:02:43.440> with<00:02:43.470> stronger

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
students by mixing them with stronger

students by mixing them with stronger
ones<00:02:44.100> also<00:02:44.850> if<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.630> class<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.960> 15<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.560> playing<00:02:46.830> in

five teams of three each team's turn

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.740 
five teams of three each team's turn
will<00:02:49.950> come<00:02:50.100> round<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.490> lot<00:02:50.610> quicker<00:02:50.820> so

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
will come round a lot quicker so

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.210 
will come round a lot quicker so
everyone<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.140> more<00:02:52.410> likely<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.800> stay<00:02:52.980> focused

everyone is more likely to stay focused
I<00:02:53.760> also<00:02:54.510> prefer<00:02:54.810> running<00:02:55.320> games<00:02:55.530> from<00:02:55.740> the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
I also prefer running games from the

I also prefer running games from the
front<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.250> class<00:02:56.490> so<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.600> keep

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
front of the class so that I can keep

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.080 
front of the class so that I can keep
everyone's<00:02:58.260> attention<00:02:58.670> rather<00:02:59.670> than<00:02:59.820> having

point number four how will students
answer<00:03:07.710> I<00:03:07.920> think<00:03:08.520> turn-taking<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.480> by<00:03:09.690> far<00:03:09.930> the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
answer I think turn-taking is by far the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.860 
answer I think turn-taking is by far the
best<00:03:10.320> approach<00:03:10.470> as<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.640> allows<00:03:11.850> teams<00:03:12.240> time<00:03:12.690> to

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
best approach as it allows teams time to

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.980 
best approach as it allows teams time to
think<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.290> collaborate<00:03:14.540> asking<00:03:15.540> students<00:03:15.930> to

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
think and collaborate asking students to

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.260 
think and collaborate asking students to
shout<00:03:16.290> out<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.680> answer<00:03:16.710> can<00:03:17.520> quickly<00:03:17.790> descend

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
shout out the answer can quickly descend

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.570 
shout out the answer can quickly descend
into<00:03:18.420> chaos<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.170> first<00:03:19.980> person<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.400> put

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
their hand up means that the strongest

point number five how are you going to
score<00:03:27.050> now<00:03:28.050> this<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.350> minor<00:03:28.620> practical

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
score now this is a minor practical

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.340 
score now this is a minor practical
consideration<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.540> one<00:03:30.690> worth<00:03:30.840> mentioning

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
consideration but one worth mentioning

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.920 
consideration but one worth mentioning
quickly<00:03:31.680> nevertheless<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.630> advise<00:03:33.630> using

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
quickly nevertheless I advise using

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.780 
quickly nevertheless I advise using
tally<00:03:34.290> sticks<00:03:34.680> like<00:03:34.860> these<00:03:35.130> for<00:03:35.370> scoring

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
tally sticks like these for scoring

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.950 
tally sticks like these for scoring
because<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.180> means<00:03:36.300> that<00:03:36.420> you're<00:03:36.600> just<00:03:36.750> adding

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
because it means that you're just adding

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.020 
because it means that you're just adding
to<00:03:37.380> what's<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.710> the<00:03:37.800> board<00:03:38.070> whereas<00:03:38.820> if<00:03:38.850> you

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
to what's on the board whereas if you

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.880 
to what's on the board whereas if you
use<00:03:39.180> numbers<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:40.110> have<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.350> keep<00:03:40.500> rubbing

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
use numbers you have to keep rubbing

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.740 
use numbers you have to keep rubbing
numbers<00:03:41.220> out<00:03:41.370> as<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.760> scores<00:03:42.060> change<00:03:42.450> and

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
numbers out as the scores change and

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.590 
numbers out as the scores change and
number<00:03:43.500> six<00:03:43.740> leave<00:03:44.640> yourself<00:03:44.880> some<00:03:45.240> wriggle

number six leave yourself some wriggle
room<00:03:45.800> as<00:03:46.800> I've<00:03:47.010> already<00:03:47.100> said<00:03:47.520> a<00:03:47.760> game<00:03:48.330> is

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
room as I've already said a game is

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.240 
room as I've already said a game is
essentially<00:03:48.960> an<00:03:49.050> activity<00:03:49.530> for<00:03:49.560> practicing

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
essentially an activity for practicing

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.040 
essentially an activity for practicing
language<00:03:50.610> so<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.390> need<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.690> keep<00:03:51.870> all

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
language so you need to keep all

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.140 
language so you need to keep all
students<00:03:52.500> interested<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.220> participating

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150
