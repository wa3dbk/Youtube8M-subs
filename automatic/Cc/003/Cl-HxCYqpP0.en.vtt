00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
seeing what the best class setup is for

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.099 
seeing what the best class setup is for
it<00:00:26.039> obviously<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.849> maybe<00:00:27.300> not<00:00:27.539> be<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.869> best

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
it obviously it maybe not be the best

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.750 
it obviously it maybe not be the best
class<00:00:28.439> setup<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:28.980> because<00:00:29.189> everyone<00:00:29.609> has

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
class setup for you because everyone has

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.730 
class setup for you because everyone has
different<00:00:29.939> play<00:00:30.210> styles<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.750> these<00:00:30.990> are<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
different play styles but these are the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.680 
different play styles but these are the
best<00:00:31.920> class<00:00:32.399> setups<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.850> my<00:00:33.030> opinion<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.540> let's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
best class setups in my opinion so let's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.000 
best class setups in my opinion so let's
get<00:00:33.780> started<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.230> straight<00:00:34.500> into<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
get started and straight into it and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.400 
get started and straight into it and
after<00:00:35.730> today's<00:00:36.000> episode<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.570> are<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.290> be

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
after today's episode we are going to be

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.530 
after today's episode we are going to be
using<00:00:37.680> these<00:00:38.010> sack<00:00:38.340> 3<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.149> if<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.300> guys<00:00:39.360> don't

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
using these sack 3 so if you guys don't

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.630 
using these sack 3 so if you guys don't
know<00:00:39.719> already<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.260> isn't<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> Kimbo<00:00:41.160> weapon

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
know already this isn't a Kimbo weapon

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.090 
know already this isn't a Kimbo weapon
you<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.390> no<00:00:42.540> other<00:00:42.719> choice<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
you have no other choice in that it is a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.700 
you have no other choice in that it is a
Kimbo<00:00:44.460> weapon<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.899> very<00:00:45.930> very<00:00:46.440> close

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
Kimbo weapon so it's a very very close

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.529 
Kimbo weapon so it's a very very close
range<00:00:46.980> gun<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.850> too<00:00:48.059> good<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.390> long

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
range gun it's not too good in the long

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.690 
range gun it's not too good in the long
range<00:00:48.809> unless<00:00:49.020> you're<00:00:49.680> extremely<00:00:49.800> accurate

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
range unless you're extremely accurate

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.819 
range unless you're extremely accurate
even<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.840> very<00:00:52.110> hard<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.530> gun<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
even then it's just very hard the gun is

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.830 
even then it's just very hard the gun is
just<00:00:53.039> inaccurate<00:00:53.399> at<00:00:53.730> long<00:00:53.940> ranges<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
just inaccurate at long ranges so I

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
just inaccurate at long ranges so I
highly<00:00:55.410> not<00:00:55.800> recommend<00:00:56.340> using<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.789> on

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
highly not recommend using this on

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.450 
highly not recommend using this on
bigger<00:00:57.300> maps<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.680> are<00:00:58.920> stick<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
bigger maps I and if you are stick to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.970 
bigger maps I and if you are stick to
close<00:00:59.670> ranges<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.329> possible<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> let's<00:01:01.829> get

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
close ranges as possible and let's get

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.680 
close ranges as possible and let's get
some<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.399> straight<00:01:02.730> into<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.120> awesome

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
some and straight into this awesome

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.810 
some and straight into this awesome
awesome<00:01:04.049> class<00:01:04.229> setup<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.710> basically<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
awesome class setup so basically for the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.100 
awesome class setup so basically for the
first<00:01:06.060> attachment<00:01:06.420> weren't<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> be

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
first attachment weren't you going to be

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.230 
first attachment weren't you going to be
using<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.799> laser<00:01:08.070> sight<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.700> use<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> laser

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
using is the laser sight I use the laser

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840 
using is the laser sight I use the laser
sight<00:01:09.540> because<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.310> said<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
sight because it's as I said it's a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.750 
sight because it's as I said it's a
short<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.330> inaccurate<00:01:13.080> range<00:01:13.380> weapon<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
short and inaccurate range weapon so the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.039 
short and inaccurate range weapon so the
laser<00:01:14.909> sight<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.390> makes<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> little<00:01:15.780> bit

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
laser sight just makes it a little bit

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.600 
laser sight just makes it a little bit
more<00:01:16.200> accurate<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.009> pinpoint<00:01:17.220> some

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
more accurate and you can pinpoint some

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.370 
more accurate and you can pinpoint some
of<00:01:17.729> those<00:01:17.790> kills<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.630> bit<00:01:18.750> easier<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
of those kills a little bit easier and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.230 
of those kills a little bit easier and
up<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> second<00:01:20.580> attachment<00:01:20.759> we're<00:01:21.119> going

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
up for the second attachment we're going

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
up for the second attachment we're going
to<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.390> using<00:01:21.540> rapid<00:01:22.200> fire<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.979> we're<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
to be using rapid fire so we're going to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.340 
to be using rapid fire so we're going to
be<00:01:24.090> using<00:01:24.119> rapid<00:01:24.479> fire<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:25.170> it

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
be using rapid fire just because it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.679 
be using rapid fire just because it
drops<00:01:25.710> people<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.460> lot<00:01:26.670> faster<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.330> gets<00:01:27.479> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
drops people a lot faster it gets to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.410 
drops people a lot faster it gets to
kill<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.170> lot<00:01:28.680> easier<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:30.329> can

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
kill a lot easier for you and you can

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.980 
kill a lot easier for you and you can
also<00:01:30.689> add<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.829> suppressor<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.640> don't<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.780> it

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
also add on suppressor I don't like it

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.810 
also add on suppressor I don't like it
personally<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.740> know<00:01:34.860> people<00:01:35.189> who<00:01:35.400> have

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
personally but I know people who have

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.910 
personally but I know people who have
used<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> suppressor<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.710> become

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
used the suppressor and have become

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.819 
used the suppressor and have become
quite<00:01:38.490> successful<00:01:39.119> with<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.780> game<00:01:39.990> so

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
quite successful with it in the game so

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.859 
quite successful with it in the game so
I<00:01:40.950> recommend<00:01:41.220> using<00:01:41.759> suppressor<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.720> want

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
I recommend using suppressor if you want

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.240 
I recommend using suppressor if you want
to<00:01:42.930> stay<00:01:43.049> quiet<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.770> don't<00:01:44.070> really

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
to stay quiet but if you don't really

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.069 
to stay quiet but if you don't really
like<00:01:44.430> suppressors<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.240> game<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.689> would

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
like suppressors in this game I would

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.050 
like suppressors in this game I would
not<00:01:46.380> recommend<00:01:46.530> using<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.460> for<00:01:47.670> perkone

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
not recommend using that so for perkone

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.120 
not recommend using that so for perkone

we're gonna be using lightweight this is

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.760 
we're gonna be using lightweight this is

to stay on your feet be fast be a bit of
a<00:01:52.920> running<00:01:53.610> gonna<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.210> kind<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:54.720> do

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
a running gonna you kind of really do

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.389 
a running gonna you kind of really do
need<00:01:55.049> lightweight<00:01:55.590> lightweight<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
need lightweight lightweight for that

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.190 
need lightweight lightweight for that
and<00:01:56.579> poke<00:01:57.540> tube<00:01:57.750> we're<00:01:57.899> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.170> using

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and poke tube we're going to be using

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.969 
and poke tube we're going to be using
the<00:01:58.680> gung-ho<00:01:59.180> which<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.600> extra<00:02:01.560> running

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the gung-ho which is just extra running

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.340 
the gung-ho which is just extra running
gun<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.759> says<00:02:03.180> well<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.200> run

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
gun really it just says well you can run

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.920 
gun really it just says well you can run
around<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.329> shoot<00:02:06.570> while<00:02:06.810> you're

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
around and you can shoot while you're

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.240 
around and you can shoot while you're
running<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.259> guess<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:07.860> kind<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.099> good

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
running I guess so that's kind of good

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.699 
running I guess so that's kind of good
as<00:02:08.399> well<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:09.479> does<00:02:09.959> add<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.319> running<00:02:10.590> gun

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
as well it does add to the running gun

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.120 
as well it does add to the running gun
ass

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
ass

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.490 
ass
act<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.600> third<00:02:12.630> perk<00:02:13.170> we're<00:02:13.380> going

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
act and for the third perk we're going

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.080 
act and for the third perk we're going
to<00:02:13.560> be<00:02:13.650> using<00:02:13.680> toughness<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.940> like

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
to be using toughness I just like

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.910 
to be using toughness I just like
toughness<00:02:15.510> because<00:02:15.840> when<00:02:16.530> you're<00:02:16.680> running

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
toughness because when you're running

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.410 
toughness because when you're running
gunning<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.340> get<00:02:17.520> shot<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.760> lot<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.150> just<00:02:18.330> just

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
gunning you get shot a lot so just just

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.470 
gunning you get shot a lot so just just
means<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.930> flinch<00:02:19.200> less<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:20.360> kind<00:02:21.360> of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
means that you flinch less and I kind of

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.120 
means that you flinch less and I kind of
secures<00:02:21.870> more<00:02:22.110> kills<00:02:22.350> for<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.740> makes<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.040> a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
secures more kills for you it makes it a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.680 
secures more kills for you it makes it a
little<00:02:23.340> bit<00:02:23.520> easier<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.940> get<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.270> kill<00:02:24.510> and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
little bit easier to get that kill and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.410 
little bit easier to get that kill and
for<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.470> final<00:02:25.650> perk<00:02:26.070> on<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.640> perk<00:02:26.910> true<00:02:27.180> for

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
for the final perk on the perk true for

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.260 
for the final perk on the perk true for
the<00:02:27.510> perk<00:02:27.690> 3<00:02:27.960> while<00:02:28.230> God<00:02:28.760> wildcard<00:02:29.760> not<00:02:30.000> guard

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
the perk 3 while God wildcard not guard

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.790 
the perk 3 while God wildcard not guard
are<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.870> going<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.080> use<00:02:31.170> scavenger<00:02:31.620> just
