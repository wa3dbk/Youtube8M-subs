00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.040 
just not more than I'm not less than
three<00:01:02.410> point<00:01:02.620> though<00:01:03.150> because<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.510> the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
three point though because the the

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.420 
three point though because the the
program<00:01:05.379> is<00:01:05.500> just<00:01:05.650> basically<00:01:05.980> on<00:01:06.160> leadership

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
program is just basically on leadership

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.640 
program is just basically on leadership
and<00:01:06.820> like<00:01:07.000> financial<00:01:07.570> accountability<00:01:07.990> a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
and like financial accountability a

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.300 
and like financial accountability a
little<00:01:09.460> bit<00:01:09.580> on<00:01:09.700> criminal<00:01:10.150> justice<00:01:10.480> of<00:01:10.600> the

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
little bit on criminal justice of the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.280 
little bit on criminal justice of the
but<00:01:12.939> I<00:01:12.970> think<00:01:13.360> it<00:01:13.630> doesn't<00:01:13.810> mean<00:01:14.049> that<00:01:14.079> I<00:01:14.259> have

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
but I think it doesn't mean that I have

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.590 
but I think it doesn't mean that I have
to<00:01:14.409> pursue<00:01:15.009> law<00:01:15.250> enforcement<00:01:15.790> people<00:01:16.240> think

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
to pursue law enforcement people think

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.639 
to pursue law enforcement people think
it's<00:01:16.720> going<00:01:16.840> to<00:01:16.899> be<00:01:16.990> about<00:01:17.079> the<00:01:17.259> investigation

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
it's going to be about the investigation

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.770 
it's going to be about the investigation
itself<00:01:18.070> but<00:01:18.430> i<00:01:18.700> think<00:01:19.299> this<00:01:19.390> answers<00:01:19.750> your

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
itself but i think this answers your

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.380 
itself but i think this answers your
young<00:01:20.079> leadership<00:01:20.619> leadership<00:01:21.549> kinda<00:01:22.210> runs

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
young leadership leadership kinda runs

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.560 
young leadership leadership kinda runs
