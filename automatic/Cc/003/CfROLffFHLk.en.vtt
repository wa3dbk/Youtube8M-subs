the<00:01:27.409> reason<00:01:27.799> I'm<00:01:27.890> getting<00:01:28.130> people<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.399> do<00:01:28.549> that

the reason I'm getting people to do that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.700 
the reason I'm getting people to do that
is<00:01:28.880> because<00:01:29.060> if<00:01:29.509> they<00:01:30.110> haven't<00:01:30.320> got<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.680> time

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
is because if they haven't got the time

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.740 
is because if they haven't got the time
they<00:01:31.100> won't<00:01:31.310> do<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.880> I<00:01:32.390> would<00:01:32.540> much<00:01:32.689> rather

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
they won't do it and I would much rather

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.319 
they won't do it and I would much rather
that<00:01:33.140> somebody<00:01:33.500> did<00:01:33.680> something<00:01:34.000> to<00:01:35.000> get<00:01:35.119> some

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.060 
that's what's really important and get
some<00:01:50.659> of<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:50.780> kit<00:01:51.079> bag<00:01:51.320> that<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:51.649> know<00:01:51.799> is<00:01:51.920> in

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
some of that kit bag that you know is in

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.020 
some of that kit bag that you know is in
there<00:01:52.250> that<00:01:52.460> you're<00:01:52.549> just<00:01:52.700> not<00:01:52.850> letting<00:01:53.030> out

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
there that you're just not letting out

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.080 
there that you're just not letting out
if<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.210> move<00:01:56.479> more<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:57.110> eat<00:01:57.320> less<00:01:58.090> that's

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
if you move more and you eat less that's

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.870 
if you move more and you eat less that's
it<00:01:59.360> there's<00:01:59.869> no<00:02:00.049> rocket<00:02:00.890> science<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.610> and

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
it there's no rocket science to it and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.140 
it there's no rocket science to it and
that's<00:02:02.479> what<00:02:02.659> I'm<00:02:02.780> out<00:02:02.959> to<00:02:03.110> prove
