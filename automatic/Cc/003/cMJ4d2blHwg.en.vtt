00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
just found out she has babies how did

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.589 
just found out she has babies how did
you<00:00:06.000> do<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.210> little<00:00:06.569> girlie<00:00:06.870> group<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:07.470> fast

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
you do that little girlie group so fast

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.940 
you do that little girlie group so fast
didn't<00:00:09.599> seem<00:00:09.750> like<00:00:09.780> was<00:00:10.110> very<00:00:10.320> long<00:00:10.530> ago<00:00:10.679> we

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
didn't seem like was very long ago we

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.100 
didn't seem like was very long ago we
hatched<00:00:11.190> her<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:12.300> look<00:00:12.450> at<00:00:12.570> that

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
hatched her and look at that

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.260 
hatched her and look at that
it's<00:00:13.950> turnaround<00:00:14.610> time<00:00:15.440> so<00:00:17.060> hopefully<00:00:18.060> she

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
it's turnaround time so hopefully she

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.880 
it's turnaround time so hopefully she
doesn't<00:00:18.480> change<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.230> because<00:00:19.439> she's<00:00:19.859> had

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
doesn't change just because she's had

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.939 
doesn't change just because she's had
babies<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.670> I'm<00:00:20.760> gonna<00:00:20.850> steal<00:00:21.150> her<00:00:21.270> eggs<00:00:21.480> but

out<00:04:06.770> a<00:04:06.800> while<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.540> they<00:04:08.540> have<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.690> tendency<00:04:09.050> of

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
out a while and they have a tendency of

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.790 
out a while and they have a tendency of
even<00:04:09.590> making<00:04:09.740> a<00:04:10.010> tame<00:04:10.280> snake<00:04:10.840> kind<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:11.960> grumpy

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
even making a tame snake kind of grumpy

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.560 
even making a tame snake kind of grumpy
a<00:04:12.830> little<00:04:13.070> bit<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.460> when<00:04:14.180> I'm<00:04:14.240> talking<00:04:14.540> about

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
a little bit and when I'm talking about

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.390 
a little bit and when I'm talking about
their<00:04:14.780> offspring<00:04:15.290> so<00:04:15.890> whether<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.220> know<00:04:16.340> it

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
their offspring so whether you know it

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.490 
their offspring so whether you know it
or<00:04:16.489> not<00:04:16.549> tame<00:04:17.299> females<00:04:18.200> make<00:04:18.650> tame<00:04:18.980> babies<00:04:19.430> and

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
or not tame females make tame babies and

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.440 
or not tame females make tame babies and
we<00:04:21.500> used<00:04:21.709> to<00:04:21.830> get<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:22.820> know<00:04:22.940> like<00:04:22.970> wow<00:04:23.210> how's

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
we used to get you know like wow how's

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.320 
we used to get you know like wow how's
that<00:04:23.630> possible<00:04:23.840> but<00:04:24.320> we<00:04:24.950> just<00:04:25.850> listen<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.270> a

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
that possible but we just listen to a

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.920 
that possible but we just listen to a
study<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.720> other<00:04:26.810> day<00:04:27.020> that<00:04:27.050> they<00:04:27.860> fed<00:04:28.930> mice

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
study the other day that they fed mice

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.980 
study the other day that they fed mice
cherries<00:04:30.740> this<00:04:31.580> is<00:04:31.790> amazing<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.330> me<00:04:32.360> they<00:04:32.720> fed

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
cherries this is amazing to me they fed

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.600 
cherries this is amazing to me they fed
mice<00:04:33.230> cherries<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:33.890> shocked<00:04:34.160> them<00:04:34.340> out<00:04:34.490> today

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
mice cherries and shocked them out today

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.910 
mice cherries and shocked them out today
to<00:04:34.910> Sherry's<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.480> they<00:04:36.140> did<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.530> until<00:04:36.830> they

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
to Sherry's and they did that until they

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.740 
to Sherry's and they did that until they
would<00:04:37.070> need<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.340> cherries<00:04:37.700> and<00:04:37.910> now<00:04:38.510> here's

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
would need the cherries and now here's

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.830 
would need the cherries and now here's
the<00:04:38.900> amazing<00:04:39.080> part<00:04:39.320> their<00:04:39.830> offspring<00:04:40.840> would

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
the amazing part their offspring would

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.350 
the amazing part their offspring would
not<00:04:42.080> eat<00:04:42.230> cherries<00:04:43.300> they<00:04:44.300> were

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
not eat cherries they were

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.290 
not eat cherries they were
pre-programmed<00:04:45.820> offspring<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:46.940> not<00:04:47.090> like

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
pre-programmed offspring to not like

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.440 
pre-programmed offspring to not like
cherries<00:04:47.690> because<00:04:48.020> of<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:48.230> situation<00:04:48.940> so<00:04:49.940> if

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
cherries because of that situation so if

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.470 
cherries because of that situation so if
you<00:04:50.660> can<00:04:50.870> transfer<00:04:51.520> information<00:04:52.520> through

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
you can transfer information through

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.650 
you can transfer information through
that<00:04:53.690> through<00:04:54.070> genetic<00:04:55.070> genes<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:56.210> surely

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
that through genetic genes you surely

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.520 
that through genetic genes you surely
can<00:04:56.840> transfer<00:04:57.260> transferred<00:04:58.070> disposition<00:04:58.790> and

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
can transfer transferred disposition and

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.020 
can transfer transferred disposition and
so<00:05:00.530> here's<00:05:00.770> a<00:05:00.830> good<00:05:01.070> case<00:05:01.310> of<00:05:01.520> it<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:01.820> we'll

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
so here's a good case of it and we'll

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.760 
so here's a good case of it and we'll
probably<00:05:02.390> have<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:02.690> bunch<00:05:02.930> of<00:05:03.020> gorgeous<00:05:03.260> mellow

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
probably have a bunch of gorgeous mellow

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.680 
probably have a bunch of gorgeous mellow
babies<00:05:04.220> glowing<00:05:04.970> partners<00:05:05.300> remember<00:05:05.480> that

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
babies glowing partners remember that

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.000 
babies glowing partners remember that
one<00:05:05.870> I<00:05:05.900> was<00:05:06.080> talking<00:05:06.230> about<00:05:06.470> that<00:05:06.740> we<00:05:06.830> brought

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
one I was talking about that we brought

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.480 
one I was talking about that we brought
it<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.280> he's<00:05:08.120> a<00:05:08.150> grump<00:05:09.280> so<00:05:10.280> it'll<00:05:10.400> be

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
it to he's a grump so it'll be

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.180 
it to he's a grump so it'll be
interesting<00:05:10.790> to<00:05:11.090> see<00:05:11.210> who<00:05:11.540> wins<00:05:11.810> so<00:05:12.560> this

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
interesting to see who wins so this

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.520 
interesting to see who wins so this
wasn't<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.640> very<00:05:13.760> good<00:05:13.880> test<00:05:14.270> of<00:05:14.419> that<00:05:14.570> but<00:05:14.840> okay

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
wasn't a very good test of that but okay

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.010 
wasn't a very good test of that but okay
anyway<00:05:15.800> this<00:05:16.250> is<00:05:16.430> our<00:05:16.520> new<00:05:16.730> setup<00:05:17.150> it's<00:05:17.600> really

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
anyway this is our new setup it's really

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.150 
anyway this is our new setup it's really
awesome<00:05:18.410> I'm<00:05:18.500> not<00:05:18.650> going<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:18.860> get<00:05:18.950> all<00:05:19.040> these

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
awesome I'm not going to get all these

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.510 
awesome I'm not going to get all these
eggs<00:05:19.430> in<00:05:19.580> it<00:05:19.669> we<00:05:19.760> got<00:05:19.910> 2<00:05:20.180> 4<00:05:20.630> 6<00:05:21.020> 8<00:05:22.330> 10<00:05:23.330> 12<00:05:23.660> 14<00:05:24.380> 16<00:05:25.010> 18
