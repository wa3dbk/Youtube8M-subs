kind of what that spells out in terms of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.470 
kind of what that spells out in terms of
what<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.199> judges<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.680> starting<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.490> look<00:00:27.150> for

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
what the judges are starting to look for

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.529 
what the judges are starting to look for
in<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.529> women's<00:00:28.949> physique<00:00:29.130> division<00:00:29.849> because

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
in the women's physique division because

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.999 
in the women's physique division because
you<00:00:30.660> guys<00:00:30.810> know<00:00:31.050> there's<00:00:31.349> physique<00:00:31.740> there's

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
you guys know there's physique there's

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.120 
you guys know there's physique there's
figure<00:00:32.430> there's<00:00:33.239> bikini<00:00:33.800> there's<00:00:34.800> kind<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
figure there's bikini there's kind of a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.790 
figure there's bikini there's kind of a
very<00:00:35.370> thin<00:00:35.670> line<00:00:35.940> between<00:00:36.300> each<00:00:36.809> category<00:00:37.469> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
very thin line between each category and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.440 
very thin line between each category and
I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> judges<00:00:38.520> are<00:00:38.730> kind<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.149> starting

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
I think the judges are kind of starting

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.600 
I think the judges are kind of starting
to<00:00:39.510> draw<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.930> line<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> sand<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.920> what

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
to draw that line in the sand of what

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.100 
to draw that line in the sand of what
they're<00:00:41.760> looking<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.329> especially<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.960> this

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
they're looking for especially with this

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.459 
they're looking for especially with this
past<00:00:43.410> Olympia<00:00:44.149> and<00:00:45.149> comparing<00:00:45.750> Julian<00:00:46.320> and

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
past Olympia and comparing Julian and

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.930 
past Olympia and comparing Julian and
mal<00:00:46.559> Kearney<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.039> Daniel<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.399> Bailey<00:00:47.760> I

mal Kearney and Daniel and Bailey I

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.709 
mal Kearney and Daniel and Bailey I
think<00:00:48.390> Juliana<00:00:49.079> Malik<00:00:49.379> karna<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.920> is

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
think Juliana Malik karna is is

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.029 
think Juliana Malik karna is is
significantly<00:00:51.719> more<00:00:51.809> muscular<00:00:52.440> than<00:00:52.590> Daniel

legs are big and it flares back out

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.179 
legs are big and it flares back out
again<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.780> she's<00:01:33.960> got<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> nice<00:01:34.409> body<00:01:34.680> builder

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
again so she's got a nice body builder

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.880 
again so she's got a nice body builder
ish<00:01:35.310> V<00:01:35.939> taper<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.350> we're<00:01:37.439> gonna<00:01:37.530> look<00:01:37.619> at

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
ish V taper so here we're gonna look at

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.580 
ish V taper so here we're gonna look at
a<00:01:37.920> front<00:01:38.280> pose<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.970> Daniel<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.810> Bailey<00:01:41.479> okay

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
a front pose of Daniel and Bailey okay

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.410 
a front pose of Daniel and Bailey okay
so<00:01:43.590> obviously<00:01:43.770> Daniel<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.549> Bailey<00:01:44.729> shoulders

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
so obviously Daniel and Bailey shoulders

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.170 
so obviously Daniel and Bailey shoulders
are<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.780> lot<00:01:46.200> less<00:01:46.530> full<00:01:46.950> than<00:01:47.460> Julian<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.060> mal

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
are a lot less full than Julian and mal

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.929 
are a lot less full than Julian and mal
karne<00:01:48.659> she<00:01:49.380> has<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> little<00:01:49.680> bit<00:01:49.860> less<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> V

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
karne she has a little bit less of the V

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.240 
karne she has a little bit less of the V
taper<00:01:51.649> she's<00:01:52.649> kind<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.009> more<00:01:53.750> just<00:01:54.750> a

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
taper she's kind of more just a

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.950 
taper she's kind of more just a
streamlined<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.579> guess<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.689> so

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
streamlined I guess not not really so

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.929 
streamlined I guess not not really so
much<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.409> bodybuilding<00:01:59.100> V<00:01:59.310> taper<00:01:59.549> though

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
much of that bodybuilding V taper though

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.569 
much of that bodybuilding V taper though
in<00:02:00.180> her<00:02:00.630> legs<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.200> believe<00:02:01.590> are<00:02:01.920> significantly

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
in her legs I believe are significantly

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.359 
in her legs I believe are significantly
smaller<00:02:03.090> than<00:02:03.299> Juliana<00:02:03.930> malacara<00:02:04.500> knees<00:02:04.649> I'm

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
smaller than Juliana malacara knees I'm

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.649 
smaller than Juliana malacara knees I'm
so<00:02:05.549> she<00:02:05.610> has<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:05.909> less<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.450> body

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
so she has just less of the body

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.479 
so she has just less of the body
building<00:02:06.869> V<00:02:07.170> taper<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.860> her<00:02:07.979> shoulders<00:02:08.369> are<00:02:08.429> a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
building V taper and her shoulders are a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.210 
building V taper and her shoulders are a
little<00:02:08.700> bit<00:02:08.819> less<00:02:09.060> fool<00:02:09.770> so<00:02:10.770> let's<00:02:11.009> look<00:02:11.069> at

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
little bit less fool so let's look at

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.000 
little bit less fool so let's look at
another<00:02:11.280> comparison<00:02:12.030> photo

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
here that I believe more clearly shows

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.000 
here that I believe more clearly shows
so<00:02:58.250> look<00:02:58.959> Juliana<00:02:59.959> mouth<00:03:00.110> carne<00:03:00.470> looks<00:03:00.709> way

more muscular than Dana Land Bailey in
this<00:03:03.440> shot<00:03:03.650> here<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.220> shoulders<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:05.060> legs

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.740 
this shot here the shoulders the legs
especially<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.459> legs<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.940> biceps<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:08.630> might

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
especially the legs the biceps it might

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.420 
especially the legs the biceps it might
just<00:03:08.870> be<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.110> angle<00:03:09.470> on<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.739> bicep<00:03:10.190> because

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
just be the angle on the bicep because

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.210 
just be the angle on the bicep because
she's<00:03:10.579> flexing<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.150> Dana's<00:03:11.480> not<00:03:11.890> but<00:03:12.890> she<00:03:13.010> has

he ever wants to reclaim the title

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.520 
he ever wants to reclaim the title
personally<00:03:50.359> I<00:03:50.540> don't<00:03:50.690> think<00:03:50.900> she<00:03:51.260> will

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
personally I don't think she will

the<00:03:55.010> judges<00:03:55.250> are<00:03:55.430> kind<00:03:55.670> of<00:03:55.819> starting<00:03:56.209> to

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
the judges are kind of starting to

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.259 
the judges are kind of starting to
change<00:03:56.660> their<00:03:57.079> their<00:03:58.069> judging<00:03:58.519> criteria<00:03:59.180> just

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
change their their judging criteria just

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.050
