vibe<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:33.040> sonically<00:00:34.040> this<00:00:34.340> is<00:00:34.520> uh<00:00:34.550> this<00:00:34.940> is<00:00:35.000> a

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
vibe and sonically this is uh this is a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.959 
vibe and sonically this is uh this is a
really<00:00:35.270> special<00:00:35.480> sba<00:00:36.020> it's<00:00:36.620> um<00:00:36.949> it's<00:00:37.789> got<00:00:37.910> a

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
really special sba it's um it's got a

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.240 
really special sba it's um it's got a
great<00:00:38.239> attack<00:00:38.600> to<00:00:38.870> it<00:00:39.050> a<00:00:39.500> great<00:00:39.739> amount<00:00:40.100> of

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
great attack to it a great amount of

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.279 
great attack to it a great amount of
resistance<00:00:40.600> meaning<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:41.780> doesn't<00:00:41.989> have<00:00:42.079> a<00:00:42.109> ton

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
resistance meaning it doesn't have a ton

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.930 
resistance meaning it doesn't have a ton
of<00:00:42.320> resistance<00:00:42.829> but<00:00:42.949> it<00:00:43.100> has<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:43.609> small<00:00:43.910> amount

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
of resistance but it has a small amount

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.090 
of resistance but it has a small amount
that<00:00:44.390> gives<00:00:45.020> you<00:00:45.109> something<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.410> push<00:00:45.620> against

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
that gives you something to push against

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.189 
that gives you something to push against
and<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.520> I<00:00:46.850> think<00:00:47.030> that's<00:00:47.180> a<00:00:47.420> lot<00:00:48.019> of<00:00:48.050> what

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
and and I think that's a lot of what

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:49.599 
and and I think that's a lot of what
makes<00:00:48.320> a<00:00:48.620> lot<00:00:48.739> of<00:00:48.800> these<00:00:48.890> benches<00:00:49.160> cylinder<00:00:49.460> so

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
makes a lot of these benches cylinder so

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.369 
makes a lot of these benches cylinder so
cool<00:00:49.879> is<00:00:50.120> that<00:00:50.180> they're<00:00:50.480> not<00:00:50.600> totally<00:00:50.989> pre

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
cool is that they're not totally pre

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.800 
cool is that they're not totally pre
