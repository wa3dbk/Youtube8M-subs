 the benefits of direct x12 attentive 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.239
 because the improvement of using direct x12 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.109
 in pc it can reach up to 20 per 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.309
 hundred and something else in xbox band is is 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.600
 Speaking to a percentage between

 20% and 30% improvement what could 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.000
 come to happen not because the new 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.640
 api has been created to work better 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.260
 with more concrete hardware the creator of 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.899
 one of the next releases of the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.730
 study mentioned above whose name is 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.589
 say Browne has said so 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.710
 approximate what are the possibilities 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.690
 of this new live x12 says that this 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.310
 will help a lot says he has been in 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.080
 the direct developer program 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.880
 x 12 for a time 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.850
 played a lot with the elements that I had 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.580
 the one real in chain 4 and has seen how 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.590
 it worked really it has been observed a 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.990
 increase of up to 20% in the 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.820
 performance for pc something that could 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.460
 be represented with increases in 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.320
 the frames this could reach 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.970
 xbox one even more effectively 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.890
 although this message is very positive 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.740
 It was also wanted to emphasize that the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.350
 improvement does not necessarily have to be 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.140
 present nor is it represented as a 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.940
 increase in fps is everything will depend 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.970
 of the machine in which it is operating 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.950
 and that's why in xbox one you can get a 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.400
 great performance because it is a 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.110
 very specific and specific hardware as well 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.090
 Thank you very much everyone for being 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.920
