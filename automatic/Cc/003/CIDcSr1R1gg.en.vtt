00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:06.759
Hello, I'm José Carrasco with you once again from the island of Menorca

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:14.604
to present to you a very interesting proposal to invest in the island of Menorca

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:20.690
as I'm showing, it is a grand country house on two floors

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.317
it's a property with 4,300 square meters of land

00:00:27.317 --> 00:00:36.654
it is in a fantastic location in a very 
 quiet place, you can here the birds singing

00:00:36.654 --> 00:00:49.522
and it is on the edge of the best residential 
 area of the town of Es Migjorn

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:56.721
and next to the countryside, as you can see here 
 - I'll try to show you a little better

00:00:56.721 --> 00:01:08.805
from here there are fantastic country views with this magnificent talaiot

00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:17.272
it is a prehistoric megalithic tower a type only found in Menorca

00:01:17.272 --> 00:01:26.466
and as you can see there are old trees, like 
 this fig tree, which is coming into flower

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:37.102
I'll focus-in on the new shoots, we are now just about coming into spring

00:01:37.102 --> 00:01:41.000
this is the house, on two floors

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.550
a little over 800 square meters constructed area, 
 I think it's actually 822 square meters

00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:52.290
it has lots of possibilities and the location is superb

00:01:52.289 --> 00:02:02.880
here there is a small public park as we are in a small village

00:02:02.883 --> 00:02:11.470
It’s nor busy as there is lots of surrounding countryside and lots of other places to go to

00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:17.840
it's a fantastic situation, and the house has water and electricity

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:24.030
the land is classified as urban land, which is a notable feature

00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:30.880
I'll show you a little from behind where there is a beautiful patio

00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:41.480
this here is the entrance with its two pillars and 
 as you see with planters on both sides

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.040
from here let's take a closer look at the buildings

00:02:48.044 --> 00:02:54.800
let's go and take a closer look at the rear facade

00:02:54.798 --> 00:03:00.480
the house is built of stone, the typical 'marés' stone of Menorca

00:03:00.477 --> 00:03:07.780
with lots of details like this pillar made of the same stone

00:03:07.785 --> 00:03:17.650
this construction on the side of the house is 
 a stable, what we call here a 'boyera'

00:03:17.654 --> 00:03:23.780
and this small piece of land also belongs to the house 

00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:34.410
the other that I showed you earlier and 
 is the public park and is naturally very flat

00:03:34.407 --> 00:03:37.960
from here we have is another view of the house

00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:43.940
I'll show you the inside; it really is large and has endless possibilities

00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:58.660
here is a small storeroom which has lots 
 of tools typical of the Menorcan countryside

00:03:58.657 --> 00:04:03.070
let's move-on

00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:15.790
only a few kilometres from here our agency did 
 the reforms on a very large old house

00:04:15.787 --> 00:04:29.400
and I think it would be a good example for those are interested 
 to evaluate ideas and costs and the results that can be achieved

00:04:29.398 --> 00:04:38.560
it's a great example of what can be accomplished, and we 
 have lots of photographic information of before and after

00:04:38.562 --> 00:04:41.560
it's a much more prominent house

00:04:41.563 --> 00:04:46.400
but this really is a lovely house, focus on the upper terrace

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.060
there's a balustrade made entirely of stone

00:04:50.063 --> 00:05:03.460
for these who love restoration and reforming houses, the 
 property is wonderful and a great opportunity

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:06.510
let's take a look from here

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:14.310
and you can see behind here is the talaiot, the tower, I showed you earlier

00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:17.510
and the rear facade

00:05:17.513 --> 00:05:31.650
here is another small building, a little garden room, made entirely 
 of stone with windows in the form of arches

00:05:31.647 --> 00:05:40.400
and Es Migjorn is, for me, the most peaceful of Menorca villages

00:05:40.403 --> 00:05:49.520
the town is very rural and the coastline is really interesting

00:05:49.518 --> 00:05:57.040
and it is well-liked by tourists, and like the 
 people of Menorca, it is very peaceful here

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:08.350
the town is very tranquil and almost deserted, except 
 during the months of high summer season

00:06:08.353 --> 00:06:19.070
as I said, Es Migjorn is the quietest of all the 
 villages, and at the same time is important for tourists

00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:28.400
less than 2 kilometres from the house is the Cova d’en Colom - there 
 is a link below for those who would like to see it

00:06:28.403 --> 00:06:35.320
it is a large grotto with over 24 meters in 
 height on the inside, it's a natural cave

00:06:35.324 --> 00:06:43.640
it's like a gigantic cathedral of natural stone

00:06:43.635 --> 00:06:51.570
and also close by is the magnificent beach of 
 Binigaus, it's only about 3 kilometres from here

00:06:51.567 --> 00:06:58.120
let's take a look at the inside of 
 the house with anticipation of what's inside

00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:02.080
as I said earlier, it has electricity and water

00:07:02.075 --> 00:07:07.180
and here we have an old water deposit

00:07:07.175 --> 00:07:08.660
let's go inside!
