00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
driving license yet I know at the

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.390 
driving license yet I know at the
beginning<00:01:03.110> of<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.559> summer<00:01:03.830> I<00:01:03.949> said<00:01:04.220> I<00:01:04.280> was

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
beginning of the summer I said I was

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.640 
beginning of the summer I said I was
gonna<00:01:04.519> upload<00:01:04.820> daily<00:01:05.180> but<00:01:05.509> that<00:01:05.660> just<00:01:06.320> really

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
gonna upload daily but that just really

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.620 
gonna upload daily but that just really
didn't<00:01:07.040> work<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:07.340> I'm<00:01:07.910> gonna<00:01:07.970> try<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:08.300> upload

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
didn't work so I'm gonna try and upload

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.630 
didn't work so I'm gonna try and upload
every<00:01:09.080> other<00:01:09.170> day<00:01:09.440> now<00:01:09.470> that<00:01:09.680> school<00:01:10.160> starts<00:01:10.460> I

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
every other day now that school starts I

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.370 
every other day now that school starts I
think<00:01:10.850> every<00:01:11.149> other<00:01:11.240> day<00:01:11.479> is<00:01:11.630> realistic<00:01:12.229> but

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
think every other day is realistic but

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.960 
think every other day is realistic but
let's<00:01:12.530> say<00:01:12.680> I<00:01:12.710> can<00:01:12.770> upload<00:01:13.070> three<00:01:13.550> days<00:01:13.729> in<00:01:13.940> a

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
let's say I can upload three days in a

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.029 
let's say I can upload three days in a
row<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.270> will<00:01:14.360> do<00:01:14.810> that<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.200> no<00:01:15.410> set<00:01:15.800> schedule

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
row I will do that it's no set schedule

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.010 
row I will do that it's no set schedule
but<00:01:16.520> that's<00:01:16.670> what<00:01:16.850> I'm<00:01:16.940> aiming<00:01:17.149> for<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.720> main

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
but that's what I'm aiming for the main

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.660 
but that's what I'm aiming for the main
