and still there is some risk for the

doesn't<00:02:09.050> drop<00:02:09.140> out<00:02:09.349> exactly<00:02:09.830> because<00:02:10.099> the

engine is it drops down at the slight

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.290 
engine is it drops down at the slight
angle<00:02:19.280> but<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.519> is<00:02:19.640> still<00:02:19.849> possible<00:02:20.060> to
