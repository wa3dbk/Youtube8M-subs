number<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.530> years<00:00:10.740> ago<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.980> decided<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.550> get<00:00:12.120> rid

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
number of years ago I decided to get rid

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.780 
number of years ago I decided to get rid
of<00:00:12.300> cable<00:00:12.509> TV<00:00:12.889> it's<00:00:13.889> tired<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.280> paying<00:00:14.400> 100

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
of cable TV it's tired of paying 100

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.120 
of cable TV it's tired of paying 100
bucks<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.089> month<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.630> cable<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:17.070> I

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
bucks a month for cable and so I

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.710 
bucks a month for cable and so I
replaced<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:17.730> with<00:00:17.880> some<00:00:17.910> antennas<00:00:18.390> for

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
replaced it all with some antennas for

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.029 
replaced it all with some antennas for
TV<00:00:19.520> now<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.730> my<00:00:20.850> particular<00:00:21.060> area<00:00:21.650> add<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.890> that

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
TV now in my particular area add in that

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.340 
TV now in my particular area add in that
directions<00:00:23.789> where<00:00:24.150> about<00:00:24.420> 80%<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
directions where about 80% of the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.290 
directions where about 80% of the
channels<00:00:25.830> come<00:00:26.070> from<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.820> they're<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.119> that

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
channels come from and they're not that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.359 
channels come from and they're not that
far<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:28.230> can't<00:00:28.470> quite<00:00:28.650> see<00:00:28.710> them<00:00:29.010> because<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
far you can't quite see them because of

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.650 
far you can't quite see them because of
the<00:00:29.460> trees<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.380> right<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.650> there<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:33.450> tops

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
the trees but right up there on the tops

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.740 
the trees but right up there on the tops
of<00:00:33.840> those<00:00:33.960> hills<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.559> where<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> antennas<00:00:35.250> are

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
of those hills is where the antennas are

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.670 
of those hills is where the antennas are
and<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.989> get<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.350> signal<00:00:38.719> I've<00:00:39.719> got<00:00:39.989> this

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and so to get that signal I've got this

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.430 
and so to get that signal I've got this
it's<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.969> channel<00:00:42.510> master<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:43.260> Bay

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
it's just a channel master for Bay

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.069 
it's just a channel master for Bay
antenna<00:00:43.910> nothin<00:00:44.910> fancy<00:00:45.120> does<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> great<00:00:46.020> job

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
antenna nothin fancy does a great job

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.540 
antenna nothin fancy does a great job
pulls<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.710> all<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> signals<00:00:47.399> from<00:00:47.460> that

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
pulls in all the signals from that

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.170 
pulls in all the signals from that
direction<00:00:47.820> pretty<00:00:48.600> much<00:00:48.750> at<00:00:48.899> 100%<00:00:50.059> but<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
direction pretty much at 100% but the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.020 
direction pretty much at 100% but the
problem<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.690> there's<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> few<00:00:53.399> channels

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
problem is there's like a few channels

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.029 
problem is there's like a few channels
that<00:00:54.120> come<00:00:54.360> from<00:00:54.539> 120<00:00:55.320> degrees<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
that come from 120 degrees in the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.639 
that come from 120 degrees in the
opposite<00:00:56.430> direction<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.879> way<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.649> they're

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
opposite direction that way and they're

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.459 
opposite direction that way and they're
much<00:00:59.100> further<00:00:59.460> away<00:00:59.640> very<00:01:00.239> hard<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.719> get<00:01:00.899> I've

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
much further away very hard to get I've

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.770 
much further away very hard to get I've
tried<00:01:01.739> several<00:01:02.039> professional<00:01:03.000> antennas<00:01:03.539> I've

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
tried several professional antennas I've

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.770 
tried several professional antennas I've
tried<00:01:04.159> antenna<00:01:05.159> pre<00:01:06.000> gain<00:01:06.210> amplifiers

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
tried antenna pre gain amplifiers

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.560 
tried antenna pre gain amplifiers
nothing<00:01:07.439> seems<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> pull<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.270> wanted

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
nothing seems to pull it in so I wanted

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.539 
nothing seems to pull it in so I wanted
to<00:01:09.630> try<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> homemade<00:01:10.290> antenna<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.950> what<00:01:11.520> I

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
to try a homemade antenna and what I

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.930 
to try a homemade antenna and what I
ended<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:11.970> making<00:01:12.180> was<00:01:12.659> this

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.660 

this<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:18.440> 20<00:01:19.010> foot<00:01:19.250> long<00:01:19.720> yagi<00:01:20.720> antenna

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
this is a 20 foot long yagi antenna

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.980 
this is a 20 foot long yagi antenna
specifically<00:01:22.670> cut<00:01:22.910> to<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.270> frequency<00:01:23.810> I'm

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
specifically cut to the frequency I'm

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.630 
specifically cut to the frequency I'm
trying<00:01:24.290> to<00:01:24.470> receive<00:01:27.190> so<00:01:28.190> what<00:01:28.340> we've<00:01:28.460> got

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
trying to receive so what we've got

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.040 
trying to receive so what we've got
going<00:01:28.850> on<00:01:29.090> here<00:01:29.420> is<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:30.830> boom<00:01:31.040> itself<00:01:31.460> is

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
going on here is the boom itself is

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.990 
going on here is the boom itself is
extruded<00:01:33.050> aluminum<00:01:33.500> tubing<00:01:33.980> 1<00:01:34.520> inch<00:01:34.730> by<00:01:34.940> 2

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
inches it's 20 foot long and then for

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.950 
inches it's 20 foot long and then for
the<00:01:39.410> elements<00:01:40.010> on<00:01:40.160> here<00:01:40.570> so<00:01:41.570> I've<00:01:41.660> got<00:01:41.810> these

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
the elements on here so I've got these

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.760 
the elements on here so I've got these
nylon<00:01:42.320> bushings<00:01:43.270> with<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.780> aluminum<00:01:45.200> rods<00:01:45.470> I

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
nylon bushings with the aluminum rods I

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.980 
nylon bushings with the aluminum rods I
drilled<00:01:46.070> holes<00:01:46.130> across<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.450> then<00:01:47.600> pounded

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
drilled holes across and then pounded

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.320 
drilled holes across and then pounded
the<00:01:48.110> rods<00:01:48.290> through<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:49.070> then<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:49.970> drilled<00:01:50.180> a

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
the rods through and then I drilled a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.830 
the rods through and then I drilled a
vertical<00:01:50.900> hole<00:01:51.190> ran<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.220> screw<00:01:53.150> through<00:01:53.510> and

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
vertical hole ran a screw through and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.160 
vertical hole ran a screw through and
drilled<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:54.380> tapped<00:01:54.440> holes<00:01:54.860> into<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.520> boom

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
drilled and tapped holes into the boom

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.680 
drilled and tapped holes into the boom
to<00:01:57.170> attach<00:01:57.680> them<00:01:58.010> on<00:01:58.130> there<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.730> that<00:01:58.880> way<00:01:59.090> the

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
to attach them on there and that way the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.690 
to attach them on there and that way the
elements<00:02:00.200> are<00:02:00.320> electrically<00:02:00.980> isolated<00:02:01.490> from

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
elements are electrically isolated from

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.650 
elements are electrically isolated from
the<00:02:01.820> boom<00:02:03.160> now<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.670> design<00:02:04.970> for<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:05.270> antenna

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
the boom now the design for this antenna

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.810 
the boom now the design for this antenna
I<00:02:05.720> found<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.110> on<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.229> Internet<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:07.460> original

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
I found it on the Internet the original

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.340 
I found it on the Internet the original
design<00:02:08.119> was<00:02:08.330> for<00:02:08.570> a<00:02:08.630> slightly<00:02:09.110> different

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
design was for a slightly different

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.020 
design was for a slightly different
frequency<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.369> want<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.640> say<00:02:10.760> it<00:02:10.820> was<00:02:10.910> like

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
frequency I want to say it was like

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.320 
frequency I want to say it was like
around<00:02:11.230> 150<00:02:12.230> megahertz<00:02:12.710> or<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.100> but<00:02:13.970> there<00:02:14.270> are

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
around 150 megahertz or so but there are

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.240 
around 150 megahertz or so but there are
formulas<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.960> can<00:02:14.990> use<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.530> scale<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.100> to

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
formulas you can use to scale it to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.220 
formulas you can use to scale it to
different<00:02:16.400> frequencies<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.780> used<00:02:18.050> those

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
different frequencies so I used those

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.030 
different frequencies so I used those
formulas<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.220> scale<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.420> antenna<00:02:20.780> design<00:02:21.200> to

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
formulas to scale the antenna design to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.880 
formulas to scale the antenna design to
the<00:02:22.220> frequency<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.730> was<00:02:23.000> interested<00:02:23.300> in<00:02:23.890> and

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
the frequency I was interested in and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.040 
the frequency I was interested in and
this<00:02:25.370> is<00:02:25.520> what<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.700> came<00:02:25.820> up<00:02:26.150> with<00:02:26.180> all<00:02:26.540> include

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
this is what I came up with all include

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.250 
this is what I came up with all include
links<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:28.280> antenna<00:02:28.820> design<00:02:29.110> functions<00:02:30.110> to

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
links to the antenna design functions to

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.940 
links to the antenna design functions to
scale<00:02:30.530> all<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:30.980> stuff

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
scale all that stuff

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.910 
scale all that stuff
now<00:02:33.190> as<00:02:33.459> for<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.230> receiving<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.319> signal<00:02:35.740> I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
now as for the receiving the signal I

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.680 
now as for the receiving the signal I
ended<00:02:36.310> up<00:02:36.400> going<00:02:36.580> with<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.910> folded<00:02:37.510> dipole

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
ended up going with a folded dipole

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.680 
ended up going with a folded dipole
design<00:02:38.319> here<00:02:38.940> again<00:02:39.940> just<00:02:39.970> took<00:02:40.300> some<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.599> the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
design here again just took some of the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.010 
design here again just took some of the
aluminum<00:02:41.080> tube<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.890> should<00:02:42.520> say<00:02:42.730> rod<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.330> kind

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
aluminum tube I should say rod and kind

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.630 
aluminum tube I should say rod and kind
of<00:02:44.050> bent<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.440> around<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.250> shape<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.520> a

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
of bent it around to the shape of a

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.100 
of bent it around to the shape of a
folded<00:02:45.970> dipole<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:47.020> then<00:02:47.290> attached<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
folded dipole and then attached the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.080 
folded dipole and then attached the
leads<00:02:50.110> down<00:02:50.500> here<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.100> Ballon<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:51.790> then

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
leads down here to the Ballon and then

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.880 
leads down here to the Ballon and then
off<00:02:52.810> on<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.430> TV<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.380> then<00:02:56.380> there's<00:02:56.560> one

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
off on to the TV and then there's one

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.360 
off on to the TV and then there's one
director<00:02:57.520> back<00:02:57.700> here<00:02:58.030> I've<00:02:59.019> tried<00:02:59.470> I've<00:03:00.130> got

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
director back here I've tried I've got

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.800 
director back here I've tried I've got
some<00:03:00.550> screw<00:03:00.819> holes<00:03:01.030> back<00:03:01.269> here<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:01.720> I've

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
some screw holes back here and I've

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.420 
some screw holes back here and I've
tried<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.530> corner<00:03:03.250> reflector<00:03:03.930> which<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:06.069> worked

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
tried a corner reflector which it worked

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.880 
tried a corner reflector which it worked
but<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:06.940> didn't<00:03:07.420> increase<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:08.019> gain<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.560> found

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
but it didn't increase the gain I found

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.740 
but it didn't increase the gain I found
I<00:03:08.980> got<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.340> most<00:03:09.519> gain<00:03:09.850> from<00:03:10.150> using<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.600> a

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
I got the most gain from using just a

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.229 
I got the most gain from using just a
single<00:03:11.170> reflector<00:03:11.830> so<00:03:12.519> that's<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.940> design

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
single reflector so that's the design

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.479 
single reflector so that's the design
I've<00:03:13.450> got<00:03:13.630> going<00:03:13.989> here

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
I've got going here

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.570 
I've got going here
now<00:03:15.720> unfortunately<00:03:16.950> given<00:03:17.950> all<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.280> this

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
now unfortunately given all of this

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.120 
now unfortunately given all of this
antenna<00:03:19.060> I'm<00:03:19.540> still<00:03:20.110> not<00:03:20.350> able<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.739> pull<00:03:20.980> in

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
antenna I'm still not able to pull in

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.550 
antenna I'm still not able to pull in
the<00:03:21.280> channel<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:21.760> was<00:03:21.910> interested<00:03:22.209> in<00:03:22.569> this

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
the channel I was interested in this

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.410 
the channel I was interested in this
antenna<00:03:23.920> does<00:03:24.280> work<00:03:24.610> there<00:03:24.850> are<00:03:24.970> some<00:03:25.239> other

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
antenna does work there are some other

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.300 
antenna does work there are some other
channels<00:03:25.870> in<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.140> direction<00:03:26.319> it<00:03:26.739> does<00:03:27.040> pull

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
channels in that direction it does pull

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.550 
channels in that direction it does pull
them<00:03:27.459> in<00:03:27.640> it's<00:03:28.209> just<00:03:28.390> not<00:03:28.780> able<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.200> pull<00:03:29.410> in

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
them in it's just not able to pull in

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.320 
them in it's just not able to pull in
the<00:03:29.739> one<00:03:29.950> channel<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.459> was<00:03:30.580> trying<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.150> get

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
the one channel I was trying to get

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.539 
the one channel I was trying to get
which<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:32.140> kind<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.530> bummer<00:03:32.769> but<00:03:32.890> at<00:03:33.430> the

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
which is kind of a bummer but at the

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.100 
which is kind of a bummer but at the
same<00:03:33.700> time<00:03:33.970> this<00:03:34.120> was<00:03:34.299> definitely<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.780> fun

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
same time this was definitely a fun

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.470 
same time this was definitely a fun
project<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.799> I'm<00:03:36.610> glad<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:36.880> did<00:03:37.209> it

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
project and I'm glad I did it

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.160 
project and I'm glad I did it
so<00:03:38.290> yeah<00:03:38.680> if<00:03:39.340> you're<00:03:39.489> ever<00:03:40.150> curious<00:03:40.420> what<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.780> 20

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
so yeah if you're ever curious what a 20

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.080 
so yeah if you're ever curious what a 20
foot<00:03:41.320> long<00:03:41.500> antenna<00:03:42.190> looks<00:03:42.430> like<00:03:42.609> for<00:03:42.820> TV

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
foot long antenna looks like for TV

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.990 
foot long antenna looks like for TV
frequencies<00:03:43.690> here<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.680> go
