00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.550
 stage to encourage the public to dance to the rhythm of their rumbas 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.700

 It was in both older and young people they already appreciated their well-known cante as well 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.820
 as the way to surrender to the public when he transforms what he always

 he has been and will be a purebred artist
