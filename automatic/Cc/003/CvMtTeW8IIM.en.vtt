00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
splash of mango so that'll help give our

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.170 
splash of mango so that'll help give our
popsicles<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.930> sweet<00:01:22.590> flavor<00:01:23.159> without<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> ton

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
popsicles a sweet flavor without a ton

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.660 
popsicles a sweet flavor without a ton
of<00:01:24.210> sugar<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.200> these<00:01:25.380> coconut<00:01:25.830> waters<00:01:26.159> only

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
of sugar so these coconut waters only

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.179 
of sugar so these coconut waters only
have<00:01:27.150> 15<00:01:27.840> grams<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.380> sugar<00:01:28.619> there's<00:01:29.040> two

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
have 15 grams of sugar there's two

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.640 
have 15 grams of sugar there's two
servings<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:31.110> means<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.560> would

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
servings so that means that you would

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.760 
servings so that means that you would
have<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.040> drink<00:01:32.369> half<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.470> that

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
have to drink half of this to get that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.060 
have to drink half of this to get that
amount<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.460> sugar<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.270> you're<00:01:36.810> only<00:01:36.869> going<00:01:37.070> to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
amount of sugar so you're only going to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.640 
amount of sugar so you're only going to
be<00:01:38.159> putting<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.880> teeny<00:01:39.210> tiny<00:01:39.479> bit<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.110> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
be putting in a teeny tiny bit of this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.240 
be putting in a teeny tiny bit of this
into<00:01:41.640> your<00:01:41.850> popsicle<00:01:42.810> mold<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.740> really

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
into your popsicle mold so it's really

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.280 
into your popsicle mold so it's really
not<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.579> lot<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.850> sugar<00:01:44.939> at<00:01:45.240> all<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.630> then<00:01:45.780> your

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
not a lot of sugar at all and then your

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.740 
not a lot of sugar at all and then your
fruit<00:01:46.710> has<00:01:46.890> natural<00:01:47.340> sugars<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.850> are<00:01:48.119> fine

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
fruit has natural sugars they are fine

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.240 
fruit has natural sugars they are fine
so<00:01:48.869> they're<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.560> better<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:50.070> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
so they're going to be better for you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.520 
so they're going to be better for you
and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.210> last<00:01:51.750> you're<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> need<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and then last you're going to need a

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
other side and then I like to just drop

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.140 
other side and then I like to just drop
like<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.360> blueberry<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:29.370> few<00:04:30.370> blueberries<00:04:30.580> in

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
there if the blueberries are not frozen

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.210 
there if the blueberries are not frozen
they'll<00:04:35.020> tend<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.350> float<00:04:35.620> so<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:35.920> might<00:04:36.070> want

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
they'll tend to float so you might want

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.770 
they'll tend to float so you might want
to<00:04:36.250> put<00:04:36.400> those<00:04:36.520> in<00:04:36.760> first<00:04:37.120> if<00:04:37.420> you're<00:04:37.570> going<00:04:37.690> to

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
to add that till it fills up to the very

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.830 
to add that till it fills up to the very
top<00:04:49.170> where<00:04:50.170> you<00:04:50.260> can<00:04:50.410> stick<00:04:50.680> in<00:04:50.860> your<00:04:51.840> popsicle

top where you can stick in your popsicle
stick<00:04:53.080> without<00:04:53.800> it<00:04:54.540> overflowing<00:04:55.540> so<00:04:55.960> you

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
stick without it overflowing so you

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.740 
stick without it overflowing so you
stick<00:04:56.350> that<00:04:56.530> in<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:57.180> then<00:04:58.180> make<00:04:58.510> sure<00:04:58.540> that

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
just kind of give it a little shape you

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.860 
just kind of give it a little shape you
don't<00:05:05.830> want<00:05:05.980> it<00:05:06.070> to<00:05:06.780> have<00:05:07.780> ugly<00:05:08.050> spots<00:05:08.560> on<00:05:08.830> your

popsicle top and they are ready for the

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:19.259 
popsicle top and they are ready for the
freezer<00:06:18.009> so<00:06:18.610> then<00:06:18.819> you're<00:06:18.939> gonna<00:06:19.059> want<00:06:19.179> to<00:06:19.209> put

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:19.269 
freezer so then you're gonna want to put

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:22.439 
freezer so then you're gonna want to put
these<00:06:19.419> in<00:06:19.479> the<00:06:19.719> freezer<00:06:19.929> for<00:06:20.439> about<00:06:21.449> depends

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
these in the freezer for about depends

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.179 
these in the freezer for about depends
on<00:06:22.539> how<00:06:22.629> big<00:06:22.779> your<00:06:22.869> popsicles<00:06:23.499> molds<00:06:24.039> are

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:24.189 
on how big your popsicles molds are

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:26.399 
on how big your popsicles molds are
these<00:06:24.699> will<00:06:25.059> probably<00:06:25.149> take<00:06:25.509> maybe<00:06:25.689> like<00:06:25.989> four

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:26.409 
these will probably take maybe like four

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:28.319 
these will probably take maybe like four
hours<00:06:26.439> to<00:06:26.949> freeze<00:06:27.219> larger<00:06:27.639> popsicle<00:06:28.089> molds

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:28.329 
hours to freeze larger popsicle molds

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:30.809 
hours to freeze larger popsicle molds
will<00:06:28.419> take<00:06:28.599> about<00:06:28.869> six<00:06:29.379> hours<00:06:29.559> so<00:06:30.189> just<00:06:30.699> give

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819 
will take about six hours so just give

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:32.309 
will take about six hours so just give
them<00:06:30.939> some<00:06:31.119> time<00:06:31.269> to<00:06:31.299> fully<00:06:31.629> freeze<00:06:32.019> you

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 
them some time to fully freeze you

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.659 
them some time to fully freeze you
wouldn't<00:06:32.589> want<00:06:32.709> to<00:06:32.769> pull<00:06:32.979> the<00:06:33.099> stick<00:06:33.309> out<00:06:33.429> and

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
wouldn't want to pull the stick out and

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.339 
wouldn't want to pull the stick out and
not<00:06:33.789> be<00:06:33.969> fully<00:06:34.209> frozen<00:06:34.479> and<00:06:34.929> then<00:06:35.079> when<00:06:35.229> you're

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
not be fully frozen and then when you're

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.439 
not be fully frozen and then when you're
ready<00:06:35.379> to<00:06:35.829> enjoy<00:06:35.979> your<00:06:36.159> popsicle<00:06:36.849> just<00:06:37.269> take
