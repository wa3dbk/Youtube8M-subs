and<00:02:28.160> aloe<00:02:28.430> vera<00:02:28.670> juice<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.269> great<00:02:29.810> for<00:02:30.260> our

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
and aloe vera juice is great for our

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.979 
and aloe vera juice is great for our
hair<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.819> I<00:02:31.849> think<00:02:32.030> that's<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.780> reason

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
hair and so I think that's the reason

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.289 
hair and so I think that's the reason
these<00:02:33.560> products<00:02:34.280> work<00:02:34.489> so<00:02:34.730> well<00:02:34.940> for<00:02:35.180> me

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
these products work so well for me

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.449 
these products work so well for me
because<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.900> aloe<00:02:36.080> vera<00:02:36.349> juice<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.950> I

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
because of the aloe vera juice and I

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.809 
because of the aloe vera juice and I
made<00:02:38.450> up<00:02:38.569> my<00:02:38.750> mind<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:39.230> once<00:02:39.680> I'm<00:02:40.040> able<00:02:40.370> to

this starting point I would say it

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.410 
this starting point I would say it
definitely<00:03:41.980> reduces<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.489> amount<00:03:43.970> of<00:03:44.090> frizz

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.120 
kawatche yesterday and then I let my
hair<00:04:16.970> air<00:04:17.150> dry<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.900> then<00:04:18.500> after<00:04:18.829> it<00:04:18.980> was

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
hair air dry and then after it was

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.699 
hair air dry and then after it was
totally<00:04:19.730> dry<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.299> combed<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.870> out<00:04:21.019> with<00:04:21.260> my<00:04:21.470> wide
