00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
some racism particularly brandy this

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.500 
some racism particularly brandy this
year<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:13.980> went<00:02:14.190> into<00:02:14.370> pretty<00:02:14.849> tied<00:02:15.120> because<00:02:15.330> we

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
year I went into pretty tied because we

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.170 
year I went into pretty tied because we
trained<00:02:15.780> very<00:02:16.049> hard<00:02:16.170> going<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:16.950> yeah<00:02:17.459> so

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
trained very hard going to that yeah so

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.000 
trained very hard going to that yeah so
I<00:02:18.209> was<00:02:18.660> uncomfortable<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.500> lot<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.799> time

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
I was uncomfortable a lot of the time

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.100 
I was uncomfortable a lot of the time
during<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.580> Romany<00:02:21.000> which<00:02:21.780> sounds

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
during the Romany which sounds

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.869 
during the Romany which sounds
ridiculous<00:02:22.560> because<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.920> won<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.220> race<00:02:23.370> 12

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
ridiculous because I won the race 12

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:29.059 
ridiculous because I won the race 12
stages<00:02:24.950> but<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.379> find<00:02:28.379> it<00:02:28.530> difficult<00:02:28.620> race

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
stages but so I find it difficult race

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.500 
stages but so I find it difficult race
in<00:02:29.280> like<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.580> thing<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.910> understand<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.480> have

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
in like that thing I understand I have

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.789 
in like that thing I understand I have
to<00:02:30.810> race<00:02:30.989> like<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.230> since<00:02:31.680> obviously

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
to race like that since obviously

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.199 
to race like that since obviously
because<00:02:32.129> if<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.310> don't<00:02:32.430> do<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.730> training<00:02:33.000> and

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
because if you don't do the training and

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.759 
because if you don't do the training and
then<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.420> can't<00:02:33.629> get<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:33.989> position<00:02:36.769> so

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
then you can't get to this position so

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.410 
then you can't get to this position so
doping<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.310> was<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.519> first<00:02:38.700> time<00:02:38.940> we<00:02:39.120> kind<00:02:39.360> of

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
doping it was the first time we kind of

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.819 
doping it was the first time we kind of
backed<00:02:39.629> off<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.959> training<00:02:40.319> going<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.799> a

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
backed off the training going to a

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.460 
backed off the training going to a
little<00:02:41.129> bit<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.629> so<00:02:42.629> it<00:02:42.720> was<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.840> relief<00:02:43.140> for<00:02:43.200> me

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
little bit and so it was a relief for me

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.050 
little bit and so it was a relief for me
there<00:02:43.650> after<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:44.040> time<00:02:44.250> strong<00:02:44.519> stuff<00:02:44.819> there

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
there after the time strong stuff there

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.910 
there after the time strong stuff there

troll so it was kind of just reassurance
of<00:03:58.620> everything<00:03:59.550> so<00:03:59.730> abstract<00:03:59.880> I<00:04:00.180> think<00:04:00.360> I<00:04:00.420> had

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
of everything so abstract I think I had

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.330 
of everything so abstract I think I had
to<00:04:00.780> fit<00:04:00.959> about<00:04:01.050> very<00:04:01.410> real<00:04:01.650> contender<00:04:02.130> for<00:04:02.250> the

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
to fit about very real contender for the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.970 
to fit about very real contender for the
tour<00:04:02.550> I<00:04:02.880> had<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.840> be<00:04:03.990> like<00:04:04.020> that<00:04:04.380> in<00:04:04.530> Bethany

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
tour I had to be like that in Bethany

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.309 
tour I had to be like that in Bethany
because<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.370> think<00:04:05.430> that's<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:06.000> marketable

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
because I think that's the marketable

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.580 
because I think that's the marketable
the<00:04:08.280> papers<00:04:08.819> for<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:08.999> tool<00:04:09.239> because<00:04:09.590> after

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
the papers for the tool because after

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.709 
the papers for the tool because after
dr.<00:04:10.890> day<00:04:10.980> last<00:04:11.219> year<00:04:11.370> don't<00:04:11.609> think<00:04:11.819> so<00:04:12.060> that

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:12.719 
dr. day last year don't think so that

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.479 
dr. day last year don't think so that
was<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.930> tour<00:04:13.230> winning<00:04:13.560> performance<00:04:14.069> and<00:04:14.219> open

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
was a tour winning performance and open

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.490 
was a tour winning performance and open
a<00:04:14.579> I<00:04:14.609> think<00:04:14.969> it<00:04:15.090> was<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.239> top<00:04:15.540> five<00:04:15.780> top<00:04:16.199> three

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
a I think it was a top five top three

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.330 
a I think it was a top five top three
maybe<00:04:16.739> pole<00:04:17.039> game<00:04:17.220> tight<00:04:18.829> so<00:04:19.829> yeah<00:04:20.039> that's

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
maybe pole game tight so yeah that's

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.820 
maybe pole game tight so yeah that's
kind<00:04:20.669> of<00:04:20.699> with
