afterwards<00:00:18.720> before<00:00:19.470> i<00:00:19.500> start<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:20.220> note<00:00:20.400> that

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
afterwards before i start just note that

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.980 
afterwards before i start just note that
i'm<00:00:20.699> not<00:00:20.910> going<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.240> say<00:00:21.420> any<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
i'm not going to say any of the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.259 
i'm not going to say any of the
percentages<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.039> because<00:00:23.460> most<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.119> them

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
percentages in this because most of them

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.179 
percentages in this because most of them
for<00:00:24.539> all<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.930> trinkets<00:00:25.170> are<00:00:25.500> actually<00:00:25.949> wrong

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
for all the trinkets are actually wrong

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.070 
for all the trinkets are actually wrong
and<00:00:26.519> if<00:00:27.060> they<00:00:27.180> are<00:00:27.330> correct<00:00:27.599> now<00:00:27.869> they'll

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
and if they are correct now they'll

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.650 
and if they are correct now they'll
probably<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.800> changed<00:00:29.160> before<00:00:29.250> 6.2<00:00:30.090> goes

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660

nerfs coming up in the future the fact

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.910 
nerfs coming up in the future the fact
that<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:12.270> got<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> pretty<00:01:12.869> good<00:01:13.049> trinket<00:01:13.530> mage

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that they got a pretty good trinket mage

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.800 
that they got a pretty good trinket mage
class<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:15.090> actually<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.420> little<00:01:15.600> bit

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
class that is it's actually a little bit

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.420 
class that is it's actually a little bit
surprising<00:01:16.200> because<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.770> would<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.250> thought

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
surprising because I would have thought

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.820 
surprising because I would have thought
blizzard<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.180> trying<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.689> tone<00:01:19.140> back<00:01:19.380> mages

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
blizzard was trying to tone back mages

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.649 
blizzard was trying to tone back mages
even<00:01:20.130> more<00:01:20.340> than<00:01:20.610> they<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.240> at<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> moment

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
even more than they are at the moment

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.050 
even more than they are at the moment
but<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.140> seems<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.740> trinket<00:01:23.070> does<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
but it seems like this trinket does the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.350 
but it seems like this trinket does the
exact<00:01:24.450> opposite<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:26.189> arcane<00:01:26.970> power<00:01:27.000> is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
exact opposite so arcane power is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.210 
exact opposite so arcane power is
basically<00:01:27.780> used<00:01:27.990> by<00:01:28.140> arcane<00:01:28.560> mages<00:01:28.799> as

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
basically used by arcane mages as

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.310 
basically used by arcane mages as
frequently<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:29.880> possible<00:01:30.060> they're<00:01:30.840> using<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
frequently as possible they're using it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
frequently as possible they're using it
when<00:01:31.439> they're<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.740> through<00:01:31.860> their<00:01:32.100> burn

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
when they're going through their burn

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.160 
when they're going through their burn
phase<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.150> burn<00:01:33.390> phase<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.840> when<00:01:33.990> they're

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
phase the burn phase is when they're

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.710 
phase the burn phase is when they're

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
able to benefit from this for the first

able to benefit from this for the first

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
ice Lance in an AoE situation but pretty

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.270 
ice Lance in an AoE situation but pretty
much<00:03:22.260> after<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.620> you're<00:03:22.860> not<00:03:22.980> really<00:03:23.130> going

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
much after that you're not really going

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.520 
much after that you're not really going
to<00:03:23.340> benefit<00:03:23.670> from<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:24.030> even<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:24.660> single<00:03:25.110> target

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
to benefit from it even on single target

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.710 
to benefit from it even on single target
on<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.950> start<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.310> pole<00:03:26.670> or<00:03:27.090> during<00:03:27.630> a

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
burn phase when they have cooldowns up

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.320 
burn phase when they have cooldowns up
you<00:03:29.280> know<00:03:29.370> when<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.550> have<00:03:29.640> your<00:03:29.730> icy<00:03:30.180> veins

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
you know when you have your icy veins

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.420 
you know when you have your icy veins
going<00:03:30.780> on<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.500> have<00:03:31.590> your<00:03:31.680> frozen<00:03:31.920> orb<00:03:32.250> up

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
going on you have your frozen orb up

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.580 
going on you have your frozen orb up
with<00:03:32.730> your<00:03:32.940> prismatic<00:03:33.480> Krystal<00:03:33.959> you're<00:03:34.440> going

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
with your prismatic Krystal you're going

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.110 
with your prismatic Krystal you're going
to<00:03:34.650> begin<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:34.920> good<00:03:35.190> amount<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.489> ice<00:03:35.640> alliances

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
to begin a good amount of ice alliances

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.880 
to begin a good amount of ice alliances
especially<00:03:36.660> with<00:03:36.780> some<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.110> tier<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.770> all

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
especially with some of the tier and all

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.229 
especially with some of the tier and all
those<00:03:38.040> kind<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.430> things<00:03:38.489> they're<00:03:38.910> not<00:03:39.090> really

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
those kind of things they're not really

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.100 
those kind of things they're not really
going<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.450> be<00:03:39.570> able<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.810> incorporate

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
going to be able to incorporate

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.140 
going to be able to incorporate
frostbolt<00:03:40.830> in<00:03:41.040> between<00:03:41.370> those<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.640> sciences

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
frostbolt in between those I sciences

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.630 
frostbolt in between those I sciences
and<00:03:42.330> so<00:03:42.840> it's<00:03:42.989> really<00:03:43.080> not<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.440> amazing<00:03:44.100> but

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
and so it's really not that amazing but

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.699 
and so it's really not that amazing but
obviously<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.239> is<00:03:45.360> above<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.870> for<00:03:46.410> single

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
obviously it is above and for single

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.920 
obviously it is above and for single
target<00:03:47.160> damage<00:03:47.640> when<00:03:48.360> you're<00:03:48.480> just<00:03:48.660> kind<00:03:48.870> of

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
target damage when you're just kind of

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.600 
target damage when you're just kind of
in<00:03:49.140> between<00:03:49.290> your<00:03:49.650> cooldowns<00:03:50.130> or<00:03:50.370> in<00:03:50.489> between

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
in between your cooldowns or in between

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.580 
in between your cooldowns or in between
prismatic<00:03:51.209> Krystal<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.570> frozen<00:03:51.870> orb<00:03:52.170> you

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
prismatic Krystal and frozen orb you

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.570 
prismatic Krystal and frozen orb you
know<00:03:52.680> obviously<00:03:52.860> there's<00:03:53.280> going<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.489> be<00:03:53.520> a

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
know obviously there's going to be a

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.370 
know obviously there's going to be a
nice<00:03:53.700> buff<00:03:54.000> because<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.540> can<00:03:54.720> control<00:03:55.140> it<00:03:55.260> a

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
nice buff because you can control it a

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.860 
nice buff because you can control it a
lot<00:03:55.590> more<00:03:55.620> I'm<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.190> good<00:03:56.760> example<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.300> that<00:03:57.360> is

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
lot more I'm a good example of that is

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.979 
lot more I'm a good example of that is
if<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.650> want<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:58.980> use<00:03:59.160> your<00:03:59.600> what's<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.750> called

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
if you want to use your what's it called

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.900 
if you want to use your what's it called
the<00:04:01.380> one<00:04:01.530> with<00:04:01.650> your<00:04:01.800> pet<00:04:02.070> water<00:04:02.400> elemental

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
the one with your pet water elemental

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.520 
the one with your pet water elemental
water<00:04:03.090> jet<00:04:03.390> sorry<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:03.780> had<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:03.959> think<00:04:04.170> about<00:04:04.320> it

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
water jet sorry I had to think about it

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.380 
water jet sorry I had to think about it
for<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.709> sec<00:04:04.920> but<00:04:05.130> if<00:04:05.580> you<00:04:05.700> do<00:04:05.820> your<00:04:05.940> water<00:04:06.150> jet

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
for a sec but if you do your water jet

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.550 
for a sec but if you do your water jet
right<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:06.720> you're<00:04:06.840> going<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:06.989> do<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.170> activate

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
right so you're going to do you activate

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.229 
right so you're going to do you activate
water<00:04:07.890> jet<00:04:08.100> with<00:04:08.250> your<00:04:08.370> pet<00:04:08.550> as<00:04:08.730> your<00:04:08.910> cast<00:04:09.090> and

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
water jet with your pet as your cast and

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.030 
water jet with your pet as your cast and
frostbolt<00:04:09.780> do<00:04:09.989> your<00:04:10.110> second<00:04:10.470> frostbolt<00:04:10.830> now

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
frostbolt do your second frostbolt now

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.250 
frostbolt do your second frostbolt now
you<00:04:11.100> have<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.459> ice<00:04:11.640> Lance's<00:04:12.090> up<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.720> cast<00:04:13.050> one

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
you have to ice Lance's up it cast one

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.750 
you have to ice Lance's up it cast one
of<00:04:13.350> your<00:04:13.440> ice<00:04:13.530> lenses<00:04:13.980> because<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.310> just<00:04:14.550> cast

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
of your ice lenses because you just cast

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.670 
of your ice lenses because you just cast
for<00:04:15.030> us<00:04:15.090> both<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:15.900> increases<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.410> damage

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
for us both that increases the damage

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.840 
for us both that increases the damage
and<00:04:16.919> then<00:04:17.130> you're<00:04:17.250> going<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.430> test<00:04:17.640> another

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
and then you're going to test another

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.789 
and then you're going to test another
first<00:04:18.239> ball<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:18.630> do<00:04:18.720> another<00:04:18.840> ice<00:04:19.230> lights<00:04:19.560> on

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
first ball and do another ice lights on

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.770 
first ball and do another ice lights on
so<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:20.519> know<00:04:20.609> obviously<00:04:20.790> it<00:04:21.120> is<00:04:21.299> quite<00:04:21.600> nice

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
so you know obviously it is quite nice

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.140 
so you know obviously it is quite nice
for<00:04:21.840> those<00:04:22.260> situations<00:04:22.919> in<00:04:23.070> between<00:04:23.490> but<00:04:24.030> as

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
for those situations in between but as

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.330 
for those situations in between but as
far<00:04:24.360> as<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.600> being<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:25.050> best<00:04:25.320> for<00:04:25.680> na<00:04:25.890> we<00:04:25.919> sit

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
far as it being the best for na we sit

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.520 
far as it being the best for na we sit
to

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
to

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.050 
to
nation<00:04:26.860> or<00:04:27.100> a<00:04:27.160> point<00:04:27.639> where<00:04:27.790> you're<00:04:27.940> really

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
nation or a point where you're really

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.250 
nation or a point where you're really
burning<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.600> boss<00:04:28.750> because<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.110> have<00:04:29.200> all

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
burning the boss because you have all

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.660 
burning the boss because you have all
your<00:04:29.410> cooldowns<00:04:29.830> up<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.160> don't<00:04:30.220> think<00:04:30.550> it's

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
your cooldowns up I don't think it's

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.570 
your cooldowns up I don't think it's
going<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:30.820> be<00:04:30.910> as<00:04:31.120> good<00:04:31.660> as<00:04:32.350> in<00:04:32.590> between<00:04:32.920> now

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
going to be as good as in between now

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.800 
going to be as good as in between now
those<00:04:33.790> are<00:04:33.820> my<00:04:34.000> thoughts<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.420> tomb<00:04:34.660> of

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
those are my thoughts on tomb of

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.780 
those are my thoughts on tomb of
shifting<00:04:35.169> words<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:35.590> think<00:04:36.040> overall<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.760> is

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
shifting words I think overall it is

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.060 
shifting words I think overall it is
nice<00:04:37.450> buffs<00:04:37.780> for<00:04:38.020> all<00:04:38.169> three<00:04:38.470> specs<00:04:38.800> but<00:04:39.010> I

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
nice buffs for all three specs but I

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.700 
nice buffs for all three specs but I
think<00:04:39.340> fire<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:40.030> arcane<00:04:40.450> mages<00:04:40.690> kind<00:04:41.470> of<00:04:41.560> come

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
think fire and arcane mages kind of come

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.830 
think fire and arcane mages kind of come
out<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.860> little<00:04:42.070> bit<00:04:42.280> more<00:04:42.430> ahead<00:04:42.700> than<00:04:43.120> frost<00:04:43.540> I

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
out a little bit more ahead than frost I

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.750 
out a little bit more ahead than frost I
don't<00:04:44.260> think<00:04:44.320> this<00:04:44.590> really<00:04:44.800> makes<00:04:44.980> frost<00:04:45.310> Opie

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
don't think this really makes frost Opie

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.970 
don't think this really makes frost Opie
however<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.720> do<00:04:47.020> think<00:04:47.169> it<00:04:47.500> will<00:04:47.590> bring<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:47.889> up

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
however I do think it will bring it up

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.670 
however I do think it will bring it up
up<00:04:48.790> to<00:04:48.850> par<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.270> little<00:04:49.840> bit<00:04:49.960> simply<00:04:50.350> because

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
up to par a little bit simply because

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.570 
up to par a little bit simply because
they're<00:04:50.860> going<00:04:50.980> to<00:04:51.040> be<00:04:51.130> able<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.430> maintain

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
they're going to be able to maintain

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.510 
they're going to be able to maintain
more<00:04:52.090> dps<00:04:52.600> in<00:04:52.840> between<00:04:53.530> their<00:04:53.680> burn<00:04:53.830> phases<00:04:54.310> in

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
more dps in between their burn phases in

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.970 
more dps in between their burn phases in
between<00:04:55.180> their<00:04:55.419> initial<00:04:56.110> burst<00:04:56.320> basically

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
between their initial burst basically

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.890 
between their initial burst basically
like<00:04:57.160> they're<00:04:57.820> just<00:04:58.180> going<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.389> have<00:04:58.690> more

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
like they're just going to have more

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.540 
like they're just going to have more
sustained<00:04:59.320> dps<00:04:59.770> which<00:05:00.010> has<00:05:00.160> always<00:05:00.310> been<00:05:00.490> a

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
sustained dps which has always been a

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.700 
sustained dps which has always been a
problem<00:05:00.730> with<00:05:00.940> frost<00:05:01.180> mages<00:05:01.450> on<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:02.350> problem

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
problem with frost mages on the problem

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.130 
problem with frost mages on the problem
being<00:05:02.860> that<00:05:02.950> they<00:05:03.250> have<00:05:03.400> high<00:05:03.669> burst<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.240> then

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
being that they have high burst and then

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.600 
being that they have high burst and then
after<00:05:05.530> that<00:05:05.560> they<00:05:05.890> have<00:05:06.040> nothing<00:05:06.400> until

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
after that they have nothing until

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.970 
after that they have nothing until
cooldowns<00:05:07.180> are<00:05:07.360> up<00:05:07.450> again<00:05:07.720> so<00:05:08.320> those<00:05:08.740> are<00:05:08.770> my

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
cooldowns are up again so those are my
