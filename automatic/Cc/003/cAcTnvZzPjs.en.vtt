you heard the air coming out that should

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.280 
you heard the air coming out that should
do<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.759> guess

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
do it I guess

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.330 
do it I guess
let's<00:02:08.290> think<00:02:08.410> we<00:02:08.560> can<00:02:08.680> find<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.979> can<00:02:09.100> see<00:02:09.250> all

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
let's think we can find you can see all

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.910 
let's think we can find you can see all
the<00:02:09.430> other<00:02:09.550> spots<00:02:09.880> we've<00:02:10.060> been<00:02:10.180> hitting<00:02:10.450> it

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the other spots we've been hitting it
