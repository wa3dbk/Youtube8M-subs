00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
some of you guys have been asking me how

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.480 
some of you guys have been asking me how
to<00:00:03.540> get<00:00:03.750> Daggerfall<00:00:04.350> running<00:00:04.710> on<00:00:04.890> DOSBox

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
to get Daggerfall running on DOSBox

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.990 
to get Daggerfall running on DOSBox
turbo<00:00:05.839> well<00:00:06.839> I've<00:00:07.140> never<00:00:07.620> tried<00:00:08.490> installing

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
turbo well I've never tried installing

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.910 
turbo well I've never tried installing
Daggerfall<00:00:09.630> before<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.260> thought<00:00:10.620> I'd<00:00:10.769> give

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
Daggerfall before so I thought I'd give

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.759 
Daggerfall before so I thought I'd give
it<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.070> shot<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.340> see<00:00:11.910> what<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:13.170> can<00:00:13.380> do<00:00:13.469> for<00:00:13.679> you

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
it a shot and see what I can do for you

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.240 
it a shot and see what I can do for you
guys<00:00:13.920> I'm<00:00:14.610> using<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.179> new<00:00:15.330> DOSBox<00:00:15.900> turbo<00:00:16.250> 1.3

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
guys I'm using the new DOSBox turbo 1.3

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.630 
guys I'm using the new DOSBox turbo 1.3
and<00:00:17.869> this<00:00:18.869> version<00:00:19.230> comes<00:00:19.439> with<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.980> profile

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and this version comes with a profile

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.880 
and this version comes with a profile
manager<00:00:21.210> or<00:00:21.449> DOSBox<00:00:22.020> manager<00:00:22.500> lets<00:00:22.800> you

manager or DOSBox manager lets you
manage<00:00:23.070> your<00:00:23.369> game<00:00:23.550> profiles<00:00:24.060> I'm<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.570> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
manage your game profiles I'm going to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.839 
manage your game profiles I'm going to
be<00:00:24.720> using<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:26.070> let's<00:00:26.430> get<00:00:26.760> started<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:28.849> as

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
be using that so let's get started so as

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.749 
be using that so let's get started so as
you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.390> I've<00:00:30.570> already<00:00:30.900> created<00:00:31.289> a

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
you can see I've already created a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.270 
you can see I've already created a
Daggerfall<00:00:32.759> profile<00:00:33.829> let's<00:00:34.829> go<00:00:35.010> ahead<00:00:35.070> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
Daggerfall profile let's go ahead and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.920 
Daggerfall profile let's go ahead and
take<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> look<00:00:35.670> at<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> see<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.570> settings

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
take a look at it and see what settings

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.010 
take a look at it and see what settings
I've<00:00:37.050> used<00:00:40.100> so<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:42.300> key<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.989> getting

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
I've used so the key to getting

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.350 
I've used so the key to getting
Daggerfall<00:00:43.829> set<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.579> use<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.090> correct

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360

Daggerfall set up is to use the correct
dose<00:00:45.539> box<00:00:45.840> settings<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:47.270> you<00:00:48.270> want<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> make

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
dose box settings and you want to make

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.500 
dose box settings and you want to make
sure<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:49.079> memory<00:00:49.649> size<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.280> set<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.640> 16

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.490 

I<00:00:54.210> left<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.050> frame<00:00:55.320> skip<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:58.050> left<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
I left the frame skip and the I left the

cycles<00:01:01.399> what<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.430> did<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:02.940> I'm<00:01:03.210> using<00:01:03.570> this

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
cycles what I did was I'm using this

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
cycles what I did was I'm using this
option<00:01:04.080> right<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:04.979> CPU<00:01:05.519> auto

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820

option right here the for CPU auto
option<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:08.369> what<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.640> does

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
option I have that on and what that does

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.300 
option I have that on and what that does
is<00:01:10.040> it<00:01:11.040> will<00:01:11.400> let<00:01:12.119> DOSBox<00:01:12.960> turbo<00:01:13.080> select<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
is it will let DOSBox turbo select the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.580 
is it will let DOSBox turbo select the
the<00:01:14.700> correct<00:01:15.030> cycles<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.900> long<00:01:16.080> as<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.380> have

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the correct cycles as long as you have

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.280 
the correct cycles as long as you have
the<00:01:16.799> cycles<00:01:17.220> set<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> high<00:01:17.909> enough<00:01:18.119> value<00:01:18.630> so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the cycles set to a high enough value so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.490 
the cycles set to a high enough value so
I<00:01:19.320> set<00:01:19.650> cycles<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.520> 20,000<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.689> I'm<00:01:22.290> letting

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
I set cycles to 20,000 and I'm letting

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.569 
I set cycles to 20,000 and I'm letting
DOSBox<00:01:23.159> turbo<00:01:25.939> manage<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> CPU<00:01:27.950> by<00:01:28.950> reducing

DOSBox turbo manage the CPU by reducing

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.160 
DOSBox turbo manage the CPU by reducing
the<00:01:29.700> cycles<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.509> there's<00:01:30.720> no<00:01:30.840> audio

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the cycles so that there's no audio

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.530 
the cycles so that there's no audio
stubborn<00:01:31.619> now<00:01:31.770> that's<00:01:32.009> not<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.390> optimal<00:01:33.390> way

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
stubborn now that's not the optimal way

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.090 
stubborn now that's not the optimal way
of<00:01:33.720> getting<00:01:34.020> started<00:01:36.110> really<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.920> want

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
of getting started really if you want

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.670 
of getting started really if you want
the<00:01:38.220> maximum<00:01:38.520> speed<00:01:39.180> out<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.479> your<00:01:39.600> device<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
the maximum speed out of your device you

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.219 
the maximum speed out of your device you
probably<00:01:41.040> want<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> disable<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.509> option<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
probably want to disable this option and

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.120 
probably want to disable this option and
set<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.220> cycle<00:01:44.700> rate<00:01:44.939> optimally<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.130> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
set the cycle rate optimally for the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.289 
set the cycle rate optimally for the
game<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.610> you're<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.060> playing

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
game that you're going to be playing

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.480 
game that you're going to be playing
however<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.110> wanted<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.159> running

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
however I wanted to get up and running

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.819 
however I wanted to get up and running
as<00:01:50.610> quickly<00:01:50.670> as<00:01:51.090> possible<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.470> didn't

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
as quickly as possible and it didn't

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.740 
as quickly as possible and it didn't
really<00:01:52.890> seem<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> affect<00:01:53.610> performance<00:01:54.240> that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
really seem to affect performance that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.539 
really seem to affect performance that
much<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.860> went<00:01:56.130> ahead<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.399> did<00:01:56.490> that

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
much so I went ahead and did that

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.560 
much so I went ahead and did that
everything<00:01:59.549> else<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.090> same

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
everything else is the same

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.179 
everything else is the same
other<00:02:00.869> than<00:02:01.640> autoexec<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:03.890> input<00:02:04.890> an<00:02:05.009> auto

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
other than autoexec I input an auto

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.219 
other than autoexec I input an auto
exact<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.759> takes<00:02:06.000> me<00:02:06.210> directly<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
exact that takes me directly to the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.040 
exact that takes me directly to the
Daggerfall<00:02:07.920> directory<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:09.110> could<00:02:10.110> have

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
Daggerfall directory I could have

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.260 
Daggerfall directory I could have
have<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.560> game<00:02:11.800> auto<00:02:12.100> start<00:02:12.610> at<00:02:12.820> this<00:02:13.180> point

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
have the game auto start at this point

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.180 
have the game auto start at this point
as<00:02:13.570> well<00:02:13.780> but<00:02:14.110> I'm<00:02:14.260> not<00:02:14.290> going<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.620> do<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.950> for

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
as well but I'm not going to do that for

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.830 
as well but I'm not going to do that for
your<00:02:15.340> benefit<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.300> can<00:02:16.450> see<00:02:16.600> some<00:02:16.810> of

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
your benefit so that you can see some of

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.440 
your benefit so that you can see some of
the<00:02:16.960> other<00:02:17.140> setup<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:18.340> I've<00:02:18.520> done<00:02:18.820> with

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
the other setup that I've done with

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.520 
the other setup that I've done with
Daggerfall<00:02:21.300> let's<00:02:22.300> see<00:02:22.480> anything<00:02:22.690> else<00:02:23.110> the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
Daggerfall let's see anything else the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.620 
Daggerfall let's see anything else the
only<00:02:24.070> other<00:02:24.220> thing<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:25.120> did<00:02:25.270> was<00:02:25.570> I

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
only other thing that I did was I

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.810 
only other thing that I did was I
changed<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.590> default<00:02:26.800> sound<00:02:27.280> blaster<00:02:27.700> from

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
changed the default sound blaster from

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
changed the default sound blaster from
sound<00:02:28.150> blaster<00:02:28.540> 16<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.620> sound<00:02:29.860> blaster<00:02:30.250> two<00:02:30.840> I

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
sound blaster 16 to sound blaster two I

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.960 
sound blaster 16 to sound blaster two I
did<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.530> because<00:02:32.740> I<00:02:32.980> think<00:02:33.400> it's<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.730> little

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
did that because I think it's a little

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.200 
did that because I think it's a little
bit<00:02:34.090> faster<00:02:34.570> although<00:02:35.070> I'm<00:02:36.070> not<00:02:36.400> 100%<00:02:37.150> sure

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
bit faster although I'm not 100% sure

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.780 
bit faster although I'm not 100% sure
your<00:02:37.930> mileage<00:02:38.290> may<00:02:38.320> vary<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.890> may<00:02:39.040> very<00:02:39.640> well

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
your mileage may vary you may very well

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.850 
your mileage may vary you may very well
get<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.210> same<00:02:40.390> speed<00:02:40.660> with<00:02:40.840> sound<00:02:41.020> blaster<00:02:41.410> 16

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
get the same speed with sound blaster 16

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.770 
get the same speed with sound blaster 16
and<00:02:42.100> you'll<00:02:42.250> definitely<00:02:43.000> get<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.360> little<00:02:43.660> bit

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
and you'll definitely get a little bit

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.320 
and you'll definitely get a little bit
better<00:02:44.080> sound<00:02:44.650> quality<00:02:44.770> with<00:02:45.460> sound<00:02:45.970> blaster

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
better sound quality with sound blaster

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.550 
better sound quality with sound blaster
16<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:50.850> other<00:02:51.850> settings<00:02:52.480> are<00:02:52.750> all<00:02:53.050> at

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
16 so the other settings are all at

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.840 
16 so the other settings are all at
their<00:02:54.250> default<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:56.380> only<00:02:57.040> other<00:02:57.280> setting

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
their default the only other setting

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.350 
their default the only other setting
that<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.060> did<00:02:58.600> change<00:02:59.080> was<00:02:59.830> this<00:03:00.460> keep<00:03:00.820> aspect

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
that I did change was this keep aspect

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.990 
that I did change was this keep aspect
ratio<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.780> turned<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.350> off<00:03:02.500> because<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.490> like<00:03:03.850> to

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
ratio I turned it off because I like to

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.250 
ratio I turned it off because I like to
have<00:03:04.180> my<00:03:04.710> games<00:03:05.710> stretched<00:03:06.750> full<00:03:07.750> screen<00:03:08.080> on

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
have my games stretched full screen on

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.030 
have my games stretched full screen on
my<00:03:08.290> transformer<00:03:09.190> tablet<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:11.320> let's<00:03:11.770> go<00:03:11.920> ahead

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
my transformer tablet so let's go ahead

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.150 
my transformer tablet so let's go ahead
and<00:03:12.960> start<00:03:13.960> this<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.380> see<00:03:14.530> what<00:03:14.650> happens

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
and start this and see what happens

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.830 
and start this and see what happens
so<00:03:16.770> should<00:03:17.770> take<00:03:17.980> us<00:03:18.160> directly<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.840> dose

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840

that<00:03:43.410> as<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.590> can<00:03:44.740> see<00:03:44.860> I've<00:03:45.010> already<00:03:45.130> done<00:03:45.400> it

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
that as you can see I've already done it

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.660 
that as you can see I've already done it
you<00:03:46.420> can<00:03:46.540> go<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.720> auto<00:03:46.960> detect<00:03:47.080> and<00:03:47.860> it<00:03:48.370> should

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
you can go to auto detect and it should

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.520 
you can go to auto detect and it should
detect<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.180> device<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.690> you're<00:03:49.930> using<00:03:50.200> in

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
this case I'm using the sound blaster

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.160 
this case I'm using the sound blaster
instead<00:03:53.020> of<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.260> sound<00:03:53.440> blaster<00:03:53.530> 16<00:03:55.170> one

instead of the sound blaster 16 one
thing<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.770> want<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.010> make<00:03:57.100> sure<00:03:57.130> of<00:03:57.850> is<00:03:58.720> you

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.140 
to be running fall Exe one other thing I
wanted<00:04:33.480> to<00:04:33.540> show<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:34.550> there<00:04:35.550> is<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.730> config

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
wanted to show you there is a config

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.390 
wanted to show you there is a config
file<00:04:36.420> called<00:04:37.050> Z<00:04:37.350> CFG<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:39.740> in<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:41.040> config

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
file called Z CFG and in that config

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.940 
file called Z CFG and in that config
file<00:04:41.640> it<00:04:41.940> will<00:04:42.120> have<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.420> correct<00:04:42.720> path<00:04:43.140> to

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
file it will have the correct path to

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.020 
file it will have the correct path to
your<00:04:44.930> Daggerfall<00:04:45.930> arena<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:46.830> directory<00:04:47.400> you

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
your Daggerfall arena to directory you

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.580 
your Daggerfall arena to directory you
need<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.300> make<00:04:48.660> sure<00:04:48.690> you<00:04:48.930> set<00:04:49.140> those<00:04:49.290> paths

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
need to make sure you set those paths

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.490 
need to make sure you set those paths
before<00:04:49.980> you<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:50.670> begin<00:04:51.080> ok<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.140> let's<00:04:52.440> start

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
before you you begin ok so let's start

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.990 
before you you begin ok so let's start
the<00:04:52.740> game<00:04:54.560> so<00:04:55.560> we're<00:04:55.680> going<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.830> run<00:04:55.980> fall<00:04:56.220> Exe

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
the game so we're going to run fall Exe

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.160 
the game so we're going to run fall Exe
z<00:04:58.520> CFG<00:04:59.550> and<00:05:01.430> then<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.520> game<00:05:02.670> should<00:05:02.880> start<00:05:03.240> up

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:12.970 

and<00:05:07.170> here<00:05:07.380> it<00:05:07.500> goes<00:05:08.150> skip<00:05:09.150> title<00:05:09.900> screen<00:05:11.900> now

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
and here it goes skip title screen now

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.530 
and here it goes skip title screen now
I'm<00:05:13.980> going<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.190> go<00:05:14.310> ahead<00:05:14.400> and<00:05:14.670> start<00:05:15.390> a<00:05:15.510> new

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
I'm going to go ahead and start a new

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.520 
I'm going to go ahead and start a new
game<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:17.180> I'll<00:05:18.180> just<00:05:18.390> pick<00:05:18.630> any<00:05:18.870> home

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
game and I'll just pick any home

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.870 
game and I'll just pick any home

province oops
let's<00:05:25.480> see<00:05:26.080> I<00:05:27.570> haven't<00:05:28.570> played<00:05:28.930> Daggerfall<00:05:29.800> so

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
let's see I haven't played Daggerfall so

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.879 
let's see I haven't played Daggerfall so
I'm<00:05:30.160> not<00:05:30.750> too<00:05:31.750> sure<00:05:31.960> what<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.320> do<00:05:32.440> here<00:05:32.470> but<00:05:32.740> I'm

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
I'm not too sure what to do here but I'm

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.210 
I'm not too sure what to do here but I'm
going<00:05:33.010> to<00:05:33.070> go<00:05:33.130> ahead<00:05:33.220> and<00:05:33.400> create<00:05:34.180> a<00:05:34.300> character

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
going to go ahead and create a character

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.170 
going to go ahead and create a character
real<00:05:36.220> quick<00:05:36.960> see<00:05:37.960> if<00:05:37.990> we<00:05:38.110> can<00:05:38.850> skip<00:05:39.850> through

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
real quick see if we can skip through

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:50.189 
real quick see if we can skip through
all<00:05:40.210> this<00:05:42.720> okay<00:05:43.720> name<00:05:44.350> myself<00:05:47.400> alright<00:05:49.199> just

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
all this okay name myself alright just

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.629 
all this okay name myself alright just
go<00:05:50.350> with<00:05:50.530> the<00:05:50.620> defaults<00:05:52.470> okay<00:05:53.470> I<00:05:54.190> think<00:05:54.460> I<00:05:54.610> have

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
go with the defaults okay I think I have

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.860 
go with the defaults okay I think I have
to<00:05:56.400> allocate<00:05:57.400> some<00:05:57.700> kind<00:05:57.970> of<00:05:58.979> points<00:05:59.979> here

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
to allocate some kind of points here

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.620 
to allocate some kind of points here
okay

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:28.810 

we'll<00:06:06.140> do<00:06:06.260> that<00:06:06.410> here<00:06:06.680> as<00:06:07.100> well

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.660 

all<00:06:29.360> right<00:06:29.540> and<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:29.900> video<00:06:30.710> starts<00:06:31.040> playing<00:06:31.100> I

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
all right and the video starts playing I

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:41.030 
all right and the video starts playing I
think<00:06:32.660> we're<00:06:33.140> going<00:06:33.260> to<00:06:33.320> skip<00:06:34.100> through<00:06:34.520> this

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.170 

I'm<00:06:42.040> going<00:06:42.220> to<00:06:42.280> go<00:06:42.370> ahead<00:06:42.430> and<00:06:42.610> skip<00:06:42.820> that<00:06:42.970> as

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
I'm going to go ahead and skip that as

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:49.910 
I'm going to go ahead and skip that as
well<00:06:43.440> get<00:06:44.440> you<00:06:44.590> straight<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:45.100> the<00:06:45.250> gameplay

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.600 

okay<00:06:50.920> we're<00:06:51.070> not<00:06:51.160> going<00:06:51.340> to<00:06:51.400> use<00:06:51.520> the<00:06:51.640> tutorial

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.640 

all<00:06:57.610> right<00:06:57.820> so<00:06:58.150> I<00:06:58.420> guess<00:06:58.690> you<00:06:58.810> start<00:06:59.110> out<00:06:59.350> in<00:06:59.380> a

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
all right so I guess you start out in a

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:09.519 
all right so I guess you start out in a
room<00:06:59.920> here<00:07:00.850> and<00:07:02.760> see<00:07:03.760> if<00:07:03.880> I<00:07:03.940> can

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:09.529 

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:13.190 

there<00:07:10.529> we<00:07:10.620> go

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.200 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.460 

I'm<00:07:13.740> not<00:07:13.860> sure<00:07:14.070> how<00:07:14.220> to<00:07:14.280> play<00:07:14.520> the<00:07:14.700> game<00:07:14.850> cell

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
I'm not sure how to play the game cell

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.140 
I'm not sure how to play the game cell
as<00:07:16.470> you<00:07:16.680> can<00:07:16.800> see<00:07:16.950> the<00:07:17.070> game<00:07:17.220> is<00:07:17.250> plain<00:07:17.610> it's

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
as you can see the game is plain it's

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.770 
as you can see the game is plain it's
relatively<00:07:18.870> smooth<00:07:19.230> playing<00:07:19.620> pretty<00:07:19.800> good

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780 
relatively smooth playing pretty good

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.680 
relatively smooth playing pretty good
with<00:07:21.780> no<00:07:22.430> optimizations<00:07:23.430> in<00:07:23.850> the<00:07:24.480> dosbox

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:24.690 
with no optimizations in the dosbox

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.810 
with no optimizations in the dosbox
config<00:07:25.440> I<00:07:25.650> think<00:07:26.040> with<00:07:26.250> a<00:07:26.280> little<00:07:26.700> bit<00:07:26.790> of

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:26.820 
config I think with a little bit of

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.250 
config I think with a little bit of
optimization<00:07:27.570> it<00:07:27.690> would<00:07:27.780> play<00:07:27.930> really<00:07:28.140> well

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.260 
optimization it would play really well

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.280 
optimization it would play really well
so<00:07:29.190> there<00:07:29.370> you<00:07:29.490> go<00:07:29.640> Daggerfall<00:07:30.240> on<00:07:30.690> DOSBox

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.290 
so there you go Daggerfall on DOSBox

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.410 
so there you go Daggerfall on DOSBox
turbo
