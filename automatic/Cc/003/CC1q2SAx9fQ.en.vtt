00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:08.019
 I think that's the thought 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.820
 moment are in the team at the 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.820
 preparation for the cup match 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.509
 Training contents the opponent again 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.819
 analyze in detail study 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:24.489
 also develop a concept like us 

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:25.989
 tomorrow can win the game and 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.269
 I must honestly say that to myself 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:32.560
 did not deal with it or 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:34.450
 employ that yesterday's training 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.930
 the last one on the street Säbener was 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.950
 that 's the last training session today 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.110
 my team is here in berlin and 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.140
 I think these thoughts come for sure 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.579
 then if when I have time on vacation 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.010
 to think about it when looking at pictures 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.100
 sees many paris follow already 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.440
 said of the champions league final 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:05.469
 or maybe tomorrow too 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:07.810
 play because we are active I do not think so 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.520
 that we record it that way 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.409
 Worry like that maybe that 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.049
 normal fan in the stadium does that 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.719
 neutral observers because they are 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.479
 just focus on focused 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:22.359
 that's the same on the field 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.130
 like on the bench and so I go 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.710
 Now with my last days here 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.049
 FC Bayern 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.780
 I do not worry so much about that 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.249
 I do not think that's been 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.450
 today my or yesterday one last 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:36.450
 training on the street säbener 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.420
 that will surely come when I enter 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.159
 win a little distance 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.399
 basically I want to say that 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.829
 now have the two players luiz gustavo 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.469
 then experienced in the last days and me 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.100
 I've rarely seen players like that 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:57.880
 he was disappointed that he was around 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.329
 because they were on the one side 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.950
 have the players for the whole year for the 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.479
 championship for the champions league 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.029
 and of course for the German 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.920
 Pokal worked and prepared 

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:10.440
 lived after that 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.200
 and so on and so on and suddenly 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.040
 you tell them two days before that 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.620
 endgame 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.130
 no, it's not you have your 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.050
 Homeland travel around at one say 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.250
 it is unimportant preparatory game 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.959
 to take part or the secondment 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.819
 14 days that is adhered to 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.060
 Personally, I have none at all 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.730
 understanding I have felipe too 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.019
 scolari said that was a very 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.250
 pleasant conversation 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.250
 I know the Brazilian here 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.900
 football association i know i know too 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.310
 the attitude that that is always strict 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.489
 it was respected no matter what club 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.470
 that was barcelona madrid or who 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.269
 have become present 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.980
 The Brazilian footballer has football 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.500
 Driving always takes care of and trades 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.250
 That's why I had very little there 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.340
 chances of success 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.239
 Now I have to say if you are a player 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:16.920
 then that is certainly a bitterness 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:19.620
 that's a big disappointment because that 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.980
 are two guys this year 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.870
 our success with coined so and 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.480
 I would like to say that too 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.850
 holger badstuber or toni kroos 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.109
 These are also two Germans 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.459
 national player 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.260
 the other two brazilian 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.980
 National player four national player 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.510
 not tomorrow 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.549
 but that is of course another case 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.500
 if you're hurt or how 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.579
 now in the case of the brazilians 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.620
 It sure is scary for the guys 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.670
 been difficult 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.049
 there too a decision to make 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.819
 but personally I am very strong 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.910
 made for traveling home 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.310
 because I know the brazilians and me 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.049
 I do not want my players in that 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.690
 next year at the world championship 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.030
 not in your own country in brazil 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.019
 because that was the danger when 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.019
 they are not going to be gone
