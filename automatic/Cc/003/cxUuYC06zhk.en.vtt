 after all, grill philippika berlin avatar 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.920
 You can always talk about it 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.810
 at least it is definitely report 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.850
 a great thing and above all 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.989

 we have something for every berliner 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.559
 as beautiful as it is there is also 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.850
 not only doner, but there are also 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.140
 especially when you do not know exactly 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.750
 yes exactly doors are then stop 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.340
 also often so small things that maybe 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.720
 not everyone knows most of them are ok 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.460
 you go at night yes you have nothing 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.229
 That's why we are so 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.809
 Just look what we have before 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.640
 get so dear as we are 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.750
 again a digit in here and have 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.670
 We are just a little 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.940
 appetizer and indeed there are 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.360
 now with us everything was nice school 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.159
 There are lenses on the island 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.310
 and now it was so up here 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.510
 wall street was very much on it and 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.770
 that's why we have the following 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.980
 it will just be like this 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.220
 bit separated 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.520
 Love as we are and what can you do 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.310
 in addition to say super vegetarian 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.280
 protein source bit more culture than 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.710
 beef in any case very nice 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.330
 Vegetable egg whites is very important 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.610
 if you are training a white powder 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.330
 varies as one-sided the animals 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.960
 mucus dissolves fruits nuts much protein 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:58.990
 also from vegetable 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.240
 we are just preparing our ours 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.909
 Tip is always these proteins too 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.420
 to vary a bit and to come because 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.700
 only if the combination fits and whether 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.680
 then the same so my dear under 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.270
 number two at the start and that is there 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.239
 grilled chicken 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.129
 have munich with tomatoes or paprika 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.099
 we have a little here and there below 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.950
 mixed salad and of course whole 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.860
 important under the butt again 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.840
 Because of that, green rice always 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.010
 importantly, you have the perfect mix 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.910
 a little bit cool, it's a micro 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.680
 nutrients 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.569
 There was a bit of animal price 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.459
 protein and it is no way italy 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.769
 you have to say clearly you should 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.459
 Do not eat meat every day 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.860
 always have a bit of us 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.629
 take it back and say honestly I know 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.010
 you feel is easy to berlin because 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:54.049
 not very slow when half 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.610
 uric acid posted what strikes me as 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.560
 to say new berlin as radio art 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.200
 I knew a new colleague damn 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.880
 Eating well is cheaper than having your blood in front of you 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:17.230
 all healthy and fitness meet the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:22.790
 forget we have ever 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:29.680
 calories 600 700 800 fail the plate 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.680
 which we have here now around the 802 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.530
 but we are the whole one is wondering 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.780
 So we simply we try so 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.090
 to be able to handle that so we the basis 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.359
 In one of the diet she knocked herself 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.359
 would have 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.770
 important in all this is the fact that the 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.960
 that man has such a fitness 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.130
 lifestyle popular that you stop then 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.320
 simply the joy of life not 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.940
 loses and if I now mine 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.940
 I imagine somehow with the digital 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.500
 change into the restaurant also a raise 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.330
 weigh 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.360
 I do not know who is not on the 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.830
 go stage I think we just want 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.040
 that should also give pleasant 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.650
 and I understand people who do it 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.700
 but these normal people next door 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.780
 now we do not need here 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.070
 make a joke and here everything 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.840
 air documented gequatsche my 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.489
 eyes 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.500
 yes I think I think it is ok yet 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.820
 time saved for some purpose and 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.090
 for going to the stage or something 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.340
 but if you are moderately normal every day 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.350
 sports or I stop 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.140
 also because of my job because of it 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.400
 have fun making white love then think 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.650
 I do not give that as everything 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.169
 that's what it has always been these days, too 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.380
 every one before the pictures after 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.580
 you have to be a bit quick 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.849
 we are on it 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.009
 eighth as I said much 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.669
 professional but you really have to 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.669
 a little grin 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.439
 that would be 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:14.290
 here was a bit grin already 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.640
 therefore turned away when you sign 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.720
 Go to the turks or something will take you 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.220
 not always the main topic 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.960
 but look elsewhere on the map 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.450
 is it really gets so goody 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:28.320
 advertising there is the philipp doctor i 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.320
