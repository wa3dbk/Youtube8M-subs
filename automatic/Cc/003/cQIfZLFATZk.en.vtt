now what we're gonna do is turn on our
three-phase<00:00:53.760> power<00:00:55.129> around<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> yeren

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.380

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
got a three phase converter

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.600 
got a three phase converter
and<00:01:03.769> first<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:04.979> we'll<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.369> we're<00:01:05.519> going

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and first what we'll do is we're going

and first what we'll do is we're going
to<00:01:05.700> turn<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.689> mix<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.369> we'll<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.640> is

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
to turn it on to mix so what we'll do is

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.460 
to turn it on to mix so what we'll do is
take<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> camera<00:01:09.390> closer<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.259> see

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
take the camera closer so you can see

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.340 
take the camera closer so you can see
inside<00:01:12.649> as<00:01:13.649> it<00:01:13.890> works

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.330 

we're<00:01:16.890> gonna<00:01:16.980> turn<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.550> on<00:01:18.350> mix<00:01:19.350> first

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
we're gonna turn it on on mix first

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.370 
we're gonna turn it on on mix first
now<00:01:22.340> then<00:01:22.580> we'll<00:01:22.670> go<00:01:22.790> in<00:01:22.910> here<00:01:23.200> we<00:01:24.200> have<00:01:24.290> to

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
now then we'll go in here we have to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and I'll smoothly the mixer paddles work

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
and I'll smoothly the mixer paddles work
and<00:01:37.380> now<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.219> we'll<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.429> is<00:01:38.549> we'll<00:01:38.670> turn<00:01:38.880> on
