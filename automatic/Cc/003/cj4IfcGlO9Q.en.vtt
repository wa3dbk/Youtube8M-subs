red bull cliff diving World Series well
it's<00:00:14.910> certainly<00:00:15.089> difficult<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:15.990> rookies

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
it's certainly difficult for the rookies

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.019 
it's certainly difficult for the rookies
in<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.800> competition<00:00:17.130> because<00:00:17.430> they<00:00:17.850> only

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
in this competition because they only

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.000 
in this competition because they only
have<00:00:18.330> about<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.630> year<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.590> hard<00:00:19.800> driving

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
have about a year of hard driving

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.710 
have about a year of hard driving
experience<00:00:20.580> before<00:00:20.730> they<00:00:21.240> come<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
experience before they come in the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.150 
experience before they come in the
series<00:00:22.970> as<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.180> rock<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.810> series<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.350> I

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
series as a rock in this series is I

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.700 
series as a rock in this series is I
think<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.910> really<00:00:26.970> good<00:00:27.449> because<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.380> learned

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
think it really good because I learned

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.440 
think it really good because I learned
about<00:00:29.039> myself<00:00:29.699> more<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:31.080> 10<00:00:31.619> years<00:00:31.890> in

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
about myself more that 10 years in

about myself more that 10 years in
diving<00:00:33.450> shows<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.730> think<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> problem<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.270> that

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
diving shows I think the problem is that

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.310 
diving shows I think the problem is that
I<00:00:36.510> think<00:00:36.870> too<00:00:36.989> much<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.410> need<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> calm<00:00:38.129> down<00:00:38.160> a

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
I think too much I need to calm down a

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.459 
I think too much I need to calm down a
brief<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.829> really<00:00:41.129> important<00:00:41.610> hey<00:00:42.540> give<00:00:43.379> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
brief is really important hey give a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.790 
brief is really important hey give a
second<00:00:43.829> chance<00:00:44.210> it<00:00:45.210> may<00:00:45.809> again<00:00:46.110> my<00:00:46.289> diet<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.770> my

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
second chance it may again my diet in my

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
second chance it may again my diet in my
mind<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.059> let<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:52.610> they<00:00:53.610> haven't

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
mind and just let it do it they haven't

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.270 
mind and just let it do it they haven't
mastered<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> entry<00:00:55.050> whereas<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> landowner

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
mastered the entry whereas a landowner

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.099 
mastered the entry whereas a landowner
we<00:00:56.489> spent<00:00:56.789> three<00:00:57.120> years<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.690> doing<00:00:57.870> high

diving<00:00:58.350> shows<00:00:58.649> every<00:00:59.129> single<00:00:59.489> day<00:00:59.609> we<00:01:00.149> knew

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
diving shows every single day we knew

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.790 
diving shows every single day we knew
how<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.840> get<00:01:01.020> through<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> water<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.649> no

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
how to get through the water with no

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
how to get through the water with no
splash<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.329> could<00:01:03.480> add<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
splash and then we could add the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.479 
splash and then we could add the
difficult<00:01:04.350> maneuvers<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.159> that's<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
difficult maneuvers and that's the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.109 
difficult maneuvers and that's the

somersaults<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:15.950> twists<00:02:16.370> you're<00:02:16.580> going<00:02:16.730> to

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
somersaults and twists you're going to

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.040

see<00:02:16.940> someone<00:02:17.210> who's<00:02:17.420> going<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.690> be<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.780> real

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
see someone who's going to be a real

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.490 
see someone who's going to be a real
powerhouse<00:02:18.320> I<00:02:20.110> think<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.200> most<00:02:21.320> difficult

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
powerhouse I think the most difficult

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.160 
powerhouse I think the most difficult
thing<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.070> year<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:22.490> far<00:02:22.730> has<00:02:23.690> just<00:02:23.720> been

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
thing this year so far has just been

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.250 
thing this year so far has just been
just<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.890> my<00:02:25.180> inconsistency<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:27.140> know

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
just that my inconsistency you know

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.540 
just that my inconsistency you know
obviously<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.680> wanted<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:27.980> do<00:02:28.100> better<00:02:28.310> all<00:02:28.520> the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
obviously I wanted to do better all the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.910 
obviously I wanted to do better all the
time<00:02:28.670> but<00:02:29.030> that's<00:02:29.660> not<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.290> reality<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.770> a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
time but that's not the reality of a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.410 
time but that's not the reality of a
rookie<00:02:31.070> season<00:02:31.520> you<00:02:31.610> know<00:02:31.640> you're<00:02:31.940> supposed

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
rookie season you know you're supposed

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.930 
rookie season you know you're supposed
to<00:02:32.750> come<00:02:32.900> in<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.110> struggle<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.620> learn<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
to come in and struggle and learn the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.920 
to come in and struggle and learn the
ins<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.240> outs<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.730> only<00:02:41.209> way<00:02:41.450> you're<00:02:41.780> gonna

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
ins and outs the only way you're gonna

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.050 
ins and outs the only way you're gonna
be<00:02:42.140> consistent<00:02:42.770> is<00:02:42.890> by<00:02:43.160> training<00:02:43.520> very<00:02:43.910> hard

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
be consistent is by training very hard

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.180 
be consistent is by training very hard
but<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:44.990> have<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.260> put<00:02:45.440> your<00:02:45.530> body<00:02:45.740> through<00:02:45.860> it

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
but you have to put your body through it
