00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.880
 The theme of this time is the roll-up technique of shirts and pants 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.200
 Roll-up is like shirts and pants 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.800
 It is that I'll turning 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.800
 Let's get rid of your usual dressing at this preparatory school 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:37.290
 Wearing a long-sleeved shirt usually looks like this 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:42.740
 Seasonal pattern It is recommended to roll it up when you want to have a slightly lighter impression 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.740
 Let's look at the coordinates that rolled it up 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.550
 Here is the size rolled up sleeves 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.079
 It has become more than light with a sense of season compared to the previous 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.300
 Well then 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.300
 Let's explain how to roll up 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.890
 First remove the button on the cuff 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.770
 Standard 3 for switching cuffs 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.240
 I am writing 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.240
 The width rest further 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.440
 To appeal to nature 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.409
 Doctor 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:34.100
 The point is to leave as it is 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.100
 This is completed 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.430
 Then let's introduce how to use a roller that can produce the following effect 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.010
 Here is another rollup pattern 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:55.280
 I think you have a better impression 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.280
 Let's see how to roll up another pattern 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.689
 Let's meet and think about it 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.520
 This time 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.520
 That 's twice the width of the switch point 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.160
 Let's do 1 draw 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.010
 This time 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.489
 It is the point that the end of last year comes out a little 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.489
 Last 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.040
 The came out ahead 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.040
 Let's get down a little 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.030
 This is complete 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.890
 Then I will introduce the roll-up of the pants next 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.580
 The style of a normal pants looks like this 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:47.140
 I would like to give a slightly lighter impression towards some 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.140
 Let's roll up 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.950
 Here is the style that rolled up the pants 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.590
 Your feet are lighter than before 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:02.360
 I think it became a style that suits the season 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.360
 Let's see how to ball up 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:13.200
 First, we do so once 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.200
 At this time , it is a standard that its width is 2 cm is 3 cm. 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.819
 next 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.819
 I will roll up along that 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:30.540
 It is a standard that the height to roll up comes to the height of the ankle 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.540
 This is completed 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.910
 The 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.140
 How was the third floor fashionable preparatory school?
