00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
next part is just to go ahead and just

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.490 
next part is just to go ahead and just
slide<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> phone<00:01:42.200> into<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.229> outer<00:01:43.500> case<00:01:43.799> here

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
slide the phone into the outer case here

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.350 
slide the phone into the outer case here
much<00:01:46.500> similar<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> our<00:01:47.100> outer<00:01:47.250> box<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
much similar to our outer box on the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389 
much similar to our outer box on the
simply<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.049> way<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> works<00:01:49.500> how<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.799> locks<00:01:50.130> on

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
simply the way it works how it locks on

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.929 
simply the way it works how it locks on
the<00:01:50.850> outer<00:01:51.030> edge<00:01:51.149> here<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.549> if<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.610> don't<00:01:53.759> get

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the outer edge here and if you don't get

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.959 
the outer edge here and if you don't get
it<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.180> right<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.540> will<00:01:54.720> kind<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.229> stick<00:01:55.439> out

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
it just right it will kind of stick out

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.639 
it just right it will kind of stick out
all<00:01:56.969> right<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.570> since<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.350> gold

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
all right so since this is the gold

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.770 
all right so since this is the gold
phone<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:59.280> we'll<00:01:59.790> go<00:01:59.969> ahead<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.210> put<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
phone here we'll go ahead and put on the

phone here we'll go ahead and put on the
go<00:02:01.619> back<00:02:01.920> plate<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.790> actually<00:02:03.329> replicate<00:02:04.259> what

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
go back plate to actually replicate what

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.230 
go back plate to actually replicate what
the<00:02:04.740> actual<00:02:05.100> phone<00:02:05.310> looks<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.820> inside<00:02:06.090> the
