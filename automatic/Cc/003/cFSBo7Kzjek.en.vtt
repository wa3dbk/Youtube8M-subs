00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.830
 I consider this a problem 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.740
 fundamental in the biochemistry of a course 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.709
 general because it is the basis for the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.059
 understanding of following processes as 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:15.269
 may be the importance of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.950
 maintenance of ph homeostasis and 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.650
 also for separation processes 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.920
 of proteins or peptides from a mixture 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.050
 for example with exchange systems 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.610
 ionic 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:33.300
 how can you see 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.300
 we are asked to calculate the load 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.050
 and as you can see from a series of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.620
 amino acids glycine aspartic 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.570
 lysine or discipline for ones 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.570
 certain ph values 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.219
 I think that to have clear ideas 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.500
 it is necessary that you look at the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.500
 next picture that I'm going to put 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.040
 here you have them 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.600
 these are the ideas to which I referred 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.960
 first of all you have to know what they are 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.200
 freckles freckles you know that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.259
 calculate as the logarithm of forgiveness 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.750
 minus the logarithm of the constant that 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.209
 regulates a balance but what is important 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.170
 for this problem is that you have in 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:33.750
 tell what is here that says that 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.420
 for a mean ph value equal to a 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.929
 pk the proportion of ionic forms 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.340
 which they are in equilibrium as is 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:49.700
 here for the 50-50 agreement and care 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.700
 pay close attention to this conclusion 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.570
 to this one here 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:01.280
 at ph lower than sin is going to predominate 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:07.520
 the most proto way nothing 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.590
 and ap major is the proto nothing we're going to 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.459
 see right away what it means but 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.730
 before I want to remind you that is the point 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.810
 electrical iso the iso electrical point of 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.470
 an amino acid is a value that is calculated 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.230
 as average freckles and that for a ph 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.000
 of the medium equal to that point iso 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.400
 electric it turns out that 100% of the 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.430
 amino acid is in its ion form 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.959
 dipolar that as you know has the name or 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.959
 receives the name of 'twitter' yum 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.180
 but now what I would like is 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.819
 develop the explanation a bit more 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.659
 of this consequence let's move on to the 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.659
 next blackboard 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.370
 look here you have a balance between two 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.099
 amino acid forms the way in this 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.400
 more proto case nothing that has more charge 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.800
 one and here would be the dipolar ion form 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.620
 that has zero charge let's assume that 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.090
 the pk 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.420
 for this balance is three very well 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.599
 this means that for a ph equal to 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.599
 three 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.280
 50 percent of the amino acid will have 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.640
 this ionized form and the other 50% will have 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.140
 this other however to a ph by 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.270
 example of 2 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.850
 which is going to predominate is going to be this 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.030
 way to ph matched therefore 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:45.010
 we will say that the shape with charge predominates 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:49.330
 plus 1 on the contrary to ph equal to 4 is 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.300
 say a ph that is greater than the pk what 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.910
 that will predominate is the way in this 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.850
 case of criterion and therefore its 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.700
 predominant load will be 0 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.630
 This is precisely what us 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.480
 they ask us in the exercise 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.790
 what has to be the methodology in 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.710
 first place writes the chain of 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.710
 equilibria for each amino acid 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.980
 then mark the charges of each 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.489
 amino acid form and freckles in the 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.489
 balances 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:31.560
 and finally determines the load for 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.560
 every ph about which they ask you 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.139
 and you already should have it 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.800
 this is what I have done for 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.800
 solve 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.669
 well here you have all the steps 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.490
 captured in an image give the pause 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.160
 so that you understand what I have done 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.060
 review it calmly I'll explain 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.060
 a couple of them 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.820
 I start with glycine 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.150
 I have put the three unique ways that 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.150
 have 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.750
 the proto nothing the form of criterion and the 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.240
 way of it is proto nothing observes as 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:19.620
 put also the freckles in each 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:22.260
 equilibrium and then I have pointed out the ph 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:27.270
 about those who ask me 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:30.900
 with ph is 1 and 2 being less than the pk 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:35.610
 the load is going to be more 1 that would be the 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:39.390
 answer a ph 4 is a ph greater than 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.880
 this pk but smaller than this one so this 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.600
 will be the predominant way is to say the 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.600
 form of load criteria 0 for a ph 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:53.660
 of 10 the amino acid load is going to be 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:59.920
 minus 1 since 10 is a higher value 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.920
 pk 2 in this case to the pk of the friend group 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.820
 Aspartic acid is an amino acid with 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:13.870
 a group ere acid here we have the p 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:18.310
 fall and we repeat the same thing for 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:21.790
 p h 1 and 2 that are less than pk ao pk 1 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:26.280
 the acid group pk the load will be more 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.280
 1 for a ph of 4 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.540
 the predominant form will be the one that is 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:39.710
 the right of this pk value is to say 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:43.580
 minus 1 and already at a ph 10 the load will be 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:46.540
 minus 2 the same thing we can do with the 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.730
 lysine analysis 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:53.350
 in this case it is an amino acid with a 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:58.480
 basic group r here we have the pk of his 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:59.350
 network group at a ph 1 and 2 lower than 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.970
 pk 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:07.610
 or pk 1 the load will be plus 2 then because of 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:13.050
 this group to me no longer this other 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:16.649
 4 will be minus 1 and 10 the load 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:20.189
 predominant will be 0 since 10 is 

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:24.300
 slightly lower than 10.53 and that's how it is 

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:28.289
 How can you determine the load of a 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.779
 amino acid according to the ph this you can 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:33.689
 apply with a little more calculation 

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:35.479
 nothing more to the charge of a peptide something 

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:37.439
 which for example can allow you 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:40.589
 answer questions they ask 

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:43.349
 reference to protein separation by 

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:46.339
 exchange either ionic or cationic and 

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:46.339
 by electrophoresis
