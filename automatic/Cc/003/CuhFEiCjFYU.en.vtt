00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.810 

in<00:00:01.500> this<00:00:01.770> video<00:00:02.010> we're<00:00:02.340> just<00:00:02.370> going<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.610> take<00:00:02.760> a

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
in this video we're just going to take a

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.640 
in this video we're just going to take a
look<00:00:02.970> at<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.240> rendering<00:00:03.629> quality<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.470> the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
look at the rendering quality of the

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.960 
look at the rendering quality of the
light<00:00:04.920> setups<00:00:05.310> that<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:05.430> did<00:00:05.609> in<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.819> previous

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
light setups that I did in the previous

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.179 
light setups that I did in the previous
three<00:00:06.240> tutorials<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.560> have<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.980> green

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
three tutorials the I have the green

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.410 
three tutorials the I have the green
light<00:00:08.220> back<00:00:08.670> here<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.290> the<00:00:10.290> yellow<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
light back here and the yellow and the

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.759 
light back here and the yellow and the
violet<00:00:12.420> light<00:00:12.630> up<00:00:12.780> there<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.200> then<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.559> also

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
violet light up there and then I also

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.670 
violet light up there and then I also
have<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.400> regular<00:00:15.240> light<00:00:15.750> back<00:00:16.289> into<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
have the regular light back into the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.140 
have the regular light back into the
scene<00:00:16.890> over<00:00:17.070> here<00:00:17.340> except<00:00:17.609> I've<00:00:17.760> turned<00:00:17.970> its

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
scene over here except I've turned its

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.179 
scene over here except I've turned its
intensity<00:00:18.630> down<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.619> doesn't<00:00:19.650> override

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
intensity down so it doesn't override

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.980 
intensity down so it doesn't override
the<00:00:20.369> scene<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.210> wanted<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.539> give<00:00:21.630> some

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the scene but I wanted to give some

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.310 
the scene but I wanted to give some
illumination<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> scene<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.580> fact<00:00:24.320> that

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
illumination to the scene in fact that

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.290 
illumination to the scene in fact that
way<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.710> see<00:00:25.920> these<00:00:26.130> objects<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.090> see

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
way we can see these objects we can see

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.750 
way we can see these objects we can see
the<00:00:27.449> results<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.800> maybe<00:00:29.160> we'll<00:00:29.609> turn

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the results of this maybe we'll turn

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.870 
the results of this maybe we'll turn
this<00:00:30.000> way<00:00:30.179> down<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.380> little<00:00:31.590> bit<00:00:31.740> more<00:00:32.070> not

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
this way down just a little bit more not

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.670 
this way down just a little bit more not
much<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> give<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.079> an<00:00:34.170> idea<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:37.559> we

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
much but just to give you an idea so we

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.139 
much but just to give you an idea so we
can<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> other<00:00:38.190> lights<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.670> well<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
can see the other lights as well the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.580 
can see the other lights as well the
effect<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.570> these<00:00:39.719> other<00:00:39.930> lights<00:00:40.200> all<00:00:40.440> right

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
effect of these other lights all right

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.100 
effect of these other lights all right
so<00:00:41.190> I'll<00:00:41.280> zoom<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.790> bat<00:00:41.969> here<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.480> then

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
so I'll zoom in to bat here and then

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.110 
so I'll zoom in to bat here and then
notice<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.070> go<00:00:44.190> back<00:00:44.250> into<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.760> tab<00:00:45.090> here

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
notice if you go back into this tab here

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600 
notice if you go back into this tab here
see<00:00:45.960> I've<00:00:46.230> even<00:00:46.530> got<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.800> render<00:00:47.190> preview

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
see I've even got this render preview

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.360 
see I've even got this render preview
cranked<00:00:47.969> up<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.239> 50<00:00:48.660> right<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> then<00:00:50.250> you

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
cranked up to 50 right and then you

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.860 
cranked up to 50 right and then you
start<00:00:50.640> getting<00:00:50.760> these<00:00:51.000> kind<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.360> effects<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
start getting these kind of effects and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.569 
start getting these kind of effects and
then<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.050> get<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> dots<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:52.920> over<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.399> well

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
then you get the dots all over here well

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.459 
then you get the dots all over here well
these<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:53.910> actually<00:00:54.329> very<00:00:54.660> very<00:00:55.140> cool

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
these are actually very very cool

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.900 
these are actually very very cool
because<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.039> does<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.309> tells<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.670> where

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
because what it does it tells you where

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
because what it does it tells you where
the<00:00:56.940> light<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.239> actually<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.100> scene

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the light is actually going in the scene

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.580 
the light is actually going in the scene
and<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.359> might<00:01:00.809> look<00:01:00.930> at<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.260> that's<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and you might look at a go that's a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.709 
and you might look at a go that's a
terrible<00:01:02.010> renderer<00:01:02.309> no<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:03.210> was<00:01:03.449> pretty

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
terrible renderer no this was pretty

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.440 
terrible renderer no this was pretty
quick<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.229> only<00:01:04.409> four<00:01:04.890> point<00:01:05.580> seven<00:01:06.000> six

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
quick that was only four point seven six

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.310 
quick that was only four point seven six
seconds<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.619> render<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.420> i'm<00:01:09.869> also<00:01:10.170> i

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
seconds to render that but if i'm also i

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.090 
seconds to render that but if i'm also i
also<00:01:10.740> have<00:01:11.040> GPU<00:01:12.030> computing<00:01:12.810> enabled<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.500> here

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
also have GPU computing enabled in here

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.640 
also have GPU computing enabled in here
so<00:01:14.400> otherwise<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.299> might<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.630> closer<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.020> 30

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
so otherwise that might be closer to 30

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.010 
so otherwise that might be closer to 30
seconds<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.210> quality<00:01:18.720> I've

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
seconds just to get this quality I've

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.620 
seconds just to get this quality I've
running<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.009> okay<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.520> maybe<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.600> your

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
running so you go okay so maybe on your

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.719 
running so you go okay so maybe on your
computer<00:01:22.080> maybe<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.350> don't<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> fast<00:01:23.250> GPU

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
computer maybe you don't have a fast GPU

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.830 
computer maybe you don't have a fast GPU
card<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.200> crank<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.830> 100<00:01:26.310> in

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
card or and you crank it up to 100 in

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.870 
card or and you crank it up to 100 in
here<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.049> even<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.130> hundred<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:29.729> let's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
here and even in a hundred in here let's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.249 
here and even in a hundred in here let's
see<00:01:30.000> how<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.150> takes<00:01:30.450> well<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:30.869> not<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.079> much

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
see how it takes well it's not that much

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.850 
see how it takes well it's not that much
longer<00:01:32.119> but<00:01:33.119> almost<00:01:33.810> ten<00:01:34.200> seconds<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:34.829> that

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
longer but almost ten seconds so that

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.039 
longer but almost ten seconds so that
means<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.700> almost<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.299> minute<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.869> only

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
means you know almost a minute to only

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.999 
means you know almost a minute to only
generate<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.650> quality<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.460> you're<00:01:38.960> enabling

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
generate this quality so you're enabling

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.590 
generate this quality so you're enabling
GPU<00:01:41.009> rendering<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.640> here<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.210> really

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
GPU rendering on here is really

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.330 
GPU rendering on here is really
important<00:01:43.110> or<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> modern-day

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
important or if you have a modern-day

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.060 
important or if you have a modern-day
CPU<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.479> really<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.780> very<00:01:46.110> effective<00:01:46.799> as

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
CPU that can really be very effective as

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.330 
CPU that can really be very effective as
well<00:01:47.360> but<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:49.049> important<00:01:50.009> thing<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.220> know

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
well but the important thing to know

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.850 
well but the important thing to know
about<00:01:50.570> this<00:01:51.570> type<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.899> rendering<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.619> that

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
about this type of rendering is that

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.490 
about this type of rendering is that
sometimes<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.240> crank<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.140> up<00:01:55.350> maybe

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
sometimes I just crank this up maybe

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.530 
sometimes I just crank this up maybe
I'll<00:01:55.680> put<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.890> up<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.280> 3000<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.329> if<00:01:57.390> I'm

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
I'll put it up to like 3000 and if I'm

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.850 
I'll put it up to like 3000 and if I'm
not<00:01:57.659> doing<00:01:57.960> anything<00:01:58.110> I'm<00:01:58.290> doing<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.619> in

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
not doing anything I'm doing this in

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.590 
not doing anything I'm doing this in
preview<00:01:59.460> mode<00:01:59.490> because<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.149> how<00:02:00.420> I'm

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
preview mode because this is how I'm

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.440 
preview mode because this is how I'm
working<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.710> maybe<00:02:01.890> I'm<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.450> doing

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
working and maybe I'm just doing

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.090 
working and maybe I'm just doing
something<00:02:03.719> else<00:02:04.020> for<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.259> little<00:02:04.380> bit<00:02:04.500> I'm<00:02:04.860> just

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
something else for a little bit I'm just

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.310 
something else for a little bit I'm just
going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.310> let<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.520> run<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.060> you'll<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:06.990> see

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
going to let it run and you'll just see

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.680 
going to let it run and you'll just see
the<00:02:07.950> call<00:02:08.220> how<00:02:08.399> much<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.879> difference<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the call how much of a difference the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.050 
the call how much of a difference the
extra<00:02:09.989> samples<00:02:10.379> are<00:02:10.590> as<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.400> doing<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.849> it'll

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
extra samples are as it's doing it it'll

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.940 
extra samples are as it's doing it it'll
start<00:02:12.330> taking<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.840> from<00:02:12.989> this<00:02:13.230> granny<00:02:13.680> look

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
start taking it from this granny look

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.340 
start taking it from this granny look
even

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
even

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.790 
even
see<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.770> little<00:02:14.800> dots<00:02:15.460> on<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.000> light<00:02:16.800> just

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
see the little dots on the light just

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.890 
see the little dots on the light just
why<00:02:18.130> what<00:02:18.700> do<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:18.910> had<00:02:19.090> recording<00:02:19.600> this<00:02:19.690> video

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
why what do I had recording this video

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.350 
why what do I had recording this video
but<00:02:20.320> let's<00:02:20.560> just<00:02:21.490> watch<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.730> for<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.120> bit<00:02:22.270> and

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
but let's just watch it for a bit and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.910 
but let's just watch it for a bit and
just<00:02:22.480> see<00:02:22.690> what<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.050> difference<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.650> extra

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
just see what a difference the extra

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:36.000 
just see what a difference the extra
samples<00:02:24.310> make

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:45.890 

it<00:02:36.670> already<00:02:36.939> starting<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.480> look<00:02:37.599> smooth<00:02:37.959> doubt

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.170 

well<00:02:46.560> let<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.159> run<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.400> whole<00:02:47.549> way<00:02:47.579> but<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.939> mean

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
well let it run the whole way but I mean

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.220 
well let it run the whole way but I mean
it's<00:02:48.299> kind<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.540> gives<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.780> an<00:02:48.840> idea<00:02:48.989> the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
it's kind of gives you an idea the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.780 
it's kind of gives you an idea the
importance<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.890> letting<00:02:50.220> these<00:02:50.340> samples

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
importance of letting these samples

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.890 
importance of letting these samples
right<00:02:50.909> of<00:02:51.030> course<00:02:51.180> that's<00:02:51.390> already<00:02:51.599> one

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
right of course that's already one

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:13.920 
right of course that's already one
minute<00:02:52.230> right<00:02:52.409> there

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.619 

yeah<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.079> can<00:03:15.319> still<00:03:16.189> barely<00:03:16.519> see<00:03:16.969> the<00:03:17.120> dots<00:03:17.329> on

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
yeah I can still barely see the dots on

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.240 
yeah I can still barely see the dots on
here<00:03:17.870> but<00:03:18.079> now<00:03:18.230> it's<00:03:18.500> really<00:03:18.709> starting<00:03:18.859> to

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
here but now it's really starting to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.459 
here but now it's really starting to
come<00:03:19.370> life<00:03:19.909> but<00:03:20.150> it's<00:03:20.420> still<00:03:20.629> quite<00:03:21.140> grainy

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:21.469 
come life but it's still quite grainy

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.759 
come life but it's still quite grainy
and<00:03:21.709> I'm<00:03:21.829> up<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.159> 900<00:03:22.930> samples<00:03:23.930> minute<00:03:24.349> and<00:03:24.469> 32

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
and I'm up to 900 samples minute and 32

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:37.539 
and I'm up to 900 samples minute and 32
seconds<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.560> reason<00:03:36.859> this<00:03:36.980> was<00:03:37.159> running

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
seconds and the reason this was running

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.129 
seconds and the reason this was running
granny<00:03:37.760> in<00:03:37.909> the<00:03:38.000> first<00:03:38.239> place<00:03:38.389> was<00:03:38.629> because<00:03:38.689> I

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
granny in the first place was because I

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.780 
granny in the first place was because I
have<00:03:39.379> the<00:03:39.409> light<00:03:39.889> intensity<00:03:40.430> of<00:03:40.639> these

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
have the light intensity of these

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.520 
have the light intensity of these
individual<00:03:41.239> spots<00:03:41.569> cranked<00:03:42.079> way<00:03:42.109> up<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.409> think

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
individual spots cranked way up I think

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.039 
individual spots cranked way up I think
I<00:03:42.680> set<00:03:43.129> them<00:03:43.189> at<00:03:43.340> about<00:03:43.549> 60<00:03:44.150> for<00:03:44.659> each<00:03:44.780> one

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
I set them at about 60 for each one

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.319 
I set them at about 60 for each one
where<00:03:45.290> is<00:03:45.439> this<00:03:45.560> overall<00:03:46.129> huge<00:03:46.760> light<00:03:47.090> in<00:03:47.239> the

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
where is this overall huge light in the

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.250 
where is this overall huge light in the
scene<00:03:47.540> is<00:03:47.720> set<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:49.060> 11.1<00:03:50.060> will<00:03:50.359> too<00:03:50.569> so<00:03:50.959> I<00:03:51.019> mean

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
scene is set it 11.1 will too so I mean

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.729 
scene is set it 11.1 will too so I mean
just<00:03:51.439> it's<00:03:51.590> quite<00:03:51.889> low<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:54.260> if<00:03:54.379> you<00:03:54.470> need<00:03:54.620> to

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
just it's quite low so if you need to

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.379 
just it's quite low so if you need to
crank<00:03:55.040> up<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.340> intensity<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.909> things<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:56.239> get

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
crank up the intensity of things you get

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.420 
crank up the intensity of things you get
that<00:03:56.510> grainy<00:03:56.780> stuff<00:03:57.139> you<00:03:57.620> can<00:03:57.829> resolve<00:03:58.129> just

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
that grainy stuff you can resolve just

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.970 
that grainy stuff you can resolve just
by<00:03:58.609> letting<00:03:59.599> it<00:03:59.870> run<00:04:00.049> but<00:04:00.290> number<00:04:00.530> two<00:04:00.590> minutes

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
by letting it run but number two minutes

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.190 
by letting it run but number two minutes
you<00:04:01.430> know<00:04:01.579> that's<00:04:04.030> per<00:04:05.030> frame<00:04:05.419> so<00:04:05.810> that's<00:04:05.989> not

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
you know that's per frame so that's not

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.750 
you know that's per frame so that's not
good<00:04:06.349> time<00:04:06.530> intensive<00:04:06.919> if<00:04:07.189> you<00:04:07.310> start<00:04:07.549> trying

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
good time intensive if you start trying

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.860 
good time intensive if you start trying
to<00:04:07.909> do<00:04:08.030> an<00:04:08.120> animation<00:04:09.069> and<00:04:10.069> we're<00:04:10.310> about<00:04:10.870> you

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
to do an animation and we're about you

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.110 
to do an animation and we're about you
know<00:04:11.989> approaching<00:04:12.739> 1500<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:13.639> that's<00:04:13.790> not<00:04:14.000> to

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
know approaching 1500 and that's not to

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.150 
know approaching 1500 and that's not to
look<00:04:14.209> pretty<00:04:14.450> good<00:04:14.720> but<00:04:15.379> you<00:04:15.590> could<00:04:15.739> easily<00:04:15.769> go

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
look pretty good but you could easily go
