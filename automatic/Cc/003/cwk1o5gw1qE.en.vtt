00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:10.560 
you think that there would only be one
spot<00:00:07.359> of<00:00:07.569> blood<00:00:07.899> for<00:00:08.410> several<00:00:09.309> semesters<00:00:09.849> we

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
spot of blood for several semesters we

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.530 
spot of blood for several semesters we
would<00:00:10.960> take<00:00:11.950> a<00:00:12.009> mock<00:00:12.309> crime<00:00:12.519> scene<00:00:12.879> and<00:00:13.150> we

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
would take a mock crime scene and we

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.720 
would take a mock crime scene and we
would<00:00:13.660> get<00:00:13.750> a<00:00:13.809> mannequin<00:00:14.410> and<00:00:14.860> have<00:00:15.639> the

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
would get a mannequin and have the

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.070 
would get a mannequin and have the
students<00:00:16.150> and<00:00:16.240> you<00:00:16.299> know<00:00:16.359> take<00:00:16.600> the<00:00:16.630> pictures

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
students and you know take the pictures

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.900 
students and you know take the pictures
and<00:00:17.260> so<00:00:17.410> forth<00:00:17.439> and<00:00:17.800> it<00:00:18.220> became<00:00:18.460> clear<00:00:18.760> we

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
and so forth and it became clear we

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.400 
and so forth and it became clear we
thought<00:00:19.119> we<00:00:19.269> must<00:00:19.570> be<00:00:19.689> able<00:00:19.900> to<00:00:19.990> do<00:00:20.140> something

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
thought we must be able to do something

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:29.260 
thought we must be able to do something
better<00:00:20.800> how<00:00:21.430> about<00:00:21.460> that<00:00:21.820> one<00:00:23.340> new<00:00:24.420> clean<00:00:25.420> Oh

victims

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.600 
victims
well<00:01:03.170> my<00:01:03.320> first<00:01:03.589> experience<00:01:04.159> was<00:01:04.250> with<00:01:04.580> a

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
well my first experience was with a

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.480 
well my first experience was with a
crime<00:01:05.030> scene<00:01:05.330> was<00:01:05.659> when<00:01:06.170> I<00:01:06.500> was<00:01:06.830> asked<00:01:07.280> by<00:01:07.340> the

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
crime scene was when I was asked by the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.250 
crime scene was when I was asked by the
behavioral<00:01:08.030> science<00:01:08.479> unit<00:01:08.540> down<00:01:08.960> at<00:01:09.110> Quantico

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
behavioral science unit down at Quantico

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.090 
behavioral science unit down at Quantico
the<00:01:09.890> FBI<00:01:10.159> division<00:01:10.820> their<00:01:11.030> training<00:01:11.390> division

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
the FBI division their training division

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.490 
the FBI division their training division
to<00:01:13.100> come<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:14.060> talk<00:01:14.330> with<00:01:14.390> them<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.020> so<00:01:15.320> they

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
to come and talk with them and so they

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.770 
to come and talk with them and so they
brought<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:16.040> cases<00:01:16.820> down<00:01:17.000> to<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.330> Quantico

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
brought the cases down to the Quantico

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.320 
brought the cases down to the Quantico
and<00:01:18.049> they<00:01:18.680> would<00:01:19.010> show<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.490> crime<00:01:19.729> scenes<00:01:20.090> and

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
and they would show the crime scenes and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.570 
and they would show the crime scenes and
then<00:01:20.570> try<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.840> recreate<00:01:21.409> from<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.340> crime

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
then try to recreate from the crime

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.039 
then try to recreate from the crime
scene<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.119> of<00:01:23.240> course<00:01:23.450> all<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:23.720> had<00:01:23.869> was<00:01:24.020> the

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
scene and of course all you had was the

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:24.640 
scene and of course all you had was the
victim

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
victim

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.679 
victim
so<00:01:25.070> victimology<00:01:25.580> became<00:01:26.210> very<00:01:26.450> very

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
so victimology became very very

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.990 
so victimology became very very
important<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.380> very<00:01:27.860> few<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.310> them<00:01:28.460> of<00:01:28.700> the

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
important and very few of them of the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.420 
important and very few of them of the
agents<00:01:29.479> were<00:01:29.960> trained<00:01:30.380> in<00:01:30.560> victimology<00:01:31.070> at

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
agents were trained in victimology at

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.310 
agents were trained in victimology at
that<00:01:31.610> time<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:32.150> high-profile<00:01:32.780> case<00:01:33.049> I've

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
that time a high-profile case I've

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.039 
that time a high-profile case I've
worked<00:01:33.500> on<00:01:33.649> several<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.659> probably<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.899> one

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
worked on several and probably the one

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.279 
worked on several and probably the one
that<00:01:36.259> many<00:01:36.799> people<00:01:37.640> would<00:01:37.850> know<00:01:38.090> did<00:01:38.960> happen

concrete thinker he thought I must have

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.240 
concrete thinker he thought I must have
done<00:03:29.360> it<00:03:29.420> because<00:03:30.230> we<00:03:30.350> had<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.620> crime<00:03:30.890> scene

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
done it because we had the crime scene

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.750 
done it because we had the crime scene
and<00:03:31.550> it<00:03:31.790> was<00:03:31.820> an<00:03:32.060> important<00:03:32.570> case<00:03:32.780> is<00:03:33.200> how<00:03:33.590> we

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
and it was an important case is how we

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.340 
and it was an important case is how we
built<00:03:34.760> this<00:03:35.500> virtual<00:03:36.500> crime<00:03:36.830> case<00:03:37.130> and

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
built this virtual crime case and

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.310 
built this virtual crime case and
decided<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.650> try<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:39.950> out<00:03:40.310> with<00:03:40.550> students<00:03:44.320> well

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
decided to try it out with students well

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.199 
decided to try it out with students well
that's<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.680> very<00:03:45.890> good<00:03:46.070> question<00:03:46.250> why<00:03:46.730> would<00:03:47.030> he

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
that's a very good question why would he

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.340 
that's a very good question why would he
call<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.930> say<00:03:48.650> he<00:03:48.950> did<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:50.080> wonderful

changed<00:04:15.440> since<00:04:16.430> I've<00:04:16.760> been<00:04:17.120> able<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:17.690> add<00:04:17.840> the

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
changed since I've been able to add the

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.039 
changed since I've been able to add the
tool<00:04:18.500> in<00:04:18.919> that<00:04:18.979> I<00:04:19.910> feel<00:04:20.299> that<00:04:20.510> I'm<00:04:20.660> giving

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
tool in that I feel that I'm giving

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.320 
tool in that I feel that I'm giving
students<00:04:21.620> something<00:04:22.040> really<00:04:22.490> concrete<00:04:22.729> to

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
students something really concrete to

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.270 
students something really concrete to
work<00:04:23.600> on<00:04:23.870> very<00:04:24.410> different<00:04:24.800> from<00:04:24.890> a<00:04:25.070> more

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
work on very different from a more

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.310 
work on very different from a more
passive<00:04:25.580> kind<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.390> assignment<00:04:27.050> where<00:04:27.200> you

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
passive kind of assignment where you

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.200 
passive kind of assignment where you
have<00:04:27.530> to<00:04:27.710> read<00:04:27.950> something<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.669> then<00:04:28.760> answer

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
have to read something and then answer

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.020 
have to read something and then answer
some<00:04:29.240> questions<00:04:29.870> I've<00:04:30.380> been<00:04:30.440> amazed<00:04:31.190> at<00:04:31.700> how

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
some questions I've been amazed at how

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.060 
some questions I've been amazed at how
much<00:04:32.210> I've<00:04:32.479> learned<00:04:32.780> about<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.260> student<00:04:33.860> and

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
much I've learned about the student and

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.340 
much I've learned about the student and
what<00:04:34.400> they've<00:04:34.640> observed<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.300> how<00:04:35.419> varied

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
what they've observed and how varied

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.520 
what they've observed and how varied
their<00:04:37.220> opinions<00:04:38.060> are<00:04:38.330> so<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.900> keeps<00:04:39.140> me

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
their opinions are so it keeps me

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.680 
their opinions are so it keeps me
learning<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:40.640> hopefully<00:04:41.030> helps<00:04:41.570> the

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
learning and it hopefully helps the

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.810 
learning and it hopefully helps the
students<00:04:42.169> to<00:04:42.229> keep<00:04:42.530> learning<00:04:43.280> so<00:04:43.490> that's

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
students to keep learning so that's

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.150 
students to keep learning so that's
really<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.479> way<00:04:44.630> I've<00:04:44.780> developed<00:04:45.410> much<00:04:46.130> of
