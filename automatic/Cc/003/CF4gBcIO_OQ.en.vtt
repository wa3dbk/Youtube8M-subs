00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
*Cue Red vs Blue Intro*

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.260
Sarge: Yow. What In the?

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.020
Sarge: Stupid Grif and Simmons. Can't even build a regulation Grave.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.260
Sarge: What have we run all those drills for?

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.920
Sarge: So, this is the Afterlife, huh?

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.060
Sarge: Heh, not too impressive if you ask me.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.540
Sarge: This place is a wreck.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.060
Sarge: Who's in charge here anyway?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.240
Sarge: Need to get me a couple of Marine Angels.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.320
Sarge: Get this place spic and span in no time.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.060
Sarge: You know, now that I think about it, I don't seem to remember much about underground caves in the Bible.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.560
Sarge: Not even that new Bible they rewrote in 2040, with that big chase scene and that weird cameo by Ben Stiller.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.880
Sarge: That guy was a nut.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.100
Sarge: Wait a minute! Afterlife? Underground Cave?!

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.680
Sarge: What if this isn't heaven?!

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.400
Sarge: What if it's--?! No, It couldn't be. Could it?!

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.500
Donut: Hey, Sarge. What are you doing down here?

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.900
Sarge: It is! Oh, it is.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.020
Church: Oh, man. This is not gonna work out well for us.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.880
Tucker: Dude, are you kidding? We finally have two girls on our team.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.200
Tucker: You know what that means.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.040
Caboose: Yeah, Co-ed Softball team!

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.880
Caboose: I'm gonna go get my baseball racket.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.540
Church: Tucker, I know what you're thinking, and it's not gonna happen.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.460
Tucker: Oh, why not?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.720
Church: Because girls can't share anything. Not even an apartment.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.880
Church: Every time girls live together, within six months, they both hate each other and somebody gets stuck with a $1200 phone bill.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.040
Church: That's fact.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.400
Tucker: Ah, let them fight. So long as we get to watch the making up, who cares?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.620
Tucker: We can even record it and sell copies to the Reds.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.520
Sarge: NOOOOOOOO!

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.980
Sarge: Moan!

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.720
Donut: It's been crazy down here, Sarge.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.780
Sarge: Nooo!
Donut: You would not believe all the stuff I found.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.540
Sarge: Sorrowful Sounds!

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.120
Sarge: Pleas for forgiveness!

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.180
Donut: Sarge, keep it down.
Sarge: I have sinned!

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.420
Donut: We don't want them to hear you.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.780
Sarge: Donut, don't interrupt my repentful moaning.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.140
Sarge: If I want God to forgive me, I want to be as miserable as possible.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.300
Sarge: He loves that stuff.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.880
Donut: This isn't hell, Sarge. And you're not dead.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.640
Sarge: Repent! Repent!

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.380
Donut: Come on, Sarge. Be quiet.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.440
Donut: I've been exploring down here and found some really crazy stuff. Look.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.640
Sarge: Why, that fort looks like a Blue Base.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.880
Sarge: And just when I thought hell couldn't get any worse.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.540
Donut: Yeah, but look at that!

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.020
Sarge: What in the hell is that thing?

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.360
Donut: I don't know, but but it sure looks a lot like the motorcycle I found in the cave upstairs

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.940
Sarge: Donut, why didn't you report this?

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.520
Donut: I couldn't. My radio broke when I fell.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.380
*Radio Static*
Simmons: Come in, Sarge. Are you there?

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.800
Sarge: Hello! Is that you, Simmons?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.260
Donut: No, I'm DO-NUT! Did you get amnesia from your fall or something?

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.100
Sarge: Shut up, Donut.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.680
Donut: Uh, Okay?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.400
Simmons: Sarge, we're down in the cave with you. Are you okay? Please tell me you're okay.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.900
Sarge: I'm fine. What's your location?

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.360
Donut: I'm standing right here. Next to you.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.060
Sarge: Shut up!

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.520
Simmons: We're looking for you right now, but this place is huge.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.620
Simmons: Grif is with me and we're on top of some kind of peninsular outcropping.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.480
Sarge: Uh, you're on top of Grif's what?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.120
Donut: Grif isn't anywhere around here.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.800
Sarge: Donut! I told you to be quiet!

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.600
Donut: Well, stop asking me stuff then.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.920
Simmons: No, we're on a peninsular ledge, trying to find you.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.600
Sarge: Roger that. I got Donut.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.840
Sarge: You sit tight and we'll find you.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.420
Simmons: Roger that. Simmons out.
*Radio clicks off*

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.540
Grif: Dude, what was all that stuff about your penis ruler?

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.180
Sarge: I just talked with Simmons on the radio.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.580
Donut: Oooooohoho. The radio.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.440
Sarge: I told them to hold still and we'll come to them.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.840
Donut: Sarge, I don't think you realize how big this place is.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.660
Donut: There's no Landmarks or anything.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.900
Donut: Just one rock after another that all looks the same.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.520
Donut: Finding them would be like finding a needle in a haystack.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.180
Sarge: They said they were standing on some kind of...penis no--

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.280
Donut: Oh, I know where that is. Let's go.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.820
Simmons: Hello, everyone.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.140
Simmons: Now that we have our own YouTube Channel, I've taken the liberty of reorganizing everything for a streamline viewing experience.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.160
Simmons: Just hit subscribe to put it to use.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.280
Grif: You were supposed to convince them to subscribe, not put them to sleep. You loser.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.820
Simmons: *Sighs* I hate him so much.
