and then it starts raining it will not

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.070

stay<00:02:29.190> straight<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.730> then<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> curl<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.750> usually

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080

in<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.230> rain<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.530> loses<00:02:31.890> its<00:02:32.040> curl<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.490> it

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
in the rain it loses its curl and it

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.110 
in the rain it loses its curl and it
gets<00:02:32.700> all<00:02:32.820> gross

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
really long there's so many different

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.300 
really long there's so many different
ways<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.630> can<00:03:09.780> layer<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.110> up<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.620> it's

ways that you can layer it up and it's

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.550 
ways that you can layer it up and it's
in<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.910> color<00:03:12.120> try<00:03:12.540> black<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.170> thought<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.500> had

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
in the color try black I thought it had

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.750 
in the color try black I thought it had
some<00:03:13.799> dimension<00:03:14.250> because<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.579> very

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
some dimension because it is very

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.640 
some dimension because it is very
lightweight<00:03:15.060> but<00:03:15.329> it's<00:03:16.079> really<00:03:16.320> like<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.560> huge

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
lightweight but it's really like a huge

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.280 
lightweight but it's really like a huge
scarf<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.549> then<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.820> have<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.390> my<00:03:18.600> socks<00:03:19.019> in<00:03:19.260> my

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
scarf and then I have on my socks in my

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.259 
scarf and then I have on my socks in my
hunter<00:03:19.980> rain<00:03:20.160> boots<00:03:20.489> these<00:03:20.730> are<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:20.970> creamy

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
hunter rain boots these are the creamy

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.030 
hunter rain boots these are the creamy
color<00:03:21.600> once<00:03:21.900> again<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.200> wanted<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.680> mix<00:03:22.860> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
color once again I wanted to mix the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.740 
color once again I wanted to mix the
neutrals<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.640> thought<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:24.000> these<00:03:24.480> socks

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
neutrals and I thought that these socks

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.930 
neutrals and I thought that these socks
went<00:03:24.989> very<00:03:25.140> well<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.400> think<00:03:26.459> they<00:03:26.700> make<00:03:26.850> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
went very well and I think they make the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.340 
went very well and I think they make the
boots<00:03:27.120> look<00:03:27.269> even<00:03:27.600> cuter<00:03:27.810> than<00:03:28.079> they<00:03:28.230> already

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
boots look even cuter than they already

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.050 
boots look even cuter than they already
are
