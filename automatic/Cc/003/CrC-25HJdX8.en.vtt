 in the middle of an island big island and 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.320
 I thought we'll do it soon 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.779
 a walk and not the track 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.180

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.010
 animal keeper made yes is right yes 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.780
 very unusual the others stays 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.550
 or other athletes the genes 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.920
 He is in the sports management area 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.920
 or even in the physio cup are with you 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.320
 Yes , I say difficult to do so 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.699
 knew about my school at all 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.230
 nothing I should do so me 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.969
 also had the direction physiotherapy 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.460
 actually a friend 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.140
 Inka Grings has me then the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.570
 Duisburger Zoo sent at that time as me 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.100
 have still played there in duisburg 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.870
 started internship and it was 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.670
 the madness directly so I was me 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.250
 Do not believe two days there and that was 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.480
 right for me yes that was me and 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.080
 Accordingly, I am there for it 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.510
 decided 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.550
 Yesterday I was only with her 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.790
 discovered have to see if there is sitting 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.630
 on 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.600
 I have already seen me therefore 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.460
 is only with us but also as 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.140
 we drove to the training ground 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.100
 have one also stood still 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.630
 stood on the hind legs 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.060
 For me, the company is big on cinema 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.910
 every case alex popp is synonymous 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.070
 somehow for 100% football is days 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:40.330
 you do not think about soccer or 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:42.460
 moments holiday if not exactly the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.500
 men-wm or something like that is then 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.350
 But the holiday is really 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.210
 switch off completely so announced 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.990
 really then I want nothing more 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.300
 see and hear 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.010
 However, it is also after some 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.100
 maybe a week or so 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.600
 that I say okay then I can 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.730
 take a ball again and sex 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.260
 So play it is not a long time 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.460
 time you say wow I do not have one 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.320
 bock more on soccer i want that now 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.170
 do not see everything but that's one 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.789
 short phase just completely nothing 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.190
 hear nothing from such a round 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.660
 things and yes it can be done anyway 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.110
 actually go faster again 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.120
 as you actually want 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.190
 on sunday it starts for you 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.830
 against Ivory Coast a brand new 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.610
 opponent how do you become as a team 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.660
 We have prepared such game analyzes 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.740
 So from the opponents are already 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.790
 months in advance of colleagues bumped 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.470
 sighted and analyzed everything completely 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.540
 and that is what we are introduced to 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.520
 Strengthening is what their weaknesses are where 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.840
 we see our chance our rooms 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.209
 see and exist first wm so i 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.400
 my more than anything can win 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.540
 not and I believe so if that 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.430
 also go into this game and 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.989
 Actually, I think so too 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.239
 many many teams the biggest 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.370
 to play against Germany and 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.459
 Accordingly, one is also motivated 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.200
 be and we are, we want it too 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:10.870
 very good to start the tournament and 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.870
 accordingly, must also be prepared 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:22.580
 is still a few burned that I burned 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:24.950
 so of course i can come to alex 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.049
 Professionals allegedly better I know yes 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.060
 You've known that way before six 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.100
 years back then in duisburg we 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.660
 Together we went to the training where we 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.459
 almost a car accident was built 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.780
 right here and today i have the honor 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.209
 I interview here 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.519
 that's why I start directly and that 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.549
 There was also the vfl wolfsburg page 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.190
 a call and yes here are already one 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.030
 I'll just ask some of them 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.670
 would make 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.739
 and this is where the alexandra feels 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.410
 you are fit enough 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.269
 I think so yes yes so I have 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.950
 already worked a lot for the 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.360
 wm 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.030
 I think I have a good season 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.319
 where I am also self-confident now 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.030
 However , could travel to Canada 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.950
 we speak very nicely do you have 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.200
 special rituals before a game yes 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.360
 So I already always have them 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.150
 left to left shoes left shin 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.799
 nice left neck 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.959
 that's always how it was 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.130
 do it now and take it funny 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.820
 I always keep my jewelry in the same 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.790
 sequence from so I actually even 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.130
 It was not that special 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.700
 ritual is simply the routine 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.639
 just okay you have influence on the 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.169
 choose his jersey number if so what 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.800
 special meaning has the jersey number 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.960
 18 for you not the choice so that 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.180
 the national coach decides which 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.180
 We get jersey numbers and thereby 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.919
 that I injured as the 2013 em 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.310
 may I even before the jersey number 9 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.620
 just gave a change and as 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.889
 I then pushed to again it was 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.889
 then the 18 under the club you wear 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:06.039
 the lwl probably yours too 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.910
 favorite brand 11 and 25 are actually 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.660
 so my favorite number and have 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.520
 I've always played 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.889
 especially the eleven-year-olds have my boys 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.590
 had already quirks and the 25 was 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.820
 actually my first my first 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.080
 number in the Bundesliga and 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.850
 accordingly for me, too 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.740
 What special then I have one more 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.860
 Last question and that is what I have here 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.450
 pillow hashtag title dream and a great one 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.770
 picture of you I still have here and 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.300
 he asks the tine love pop what would have 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.220
 I do for this to pillow this 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.700
 actually you can actually think so 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.080
 I do not do anything because yes this pillow 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.380
 and actually this one 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.510
 hashtag us as a team completely 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.130
 hopefully yes the whole bmw was 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.780
 accompanied and we hope 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.110
 actually behind with the title 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.960
 dream to get the title 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.820
 go out of this wm and i believe if 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.680
 we'll manage that anyway 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.160
 no that's right you're right 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.800
 ok so I thank you and yes me 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.740
 wish you all the best for the wm see 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.580
