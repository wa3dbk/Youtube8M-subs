what<00:02:33.409> do<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.680> think<00:02:33.799> about<00:02:34.099> this<00:02:34.430> hill<00:02:34.700> and

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
what do you think about this hill and

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.929 
what do you think about this hill and
thus<00:02:36.079> bit<00:02:36.319> of<00:02:36.409> the<00:02:36.470> course<00:02:36.739> well<00:02:37.189> from<00:02:37.790> my

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
thus bit of the course well from my

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.429 
thus bit of the course well from my
class<00:02:38.180> experience<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.810> running<00:02:38.930> this<00:02:39.170> hill

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
class experience of running this hill

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.679 
class experience of running this hill
this<00:02:40.189> is<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.430> hell<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:40.670> obviously<00:02:41.359> within<00:02:41.569> the

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
this is a hell that obviously within the

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.710 
this is a hell that obviously within the
McMahons<00:02:42.290> eerie<00:02:42.590> switches<00:02:43.220> this<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:44.180> the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
McMahons eerie switches this I is the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.319 
McMahons eerie switches this I is the
mean<00:02:44.900> race<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.319> main<00:02:46.120> features<00:02:47.120> three

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
mean race to the main features three

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.330 
mean race to the main features three
times<00:02:47.569> so<00:02:48.440> it's<00:02:48.560> going<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.739> have<00:02:48.799> a<00:02:48.920> key

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
times so it's going to have a key

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.520 
times so it's going to have a key
outcome<00:02:49.879> on<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.180> winners<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.810> this<00:02:50.989> Reese<00:02:51.230> and

races<00:03:00.260> on<00:03:00.379> here<00:03:00.590> I've<00:03:00.739> seen<00:03:01.010> by<00:03:01.430> graces<00:03:01.879> Rania

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
races on here I've seen by graces Rania

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.179 
races on here I've seen by graces Rania
and<00:03:02.629> this<00:03:02.870> race<00:03:03.139> will<00:03:03.349> have<00:03:03.409> a<00:03:03.620> bearing<00:03:03.889> on<00:03:04.069> the

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
and this race will have a bearing on the

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.039 
and this race will have a bearing on the
outcome<00:03:04.220> of<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.639> race<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.629> they're<00:03:05.810> saying<00:03:05.989> a

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
outcome of the race so they're saying a

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.069 
outcome of the race so they're saying a
part<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.439> course<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:07.239> Mayor<00:03:08.239> up<00:03:08.510> move

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
part of the course that Mayor up move

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.300 
part of the course that Mayor up move
may<00:03:09.349> be<00:03:09.409> made<00:03:09.680> maybe<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.489> know<00:03:12.099> I<00:03:13.099> think

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
may be made maybe you know I think

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.860 
may be made maybe you know I think
somewhere<00:03:14.209> that<00:03:14.359> you<00:03:14.420> can<00:03:14.569> definitely

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
somewhere that you can definitely

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.080 
somewhere that you can definitely
consolidate<00:03:15.590> your<00:03:15.620> position<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.849> think

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
consolidate your position and I think

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.759 
consolidate your position and I think
that<00:03:17.239> if<00:03:17.389> you<00:03:17.720> are<00:03:17.780> struggling<00:03:18.200> going<00:03:18.560> up<00:03:18.650> this

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
that if you are struggling going up this

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.319 
that if you are struggling going up this
hill<00:03:18.829> particularly<00:03:19.489> in<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.639> first<00:03:19.849> or<00:03:20.000> second

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
hill particularly in the first or second

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.890 
hill particularly in the first or second
laps<00:03:20.510> it's<00:03:21.199> a<00:03:21.379> long<00:03:21.560> way<00:03:21.709> around<00:03:21.799> this<00:03:22.069> course

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
laps it's a long way around this course

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.990 
laps it's a long way around this course
well<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:23.930> just<00:03:24.109> noticed<00:03:25.099> our<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.489> if<00:03:25.669> the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
well I just noticed our that if the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000 
well I just noticed our that if the
course<00:03:26.449> and<00:03:26.780> this<00:03:27.290> hell<00:03:27.500> is<00:03:27.680> I'm<00:03:27.799> tough<00:03:27.980> enough

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
course and this hell is I'm tough enough

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.240 
course and this hell is I'm tough enough
we<00:03:28.849> soon<00:03:29.030> have<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.299> bit<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:29.569> water<00:03:30.260> line<00:03:30.650> along

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
we soon have a bit of water line along

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.009 
we soon have a bit of water line along
this<00:03:32.379> so<00:03:33.849> so<00:03:34.849> it's<00:03:35.000> going<00:03:35.209> to<00:03:35.329> turn<00:03:35.540> up<00:03:35.599> quite

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
this so so it's going to turn up quite

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.020 
this so so it's going to turn up quite
nicely<00:03:36.049> a<00:03:36.560> limb<00:03:36.829> and<00:03:36.859> the<00:03:37.609> weather<00:03:37.790> forecast

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
nicely a limb and the weather forecast

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.610 
nicely a limb and the weather forecast
is<00:03:38.299> next<00:03:38.329> couple<00:03:38.690> days<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:38.930> only<00:03:39.109> suggested

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
is next couple days you only suggested

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.930 
is next couple days you only suggested
that<00:03:39.709> will<00:03:39.889> increase<00:03:40.099> something<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:40.639> very

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
that will increase something a very

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.750 
that will increase something a very
tough<00:03:41.209> Helen<00:03:41.480> prospect<00:03:41.949> absolutely<00:03:42.949> let's

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
tough Helen prospect absolutely let's

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.440 
tough Helen prospect absolutely let's
just<00:03:43.970> take<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.180> week<00:03:44.449> walk<00:03:45.079> up<00:03:45.319> to<00:03:45.470> see<00:03:45.680> what

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.839 

no<00:03:52.290> looking<00:03:52.860> at<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.099> lead<00:03:53.310> into<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
no looking at the lead into the

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.630 
no looking at the lead into the
intersection<00:03:54.270> party<00:03:55.010> which<00:03:56.010> does<00:03:56.280> lead<00:03:56.610> to

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
intersection party which does lead to

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.070 
intersection party which does lead to
the<00:03:57.000> high<00:03:57.180> point<00:03:57.569> of<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.410> hill<00:03:59.810> which<00:04:00.810> brings

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
the high point of the hill which brings

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.220 
the high point of the hill which brings
us<00:04:01.260> back<00:04:01.349> to<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.739> original<00:04:02.220> cross<00:04:02.430> over<00:04:06.230> the

us back to the original cross over the
small<00:04:07.530> lot<00:04:07.709> came<00:04:07.980> up<00:04:08.099> this<00:04:08.250> hill<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:09.060> big

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
small lot came up this hill and the big

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.600 
small lot came up this hill and the big
