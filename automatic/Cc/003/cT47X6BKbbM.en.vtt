00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.340
 series of other menus even for more things 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.650
 important 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.830
 this is the first and we say that that is to say 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.269
 make it easier for you all 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.970

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.359

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.590

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.020

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.510

 public of and you will see own sails 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.879
 this rustic cloth covered cloth is a 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.059
 example 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.309
 ok then let's go to this menu 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:54.270
 birthday 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:56.850
 then as an aperitif over drinks and 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.480
 then he wall to your taste drinks 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.809
 smurfs for children orange paradis rule 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.580
 in other words you can here then me 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.210
 I would say to put 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.980
 some bare pizzas that you like a 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.070
 all large and small to put 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.500
 of rustic vatra puffs though yes 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.830
 they make more rubiche pizzetterie for 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.170
 example are twenty people 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.290
 better to do two free methods 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.100
 pizzas and a rustic wire Trust 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.670
 always a bit of old telequiz 7 then 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.160
 as a touch of elegance I would put i 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.510
 salty glasses I made 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.090
 see in the video and with ie beautiful e 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.570
 very good colo cola to fork 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.570
 side paranti you will look great 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:00.060
 then just to start eating 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:03.330
 I would make timi sandwiches not always that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.340
 stage see in the video in bullfighting yes 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.530
 they calculate two each 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:14.040
 hypothesis are twenty people will make you 40 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.950
 sandwiches and then sandwiches always 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.700
 million call the buttons too 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.260
 those also go two apiece 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:28.670
 so always there for those people 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:32.370
 they will make 240 sandwiches and 40 fine Boston 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.560
 then I'd make a nice rice salad 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.640
 like that year he showed in 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.170
 video 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.700
 also because a lot in canada split not 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.170
 is never wrong 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.030
 everyone likes it and then it is a dish 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.790
 cool termite said what states it is 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.510
 just the ideal but also when winter 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.400
 okay what was even better 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.110
 was of a beautiful rice salad 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.200
 pretty decorated 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.070
 in an oven dish always calculated for 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.130
 20 people because I feed a kilo of rice 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:09.990
 because after all the seasoning sum 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:13.350
 such as weight and finally one 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.490
 nice cake the cake will go to yours 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.740
 taste so much I did see several 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.020
 in the videos and now I'll put a cake 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.650
 mimosa who could put a cake of 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.830
 fruit a millefeuille that profiterol 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:33.120
 which then gave more and what I think 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:37.950
 this is a very simple menu and 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.680
 very nice and functional and definitely 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.930
 make an excellent figure 2 I hope this 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.260

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.300
