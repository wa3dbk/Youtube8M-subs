never know rarely bridges anywhere Jenny

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.679 
never know rarely bridges anywhere Jenny
I<00:02:01.890> gotta<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.460> say<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:02.939> can't<00:02:03.210> break<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
I gotta have to say we can't break the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.630 
I gotta have to say we can't break the
second<00:02:04.140> Soph<00:02:04.380> into<00:02:04.799> tense<00:02:05.070> though<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.490> can

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
second Soph into tense though we can

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.580 
second Soph into tense though we can
only<00:02:05.700> go<00:02:05.909> five<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.509> go<00:02:06.630> six<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.320> don't<00:02:07.500> have

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
only go five we can go six we don't have

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.440 
only go five we can go six we don't have
the<00:02:07.680> technology<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.399> break<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.789> down<00:02:08.910> into<00:02:09.209> 10

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the technology to break it down into 10

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.940 
the technology to break it down into 10
so<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.750> say<00:02:09.929> 55

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
so you say 55

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.020 
so you say 55
50<00:02:11.370> fine<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.239> got<00:02:12.420> ok<00:02:12.720> true<00:02:13.020> 33<00:02:13.790> split<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
50 fine I got ok true 33 split the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.360 
50 fine I got ok true 33 split the
difference<00:02:15.209> ok<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.680> got<00:02:16.800> one<00:02:16.980> way<00:02:17.069> at<00:02:17.190> three

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
difference ok so we got one way at three

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.040 
difference ok so we got one way at three
now<00:02:17.519> that<00:02:17.849> basically<00:02:18.300> leaves<00:02:18.599> me<00:02:18.870> with

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
now that basically leaves me with

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.839 
now that basically leaves me with
immediate<00:02:19.530> yeah<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.860> think<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.250> or<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.640> could

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
immediate yeah I think so or you could

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.680 
immediate yeah I think so or you could
do<00:02:20.970> go<00:02:21.209> just<00:02:21.510> go<00:02:22.069> 67<00:02:23.069> now<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.459> go<00:02:23.580> yeah<00:02:23.790> go<00:02:24.269> up

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
do go just go 67 now just go yeah go up

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.850 
do go just go 67 now just go yeah go up
yeah<00:02:25.190> or<00:02:26.190> 20<00:02:26.580> it's<00:02:27.269> not<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.480> long<00:02:27.720> shot<00:02:27.930> i<00:02:27.989> mostly
