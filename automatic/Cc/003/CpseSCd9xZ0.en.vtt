instead of doing a wig which can be

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:33.719 
instead of doing a wig which can be
pretty<00:06:31.749> expensive<00:06:32.079> this<00:06:32.469> is<00:06:32.529> under<00:06:32.889> $10<00:06:33.459> and<00:06:33.699> a

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:36.579 
wig it's like 20 or so but it's really

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:38.489 
wig it's like 20 or so but it's really
messy<00:06:36.999> as<00:06:37.089> your<00:06:37.329> towel<00:06:37.509> or<00:06:37.749> shirt<00:06:38.019> they<00:06:38.139> really

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:38.499 
messy as your towel or shirt they really

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:42.629 
messy as your towel or shirt they really
don't<00:06:38.649> care<00:06:38.829> about<00:06:39.360> and<00:06:40.439> yeah<00:06:41.439> so<00:06:42.249> that's<00:06:42.399> the

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
don't care about and yeah so that's the

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.929 
don't care about and yeah so that's the
havior<00:06:43.979> actually<00:06:44.979> that's<00:06:45.189> not<00:06:45.399> it<00:06:45.639> for<00:06:45.849> the

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:45.939 
havior actually that's not it for the

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:49.189 
havior actually that's not it for the
hair<00:06:46.119> I<00:06:46.149> decided<00:06:46.629> to<00:06:47.439> do<00:06:47.829> the<00:06:48.099> hair<00:06:48.339> up<00:06:48.610> like

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
hair I decided to do the hair up like

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:54.389 
hair I decided to do the hair up like
she<00:06:51.269> because<00:06:52.269> hers<00:06:52.509> is<00:06:52.539> shorter<00:06:53.110> obviously<00:06:53.739> so

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:54.399 
she because hers is shorter obviously so

00:06:54.399 --> 00:07:02.369 
she because hers is shorter obviously so
this<00:06:55.239> is<00:06:55.569> not<00:06:55.749> practical<00:06:56.649> for<00:07:00.749> long<00:07:01.749> period

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:02.379 
this is not practical for long period

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:07.289 
this is not practical for long period
