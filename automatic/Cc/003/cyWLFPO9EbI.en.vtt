a blockage around like a cartoon which
may<00:03:29.890> come<00:03:30.100> in<00:03:30.190> useful<00:03:30.220> if<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:30.790> make<00:03:30.970> in<00:03:31.120> a

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
may come in useful if you make in a

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.470 
may come in useful if you make in a
cartoon<00:03:31.600> style<00:03:32.050> 3d<00:03:32.800> movie<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:36.300> just<00:03:37.300> think

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
cartoon style 3d movie and I just think

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.030 
cartoon style 3d movie and I just think
it's<00:03:37.630> really<00:03:37.810> cool<00:03:38.140> because<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.680> can<00:03:38.710> pick

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
it's really cool because you can pick

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.930 
it's really cool because you can pick
any<00:03:39.400> color<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:39.760> on<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:41.520> suppose<00:03:42.520> it<00:03:42.670> also

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
any color you on so suppose it also

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.550 
any color you on so suppose it also
works<00:03:43.150> for<00:03:43.330> if<00:03:43.570> you<00:03:43.690> wanted<00:03:43.990> to<00:03:44.140> do<00:03:44.260> like<00:03:44.500> a
