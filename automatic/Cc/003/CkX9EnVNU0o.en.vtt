00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.449
 no 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.930
 hello cÃ©dric of the block learning the 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.809
 guitar point fr so today I 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.879
 offers you to learn the piece 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.210
 boulevard of broken dreams of the green 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.790
 day 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.170
 so it's a very simple piece then 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.850
 if I had said that zombie 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.309
 cranberries that had to be first 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.659
 piece to take I think boulevard 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.339
 of broken dreams this is your second 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.829
 piece to hang so he is he 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:02.000
 is easy then it's a piece that goes 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.220
 to play in capoen like this and that's it 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.800
 so we will first see the agreements so 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.649
 we will have to differentiate the 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.690
 torque is hard at the brakes so the 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.740
 couple and chords are very simple 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.740
 minor bed 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.670
 G major 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:33.190
 Damage to the major here is everything and 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.119
 we end with another bias 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.229
 so that's it's the couple is then 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.500
 while michael is very simple it's okay 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:48.220
 to be so it's an irony 4 and rock 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.370
 it hurts 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.030
 ben hammam 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.150
 ben hammam has 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.110
 it's going badly 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.110
 not very nice 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.360
 not bad 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:11.099
 so here is the couple and he turns on 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:17.030
 these four chords baba baobab down 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:24.420
 up down down to mahb to baho so minor 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:26.190
 soil and then we'll see their 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.310
 then offering for the end euro so a 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:37.640
 time we did there 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.770
 so we're going to follow on back 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.620
 only 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.860
 a rennais 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.190
 and there now 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.990
 in fact it's the same it's the same 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.820
 these same agreements actually except that at 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.340
 instead of putting minors at the beginning 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.850
 down to your nickname so the rhythmic 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.850
 always the same 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.540
 so baby baba simply then 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.260
 in the chorus only we will do 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.260
 once so 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.490
 second time sorry 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.200
 and at the end so the sentence will fall 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.390
 pilsen walk alone and that's it then finally 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.069
 he will stop like this so for 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:42.390
 this last sentence instead of doing 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:42.390
 do ground floor and the major is going to be back 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.790
 and that's the small difficulty of the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:53.210
 piece it 'll have to do a six 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.010
 major then the sixth major so major in 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.050
 down there are two solutions to do it 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.380
 you will see it's not so complicated 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.080
 only that 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.590
 so first solution is the bar and 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.310
 the bar is here crate of them actually 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:11.030
 the ex pressed on the box 2.6 and there the 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.460
 night yesterday will come crush on box 4 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:18.860
 the strings 3 4 and 5 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.299
 this is like this so as it is a 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.820
 rock song and that's a piece 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.520
 rather that will sound a little more 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.990
 Europe so that's when are you 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.400
 can do everything to make the site like 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.560
 that we will do what is so called 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.670
 fifth the 6th 5th actually we're going to support 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.090
 if the index 15.2 second string 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:43.610
 the annular box 4 of the third string 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.900
 and the little finger box 4 of the 4th strings 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.720
 and we will try to play the strings that 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.050
 two three four 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.060
 here 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:57.020
 in fact the 5th agreements are 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.020
 chords that sounds rock that's it 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.430
 this is how it is to play that 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:10.560
 the 3 4 that's the second way of 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.980
 play to play the third agreement 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.480
 way 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:18.420
 so here you know the position of 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.990
 the major so the major often we 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.760
 you say major index and annular for 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.950
 flatten the three hulls that are next 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.020
 on the bodies of two three and four of 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.800
 Box 2 but everything to do fingering 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:35.490
 there now you will do the fingering 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:39.510
 major annular and auricular here 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.670
 that's it's all about you 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.460
 go the shifted to more than the 4th 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.230
 so did the same but the fourth case 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.290
 here with the nex you 're going to support up 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.970
 on the second box and you will play 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.970
 than the core 2 3 4 and 5 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.890
 here you have your agreement on 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.890
 so here you have too much solution 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:06.380
 the bar and the fifth for those who 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:11.240
 really do not arrive with just the 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:13.580
 three strings or that's where the agreement like 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.040
 these and those who really arrive 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.360
 you put here the finger that presses 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.360
 the scene that are the 6th string 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.690
 So here we have just seen the piece 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.770
 boulevard of broken dreams 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.910
 you see that he is not well 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:32.150
 complicated so the couple and their brake 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.270
 here now if you want so I 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.680
 will leave link below the video 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.480
 to go on a second video in 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.310
 which I will learn the little riff 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.500
 that there is in the piece 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.400
 So if you want to join me 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.080
 right away in the second video 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.100
 clicked highlights what they have going 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.100
 thank you to all these acts
