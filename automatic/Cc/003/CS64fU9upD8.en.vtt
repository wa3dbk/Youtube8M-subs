I<00:00:39.240> have<00:00:40.240> liked<00:00:40.360> this<00:00:40.480> theory<00:00:40.810> in<00:00:40.960> my<00:00:41.110> head<00:00:41.290> when

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
I have liked this theory in my head when

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.610 
I have liked this theory in my head when
somebody<00:00:42.400> does<00:00:42.880> something<00:00:42.910> really<00:00:43.300> amazing

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
somebody does something really amazing

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.140 
somebody does something really amazing
they<00:00:44.620> set<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.130> bar<00:00:45.310> they<00:00:45.700> put<00:00:45.910> all<00:00:46.000> that

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
they set the bar they put all that

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.240 
they set the bar they put all that
energy<00:00:46.270> and<00:00:47.020> that<00:00:47.110> energy<00:00:47.170> never<00:00:47.710> leaves<00:00:47.950> that

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
energy and that energy never leaves that

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.450 
energy and that energy never leaves that
you<00:00:48.820> know<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.210> it<00:00:50.110> attracts<00:00:50.650> the<00:00:50.830> rest<00:00:51.129> of<00:00:51.340> us

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460

to<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.940> honest<00:00:52.470> original<00:00:53.470> film<00:00:53.800> because<00:00:54.100> it's

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
to the honest original film because it's

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.220 
to the honest original film because it's
so<00:00:54.430> beautiful<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:55.000> so<00:00:55.210> amazing<00:00:55.330> and<00:00:55.989> it's

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
never gonna be finished but we have to

00:00:58.390 --> 00:02:01.980 
never gonna be finished but we have to
be<00:00:58.540> finished<00:00:58.780> with<00:00:58.989> it<00:00:59.140> eventually

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.660 

it's<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.080> movie<00:02:03.350> based<00:02:03.530> off<00:02:03.770> like<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.340> networks

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
it's a movie based off like the networks

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.270 
it's a movie based off like the networks
of<00:02:04.820> information<00:02:05.480> and<00:02:05.780> like<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.890> know<00:02:06.980> going

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
of information and like you know going

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.460 
of information and like you know going
for<00:02:07.520> artificial<00:02:08.090> intelligence<00:02:08.210> and<00:02:09.140> what<00:02:09.380> it

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
for artificial intelligence and what it

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.590 
for artificial intelligence and what it
becomes<00:02:09.770> but<00:02:10.100> it<00:02:10.220> becomes<00:02:10.490> bi<00:02:10.880> itself<00:02:11.390> you

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
becomes but it becomes bi itself you

know<00:02:11.720> like<00:02:11.990> when<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.290> creates<00:02:12.620> itself<00:02:13.300> it's

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
know like when it creates itself it's

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300 
know like when it creates itself it's
interesting<00:02:14.600> when<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.020> look<00:02:15.050> at<00:02:15.320> that<00:02:15.890> and

you think about what we're doing as a
collective<00:02:19.220> group<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.820> people<00:02:20.210> from<00:02:20.390> around

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
the Internet to send data because this

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.870 
the Internet to send data because this
is<00:02:24.770> ones<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.130> zeroes<00:02:25.370> we're<00:02:25.520> just<00:02:25.640> sending
