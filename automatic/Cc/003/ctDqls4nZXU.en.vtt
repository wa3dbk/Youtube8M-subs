00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.340
 chess position on this occasion os 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.040
 I present a mate called the mate of the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.340
 shoulder pads this mates is characterized by 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 two pieces that obstruct their own king 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.140
 in the form of shoulder pads in this case the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:25.060
 two towers one on each side of the king 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:29.130
 and you can not leave the box where you 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.990
 elevated in the mate and the lady in front 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.970
 herself handing him checkmate by 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.710
 the obstruction of their own towers 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.690
 as I already say is the mate of the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.840
 shoulder pad I'm going to put a position that 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.930
 go to solve already knowing this subject os 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.870
 it will be easy to visualize the line to follow 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.640
 to get this happy mate is worth the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.800
 position that I am going to put is a 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.820
 departure that occurred between dead and a 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.980
 anonymous player in the year 1857 new 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.980
 york and the position would be this 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.330
 ah 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.880

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.770
 ah 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.890
 the story the position of the pieces 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:56.110
 white pawns are 2 out of 12 2 out of 4 4 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:00.399
 zeros the black pawns are in a 777 of 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:04.780
 six g6 the white piece are f1 towers 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:11.310

 towers to 8 h 8 queen of 8 bishop c 4 and king 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.739
 g8 well as I said this position 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.650
 having seen the mat of the shoulder pads 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.200
 it is easy to get to solve the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.380
 ok we see that Black has a 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.480
 bishop of more but the white one has 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.970
 this mate that is very easy to know 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.790
 visualize and white sacrifice it 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.400
 everything to give this mate having seen 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.269
 this the solution is very simple 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.370
 sacrifice of the two towers worth tower 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:47.330
 Efe eight check 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.540
 and Black has to eat 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.710
 tower by efe 8 or lady by efe 8 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.620

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.219
 clogging 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.010
 to his own king and so with a lady 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:15.310
