00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
for a universal experience I think we

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.420 
for a universal experience I think we
are<00:02:13.489> all<00:02:14.050> allowed<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.110> be<00:02:15.440> engaged<00:02:15.800> completely

are all allowed to be engaged completely
differently<00:02:16.790> or<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.209> be<00:02:17.360> disengaged
