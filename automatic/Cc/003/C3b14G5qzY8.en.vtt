00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.139
 total unless you are welcome to the automotive constructor and in terms 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.159
 analogues of donations 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.670
 This is a historic day on which the house offers all of Chile 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.410
 to compete in one of the most hardened segments of our country 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.589
 we invite you to meet him 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.710
 particularly this time having the opportunity is testing the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.720
 rtm version 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.619
 within its many characteristics with shots is accommodating seven 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.130
 passenger is a field that is worth mentioning that in a 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.180
 this indicator 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.860
 It is a little different in addition to the proportions of nationals that have their 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.070
 imprint that is perceived longer than wide 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.730
 I do not obey the official just as I mentioned 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.470
 they stop the possible by accommodating up to seven passengers and that is why 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.190
 which is to choose a little more length 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.600
 It is also important to mention that this version the RC built an engine of 3 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.990
 points 5 liters in configuration of 6 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.250
 and it forces it towards the front wheel just through a 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.090
 six-speed transmission 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.190
 that gives us the possibility of sequential manual operations 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.340
 and this just because it is not possible to reach acceleration figures of zero 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.750
 at one hundred kilometers per hour depending on two seconds gives us the possibility of 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.170
 recover the deficit in accelerations in running order from 80 to 120 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.290
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.880
 five is 9 seconds 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.810
 while the brake system that is integrated by john lewis with 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.090
 the four wheels has abc system is from 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.360
 gives us 100-kilometer-per-hour zero arrests 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.910
 with the truck only with the driver in a matter of 45 meters 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.890
 the interior can be percent maybe one of the most interesting aspects 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.460
 highlight the decrease in the broad level of treatment that can begin with 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.010
 materials the type and the one found the steering wheel the seats one 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.220
 important amount of holes to accommodate things even under the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.680
 seat of the 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.330
 the copilot and spaces to accommodate things on the floor of the second row we have a 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.880
 double bottom in the trunk 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.069
 eric elmosnino lighting forgiveness for the led type that is also addressable 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.129
 practically the whole truck we have additionally a lamp that can 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.949
 the contrast easily and it is located in the back we have 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:20.189
 the drive of mirrors and electrically safe windows is worth the 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.609
 worth mentioning that it is a single touch the driver's we also have the 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.650
 possibility of regulating in height and depth of the steering wheel we have a 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:31.430
 Cruise control cruise controls the steering wheel a full 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.109
 travel computer that denies the possibility 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.129
 gil 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.290
 the power to configure from some parameters of the vehicle 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.419
 particularly 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:41.609
 we can play 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.400
 over time that he interests us that our vehicle that maybe sell a 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:50.129
 Once it comes, we turn it off and that is so that they do not become detracted to be able to tell 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.099
 with the advice of the radio crystals 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.099
 for an additional time on the mercalli scale the engine 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.930
 the list of urban equipment of course to continue we have p 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:05.900
 the air-conditioned air conditioning system of three 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:08.449
 areas of the center of the driver field as 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:12.010
 the co-pilot as well as the spokesmen of the rear ones can decide 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.160
 At what temperature do they want to travel? We have the same equipment since baby 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.060
 percent up with your remote control with your hearing aids auxiliary inputs 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.960
 we have that even as an interesting feature in the back that 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.889
 small tastes are incorporated that 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.610
 which are used to safely reach the birds 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.070
 the height of the center about when it is feared that they are incorporated disturb the 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.779
 side 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:40.979
 who also makes sense is worth mentioning that we have a team of 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.149
 sound that 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:46.109
 the speakers are signed by infinity cliquee that the mythical stadium 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:48.029
 a huge screen 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:51.949
 that also allows producing some photographs of these three fronts 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.049
 It allows 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.369
 from nothing else touching the screen you see the setting of different 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.919
 elements also has west entrance of finland three points five 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.369
 conciliar minutes 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:06.629
 and that same screen of the sound equipment gives us the possibility deep 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.189
 project the invasion the images sent to us by the camera placed in the 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:11.150
 rear 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.649
 - help to the people of operation 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:18.159
 we also intend on boards that gives us information 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.389
 very complete, however, when placing your hands in the position 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:23.550
 correct handling 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.550
 circumstantially part of this information is hidden 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.749
 could the best of this action is definitely the high level of 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:34.360
 equipment although the activity provided by the six-cylinder engine 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.129
 it's worth mentioning 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.580
 who is a van 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.050
 this time not the ideal to leave in matters of cures mainly for 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.029
 that proportion of length that has 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:49.359
 and soon we also have p as characteristic of that nose a lot 

00:04:49.359 --> 00:04:51.599
 space to store things i 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.550
 p this equipment that already sealed mentions the minsa commented to them 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.770
 multifunctional 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.479
 since then some even resemble it with adult corporations 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.189
 percent and aspects 6 can definitely be improved 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.099
 Express that the materials do not seem correct to the interior of this shirt 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:10.639
 not necessarily 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.139
 the assemblies are especially for some spaces that are detected in 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.979
 and some shy people who occasionally show up inside their truck 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.499
 nothing to worry about opportunely are not those annoying of them in the presence of 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.960
 mind 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.719
 is so versatile that there are some elements that are obviously going to 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.879
 to access some operations 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:32.849
 in a note as expected the transition percent 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.879
 mainly cartels are looking to offer quality after indoor 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.330
 and a good level of equipment 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.710
 this is automotive consultant amelia sesto was the projection is investment 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.940
 rt 2010 is friend Dr. Leopoldo Ruiz and we were his orders thank you
