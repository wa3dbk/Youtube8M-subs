00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
greetings I'm my boy from the mall

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.810 
greetings I'm my boy from the mall
miners<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.710> today<00:00:17.010> I'll<00:00:17.160> be<00:00:17.279> explaining<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
miners and today I'll be explaining the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.939 
miners and today I'll be explaining the
setblock<00:00:18.180> command<00:00:18.240> what<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.080> does<00:00:19.260> how<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.650> use

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
setblock command what it does how to use

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.859 
setblock command what it does how to use
it<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> practical<00:00:20.850> applications<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.720> it

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
it and the practical applications of it

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.470 
it and the practical applications of it
so<00:00:22.830> let's<00:00:22.980> get<00:00:23.100> started<00:00:23.550> what<00:00:24.300> does<00:00:24.449> a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
so let's get started what does a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.660 
so let's get started what does a
setblock<00:00:24.900> command<00:00:24.960> do<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> command

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
setblock command do it is a command

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.029 
setblock command do it is a command
capable<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.420> placing<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.260> single<00:00:28.650> block<00:00:28.859> in

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
capable of placing a single block in

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.980 
capable of placing a single block in
this<00:00:29.310> case<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:30.000> will<00:00:30.150> place<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> cobblestone

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
this case it will place a cobblestone

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.630 
this case it will place a cobblestone
block<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.529> help<00:00:31.710> us<00:00:31.830> get<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.430> village

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
block to help us get on to this village

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.970 
block to help us get on to this village
roof<00:00:33.000> if<00:00:33.630> you're<00:00:33.840> looking<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.559> place<00:00:34.770> multiple

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
roof if you're looking to place multiple

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.069 
roof if you're looking to place multiple
blocks<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.550> once<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:36.450> should<00:00:36.600> look<00:00:36.719> into<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
blocks at once you should look into the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.690 
blocks at once you should look into the
slash<00:00:37.350> fill<00:00:37.649> command<00:00:37.920> instead<00:00:38.250> which<00:00:38.520> we

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
slash fill command instead which we

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.869 
slash fill command instead which we
covered<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.390> previous<00:00:39.570> tutorial<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.820> how<00:00:41.820> do

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
covered in a previous tutorial so how do

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.389 
covered in a previous tutorial so how do
we<00:00:41.969> use<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> setblock<00:00:42.690> command<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.860> full<00:00:44.100> set

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
we use a setblock command the full set

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.100 
we use a setblock command the full set
lock<00:00:44.610> command<00:00:45.059> looks<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
lock command looks like this but the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.920 
lock command looks like this but the
basic<00:00:46.230> format<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.010> set<00:00:47.280> block<00:00:47.550> x<00:00:47.879> coordinate<00:00:48.660> y

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
basic format is set block x coordinate y

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.600 
basic format is set block x coordinate y
coordinate<00:00:49.379> Z<00:00:49.649> coordinate<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.250> your<00:00:50.370> block

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
coordinate Z coordinate and your block

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.299 
coordinate Z coordinate and your block
ID<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.870> let's<00:00:52.050> say<00:00:52.199> we'll<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.500> place<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:53.010> block

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
ID so let's say we'll in place a block

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.520 
ID so let's say we'll in place a block
of<00:00:53.489> wool<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:53.969> center<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.510> our<00:00:54.629> target<00:00:55.050> to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
of wool in the center of our target to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.130 
of wool in the center of our target to
find<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> XYZ<00:00:56.250> coordinates<00:00:56.910> simply<00:00:57.690> press<00:00:57.899> f3

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
find the XYZ coordinates simply press f3

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.229 
find the XYZ coordinates simply press f3
on<00:00:58.440> your<00:00:58.590> keyboard<00:00:58.739> look<00:00:59.520> at<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.789> targeted

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
on your keyboard look at your targeted

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.240 
on your keyboard look at your targeted
block<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> bottom<00:01:01.770> little<00:01:02.039> left

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
block and on the bottom little left

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.759 
block and on the bottom little left
column<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.969> will<00:01:03.090> say<00:01:03.300> looking<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.589> let's

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
column it will say looking at so let's

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.730 
column it will say looking at so let's
write<00:01:04.979> down<00:01:05.010> those<00:01:05.400> three<00:01:05.700> numbers<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.740> punch

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
write down those three numbers and punch

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.010 
write down those three numbers and punch
it<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.460> our<00:01:08.490> command<00:01:08.820> block<00:01:09.030> over<00:01:09.299> here<00:01:09.510> so

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
it in to our command block over here so

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.230 
it in to our command block over here so
set<00:01:10.380> block<00:01:12.229> x-coordinate

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
set block x-coordinate

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.789 
set block x-coordinate
y<00:01:14.870> coordinate<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:15.530> Z<00:01:16.400> coordinate<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.740> now<00:01:18.740> we

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
y coordinate and Z coordinate and now we

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.280 
y coordinate and Z coordinate and now we
need<00:01:19.100> our<00:01:19.130> block<00:01:19.460> ID<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:20.150> block<00:01:20.420> ID<00:01:20.659> is<00:01:21.020> just

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
need our block ID the block ID is just

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.620 
need our block ID the block ID is just
the<00:01:21.470> most<00:01:21.770> obvious<00:01:22.010> name<00:01:22.550> of<00:01:22.820> your<00:01:22.940> block<00:01:23.180> but

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
the most obvious name of your block but

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.690 
the most obvious name of your block but
in<00:01:23.750> some<00:01:23.930> cases<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.890> blocks<00:01:25.190> have<00:01:25.340> strange

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
in some cases the blocks have strange

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.230 
in some cases the blocks have strange
IDs<00:01:26.180> I<00:01:26.450> would<00:01:27.380> use<00:01:27.560> a<00:01:27.800> Minecraft<00:01:28.460> ID<00:01:28.759> list<00:01:29.119> to

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
IDs I would use a Minecraft ID list to

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.490 
IDs I would use a Minecraft ID list to
look<00:01:29.390> them<00:01:29.509> up<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:29.780> I'll<00:01:29.900> leave<00:01:30.110> one<00:01:30.259> in<00:01:30.409> the

want<00:01:49.190> anything<00:01:49.340> special<00:01:49.640> in<00:01:50.149> your<00:01:50.270> block<00:01:50.509> just

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
want anything special in your block just

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.109 
want anything special in your block just
punch<00:01:51.110> in<00:01:51.259> 0<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:52.280> let's<00:01:52.490> say<00:01:52.640> we<00:01:52.820> want<00:01:53.000> the

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
punch in 0 so let's say we want the

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.700 
punch in 0 so let's say we want the
center<00:01:53.479> of<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.690> target<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.080> be<00:01:54.200> blue<00:01:54.530> wool

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
center of the target to be blue wool

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.740 
center of the target to be blue wool
instead<00:01:55.070> of<00:01:55.190> white<00:01:55.369> so<00:01:56.090> according<00:01:56.539> to<00:01:56.600> the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
instead of white so according to the

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.740 
instead of white so according to the
Minecraft<00:01:57.170> ID<00:01:57.380> list<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.580> data<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:59.240> blue<00:01:59.509> rule

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
Minecraft ID list the data of blue rule

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.230 
Minecraft ID list the data of blue rule
is<00:01:59.960> 11<00:02:00.410> so<00:02:00.590> we'll<00:02:00.710> punch<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.100> in<00:02:01.310> push<00:02:02.060> the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
is 11 so we'll punch that in push the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.460 
is 11 so we'll punch that in push the
button<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.869> we<00:02:03.770> have<00:02:03.920> blue<00:02:04.190> wool<00:02:05.200> next<00:02:06.200> is<00:02:06.320> the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
button and we have blue wool next is the

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.560 
button and we have blue wool next is the
method<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.159> three<00:02:07.429> methods<00:02:07.850> are<00:02:08.030> replaced

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
method the three methods are replaced

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.500 
method the three methods are replaced
keep<00:02:09.019> and<00:02:09.229> destroy<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:10.310> default<00:02:10.850> is<00:02:11.000> replaced

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
keep and destroy the default is replaced

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.900 
keep and destroy the default is replaced
and<00:02:11.750> what<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.170> does<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:13.040> will<00:02:13.310> replace<00:02:13.580> the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
and what it does is it will replace the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
and what it does is it will replace the
old<00:02:14.090> block<00:02:14.390> with<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> new<00:02:15.050> block<00:02:15.730> like<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:16.940> the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
old block with a new block like that the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.259 
old block with a new block like that the
next<00:02:18.110> method<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.560> keep<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.340> what<00:02:19.700> Keef<00:02:19.970> does

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
next method is keep and what Keef does

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.380 
next method is keep and what Keef does
is<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:21.470> will<00:02:21.650> only<00:02:21.980> replace<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.850> block<00:02:23.120> if

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
is it will only replace the block if

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.920 
is it will only replace the block if
it's<00:02:23.600> empty<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:25.400> as<00:02:25.579> you<00:02:25.700> can<00:02:25.820> see<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.630> block

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
it's empty so as you can see the block

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.410 
it's empty so as you can see the block
in<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.260> middle<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.680> full<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:28.040> white<00:02:28.220> wool<00:02:28.489> so

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
in the middle is full of white wool so

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.090 
in the middle is full of white wool so
when<00:02:29.780> we<00:02:29.900> punch<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.380> keep<00:02:30.560> command<00:02:30.920> it

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
when we punch in the keep command it

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.180 
when we punch in the keep command it
will<00:02:31.220> not<00:02:31.400> do<00:02:31.670> anything<00:02:31.940> but<00:02:32.480> when<00:02:32.660> it's<00:02:32.810> empty

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
will not do anything but when it's empty

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.210 
will not do anything but when it's empty
it<00:02:34.190> will<00:02:34.340> place<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.820> block<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:36.470> final<00:02:36.860> method

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
it will place the block the final method

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.330 
it will place the block the final method
is<00:02:37.459> destroyed<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.780> what<00:02:38.930> destroy<00:02:39.290> does<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.769> it

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
is destroyed and what destroy does is it

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.060 
is destroyed and what destroy does is it
destroys<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:41.180> old<00:02:41.360> block<00:02:41.660> drops<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.620> entity

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
destroys the old block drops the entity

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.370 
destroys the old block drops the entity
and<00:02:43.250> places<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:43.970> new<00:02:44.060> one<00:02:44.360> in<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.079> if<00:02:45.140> we<00:02:45.230> click

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
and places a new one in so if we click

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.590 
and places a new one in so if we click
that<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:46.160> can<00:02:46.190> see<00:02:46.579> it<00:02:46.820> destroyed<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.299> blue

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
that you can see it destroyed the blue

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.850 
that you can see it destroyed the blue
wall<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.019> dropped<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.950> enter

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
wall and dropped the enter

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.650 
wall and dropped the enter
the<00:02:50.860> final<00:02:51.220> part<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.790> data<00:02:52.030> tag<00:02:52.330> which<00:02:52.630> is

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
the final part is the data tag which is

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.140 
the final part is the data tag which is
a<00:02:52.810> complex<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.650> bTW<00:02:54.040> tag<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.640> can<00:02:54.819> be<00:02:54.970> used

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
a complex and bTW tag that can be used

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.240 
a complex and bTW tag that can be used
to<00:02:55.240> customize<00:02:55.480> certain<00:02:56.080> things<00:02:56.530> like<00:02:57.040> the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
to customize certain things like the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.910 
to customize certain things like the
text<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.730> signs<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.750> contents<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.380> chests

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
text of signs and the contents of chests

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.540 
text of signs and the contents of chests
but<00:03:00.730> we<00:03:00.850> will<00:03:00.970> cover<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.300> in<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:01.630> future<00:03:01.840> video

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
but we will cover that in a future video

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.340 
but we will cover that in a future video
there<00:03:03.550> are<00:03:03.580> many<00:03:04.000> practical<00:03:04.330> uses<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:05.230> the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
there are many practical uses of the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.780 
there are many practical uses of the
setblock<00:03:05.650> command<00:03:05.709> but<00:03:06.340> perhaps<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.760> most

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
setblock command but perhaps the most

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.270 
setblock command but perhaps the most
useful<00:03:07.330> one<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.600> Wireless<00:03:08.260> redstone<00:03:08.739> on<00:03:09.100> the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
useful one is Wireless redstone on the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.190 
useful one is Wireless redstone on the
left<00:03:09.489> is<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.760> traditional<00:03:10.390> redstone<00:03:10.959> wire

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
left is a traditional redstone wire

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.340 
left is a traditional redstone wire
hooked<00:03:11.739> up<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.520> a<00:03:12.550> redstone<00:03:13.150> lamp<00:03:13.360> on<00:03:13.569> the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
hooked up to a redstone lamp on the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.710 
hooked up to a redstone lamp on the
right<00:03:14.530> there's<00:03:14.830> Wireless<00:03:15.459> redstone<00:03:15.910> also

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
right there's Wireless redstone also

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.199 
right there's Wireless redstone also
hooked<00:03:16.930> up<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.319> a<00:03:17.350> redstone<00:03:17.980> lamp<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:19.180> the

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
hooked up to a redstone lamp so the

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.000 
hooked up to a redstone lamp so the
first<00:03:19.540> command<00:03:19.900> block<00:03:20.110> what<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.380> does<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.830> it

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
first command block what it does is it

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.340 
first command block what it does is it
places<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.459> redstone<00:03:21.850> torch<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.540> top<00:03:23.050> of<00:03:23.260> the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
places a redstone torch on top of the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.250 
places a redstone torch on top of the
red<00:03:23.530> wolf<00:03:23.769> then<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.670> powers<00:03:25.060> these<00:03:25.510> redstone

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
red wolf then it powers these redstone

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.920 
red wolf then it powers these redstone
repeaters<00:03:26.769> that<00:03:27.670> create<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.090> short<00:03:28.390> delay<00:03:28.570> and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
repeaters that create a short delay and

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.890 
repeaters that create a short delay and
then<00:03:29.410> finally<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.190> powered<00:03:30.670> this<00:03:30.790> one<00:03:31.030> which

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
then finally it powered this one which

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.650 
then finally it powered this one which
sets<00:03:32.230> air<00:03:32.470> there<00:03:32.830> so<00:03:33.130> removes<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.850> redstone<00:03:34.300> so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
sets air there so removes a redstone so

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.710 
sets air there so removes a redstone so
the<00:03:34.810> lamp<00:03:35.140> isn't<00:03:35.350> powered<00:03:35.860> anymore

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
the lamp isn't powered anymore

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.610 
the lamp isn't powered anymore
so<00:03:37.320> overall<00:03:37.710> these<00:03:38.580> two<00:03:38.880> setups<00:03:39.620> do

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
so overall these two setups do

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.670 
so overall these two setups do
practically<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.430> same<00:03:41.610> thing<00:03:41.910> only<00:03:42.810> one<00:03:43.380> is

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
practically the same thing only one is

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.560 
practically the same thing only one is
shorter<00:03:44.100> than<00:03:44.250> other<00:03:44.460> which<00:03:44.850> is<00:03:45.030> an<00:03:45.210> advantage

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
shorter than other which is an advantage

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.260 
shorter than other which is an advantage
of<00:03:45.930> Wireless<00:03:46.380> redstone<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:47.060> hope<00:03:48.060> this
