00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:19.380
 and one day I looked tired I was despondent 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.150
 sad disoriented 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.150
 is that sometimes I do not understand the whim 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.820
 then I just want to sleep 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.250
 you can feel like the world was falling on 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.090
 my 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.680
 for a moment I thought myself dead 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.830
 the truth to be honest I would have 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.600
 wanted to die at that very moment is 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.520
 that my head understood that there are things 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.360
 against which you can not fight 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.790
 in the heart 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.600
 my heart was oppressing my chest and 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.760
 I started to cry 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.600
 and since I had never cried before in my 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.309
 lifetime 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.030
 that my spirit does not yet understand 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.030
 impossible 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.840
 because that afternoon when I look at the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.390
 eyes can I find 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.900
 drink that from which so many speak the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.900
 essence 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.890
 sad eyes 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.210
 if only I could understand that I do not 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.550
 I am part of this in the injustice that 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.970
 surrounds you the barriers that prevent you from being 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.970
 free 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.430
 from some point 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.240
 I think he knew that I was 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.220
 asking forgiveness 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.510
 although I keep begging to get it 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.640
 not only me to us 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.640
 that we let it die in there 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.980
 and while he dies 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 it's not just him 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.230
 the one that is locked 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.830
 and it's been a long time since the world 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.830
 he lost the magic 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.190
 Evil seized this plane 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.350
 we lock up life 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.939
 we chained the spirit 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.939
 we believe we have the right to everything 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.540
 and some ask me why fight 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.480
 I just want to know not to steal it 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.480
 life time 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.720
 I have decided to defend life 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.160
 because in this world death 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.160
 already has too many lawyers
