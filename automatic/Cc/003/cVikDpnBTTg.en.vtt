00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.610
 hello welcome i am cecilia in sardines 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.410
 and this is a new insight into 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.550
 mint dedicated to seo web readers 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.680
 strategic marketing 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.110
 before entering the heart of this 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.550
 video I want to ask you a question 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.840
 you would spend 50 euros to acquire a 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.680
 new customer to your site 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.360
 or 70 or 100 euros this is one 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.100
 question that you absolutely must know 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.900
 answer to know if you can 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.599
 allow you to acquire new members 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.710
 and how much you can afford to pay for 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.260
 to be able to recover the investment 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.530
 carried out and possibly reach 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.329
 a positive balance this number does not 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.640
 has nothing to do with how much money 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.739
 you have on the bank account and I talked about it 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.780
 just yesterday with a Canadian friend of mine 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.760
 dustin was after ours 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.980
 conversation he decided to create 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.700
 this video is a number 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.380
 based on one in one thing only 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.239
 how much value to the traffic you acquire 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.220
 if you have the answer to this question 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.710
 then you also know what the value is 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.750
 average monetary for each member of yours 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.579
 place 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.619
 this value is called value 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.870
 average of your writing a value of yours 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.880
 written medium and is a value that depends 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.920
 from what and from what your writing 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.100
 medium purchase and bowed bow 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.049
 time to determine the value of 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.150
 your average writing can divide the 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.430
 total of your income that falls 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.350
 in between a given time frame for the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.570
 number of unique subscribers reached by 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.659
 same time frame 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.540
 let us make an example suppose today 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.490
 you have 500 members instead of your site 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.960
 and made 10 sales each of the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.270
 value of 97 euros 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.420
 this has made your limits a total 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.250
 of 970 euros to calculate the value of 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.680
 your writing may divide into this 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.700
 number for the number of members who 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.330
 arrive at your site 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.650
 in this case 500 then 970 euros 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.390
 divided by 500 is equal to 1.94 euros this 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.369
 is the value of your average or in writing 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.060
 other words also as a writing 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.590
 applies to your advertising campaigns 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.209
 also represents the maximum value that 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.220
 you can afford to pay for a 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.530
 subscribed to your site without losing a 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.480
 hundredth of what actually 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.670
 investing does not underestimate the importance 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.380
 of this number for the success of yours 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.810
