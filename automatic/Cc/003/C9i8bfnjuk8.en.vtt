spot and the stickers coming off on mine

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.439 
spot and the stickers coming off on mine
I<00:00:48.409> didn't<00:00:49.100> pick<00:00:49.640> at<00:00:49.850> it<00:00:49.970> that's<00:00:50.089> just<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.360> way

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
I didn't pick at it that's just the way

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.030 
I didn't pick at it that's just the way
it<00:00:50.540> came<00:00:50.600> but<00:00:51.379> they<00:00:51.739> all<00:00:51.830> have<00:00:52.010> unique

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
it came but they all have unique

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.700 
it came but they all have unique
stickers<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:52.940> it's<00:00:53.330> kind<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.540> cool<00:00:53.750> his<00:00:54.350> card

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
stickers so it's kind of cool his card

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.759 
stickers so it's kind of cool his card
it<00:00:55.519> is<00:00:55.670> horizontal<00:00:56.030> which<00:00:56.960> would<00:00:57.290> be<00:00:57.440> okay

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
it is horizontal which would be okay

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.649 
it is horizontal which would be okay
except<00:00:58.339> for<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.580> fact<00:00:58.790> that<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:59.030> can<00:00:59.150> only<00:00:59.360> go

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
except for the fact that it can only go

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.520 
except for the fact that it can only go
in<00:00:59.870> vertically<00:01:01.030> so<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:02.989> see<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.290> problem

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
in vertically so you see the problem

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.740 
in vertically so you see the problem
there<00:01:03.710> it's<00:01:04.309> not<00:01:04.760> gonna<00:01:04.970> not<00:01:05.420> gonna<00:01:05.570> look

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
there it's not gonna not gonna look

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.850 
there it's not gonna not gonna look
right<00:01:05.810> since<00:01:06.290> it's<00:01:06.440> supposed<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.740> be

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
right since it's supposed to be

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.160 
right since it's supposed to be
horizontal<00:01:07.159> does<00:01:08.090> have<00:01:08.299> part<00:01:08.570> of<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:08.720> Batcave

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
horizontal does have part of the Batcave

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.940 
horizontal does have part of the Batcave
in<00:01:09.500> there<00:01:10.450> but<00:01:11.450> you<00:01:12.020> know<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:12.590> can't<00:01:12.800> really

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
in there but you know you can't really

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.650 
in there but you know you can't really
use<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:13.250> as<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.490> Batcave<00:01:13.940> thing<00:01:14.210> unless<00:01:14.480> you

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
use it as a Batcave thing unless you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.620 
use it as a Batcave thing unless you
have<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:14.990> I<00:01:15.460> guess<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:16.640> could<00:01:16.820> stand<00:01:17.300> them<00:01:17.480> all

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
have it I guess you could stand them all

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.960 
have it I guess you could stand them all
up<00:01:17.840> backwards<00:01:18.440> and<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.580> can<00:01:19.700> look<00:01:19.820> at<00:01:19.910> the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
up backwards and so you can look at the

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.880 
up backwards and so you can look at the
Batcave<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.780> then<00:01:21.110> pose<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.530> figures<00:01:21.770> in

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
Batcave and then pose the figures in

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.520 
Batcave and then pose the figures in
front<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:22.220> them<00:01:22.340> I<00:01:22.520> don't<00:01:23.090> know<00:01:23.530> whatever

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
front of them I don't know whatever

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.100 
front of them I don't know whatever
collector<00:01:25.520> card<00:01:25.760> not<00:01:26.660> gonna<00:01:26.780> complain<00:01:27.050> about

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
collector card not gonna complain about

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.450 
collector card not gonna complain about
that<00:01:27.320> it's<00:01:27.620> a<00:01:27.680> bonus<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.100> figure<00:01:28.340> itself

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
that it's a bonus the figure itself

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.580 
that it's a bonus the figure itself
though<00:01:28.790> I<00:01:29.000> like<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.600> they<00:01:29.840> did<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.020> really<00:01:30.320> good

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
though I like it they did a really good

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.910 
though I like it they did a really good
job<00:01:30.650> with<00:01:30.890> all<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.220> question<00:01:31.640> marks<00:01:32.920> they

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
job with all the question marks they

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
job with all the question marks they
look<00:01:34.160> really<00:01:34.340> good<00:01:35.470> I<00:01:36.470> can't<00:01:37.430> tell<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:37.760> if<00:01:37.850> it

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
look really good I can't tell you if it

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.430 
look really good I can't tell you if it
goes<00:01:38.090> under<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.450> ab<00:01:38.570> crunch<00:01:38.600> because<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.320> ab

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
goes under the ab crunch because the ab

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.050 
goes under the ab crunch because the ab
crunch<00:01:39.470> doesn't<00:01:39.860> go<00:01:40.070> back<00:01:40.250> any<00:01:40.430> farther

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
crunch doesn't go back any farther

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.700 
crunch doesn't go back any farther
it<00:01:41.450> only<00:01:41.570> goes<00:01:41.780> forward<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.140> little<00:01:42.290> bit<00:01:42.410> so

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
it only goes forward a little bit so

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.880 
it only goes forward a little bit so
it's<00:01:43.610> pretty<00:01:43.910> limited<00:01:44.210> but<00:01:44.870> still<00:01:45.170> I<00:01:45.380> do<00:01:45.590> like

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
it's pretty limited but still I do like

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.500 
it's pretty limited but still I do like
this<00:01:46.070> figure<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.490> looks<00:01:46.670> really<00:01:46.910> good<00:01:47.030> could

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
this figure it looks really good could

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.700 
this figure it looks really good could
he<00:01:47.570> use<00:01:47.660> a<00:01:47.720> little<00:01:47.960> shading<00:01:48.200> here<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:48.560> there

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
he use a little shading here in there

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.170 
he use a little shading here in there
some<00:01:48.950> of<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.130> greens<00:01:49.370> don't<00:01:49.640> quite<00:01:49.940> match

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
some of the greens don't quite match

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.570 
some of the greens don't quite match
