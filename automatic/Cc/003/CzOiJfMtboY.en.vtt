remote which you can put on your wrist
you<00:01:29.730> can<00:01:29.940> see<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.300> recording<00:01:30.660> all<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.810> time

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
you can see it's recording all the time

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.850 
you can see it's recording all the time
I<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.350> probably<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I think that's probably one of the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.320 
I think that's probably one of the
coolest<00:01:31.980> things<00:01:32.400> about<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.730> camera<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
coolest things about this camera and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.640 
coolest things about this camera and
also<00:01:33.480> notice<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:33.960> got<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> screen<00:01:34.410> built-in

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
also notice it's got a screen built-in

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.200 
also notice it's got a screen built-in
that's<00:01:35.040> really<00:01:35.310> useful<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.880> made<00:01:36.090> of

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
that's really useful it's made of

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
that's really useful it's made of
Gorilla<00:01:36.300> Glass<00:01:36.600> which<00:01:36.870> means<00:01:37.050> it's<00:01:37.200> really

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
Gorilla Glass which means it's really

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.050 
Gorilla Glass which means it's really
durable<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.920> won't<00:01:38.010> anti<00:01:38.370> scratch<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.940> like

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
durable and won't anti scratch just like

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.750 
durable and won't anti scratch just like
your<00:01:39.210> mobile<00:01:39.600> phone<00:01:40.160> but<00:01:41.160> also<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.490> means<00:01:41.580> you

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
your mobile phone but also it means you

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.850 
your mobile phone but also it means you
can<00:01:41.910> review<00:01:42.210> footage<00:01:42.480> set<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.290> your<00:01:43.440> shot<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
can review footage set up your shot and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.290 
can review footage set up your shot and
also<00:01:44.100> change<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> menu<00:01:44.730> options<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
also change the menu options on the

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.090 
also change the menu options on the
camera<00:01:45.630> which<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.780> something<00:01:46.050> on<00:01:46.350> many<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
camera which is something on many of the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.740 
camera which is something on many of the
other<00:01:47.250> cameras<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.640> sell<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.330> can<00:01:48.480> be<00:01:48.540> quite

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
other cameras we sell it can be quite

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.120 
other cameras we sell it can be quite
difficult<00:01:48.960> thing<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.800> think<00:01:49.890> that's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
difficult thing to do so I think that's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.320 
difficult thing to do so I think that's
why<00:01:50.250> one<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> reason<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.880> really<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.150> this

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
why one of the reason I really like this

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.030 
why one of the reason I really like this
camera<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.900> battery<00:01:52.260> life<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.890> is

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
camera the battery life on this one is

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.710 
camera the battery life on this one is
three<00:01:53.310> hours<00:01:53.520> which<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.000> quite<00:01:54.210> long<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
three hours which is quite long for the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.230 
three hours which is quite long for the
type<00:01:54.900> of<00:01:54.930> camera<00:01:55.230> that<00:01:55.410> is<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.640> also<00:01:57.090> more

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
type of camera that is and also more

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.430 
type of camera that is and also more
than<00:01:57.300> enough<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.750> most<00:01:57.840> people<00:01:57.990> have

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
than enough for most people have

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.010 
than enough for most people have
continuous<00:01:59.430> video<00:01:59.700> take<00:02:00.150> video<00:02:00.630> footage

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
continuous video take video footage

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.070 
continuous video take video footage
which<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.320> good<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.880> takes<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.240> micro<00:02:03.510> SD<00:02:03.810> card

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
which is good it takes a micro SD card

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.660 
which is good it takes a micro SD card
which<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.680> pretty<00:02:04.800> widely<00:02:05.070> available<00:02:05.280> these
