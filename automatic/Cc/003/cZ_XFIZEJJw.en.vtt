that I'm considering you've literally

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.790 
that I'm considering you've literally
have<00:02:56.360> five<00:02:56.600> pieces<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.200> start<00:02:57.380> on<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.710> you

have five pieces to start on that you

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.400 
have five pieces to start on that you
chose<00:02:58.160> independently<00:02:58.910> from<00:02:59.000> one<00:02:59.090> another<00:02:59.410> as

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
chose independently from one another as

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.470 
chose independently from one another as
a<00:03:00.470> whole<00:03:00.830> look<00:03:01.280> it's<00:03:01.580> actually<00:03:01.970> not<00:03:02.120> looking

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
a whole look it's actually not looking

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.510 
a whole look it's actually not looking
too<00:03:02.840> bad<00:03:03.140> as<00:03:03.650> I<00:03:03.680> thought<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.070> would<00:03:04.160> look<00:03:04.310> worse

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520

too bad as I thought it would look worse
I<00:03:04.820> did<00:03:05.210> too<00:03:05.420> i<00:03:05.660> think<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:07.100> coat<00:03:07.460> with<00:03:07.790> the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
I did too i think that the coat with the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.640 
I did too i think that the coat with the
top<00:03:08.180> didn't<00:03:08.480> white<00:03:08.600> top<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:09.110> black<00:03:09.290> skirt

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
top didn't white top of the black skirt

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.010 
top didn't white top of the black skirt

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.149 
decisions I mean this is not everyone
would<00:05:10.570> pick<00:05:10.780> cause<00:05:10.900> it's<00:05:10.990> quite<00:05:11.229> out<00:05:11.740> there<00:05:12.010> I

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
would pick cause it's quite out there I

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.460 
would pick cause it's quite out there I
suppose<00:05:12.490> it<00:05:12.669> is<00:05:12.789> quite<00:05:13.120> in<00:05:13.630> your<00:05:13.810> face<00:05:13.990> it<00:05:14.320> was

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
suppose it is quite in your face it was

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.770 
suppose it is quite in your face it was
fine<00:05:14.650> your<00:05:14.800> face<00:05:14.949> I<00:05:15.300> can<00:05:16.300> tell<00:05:16.539> from<00:05:16.690> your

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
fine your face I can tell from your

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.570 
fine your face I can tell from your
little<00:05:17.050> cheeky<00:05:17.770> place<00:05:17.949> that<00:05:18.159> you<00:05:18.220> love<00:05:18.400> this

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
little cheeky place that you love this

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.339 
little cheeky place that you love this
one<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:19.090> just<00:05:19.510> think<00:05:19.659> it's<00:05:19.780> really<00:05:19.840> cute<00:05:20.080> and

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
one I just think it's really cute and

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.080 
one I just think it's really cute and
it's<00:05:20.800> not<00:05:20.979> something<00:05:21.130> that<00:05:21.370> I<00:05:21.550> think<00:05:21.639> I'd<00:05:21.940> go

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
it's not something that I think I'd go

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.260 
it's not something that I think I'd go
for<00:05:22.330> in<00:05:22.659> a<00:05:23.380> shop<00:05:23.650> if<00:05:23.830> it<00:05:23.949> was<00:05:24.039> there<00:05:24.270> definitely

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
for in a shop if it was there definitely

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.200 
for in a shop if it was there definitely
not<00:05:25.590> let<00:05:26.590> these<00:05:26.889> everyday<00:05:27.639> kind<00:05:27.909> of<00:05:28.030> clothes

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
not let these everyday kind of clothes

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.490 
not let these everyday kind of clothes
and<00:05:28.449> I<00:05:28.479> think<00:05:28.630> that's<00:05:28.750> why<00:05:28.900> I<00:05:28.930> went<00:05:29.110> for<00:05:29.349> it

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
and I think that's why I went for it

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.110 
and I think that's why I went for it
which<00:05:29.650> I<00:05:29.740> like<00:05:29.889> I<00:05:30.099> showed<00:05:30.460> that<00:05:30.669> but<00:05:31.000> it's

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
which I like I showed that but it's

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.249 
which I like I showed that but it's
