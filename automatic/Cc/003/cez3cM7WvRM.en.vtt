right<00:02:38.550> here<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:39.239> behind<00:02:39.660> this

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
right here in behind this

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.280 
right here in behind this
here's<00:02:40.739> your<00:02:41.040> fuse<00:02:41.310> right<00:02:41.849> here<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.330> these

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
here's your fuse right here and these

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.979 
here's your fuse right here and these
two<00:02:43.349> wires<00:02:43.950> are<00:02:44.370> original<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.360> dishwasher

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
two wires are original to the dishwasher

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.340 
two wires are original to the dishwasher
some<00:02:46.650> units<00:02:47.040> are<00:02:47.220> wired<00:02:47.730> directly<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
some units are wired directly to the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.800 
some units are wired directly to the
fuse<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.069> can't<00:02:50.340> replace<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.810> without

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
fuse so you can't replace it without

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.780 
fuse so you can't replace it without
cutting<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.410> wire<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.920> that's<00:02:53.400> why<00:02:53.640> they

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
cutting the wire and that's why they

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.120 
cutting the wire and that's why they
provide<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:55.260> if<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.440> have<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.739> cut<00:02:55.950> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
provide this so if you have to cut the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.520 
provide this so if you have to cut the
wire<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:57.090> two<00:02:57.330> cut<00:02:57.630> ends<00:02:58.019> in<00:02:58.200> your<00:02:58.350> dishwasher

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
wire the two cut ends in your dishwasher

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.880 
wire the two cut ends in your dishwasher
get<00:02:59.069> placed<00:02:59.340> inside<00:02:59.819> here<00:03:00.239> screw<00:03:01.080> down<00:03:01.290> tight

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
get placed inside here screw down tight

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.940 
get placed inside here screw down tight
that<00:03:02.489> gives<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.940> two<00:03:03.209> plugs<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:04.470> plug<00:03:04.709> into

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
that gives you two plugs to plug into

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.390 
that gives you two plugs to plug into
your<00:03:05.220> new<00:03:05.400> fuse<00:03:05.900> when<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.019> install<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:08.220> my

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
your new fuse when you install it in my

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.120 
your new fuse when you install it in my
case<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.120> original<00:03:09.540> one<00:03:09.660> had<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.110> fuse<00:03:10.380> on

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
case the original one had the fuse on

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.370 
case the original one had the fuse on
the<00:03:11.489> original<00:03:11.880> one<00:03:12.450> had<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.750> plugs<00:03:13.019> already

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
the original one had the plugs already

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.100 
the original one had the plugs already
available<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.400> didn't<00:03:14.580> have<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.760> put<00:03:14.940> that

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
available so I didn't have to put that

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.280 
available so I didn't have to put that
piece<00:03:16.110> in<00:03:17.239> again<00:03:18.239> this<00:03:18.390> is<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.690> fuse<00:03:18.930> itself

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
piece in again this is the fuse itself

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.550 
piece in again this is the fuse itself
right<00:03:19.470> here<00:03:20.359> it's<00:03:21.359> hard<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.570> see<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.079> there<00:03:22.350> is

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
right here it's hard to see but there is

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.770 
right here it's hard to see but there is
a<00:03:22.859> little<00:03:23.609> lip<00:03:23.790> right<00:03:24.000> here<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.600> that

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780

a little lip right here and that
actually<00:03:25.170> clips<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.220> here<00:03:26.250> locks<00:03:27.209> in<00:03:27.450> place

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
actually clips in here locks in place

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.080 
actually clips in here locks in place

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
hide something to replace this probably

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.449

off<00:04:35.379> the<00:04:35.919> original<00:04:36.009> fuse<00:04:36.729> it<00:04:37.180> was<00:04:37.300> inside

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
off the original fuse it was inside

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.050 
off the original fuse it was inside
there<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:38.169> just<00:04:38.800> put<00:04:38.949> a<00:04:38.979> jumper<00:04:39.550> wire<00:04:39.699> across

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
there I just put a jumper wire across

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.510 
there I just put a jumper wire across
here<00:04:40.509> and<00:04:40.629> here<00:04:40.960> plug<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.830> dishwasher<00:04:42.430> in

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520

just<00:04:42.759> for<00:04:42.909> a<00:04:42.940> second<00:04:43.360> all<00:04:43.509> the<00:04:43.990> lights<00:04:44.139> came<00:04:44.259> on

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
just for a second all the lights came on

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.520 
just for a second all the lights came on
and<00:04:44.919> so<00:04:45.729> I<00:04:45.759> knew<00:04:45.940> it<00:04:46.060> was<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.210> fuse<00:04:46.479> because<00:04:46.900> when

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
and so I knew it was a fuse because when

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.719 
and so I knew it was a fuse because when
this<00:04:47.650> was<00:04:47.770> plugged<00:04:48.009> in<00:04:48.129> the<00:04:48.220> fuse<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.520> plug

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
this was plugged in the fuse to plug

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.670

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
all so if you put a wire between these

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.730 
all so if you put a wire between these
two<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:55.150> just<00:04:55.210> don't<00:04:55.569> leave<00:04:55.720> it<00:04:55.870> obviously<00:04:56.560> on
