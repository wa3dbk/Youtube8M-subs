00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.660 
areas with the deals I've left the
e-track<00:00:19.500> at<00:00:19.650> home<00:00:19.830> because<00:00:20.070> I'm<00:00:20.310> just<00:00:20.520> going

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
to concentrate it with the small coil in

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.550 
to concentrate it with the small coil in
the<00:00:22.980> very<00:00:23.369> trashy<00:00:23.760> areas<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.420> hopefully<00:00:25.020> pick

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
the very trashy areas and hopefully pick

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.090 
the very trashy areas and hopefully pick
something<00:00:25.949> decent<00:00:26.160> out<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:27.680> did<00:00:28.680> manage<00:00:28.980> to

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
something decent out I did manage to

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.609 
something decent out I did manage to
find<00:00:29.369> two<00:00:29.970> silver<00:00:30.660> coins<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.140> last<00:00:31.350> time<00:00:31.500> I

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
find two silver coins the last time I

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.340 
find two silver coins the last time I
was<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.460> was<00:00:32.640> using<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> huge<00:00:33.449> coil

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
was up and that was using the huge coil

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.070 
was up and that was using the huge coil
on<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.400> eight-track<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.360> think<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
on the eight-track so I think with a

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.410 
on the eight-track so I think with a
coil<00:00:37.350> half<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.860> size<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.400> a<00:00:38.879> slightly<00:00:39.150> more

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
coil half the size and a slightly more

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.960 
coil half the size and a slightly more
responsive<00:00:40.080> machine<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.710> should<00:00:41.519> do<00:00:41.699> quite

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
responsive machine I should do quite

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.210 
responsive machine I should do quite
well<00:00:42.000> hopefully<00:00:42.839> although<00:00:43.769> I've<00:00:43.860> only<00:00:43.979> got

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
well hopefully although I've only got

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.969 
well hopefully although I've only got
about<00:00:44.309> two<00:00:44.820> hours<00:00:44.850> today<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:46.080> we<00:00:46.470> shall<00:00:46.650> see

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:46.979 
about two hours today so we shall see

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.969 
about two hours today so we shall see
this<00:00:47.640> was<00:00:47.790> reading<00:00:48.150> as<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.269> nice<00:00:48.570> sprightly<00:00:49.290> 76

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:49.979 
this was reading as a nice sprightly 76

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.420 
this was reading as a nice sprightly 76
on<00:00:50.339> the<00:00:50.909> dose<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.530> looks<00:00:52.799> like<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.220> a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
on the dose and it looks like it's a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.549 
on the dose and it looks like it's a
button<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.030> pretty<00:00:54.750> good<00:00:54.839> condition<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.979> is

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
button in pretty good condition what is

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.410 
button in pretty good condition what is
that's<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.739> cracking<00:00:59.309> condition<00:00:59.909> look<00:01:00.269> at

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
that's in cracking condition look at

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.680 
that's in cracking condition look at
that<00:01:01.159> EFS<00:01:02.159> which<00:01:02.610> I<00:01:02.729> believe<00:01:03.030> stands<00:01:03.449> for

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that EFS which I believe stands for

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.100 
that EFS which I believe stands for
auxiliary<00:01:04.199> fire<00:01:04.769> service<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.930> sometimes<00:01:06.930> find

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
auxiliary fire service I sometimes find

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.039 
auxiliary fire service I sometimes find
them<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.680> NFS<00:01:08.670> which<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.390> national

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
them up here with NFS which is national

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.849 
them up here with NFS which is national
fire<00:01:10.259> service<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:10.920> that's<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.969> very<00:01:12.649> you<00:01:13.649> think

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:13.859 
fire service so that's a very you think

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:15.679 
fire service so that's a very you think
that<00:01:13.979> was<00:01:14.100> pretty<00:01:14.250> much<00:01:14.460> knew<00:01:14.759> pollow<00:01:15.329> shut<00:01:15.570> up

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that was pretty much knew pollow shut up

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.730 
that was pretty much knew pollow shut up
and<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.869> could<00:01:15.960> go<00:01:16.079> back<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.439> jacket

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and it could go back in a jacket

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.289 
and it could go back in a jacket
excellent<00:01:19.009> this<00:01:20.009> one<00:01:20.189> strangely<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:20.969> reading

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
excellent this one strangely was reading

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.749 
excellent this one strangely was reading
93<00:01:22.079> and<00:01:22.829> it<00:01:23.100> looks<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.340> another<00:01:23.609> button

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
93 and it looks like another button

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.370 
93 and it looks like another button
dears<00:01:26.759> was<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.390> picking<00:01:27.719> the<00:01:27.840> signals<00:01:28.200> out

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
dears was really picking the signals out

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.480 
dears was really picking the signals out
very<00:01:28.679> well<00:01:29.009> from<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> trash<00:01:31.039> this<00:01:32.039> one<00:01:32.219> is<00:01:32.369> in

that's<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.340> pretty<00:02:57.489> good<00:02:57.640> Nick<00:02:57.910> as<00:02:58.030> well<00:02:59.370> looks

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
that's in pretty good Nick as well looks

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.330 
that's in pretty good Nick as well looks
like<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.580> first<00:03:00.910> pre-decimal<00:03:01.450> coin<00:03:02.220> seems<00:03:03.220> to

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
like the first pre-decimal coin seems to

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.759 
like the first pre-decimal coin seems to
be<00:03:03.430> an<00:03:03.519> old<00:03:03.640> penny<00:03:03.989> it's<00:03:04.989> approximately<00:03:05.560> eight

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
be an old penny it's approximately eight

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.710 
be an old penny it's approximately eight
inches<00:03:06.099> deep<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.700> that<00:03:07.120> was<00:03:07.269> a<00:03:07.299> reasonable

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
inches deep so that was a reasonable

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.740 
inches deep so that was a reasonable
depth<00:03:08.910> actually<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.030> maybe<00:03:10.239> two<00:03:10.480> there

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
depth actually the maybe two there

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.849 
depth actually the maybe two there
there's<00:03:12.090> one<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:14.019> looks<00:03:14.200> like<00:03:14.410> another<00:03:14.680> one

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
there's one that looks like another one

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:26.500 
there's one that looks like another one
in<00:03:14.980> there

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.490 

could<00:03:27.510> have<00:03:27.600> sworn<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.840> was<00:03:27.960> another<00:03:28.200> one<00:03:28.380> in

like another pre-decimal it is what in
good<00:03:44.730> condition<00:03:45.150> wants<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.990> be<00:03:46.080> there<00:03:46.170> was

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
good condition wants to be there was

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.130 
good condition wants to be there was
only<00:03:46.440> nineteen<00:03:46.860> fifty-seven<00:03:47.990> after<00:03:48.990> live

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
only nineteen fifty-seven after live
