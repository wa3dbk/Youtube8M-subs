00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.219 

now<00:00:03.740> as<00:00:03.950> you<00:00:04.130> can<00:00:04.279> see<00:00:04.340> here<00:00:04.850> I've<00:00:05.809> made<00:00:06.200> a

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:06.229 
now as you can see here I've made a

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:14.169 
now as you can see here I've made a
makeshift<00:00:07.130> and<00:00:07.609> to<00:00:08.300> hold<00:00:09.849> the<00:00:10.849> pendant<00:00:11.299> I<00:00:13.179> have

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
makeshift and to hold the pendant I have

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.320 
makeshift and to hold the pendant I have
a<00:00:14.209> third<00:00:14.509> arm<00:00:14.719> used<00:00:15.019> here<00:00:15.499> and<00:00:15.679> I've<00:00:16.670> thread<00:00:17.060> it

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
a third arm used here and I've thread it

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.570 
a third arm used here and I've thread it
back<00:00:17.360> slightly<00:00:17.869> so<00:00:18.710> that<00:00:18.740> you<00:00:18.980> see<00:00:19.130> that<00:00:19.310> it

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
back slightly so that you see that it

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.370 
back slightly so that you see that it
holds<00:00:19.970> it<00:00:20.210> but<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:20.420> pendant<00:00:20.779> actually<00:00:20.929> has<00:00:21.349> a

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
holds it but the pendant actually has a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.500 
holds it but the pendant actually has a
little<00:00:21.529> plain<00:00:22.340> other<00:00:22.580> words<00:00:22.760> gravity<00:00:23.300> will

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
little plain other words gravity will

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.089 
little plain other words gravity will
want<00:00:23.689> to<00:00:23.810> force<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.199> pin<00:00:24.800> down<00:00:25.240> the<00:00:26.240> loop<00:00:26.449> down

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
want to force the pin down the loop down

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.529 
want to force the pin down the loop down
what<00:00:28.099> I'm<00:00:28.189> going<00:00:28.429> to<00:00:28.460> do<00:00:28.640> is<00:00:28.789> I'll<00:00:28.970> move<00:00:29.210> I'm

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
what I'm going to do is I'll move I'm

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:38.140 
what I'm going to do is I'll move I'm
going<00:00:30.019> to<00:00:31.750> flux<00:00:35.620> this<00:00:36.620> area<00:00:36.980> here<00:00:37.340> and<00:00:37.490> all

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
going to flux this area here and all

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.520 
going to flux this area here and all
around<00:00:38.390> here<00:00:38.600> at<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.720> bottom<00:00:38.990> of<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.140> pendant

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
around here at the bottom of the pendant

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.820 
around here at the bottom of the pendant
take<00:00:40.340> one<00:00:40.640> large<00:00:40.940> piece<00:00:41.390> of<00:00:41.660> solder<00:00:41.930> put<00:00:42.710> it

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
take one large piece of solder put it

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.060 
take one large piece of solder put it
here<00:00:43.070> about<00:00:43.400> an<00:00:43.520> eighth<00:00:43.610> of<00:00:43.760> an<00:00:43.880> inch<00:00:43.940> x<00:00:44.180> 16

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
here about an eighth of an inch x 16

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.680 
here about an eighth of an inch x 16
when<00:00:46.070> I<00:00:46.100> put<00:00:46.400> heat<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.820> this<00:00:46.970> I'm<00:00:47.240> going<00:00:47.540> to

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
when I put heat to this I'm going to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.440 
when I put heat to this I'm going to
heat<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.050> main<00:00:48.260> part<00:00:48.560> of<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:48.740> plug<00:00:48.980> first<00:00:49.450> and

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
heat the main part of the plug first and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.040 
heat the main part of the plug first and
as<00:00:50.570> it<00:00:50.780> becomes<00:00:51.290> hot<00:00:52.510> then<00:00:53.510> I'll<00:00:53.630> go<00:00:53.810> ahead<00:00:53.900> and

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
as it becomes hot then I'll go ahead and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.790 
as it becomes hot then I'll go ahead and
start<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.410> heat<00:00:54.560> this<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.950> idea<00:00:55.370> is<00:00:55.580> to<00:00:55.850> heat

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
start to heat this the idea is to heat

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.340 
start to heat this the idea is to heat
the<00:00:57.800> area<00:00:58.250> so<00:00:58.520> that<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:59.000> solder<00:00:59.810> will<00:01:00.110> flow

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
the area so that the solder will flow

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.340 
the area so that the solder will flow
onto<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:01.130> loop<00:01:01.310> first<00:01:01.870> as<00:01:02.870> soon<00:01:03.050> as<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:03.320> does

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
onto the loop first as soon as it does

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.859 
onto the loop first as soon as it does
sometimes<00:01:03.950> it<00:01:04.189> evaporates<00:01:04.879> I'll<00:01:05.089> pull<00:01:05.719> the

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
sometimes it evaporates I'll pull the

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.139 
sometimes it evaporates I'll pull the
heat<00:01:06.020> down<00:01:06.429> onto<00:01:07.429> the<00:01:07.549> main<00:01:07.700> part<00:01:08.000> of<00:01:08.030> the

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
heat down onto the main part of the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.749 
heat down onto the main part of the
pendant<00:01:08.539> and<00:01:08.740> then<00:01:09.740> it<00:01:09.920> will<00:01:10.009> actually<00:01:10.189> draw

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
pendant and then it will actually draw

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.520 
pendant and then it will actually draw
the<00:01:10.820> heat<00:01:11.299> it<00:01:11.630> will<00:01:11.780> actually<00:01:11.929> draw<00:01:12.469> the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
the heat it will actually draw the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.919 
the heat it will actually draw the
slaughter<00:01:13.039> down<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:14.149> once<00:01:14.359> I've<00:01:14.539> got<00:01:14.570> the

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
slaughter down and once I've got the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.109 
slaughter down and once I've got the
solder<00:01:15.200> joint<00:01:15.649> Nate<00:01:15.920> onto<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.429> main<00:01:16.609> pendant

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
solder joint Nate onto the main pendant

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.749 
solder joint Nate onto the main pendant
I'll<00:01:17.509> remove<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.170> heat<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:19.340> joint<00:01:19.640> will

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
I'll remove the heat and the joint will

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.660 
I'll remove the heat and the joint will
be<00:01:19.789> made<00:01:23.740> what<00:01:24.740> I'm<00:01:24.859> looking<00:01:25.159> for<00:01:25.399> is<00:01:25.549> that

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
be made what I'm looking for is that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.179 
be made what I'm looking for is that
everything<00:01:25.939> is<00:01:26.210> lined<00:01:26.479> up<00:01:26.719> nice<00:01:27.469> and<00:01:27.499> square

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.749 

this<00:01:31.189> here<00:01:31.399> being<00:01:31.640> in<00:01:31.819> the<00:01:31.909> center<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:33.759> so

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
this here being in the center and so

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.309 
this here being in the center and so
that<00:01:34.909> when<00:01:35.030> I<00:01:35.060> except<00:01:35.420> when<00:01:35.569> I<00:01:35.630> pull<00:01:35.929> this<00:01:36.079> back

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
that when I except when I pull this back

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.929 
that when I except when I pull this back
and<00:01:36.530> sets<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.859> on<00:01:36.950> there<00:01:37.189> that<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.579> pendant

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
and sets it on there that the pendant

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.809 
and sets it on there that the pendant
will<00:01:38.060> be<00:01:38.210> basically<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:40.069> I<00:01:40.100> pull<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:40.640> on

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
will be basically so that I pull this on

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.029 
will be basically so that I pull this on
there<00:01:41.090> i<00:01:41.119> set<00:01:41.359> it<00:01:41.390> on<00:01:41.600> there<00:01:41.780> that<00:01:41.859> the<00:01:42.859> two

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
there i set it on there that the two

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.389 
there i set it on there that the two
parts<00:01:43.369> will<00:01:43.490> come<00:01:43.640> together<00:01:45.009> this<00:01:46.009> and

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
parts will come together this and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.249 
parts will come together this and
orientation<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.359> the<00:01:47.389> main<00:01:47.659> part<00:01:48.020> will<00:01:48.229> be

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
orientation to the main part will be

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.569 
orientation to the main part will be
correct<00:01:50.499> the<00:01:51.499> next<00:01:51.770> thing<00:01:51.859> to<00:01:52.009> do<00:01:52.159> is<00:01:52.189> to<00:01:52.340> go

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
correct the next thing to do is to go

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.209 
correct the next thing to do is to go
ahead<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:52.939> put<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.179> flux<00:01:53.420> on<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:53.749> and<00:01:54.100> put<00:01:55.100> the

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
ahead and put the flux on it and put the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:03.520 
ahead and put the flux on it and put the
heat<00:01:55.369> to<00:01:55.399> it

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.190 

now<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.100> have<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.490> piece<00:02:04.700> ready<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:05.090> go<00:02:05.240> look

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
now I have the piece ready to go look

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.390 
now I have the piece ready to go look
the<00:02:06.350> line<00:02:06.530> with<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:06.799> way<00:02:08.319> over<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.410> top<00:02:12.400> from

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
the line with this way over the top from

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.850 
the line with this way over the top from
behind<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.660> i<00:02:14.720> have<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.080> set<00:02:15.110> just<00:02:15.530> like<00:02:15.650> I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
behind and i have it set just like I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.300 
behind and i have it set just like I
want<00:02:16.569> now<00:02:17.569> what<00:02:17.810> I'll<00:02:17.930> do<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.319> on<00:02:18.470> this<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:19.130> can

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
want now what I'll do is on this you can

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.790 
want now what I'll do is on this you can
leave<00:02:19.520> this<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.910> dry<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:21.140> will<00:02:21.440> probably<00:02:21.650> take

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
leave this to dry it will probably take

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.699 
leave this to dry it will probably take
about<00:02:22.069> 24<00:02:22.640> hours<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:23.200> faster<00:02:24.200> way<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.350> do<00:02:24.590> it

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
about 24 hours a faster way to do it

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.610 
about 24 hours a faster way to do it
though<00:02:24.890> would<00:02:25.790> be<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.060> take<00:02:26.239> any<00:02:26.600> old<00:02:26.900> hair

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
though would be to take any old hair

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.510 
though would be to take any old hair
dryer<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.100> have<00:02:28.280> laying<00:02:28.489> around<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:29.810> on<00:02:33.520> and

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
dryer you have laying around it on and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.390 
dryer you have laying around it on and
why<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:34.940> thing<00:02:35.390> yeah

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
why the thing yeah

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.780 
why the thing yeah
your<00:02:37.000> phone<00:02:37.209> this<00:02:37.420> will<00:02:37.599> take<00:02:38.400> 15-20<00:02:39.400> seconds

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
your phone this will take 15-20 seconds

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.199 
your phone this will take 15-20 seconds
and<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.629> will<00:02:40.750> actually<00:02:41.819> completely<00:02:42.819> dry<00:02:43.150> the

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
and it will actually completely dry the

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.750 
and it will actually completely dry the
thing<00:02:43.540> out<00:02:43.689> you<00:02:43.930> want<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.260> nice<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.860> dry<00:02:45.069> this

thing out you want it nice and dry this

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.140 
thing out you want it nice and dry this

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
you want it completely dry not having

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.300 
you want it completely dry not having
the<00:02:54.909> flux<00:02:55.150> completely<00:02:55.689> dry<00:02:55.959> will<00:02:56.319> allow<00:02:57.250> the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
the flux completely dry will allow the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.699 
the flux completely dry will allow the
water<00:02:57.700> still<00:02:58.510> left<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.900> flux<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.470> turn

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
water still left in the flux to turn

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.210 
water still left in the flux to turn
into<00:02:59.980> steam<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:01.019> steam<00:03:02.189> evaporating<00:03:03.189> from

underneath the solder or any part here

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.009 
underneath the solder or any part here
will<00:03:05.769> blow<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.159> thing<00:03:06.340> apart<00:03:06.459> so<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.540> must

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
will blow the thing apart so you must

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.020 
will blow the thing apart so you must
have<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.470> slaughter<00:03:08.769> completely<00:03:09.340> dry<00:03:09.609> prior

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
have this slaughter completely dry prior

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.330 
have this slaughter completely dry prior
to<00:03:10.329> proceeding<00:03:10.569> and<00:03:11.079> now<00:03:11.980> we're<00:03:12.099> going<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.250> go

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
to proceeding and now we're going to go

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.199 
to proceeding and now we're going to go
ahead<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.639> dry<00:03:13.629> this<00:03:13.840> completely<00:03:14.200> up<00:03:18.209> and

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
ahead and dry this completely up and

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.089 
ahead and dry this completely up and
that's<00:03:20.109> good<00:03:22.500> okay<00:03:23.500> we're<00:03:23.709> back<00:03:23.739> at<00:03:24.040> our

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
that's good okay we're back at our

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.399 
that's good okay we're back at our
oxy-acetylene<00:03:24.519> tanks<00:03:25.180> let<00:03:26.019> me<00:03:26.079> go<00:03:26.230> ahead<00:03:26.319> and

oxy-acetylene tanks let me go ahead and

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.309 
oxy-acetylene tanks let me go ahead and
turn<00:03:26.620> them<00:03:26.769> on<00:03:27.780> one<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.930> things<00:03:29.049> you<00:03:29.170> might

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
turn them on one of the things you might

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.720 
turn them on one of the things you might
want<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.620> know<00:03:29.680> about<00:03:29.859> actually<00:03:30.400> suddenly

want to know about actually suddenly

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.970 
want to know about actually suddenly
taxes<00:03:31.239> when<00:03:32.139> you<00:03:32.170> turn<00:03:32.470> them<00:03:32.590> on<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.829> don't

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
taxes when you turn them on you don't

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.500 
taxes when you turn them on you don't
need<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.129> turn<00:03:33.310> them<00:03:33.430> on<00:03:33.489> all<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.760> way<00:03:34.000> there's

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
need to turn them on all the way there's

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.020 
need to turn them on all the way there's
ever<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.870> problem<00:03:35.430> you'll<00:03:36.430> want<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.939> ability

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
ever a problem you'll want the ability

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.369 
ever a problem you'll want the ability
to<00:03:38.019> turn<00:03:38.439> them<00:03:38.620> off<00:03:38.769> right<00:03:38.950> away<00:03:39.099> and<00:03:40.169> that<00:03:41.169> way

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
to turn them off right away and that way

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:42.780 
to turn them off right away and that way
if<00:03:41.530> they're<00:03:41.709> on<00:03:41.739> just<00:03:42.129> a<00:03:42.220> little<00:03:42.250> bit<00:03:42.579> it

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
if they're on just a little bit it

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.770 
if they're on just a little bit it
doesn't<00:03:43.090> take<00:03:43.209> much<00:03:43.389> to<00:03:43.449> set<00:03:43.780> them<00:03:43.900> back<00:03:44.049> off

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.280 

as<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:50.019> can<00:03:50.139> see<00:03:50.349> here<00:03:50.590> I'm<00:03:50.739> running<00:03:52.019> five<00:03:53.019> and

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
as you can see here I'm running five and

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.699 
as you can see here I'm running five and
twenty<00:03:53.620> one<00:03:54.579> actual<00:03:55.090> flow<00:03:55.449> is<00:03:56.139> going<00:03:56.530> through

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
twenty one actual flow is going through

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.009 
twenty one actual flow is going through
the<00:03:56.769> lines<00:03:56.949> these<00:03:57.220> pressures<00:03:57.970> will<00:03:58.120> drop<00:03:58.389> it

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
the lines these pressures will drop it

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.460 
the lines these pressures will drop it
will<00:03:59.139> end<00:03:59.199> up<00:03:59.319> being<00:03:59.349> about<00:03:59.680> two<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.549> ten

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
will end up being about two and ten

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.949 
will end up being about two and ten
generally<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:02.590> want<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:02.859> run<00:04:03.269> 125<00:04:04.269> for<00:04:04.629> oxy

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
generally you want to run 125 for oxy

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.920 
generally you want to run 125 for oxy
acetylene<00:04:05.310> five<00:04:06.310> part<00:04:06.639> oxygen<00:04:06.909> for<00:04:07.449> one<00:04:07.599> part
