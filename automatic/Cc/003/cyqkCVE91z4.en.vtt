nitrogen sort of my personal favorite
this<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.549> factor<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.390> under<00:01:43.200> farmers

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
this is the factor that is under farmers

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.219 
this is the factor that is under farmers
most<00:01:43.979> control<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.060> isn't<00:01:45.479> exactly<00:01:45.600> under
