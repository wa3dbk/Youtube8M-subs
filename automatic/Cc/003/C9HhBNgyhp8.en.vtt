00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.370
 hello millions of users to this act disappointed I bring them another one of the 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.230
 Friday after a long time that there was not a Friday p this opening 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.700
 commanded by mile sea there firm percent and will be 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.720
 percent on gymnastics on the physical 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.560
 he will help us to have a routine of the day to customers the opportunity to go 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.320
 to the gym 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.520
 so I want to show you that it's been a long time since the pastor 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.280
 I knew this and this is my interest to show it 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.230
 here he will not go for that first oriental where decision for the part 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.589
 specific body 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.019
 eaton inaler arms finally all body parts by one hundred percent 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:45.690
 let's see the world below first 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.530
 of those exercises lolo m overturned 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.270
 this I know that if usca has done peking 8 and 11 are the routines and have 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.400
 several routines and for beginners to 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.090
 per cent those who have 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.270
 in time for good those who are those who are those who practice goal 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.740
 you have to attend these for baseball players for raffle players 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.600
 in swimming for player left who end 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.060
 yesterday routine routine of 30 minutes 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.909
 and this is how the other of the achievements works, which is where the pri and how can 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.210
 be like a calendar of your routine record projects 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.280
 percent finally all things 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.360
 and love we have him control your meals can control the neck raised 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.860
 or lowered of weight of here in fact it can be more of a little it is necessary to say that 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.120
 many people and with a country with a percent mortgage keep me routines 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.010
 percent then I do not know combines the routines 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.350
 and so let's see is the exercises for example of abs 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.970
 and here there are several erosions 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.380
 p 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.990
 many many neighbors works dominates them dismissed for example I want selection 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.780
 any 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.300
 good to select by a hundred these are like side lizards 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.020
 and then it has an image that Enzo Perez does not understand the pack and it could rain 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.020
 video to see how they are correctly made 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.759
 I live here there is a person who makes them 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:19.989
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.900
 and so I see what my position is that I have to take and the kobe position 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.620
 correct that I have to do when doing the percent exercise and that's how 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.450
 works percent lutz after practically all the swan seems 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.840
 that everything will be ceded updating everything if you have video 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.359
 of them the good official for example that we oppose 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.679
 is it so 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:45.499
 is for example does not have video but we will be parents sideways for a hundred 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.489
 for example is this video site 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.729
 from here is the video 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.089
 and finally this is how you are learning to do exercises 1 non ten who with 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.989
 the images and thus your routines can be for example a routine does not consist 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.549
 in I do not know what a routine for opposite insists before 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:12.049
 and here measures what you have to do 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.540
 percent and says it's tied 10 to 15 minutes 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.149
 the leader of our company with 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:22.129
 between a little of cardio leo exercises in which we are since then 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.129
 the one that tells you a repeat 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.480
 p once of 12 times is to say that two fingers to lift this bar for example 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.149
 Unequal is the video 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:35.689
 and will provide it 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.249
 very simple she is and how it works in I like it very much 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.950
 this peace and that to designate Italian there is a sector in circulation 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.259
 you did not know how to impose your routine and here are all 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:52.589
 the project was the one that Friday is the quid months of coast in which this 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:54.339
 percent team is 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:58.209
 they know that if they want to swat on Friday they appear next lives 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.070
 the names 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.210
 in it the comments for which they have lean tricks that will be made 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.700
 interesting easy to watch because up here humane down their offspring in the 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.270
 button up and well thank you
