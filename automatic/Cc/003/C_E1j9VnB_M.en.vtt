to go for those and then you've got at

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.900 
to go for those and then you've got at
the<00:03:29.090> back<00:03:29.330> let's<00:03:30.260> see<00:03:30.560> if<00:03:30.769> I<00:03:30.980> skip<00:03:31.459> too<00:03:31.700> much

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
the back let's see if I skip too much

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.030 
the back let's see if I skip too much
what<00:03:32.810> they<00:03:32.959> did<00:03:33.170> was<00:03:33.380> they<00:03:33.590> give<00:03:33.769> you<00:03:33.890> these

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
what they did was they give you these

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.490 
what they did was they give you these
scenarios<00:03:34.430> of<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.540> battlefield<00:03:36.080> so<00:03:36.350> they'll

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
scenarios of the battlefield so they'll

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.550

give you a scenario map and then what

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.120 
give you a scenario map and then what
was<00:03:39.739> there<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.610> know<00:03:40.640> what<00:03:40.880> forces<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.540> use

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
which is very important because when you

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.199 
which is very important because when you
get<00:03:45.980> into<00:03:46.100> miniature<00:03:46.489> war<00:03:46.760> game<00:03:46.940> there's<00:03:47.150> a

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
get into miniature war game there's a

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.380 
get into miniature war game there's a
lot<00:03:47.299> of<00:03:47.390> people<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.750> want<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.019> reenact

lot of people that want to reenact

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.390 
lot of people that want to reenact
battles<00:03:50.390> so<00:03:51.260> this<00:03:51.530> is<00:03:51.709> very<00:03:51.890> important<00:03:52.310> I'm

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
battles so this is very important I'm

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.770 
battles so this is very important I'm
glad<00:03:52.610> they<00:03:52.760> did<00:03:52.940> this<00:03:53.120> even<00:03:53.420> though<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.510> don't

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
glad they did this even though I don't

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.690 
glad they did this even though I don't
use<00:03:53.989> it<00:03:54.140> usually<00:03:54.680> use<00:03:54.860> it<00:03:55.010> too<00:03:55.100> much<00:03:55.220> miss<00:03:55.489> them

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
use it usually use it too much miss them

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.640 
use it usually use it too much miss them
simply<00:03:56.510> because<00:03:56.780> you're<00:03:56.959> restricted<00:03:57.500> by<00:03:57.590> the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.470 
simply because you're restricted by the
forces<00:03:58.070> sometimes<00:03:58.579> I<00:03:58.700> don't<00:03:58.880> have<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.060> models

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
forces sometimes I don't have the models

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.710 
forces sometimes I don't have the models
so<00:04:00.350> but<00:04:01.310> if<00:04:01.459> you<00:04:01.790> do<00:04:01.910> have<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.120> models<00:04:02.420> this<00:04:02.540> is

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
so but if you do have the models this is

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.560 
so but if you do have the models this is
really<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.470> nice<00:04:03.980> feature<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.579> remember<00:04:05.360> Belle

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
really a nice feature I remember Belle

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.910 
really a nice feature I remember Belle
front<00:04:05.870> you<00:04:05.959> used<00:04:06.079> to<00:04:06.170> do<00:04:06.320> it<00:04:06.410> now<00:04:06.500> they<00:04:06.650> put<00:04:06.769> it

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
front you used to do it now they put it

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.289 
front you used to do it now they put it
on<00:04:07.040> PDFs<00:04:07.519> they<00:04:07.700> don't<00:04:07.940> really<00:04:08.120> pay<00:04:08.269> attention

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
on PDFs they don't really pay attention

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.490 
on PDFs they don't really pay attention
to<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:08.930> they're<00:04:09.500> focusing<00:04:10.070> more<00:04:10.250> on<00:04:10.310> the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
to it they're focusing more on the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.100 
to it they're focusing more on the
having<00:04:12.500> tournaments<00:04:13.540> style<00:04:14.540> which<00:04:14.780> i<00:04:14.900> think

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
having tournaments style which i think

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.940 
having tournaments style which i think
is<00:04:15.380> a<00:04:15.410> good<00:04:15.560> idea

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
is a good idea

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.159 
is a good idea
it<00:04:16.100> gets<00:04:16.250> people<00:04:16.400> into<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:16.970> more<00:04:17.120> but<00:04:17.780> for<00:04:18.019> the

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
it gets people into it more but for the

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.520
