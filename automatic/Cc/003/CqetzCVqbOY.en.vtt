worked on is different forms of

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.230 
worked on is different forms of
connections<00:00:16.200> so<00:00:16.410> start<00:00:16.710> out<00:00:16.890> open<00:00:17.790> connection

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
connections so start out open connection

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.480 
connections so start out open connection
one<00:00:18.600> point<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.930> connection<00:00:19.140> right<00:00:19.440> here<00:00:19.710> close

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
one point of connection right here close

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.270 
one point of connection right here close
which<00:00:21.150> has<00:00:21.330> four<00:00:21.600> course<00:00:21.870> of<00:00:22.020> action<00:00:22.380> one<00:00:22.680> two

which has four course of action one two
three<00:00:23.700> and<00:00:24.390> four<00:00:24.780> and<00:00:25.020> then<00:00:25.500> close<00:00:25.800> embrace

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
three and four and then close embrace

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.610 
three and four and then close embrace
which<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.880> basically<00:00:27.360> a<00:00:27.660> continuous<00:00:28.230> horrible

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.620 
which is basically a continuous horrible

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.880 
which is basically a continuous horrible
connection<00:00:29.040> that<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.600> here<00:00:30.600> separates<00:00:31.590> right

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
connection that of here separates right

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.180 
connection that of here separates right
here<00:00:32.279> near<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.690> hips<00:00:33.990> and<00:00:34.200> pelvic<00:00:34.590> area<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
here near the hips and pelvic area and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.480 
here near the hips and pelvic area and
then<00:00:35.340> worse<00:00:35.520> again<00:00:35.870> down<00:00:36.870> where<00:00:37.260> Isaac<00:00:37.830> so

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
then worse again down where Isaac so

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.689 
then worse again down where Isaac so
they<00:00:38.820> wait<00:00:39.570> easiest<00:00:40.260> way<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.530> into<00:00:40.829> this

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
they wait easiest way to get into this

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.240 
they wait easiest way to get into this
hug<00:00:42.699> really<00:00:43.600> good<00:00:43.750> Todd<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.350> then<00:00:44.620> slide<00:00:45.070> his

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
hug really good Todd and then slide his

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.729 
hug really good Todd and then slide his
hand<00:00:45.520> them<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.809> other<00:00:46.930> way<00:00:47.020> we<00:00:47.230> work<00:00:47.410> again

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
hand them the other way we work again

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.420 
hand them the other way we work again
into<00:00:48.040> this<00:00:48.160> was<00:00:48.550> breathe<00:00:49.300> in<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.829> then<00:00:51.100> settle

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
into this was breathe in and then settle

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.560 
into this was breathe in and then settle
it<00:00:51.550> country<00:00:51.910> back<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.640> this<00:00:54.820> is<00:00:54.850> kind<00:00:55.300> of<00:00:55.390> our

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
it country back so this is kind of our

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.310 
it country back so this is kind of our
drag<00:00:56.530> boos<00:00:57.030> position<00:00:58.030> so<00:00:58.690> that<00:00:58.720> only<00:00:59.019> worked

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
drag boos position so that only worked

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.960 
drag boos position so that only worked
out<00:00:59.500> as<00:00:59.649> we<00:00:59.769> work<00:00:59.949> on<00:01:00.159> moving<00:01:00.460> forwards<00:01:00.850> and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
out as we work on moving forwards and

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.759 
out as we work on moving forwards and
backwards<00:01:01.149> which<00:01:01.479> is<00:01:01.629> basically<00:01:02.079> pushing<00:01:02.620> out

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
backwards which is basically pushing out

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.560 
backwards which is basically pushing out
and<00:01:03.040> sliding<00:01:03.850> making<00:01:04.149> sure<00:01:04.300> you're<00:01:04.420> not

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
and sliding making sure you're not

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.090 
and sliding making sure you're not
worried<00:01:04.899> about<00:01:04.930> whether<00:01:05.680> or<00:01:05.860> not<00:01:05.950> your

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
worried about whether or not your

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.670 
worried about whether or not your
partner's<00:01:06.460> that<00:01:06.670> does<00:01:07.300> for<00:01:08.110> work

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:21.499

so<00:01:22.509> primarily<00:01:23.140> did<00:01:23.560> was<00:01:23.799> we<00:01:24.159> move<00:01:24.340> on<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.939> what

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
so primarily did was we move on to what

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.999 
so primarily did was we move on to what
we<00:01:25.359> are<00:01:25.479> calling<00:01:25.719> the<00:01:25.929> bush<00:01:26.759> which<00:01:27.759> was<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
really what this is is concentrating on

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.639 
really what this is is concentrating on
keeping<00:01:33.460> your<00:01:34.450> feet<00:01:34.659> really<00:01:35.319> small<00:01:35.619> and

The<00:01:42.189> Closer<00:01:42.459> your<00:01:42.640> internist<00:01:43.060> water<00:01:43.299> Clippers

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
The Closer your internist water Clippers

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.999 
The Closer your internist water Clippers
so<00:01:45.250> if<00:01:45.369> you<00:01:45.460> start<00:01:45.670> out<00:01:45.880> there<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:47.530> an<00:01:47.649> infant

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.980 

the<00:01:51.009> exercise<00:01:51.399> we<00:01:51.579> did<00:01:51.610> with<00:01:51.939> that<00:01:51.969> was<00:01:52.390> going

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
the exercise we did with that was going

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.389 
the exercise we did with that was going
back<00:01:53.259> for<00:01:53.649> Roush<00:01:54.399> nor<00:01:54.850> corpuscles<00:01:55.689> back<00:01:56.680> back

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
back for Roush nor corpuscles back back

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:06.700 
back for Roush nor corpuscles back back
back<00:01:58.060> back

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.639 

that<00:02:07.370> was<00:02:07.490> less<00:02:07.640> than<00:02:07.820> one<00:02:08.110> lesson<00:02:09.110> two<00:02:09.319> we

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
that was less than one lesson two we

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.100 
that was less than one lesson two we
work<00:02:09.830> on<00:02:10.130> Kip<00:02:10.399> catches<00:02:10.910> out<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.420> rules<00:02:11.600> so

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
work on Kip catches out of the rules so

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.750 
work on Kip catches out of the rules so
we<00:02:12.200> started<00:02:12.560> out<00:02:14.620> here<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:16.220> kind<00:02:16.459> of<00:02:16.580> game<00:02:16.700> is

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
we started out here this kind of game is

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.910 
we started out here this kind of game is
planting<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.540> will<00:02:17.959> point<00:02:18.200> out<00:02:18.290> by<00:02:18.560> now<00:02:18.620> you're

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
planting it will point out by now you're

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.020 
planting it will point out by now you're
right<00:02:19.069> opening<00:02:19.520> up<00:02:20.290> there<00:02:21.290> 13<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.819> when<00:02:25.940> we

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
right opening up there 13 and when we

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.350 
right opening up there 13 and when we
really<00:02:26.270> concentrated<00:02:26.959> on<00:02:27.080> his<00:02:27.350> latest

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
really concentrated on his latest

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.350 
really concentrated on his latest
set<00:02:28.630> up<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.230> building<00:02:29.530> up<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.830> lot<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.360> rotation

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
set up and building up a lot of rotation

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.360 
set up and building up a lot of rotation
here<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.340> corkscrew<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.960> array<00:02:35.200> then<00:02:36.160> from

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
here the corkscrew and array then from

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.980 
here the corkscrew and array then from
here<00:02:36.400> we<00:02:36.970> essentially<00:02:37.420> mark<00:02:37.660> I'm<00:02:37.810> just

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
here we essentially mark I'm just

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.160 
here we essentially mark I'm just
stepping<00:02:38.680> straight<00:02:39.160> back

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.470 

letting<00:02:43.950> her<00:02:44.069> settlement<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:45.270> what<00:02:45.390> we

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
letting her settlement and what we

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.390 
letting her settlement and what we
really<00:02:45.690> concentrated<00:02:46.380> on<00:02:46.500> was<00:02:46.830> as<00:02:47.099> you're

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
really concentrated on was as you're

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.880 
really concentrated on was as you're
stepping<00:02:47.610> back<00:02:48.000> all<00:02:48.720> your<00:02:48.959> stuff<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.410> back<00:02:49.590> box

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
stepping back all your stuff is back box

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.670 
stepping back all your stuff is back box
is<00:02:50.190> coming<00:02:50.550> down<00:02:50.640> your<00:02:50.970> body<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.569> linear<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.470> is

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
is coming down your body a linear and is

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.620 
is coming down your body a linear and is
go<00:02:52.860> where<00:02:53.010> your<00:02:53.099> body<00:02:53.250> knows<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.330> were

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
go where your body knows so you were

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.760 
go where your body knows so you were
doing<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.940> supposed<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.090> doing<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.959> let's

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
doing this supposed to doing this let's

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.770 
doing this supposed to doing this let's
give<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.670> lot<00:02:59.940> of<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.090> know<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.390> partner

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.370 

so<00:03:03.780> once<00:03:04.440> we<00:03:04.680> are<00:03:04.830> here<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.370> attack<00:03:05.760> we<00:03:06.750> work<00:03:06.989> on

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
so once we are here to attack we work on

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.059 
so once we are here to attack we work on
moving<00:03:07.950> valuation<00:03:08.760> normal<00:03:09.120> wats<00:03:09.470> walk<00:03:10.470> walk

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
moving valuation normal wats walk walk

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.360 
moving valuation normal wats walk walk
walk<00:03:11.430> walk<00:03:12.380> maybe<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.500> think<00:03:13.769> about<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.130> is

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
walk walk maybe I think about that is

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.820 
walk walk maybe I think about that is
the<00:03:14.550> key<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.000> same<00:03:15.269> height<00:03:16.260> as<00:03:16.590> when<00:03:16.800> you

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
the key to the same height as when you

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.650 
the key to the same height as when you
can<00:03:17.069> follow<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.489> speed<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.390> keep<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
can follow the speed and to keep the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.020 
can follow the speed and to keep the
same<00:03:18.870> similar<00:03:19.200> small<00:03:19.590> conflicts<00:03:20.040> since<00:03:20.790> your

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
same similar small conflicts since your

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.539 
same similar small conflicts since your
promise<00:03:21.799> Stefan<00:03:22.799> really<00:03:22.950> close<00:03:23.280> together

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
promise Stefan really close together

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.300 
promise Stefan really close together
sermon<00:03:24.060> pastor<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.930> do<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.200> same<00:03:25.380> thing<00:03:25.709> and

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
sermon pastor to do the same thing and

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.870 
sermon pastor to do the same thing and
that<00:03:26.430> was<00:03:26.549> not<00:03:26.730> heard<00:03:27.000> from<00:03:27.319> Casey<00:03:28.319> stop

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.900 

much<00:03:31.750> difference<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.830> was<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:33.730> go

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
much difference of that was that you go

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.780 
much difference of that was that you go
really<00:03:34.390> go<00:03:34.780> down<00:03:35.050> that's<00:03:35.470> going<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:36.100> be<00:03:36.370> a

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
really go down that's going to be a

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.310 
really go down that's going to be a
really<00:03:37.120> big<00:03:37.240> change<00:03:37.510> how's<00:03:37.870> your<00:03:38.050> step<00:03:38.290> in

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
really big change how's your step in

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:46.650 
really big change how's your step in
beforehand<00:03:38.890> that's<00:03:39.190> won't<00:03:39.430> stop<00:03:43.950> done<00:03:45.660> and

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
beforehand that's won't stop done and

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.270 
beforehand that's won't stop done and
when<00:03:46.840> we<00:03:46.930> talk<00:03:47.110> about<00:03:47.140> their<00:03:47.560> it's<00:03:47.770> two<00:03:48.040> to

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
when we talk about their it's two to

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.720 
when we talk about their it's two to
spare<00:03:48.550> follow<00:03:48.850> one<00:03:49.210> is<00:03:49.360> a<00:03:49.540> senator<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:51.490> she's

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
spare follow one is a senator and she's

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.000 
spare follow one is a senator and she's
staying<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.870> other<00:03:53.020> is<00:03:53.260> this<00:03:53.470> high<00:03:53.710> five

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
staying the other is this high five

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.960 
staying the other is this high five
essentially<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:55.660> stuff<00:03:55.900> came<00:03:56.140> from<00:03:56.970> there

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
essentially the stuff came from there

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.910 
essentially the stuff came from there
once<00:03:58.270> we're<00:03:58.510> here<00:03:58.690> we<00:03:58.840> work<00:03:58.990> to<00:03:59.380> making<00:03:59.740> it

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
once we're here we work to making it

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.030 
once we're here we work to making it
more<00:04:00.490> dynamic<00:04:00.670> plunge<00:04:01.300> by<00:04:02.020> isolating<00:04:02.830> this

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
more dynamic plunge by isolating this

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
more dynamic plunge by isolating this
barber<00:04:03.490> body<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:04.120> shifting<00:04:04.990> it<00:04:05.110> back<00:04:06.060> giving

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
barber body and shifting it back giving

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.180 
barber body and shifting it back giving
her<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.210> better<00:04:07.630> reach<00:04:07.960> for<00:04:08.920> again<00:04:08.980> we

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
her a better reach for again we

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.940 
her a better reach for again we
concentrate<00:04:09.700> that<00:04:09.820> this<00:04:09.970> wasn't<00:04:10.240> about

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
concentrate that this wasn't about

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.640 
concentrate that this wasn't about
basically<00:04:11.950> pushing<00:04:12.430> from<00:04:12.610> hi<00:04:13.480> this<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:14.260> about

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
basically pushing from hi this is about

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.550 
basically pushing from hi this is about
pulling<00:04:15.430> in<00:04:15.670> from<00:04:15.880> this<00:04:16.150> part<00:04:16.540> what<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.440> never

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
pulling in from this part what you never

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.599 
pulling in from this part what you never
want<00:04:17.890> to<00:04:17.980> do

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
want to do

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.689 
want to do
want<00:04:18.729> to<00:04:18.789> try<00:04:19.000> to<00:04:19.030> go<00:04:19.419> from<00:04:20.169> here<00:04:20.620> pushing<00:04:21.430> it

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
want to try to go from here pushing it

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.360 
want to try to go from here pushing it
back<00:04:21.849> with<00:04:22.210> this<00:04:22.389> arm<00:04:22.900> it's<00:04:23.620> always<00:04:23.919> going<00:04:24.280> to

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
back with this arm it's always going to

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.830 
back with this arm it's always going to
be<00:04:24.490> like<00:04:24.729> this<00:04:25.000> part<00:04:25.360> should<00:04:25.599> move<00:04:25.949> forward<00:04:26.949> or

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
be like this part should move forward or

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.839 
be like this part should move forward or
backward<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:29.020> way<00:04:29.229> not<00:04:29.949> so<00:04:30.129> going<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.460> closet

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
backward that way not so going to closet

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:38.040 
backward that way not so going to closet
so<00:04:31.840> what<00:04:32.199> you<00:04:32.289> know

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.409 

I<00:04:38.169> was<00:04:38.500> our<00:04:38.650> different<00:04:38.979> from<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.669> other<00:04:39.819> two

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
I was our different from the other two

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:47.960 
I was our different from the other two
things

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.640 

this<00:04:48.970> is<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.240> Shannon<00:04:49.630> spin<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.590> we

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
this is the Shannon spin so we

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.710 
this is the Shannon spin so we
concentrated<00:04:50.890> again<00:04:51.490> Senator<00:04:52.030> Paul<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.510> wine

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
concentrated again Senator Paul and wine

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.820 
concentrated again Senator Paul and wine
and<00:04:53.560> get<00:04:53.770> off<00:04:54.070> that<00:04:55.920> spinning

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
and get off that spinning

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:07.130 
and get off that spinning
normal

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.770 

I<00:05:08.140> will<00:05:08.980> really<00:05:09.280> focused<00:05:09.730> on<00:05:09.910> their<00:05:10.120> guys<00:05:10.360> ones

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
I will really focused on their guys ones

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.710 
I will really focused on their guys ones
that<00:05:11.020> your<00:05:11.230> first<00:05:11.530> step<00:05:11.830> is<00:05:12.760> always<00:05:13.150> going<00:05:13.540> to

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
that your first step is always going to

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.220 
that your first step is always going to
be<00:05:13.750> straight<00:05:14.080> back<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:19.750> you<00:05:19.840> want<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.110> make

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
be straight back and you want to make

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.140 
be straight back and you want to make
that<00:05:20.500> next<00:05:20.770> step<00:05:20.920> really<00:05:21.310> decisive<00:05:21.640> as<00:05:22.030> your

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
that next step really decisive as your

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.490 
that next step really decisive as your
father<00:05:22.270> is<00:05:22.630> going<00:05:22.870> to<00:05:22.990> watch<00:05:23.140> where<00:05:23.380> you're

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
father is going to watch where you're

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.980 
father is going to watch where you're
going<00:05:23.680> with<00:05:23.860> your<00:05:23.950> with<00:05:24.220> your<00:05:24.250> eyes<00:05:24.550> so<00:05:25.480> if<00:05:25.810> you

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
going with your with your eyes so if you

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.780
