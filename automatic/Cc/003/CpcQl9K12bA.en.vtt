but<00:01:40.470> uh<00:01:40.530> right<00:01:41.070> now<00:01:41.130> these<00:01:41.340> are<00:01:41.400> good<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
but uh right now these are good for the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.590 
but uh right now these are good for the
price<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.659> believe<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> bottom<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.070> 350

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
price I believe a bottom for like 350

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.410 
price I believe a bottom for like 350
but<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.659> got<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.380> about<00:01:46.560> 800<00:01:46.770> rms

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
but you got to get a it's about 800 rms

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.210 
but you got to get a it's about 800 rms
so<00:01:48.420> make<00:01:49.229> sure<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.549> holes<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:51.000> year

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
so make sure they are the holes a year
