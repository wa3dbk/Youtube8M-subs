00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
and she is 21 inches I think she's about

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.910 
and she is 21 inches I think she's about
10<00:01:27.990> pounds

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
10 pounds

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.929 
10 pounds
what<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> say<00:01:29.610> Marley<00:01:30.270> ten<00:01:30.509> pounds<00:01:30.720> yeah

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
what do you say Marley ten pounds yeah

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.850 
what do you say Marley ten pounds yeah
yeah<00:01:32.939> she's<00:01:33.180> very<00:01:33.509> heavy<00:01:33.900> she's<00:01:34.229> heavier<00:01:34.619> than

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
yeah she's very heavy she's heavier than

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.240 
yeah she's very heavy she's heavier than
Megan<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.570> presume<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> Megan<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.619> about

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
Megan so we presume that Megan was about

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.890 
Megan so we presume that Megan was about
seven<00:01:38.670> pounds<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.119> gonna<00:01:39.240> guess<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.659> she

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
seven pounds so I'm gonna guess that she

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:49.569 
seven pounds so I'm gonna guess that she
is<00:01:39.930> 10<00:01:40.439> pounds<00:01:40.710> um<00:01:42.140> she<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:44.600> 199<00:01:45.600> 99<00:01:47.570> so<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
is 10 pounds um she was 199 99 so and

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.280 
is 10 pounds um she was 199 99 so and
the<00:01:50.579> reason<00:01:50.939> why<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.240> were<00:01:51.390> able<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.720> afford

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
the reason why we were able to afford

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.340 
the reason why we were able to afford
her<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.590> was<00:01:52.710> because<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.310> had<00:01:53.340> um<00:01:54.320> kind<00:01:55.320> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
her it was because they had um kind of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.249 
her it was because they had um kind of
like<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.530> layaway<00:01:55.979> kind<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.969> thing<00:01:57.259> so

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
like a layaway kind of thing so
