00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
on a surface and they'll be weight on

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.279 
on a surface and they'll be weight on
this<00:00:17.490> area<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.330> see<00:00:18.449> it's<00:00:18.600> not<00:00:18.750> really<00:00:19.050> moving

this area you see it's not really moving
very<00:00:19.590> much<00:00:19.650> even<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> slick<00:00:20.609> surface

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
very much even on the slick surface

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.609 
very much even on the slick surface
you've<00:00:21.660> got<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> different<00:00:22.080> kind<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.260> surface

there but even on this slick desk
surface<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.900> know<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.019> put<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> little<00:00:31.529> pressure

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
surface you know I put a little pressure

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.370 
surface you know I put a little pressure
down<00:00:32.009> try<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> move<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.059> try<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> slide<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.809> stay

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
down try to move it try to slide it stay

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.440 
down try to move it try to slide it stay
in<00:00:34.530> place<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.460> really<00:00:35.850> well-thought-out

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
in place so I really well-thought-out

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.500 
in place so I really well-thought-out
design<00:00:36.960> from<00:00:37.649> Eureka<00:00:38.280> sound<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.149> again<00:00:39.360> you

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
design from Eureka sound and again you

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.600 
design from Eureka sound and again you
could<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.660> pop<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.440> any<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.070> case<00:00:41.340> I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
could just pop this on any to you case I

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.040 
could just pop this on any to you case I
believe<00:00:42.030> people<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.390> even<00:00:42.540> popped<00:00:42.780> them<00:00:42.930> on

believe people have even popped them on
three<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> cases<00:00:44.640> but<00:00:45.090> they<00:00:45.210> are

Eureka sound you can really tell they

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.260 
Eureka sound you can really tell they
put<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> lot<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.619> thought<00:01:59.009> into<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.939> they

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
put a lot of thought into this they

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
put a lot of thought into this they
didn't<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.570> go<00:02:00.689> ahead<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.020> it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
didn't just go ahead and do it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.389 
didn't just go ahead and do it
they<00:02:01.500> actually<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:01.860> thought<00:02:02.040> about<00:02:02.250> it

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
they actually it's thought about it

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.490 
they actually it's thought about it
first<00:02:02.579> which<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.270> great<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.170> now<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.350> you

first which is great so now that you

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.990 
first which is great so now that you
know<00:02:04.560> about<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.950> pieces<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.549> are<00:02:05.700> included

on to our 11 wreck again 11 rank is a

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.369 
on to our 11 wreck again 11 rank is a
2-u<00:02:16.680> unit<00:02:17.580> we<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:17.879> our<00:02:18.060> screws<00:02:18.450> here<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.930> our

these<00:02:21.720> black<00:02:22.200> screws<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.920> thumb<00:02:23.129> screws

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
these black screws not the thumb screws

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.039 
these black screws not the thumb screws
for<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.819> part<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.569> we're<00:02:24.720> going<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.959> be

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
for this part so we're going to be

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.259 
for this part so we're going to be
attaching<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.590> Eureka<00:02:25.950> sound<00:02:26.190> rack<00:02:26.790> arms

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
attaching the Eureka sound rack arms

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.110 
attaching the Eureka sound rack arms
just<00:02:27.599> like<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.049> just<00:02:29.040> like<00:02:29.159> you<00:02:29.280> would<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.610> 2u

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
just like so just like you would a 2u

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.650 
just like so just like you would a 2u
rack

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
rack

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.570 
rack
so<00:02:30.900> we'll<00:02:31.019> just<00:02:31.170> screw<00:02:31.410> these<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.040> then

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
so we'll just screw these on and then

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.160 
so we'll just screw these on and then
we'll<00:02:32.730> attach<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.239> legs<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.629> stand<00:02:33.900> her<00:02:34.080> up

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
we'll attach the legs and stand her up

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.970 
we'll attach the legs and stand her up
and<00:02:34.290> see<00:02:34.379> how<00:02:34.440> she<00:02:34.470> does

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
and see how she does

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.250 
and see how she does
so<00:02:35.280> I'll<00:02:35.400> position<00:02:35.670> our<00:02:35.879> first<00:02:36.120> arm<00:02:36.360> here<00:02:36.569> you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
so I'll position our first arm here you

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.830 
so I'll position our first arm here you
notice<00:02:37.680> how<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.160> direction<00:02:38.480> I'm<00:02:39.480> putting

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
notice how the direction I'm putting

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.110 
notice how the direction I'm putting
this<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.110> all<00:02:40.860> right<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.069> we<00:02:41.190> have<00:02:41.220> space<00:02:41.670> in

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
this on all right so we have space in

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.720 
this on all right so we have space in
between<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.780> Vince<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.950> actual<00:02:44.340> arm

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
between the Vince and the actual arm

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.119 
between the Vince and the actual arm
here<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:45.450> simply<00:02:45.629> screw<00:02:46.079> it<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.290> you

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129

bottom screw get these rather tight

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.050 
bottom screw get these rather tight
because<00:03:01.709> we<00:03:01.859> don't<00:03:02.010> want<00:03:02.160> our<00:03:02.220> 11<00:03:02.609> rack<00:03:02.819> or

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
don't want it to be slipping so we'll

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.440 
don't want it to be slipping so we'll
