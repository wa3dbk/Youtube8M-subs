00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
break from nerf n-strike line yep I said

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.049 
break from nerf n-strike line yep I said
and<00:00:10.440> strike<00:00:10.710> not<00:00:10.980> Elite<00:00:11.250> if<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.669> look<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
and strike not Elite if you look on the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.810 
and strike not Elite if you look on the
box<00:00:12.269> just<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.719> Zen<00:00:12.929> strike<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.610> grip

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
box just a Zen strike and on the grip

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.930 
box just a Zen strike and on the grip
there<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.959> strike<00:00:16.740> not<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.130> elite<00:00:17.310> logo<00:00:17.730> and

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
there and strike not the elite logo and

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.169 
there and strike not the elite logo and
so<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:19.110> is<00:00:19.380> does<00:00:20.130> appear<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.519> be<00:00:20.609> just<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:21.179 
so this is does appear to be just a

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.620 
so this is does appear to be just a
blu-ray<00:00:21.689> shell<00:00:21.929> of<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.380> original<00:00:22.800> and

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
blu-ray shell of the original and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.880 
blu-ray shell of the original and
actually<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:24.869> slightly<00:00:25.289> worse<00:00:25.590> than<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
actually it's slightly worse than the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.710 
actually it's slightly worse than the
original<00:00:25.980> because<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> original<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.570> go

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
original because the original if you go

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.169 
original because the original if you go
back<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> other<00:00:28.230> video<00:00:28.609> at<00:00:29.609> least<00:00:29.880> came

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
back to the other video at least came

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.510 
back to the other video at least came
with<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.419> accessory<00:00:31.019> rail<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.619> went<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.189> here

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
with a accessory rail that went on here

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.060 
with a accessory rail that went on here
or<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> has<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.810> rail<00:00:33.960> came<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.560> an<00:00:34.650> accessory

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
or a has the rail came with an accessory

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.549 
or a has the rail came with an accessory
that<00:00:35.310> went<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.969> rail<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.780> held<00:00:37.050> darts

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
that went on the rail on that held darts

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.920 
that went on the rail on that held darts
for<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.850> could<00:00:38.940> reload<00:00:39.300> faster<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
for you so you could reload faster and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.660 
for you so you could reload faster and
this<00:00:40.140> new<00:00:40.320> version<00:00:40.350> does<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.219> include<00:00:41.489> that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
this new version does not include that

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.540 
this new version does not include that
so<00:00:42.410> other<00:00:43.410> than<00:00:43.649> making<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.980> color<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.430> do

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
so other than making the color I do

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.340 
so other than making the color I do
guess<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> blue<00:00:45.809> better<00:00:46.020> than<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
guess I like the blue better than the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.700 
guess I like the blue better than the
yellow<00:00:46.530> but<00:00:46.890> otherwise<00:00:47.190> they<00:00:47.489> made<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.760> worse

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
yellow but otherwise they made it worse

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.250 
yellow but otherwise they made it worse
but<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.850> they've<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.359> out<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
but so now they've got this out just to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.049 
but so now they've got this out just to
make<00:00:52.410> sure<00:00:52.590> we're<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.340> see<00:00:53.489> how<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.850> does

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
make sure we're going to see how it does

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.450 
make sure we're going to see how it does
with<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.660> ranges<00:00:55.019> now<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:56.010> should<00:00:56.280> get

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
with the ranges now it should get

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.310 
with the ranges now it should get
slightly<00:00:56.879> better<00:00:57.059> than<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.719> my<00:00:57.870> old<00:00:58.079> test

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
slightly better than on my old test

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.900 
slightly better than on my old test
because<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> old<00:00:58.890> test<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.340> was<00:00:59.519> firing

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
because on the old test it was firing

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.599 
because on the old test it was firing
sonic<00:01:00.719> darts<00:01:00.989> which<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.980> what<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.280> came<00:01:02.399> with

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
sonic darts which is what it came with

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.979 
sonic darts which is what it came with
now<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.940> comes<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.210> elites<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.809> so

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
now it comes with elites and so

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.110 
now it comes with elites and so
technically<00:01:04.590> it's<00:01:05.340> get<00:01:05.580> little<00:01:05.880> better

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
technically it's get little better

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.950 
technically it's get little better
ranges<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:07.140> from<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.939> but<00:01:08.939> here<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:09.810> go

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
ranges just from that but here we go

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.310 
ranges just from that but here we go
let's<00:01:10.320> see<00:01:10.650> how<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.890> does<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.659> do<00:01:12.810> open

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
let's see how it does and so you do open

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.910 
let's see how it does and so you do open
it<00:01:13.470> by<00:01:13.590> pressing<00:01:13.920> down<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.189> either<00:01:14.490> side<00:01:15.920> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
it by pressing down on either side and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:25.550 
it by pressing down on either side and
you<00:01:17.990> loader<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:24.150> ready<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.170> you

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
you loader in and ready to go and you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.880 
you loader in and ready to go and you
can<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:26.579> either<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.970> single<00:01:27.540> shot<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.229> double

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
can get either a single shot or a double

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.340 
can get either a single shot or a double
blast<00:01:29.130> by<00:01:29.820> how<00:01:30.390> quickly<00:01:30.720> pull<00:01:31.110> down<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
blast by how quickly pull down the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.080 
blast by how quickly pull down the
trigger<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.310> doesn't<00:01:32.579> affect<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> ranges

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
trigger but it doesn't affect the ranges

00:01:33.090 --> 00:02:23.229 
trigger but it doesn't affect the ranges
so<00:01:33.210> I'm<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:33.780> single<00:01:33.960> shots

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.030 

and<00:02:24.239> there<00:02:24.989> we<00:02:25.140> are<00:02:25.170> 10<00:02:25.500> fired<00:02:25.769> off<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:28.350> did

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and there we are 10 fired off and did

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.620 
and there we are 10 fired off and did
sound<00:02:29.280> pretty<00:02:29.519> anemic<00:02:29.730> when<00:02:30.030> firing<00:02:30.239> compared

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
sound pretty anemic when firing compared

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.509 
sound pretty anemic when firing compared
to<00:02:30.720> alley<00:02:30.959> blaster<00:02:31.410> personally<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.280> don't<00:02:32.370> know

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
to alley blaster personally I don't know

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.130 
to alley blaster personally I don't know
why<00:02:32.760> they<00:02:32.940> didn't<00:02:33.239> actually<00:02:33.480> give<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:33.930> one<00:02:34.080> a

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
why they didn't actually give this one a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.410 
why they didn't actually give this one a
leaf<00:02:34.380> upgrade<00:02:34.910> would<00:02:35.910> have<00:02:36.000> been<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> really

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
leaf upgrade would have been a really

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.580 
leaf upgrade would have been a really
cool<00:02:36.600> blaster<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.050> they<00:02:37.140> did<00:02:37.440> but<00:02:38.480> ok<00:02:39.500> got<00:02:40.500> our

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
cool blaster if they did but ok got our

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.870 
cool blaster if they did but ok got our
lowest<00:02:40.920> two<00:02:41.069> here<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.459> they're<00:02:41.610> kind<00:02:41.819> of

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
lowest two here and they're kind of

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.940 
lowest two here and they're kind of
sitting<00:02:42.120> between<00:02:42.290> 24<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.790> 25<00:02:44.790> feet<00:02:45.920> nice<00:02:46.920> and

sitting between 24 and 25 feet nice and

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.740 
sitting between 24 and 25 feet nice and
down<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> center<00:02:47.579> slight<00:02:47.970> breeze<00:02:48.269> going<00:02:48.540> but

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
down the center slight breeze going but

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.550 
down the center slight breeze going but
nothing<00:02:48.989> that's<00:02:49.049> going<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.320> really<00:02:49.470> affect

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
nothing that's going to really affect

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.100

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
the ranges I'm gonna call the middle

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.310

here at about 30 feet and we had one

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.670 
here at about 30 feet and we had one
that<00:02:58.560> did<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:59.010> bit<00:02:59.340> better<00:02:59.519> than<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.820> rest<00:03:00.060> and

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
that did a bit better than the rest and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.319 
that did a bit better than the rest and
that<00:03:01.680> top<00:03:02.070> one<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.370> was<00:03:02.640> sitting<00:03:02.820> out<00:03:02.970> pretty

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
much by itself so keep that in mind

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.789 
much by itself so keep that in mind
that's<00:03:05.700> sitting<00:03:06.030> just<00:03:06.239> shy<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.540> 40<00:03:06.810> feet<00:03:07.019> so
