00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.870 

okay<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.470> is<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.680> old<00:00:10.830> four<00:00:11.100> Impala<00:00:11.460> and

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
okay this is the old four Impala and

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.560 
okay this is the old four Impala and
what<00:00:12.540> happened<00:00:13.020> on<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.950> motor

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
what happened on it is the motor

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.340 
what happened on it is the motor
actually<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.600> don't<00:00:15.660> think<00:00:15.750> it's<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> motor<00:00:16.230> I

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
actually I don't think it's the motor I

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.600 
actually I don't think it's the motor I
really<00:00:16.710> do<00:00:16.830> think<00:00:17.040> it's<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.340> switch<00:00:17.580> that

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
really do think it's the switch that

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.609 
really do think it's the switch that
went<00:00:18.000> out<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.270> there<00:00:18.420> right<00:00:18.570> here<00:00:18.779> because<00:00:19.380> you

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
went out on there right here because you

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.230 
went out on there right here because you
could<00:00:19.770> hear<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.310> window<00:00:20.610> got<00:00:20.790> stuck<00:00:21.060> all

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
could hear it the window got stuck all

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.060 
could hear it the window got stuck all
the<00:00:21.270> way<00:00:21.450> down<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.930> then<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.590> could<00:00:22.830> hear

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
the way down and then you could hear

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.710 
the way down and then you could hear
when<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.490> push<00:00:23.700> the<00:00:23.910> button<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.360> the<00:00:24.510> motor

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
when you push the button that the motor

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.300 
when you push the button that the motor
was<00:00:24.900> still<00:00:25.140> trying<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.440> go<00:00:25.590> down<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.130> would

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
hard bar to pop off the plastic clips

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.780 
hard bar to pop off the plastic clips
popped<00:01:32.010> off<00:01:32.220> pretty<00:01:32.490> good

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
popped off pretty good

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.590 
popped off pretty good
what<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.960> along<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:35.040> door<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.090> plastic

what but along the door was the plastic
insulation<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:38.790> glued<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.450> really

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
insulation and that was glued and really

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.870

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
right now

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.080 
right now
there<00:03:25.920> should<00:03:26.160> be<00:03:26.190> holes<00:03:26.519> right<00:03:26.730> here<00:03:26.790> that

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
there should be holes right here that

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.759 
there should be holes right here that
you<00:03:27.209> couldn't<00:03:27.480> screw<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.870> at<00:03:27.989> but<00:03:28.560> when<00:03:28.680> it

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
need to mess with all those ten

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.340 
need to mess with all those ten
millimeter<00:03:53.819> nuts<00:03:54.060> what<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.329> had<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.720> do<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.109> when

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
millimeter nuts what I had to do is when

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.660 
millimeter nuts what I had to do is when
the<00:03:55.470> window<00:03:55.739> was<00:03:55.889> in<00:03:56.069> all<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.400> way<00:03:56.430> down

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
the window was in all the way down

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.819 
the window was in all the way down
position<00:03:57.019> these<00:03:58.019> two<00:03:58.319> holes<00:03:58.530> right<00:03:58.650> here

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
position these two holes right here

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.470 
position these two holes right here
we're<00:03:59.310> supposed<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.790> be<00:03:59.940> able<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.120> screw<00:04:00.389> her

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
we're supposed to be able to screw her

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.539 
we're supposed to be able to screw her
four<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.900> would<00:04:01.049> not<00:04:01.290> fit<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.739> socket<00:04:02.100> in<00:04:02.310> there

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
four it would not fit a socket in there

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.009 
four it would not fit a socket in there
because<00:04:02.760> they<00:04:02.940> were<00:04:03.000> off-kilter

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
because they were off-kilter

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.680 
because they were off-kilter
so<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.620> socket<00:04:05.099> would've<00:04:05.340> gone<00:04:05.519> straight<00:04:05.690> so

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
so the socket would've gone straight so

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.569 
so the socket would've gone straight so
I<00:04:06.720> had<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.019> get<00:04:07.139> a<00:04:07.170> ten<00:04:07.470> millimeter<00:04:07.709> box<00:04:08.220> wrench

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
I had to get a ten millimeter box wrench

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.460 
I had to get a ten millimeter box wrench
and<00:04:08.819> put<00:04:09.389> it<00:04:09.480> through<00:04:09.599> the<00:04:09.750> big<00:04:09.989> part<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.410> the

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
and put it through the big part of the

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.699 
and put it through the big part of the
hole<00:04:10.819> onto<00:04:11.819> the<00:04:11.940> socket<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.840> twist<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:13.560> that

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
hole onto the socket and twist it that

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.979 
hole onto the socket and twist it that
way<00:04:13.950> this<00:04:14.519> one<00:04:14.730> was<00:04:14.910> easier<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.329> get<00:04:15.450> off<00:04:15.480> the

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
way this one was easier to get off the

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.539 
way this one was easier to get off the
one<00:04:16.169> all<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.410> way<00:04:16.620> in<00:04:16.739> here<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.099> had<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.370> reach

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
one all the way in here you had to reach

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.219 
one all the way in here you had to reach
your<00:04:17.700> arm<00:04:17.970> in<00:04:18.209> here<00:04:18.450> with<00:04:18.599> the<00:04:18.690> 10<00:04:18.870> millimeter

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
your arm in here with the 10 millimeter

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.190 
your arm in here with the 10 millimeter
and<00:04:19.650> get<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.310> 10<00:04:20.519> millimeter<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:21.209> here<00:04:21.539> now<00:04:22.079> it

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
and get the 10 millimeter on here now it

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.990 
and get the 10 millimeter on here now it
has<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.530> come<00:04:22.740> all<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.280> way<00:04:23.310> out<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.729> got<00:04:23.880> to

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
has to come all the way out you got to

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.730 
has to come all the way out you got to
take<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> 10<00:04:24.450> millimeter<00:04:24.870> bolt<00:04:25.139> all<00:04:25.349> the<00:04:25.410> way

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
take the 10 millimeter bolt all the way

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.190 
take the 10 millimeter bolt all the way
out<00:04:25.950> in<00:04:26.190> order<00:04:26.849> to<00:04:27.120> raise<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.599> window<00:04:27.900> all<00:04:28.080> the

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
out in order to raise the window all the

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.500 
out in order to raise the window all the
way<00:04:28.320> up<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.950> doesn't<00:04:29.400> fix<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.729> motor<00:04:29.909> that

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
way up that doesn't fix the motor that

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.170 
way up that doesn't fix the motor that
just<00:04:30.780> gets<00:04:30.960> you<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.260> window<00:04:31.979> up<00:04:32.190> so<00:04:32.970> your

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
just gets you to window up so your

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.850 
just gets you to window up so your
window<00:04:33.510> would<00:04:33.690> be<00:04:33.720> up<00:04:34.050> while<00:04:34.320> you're<00:04:34.440> driving

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
window would be up while you're driving

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.300 
window would be up while you're driving
around

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
around

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.160 
around
like<00:04:35.850> I'll<00:04:36.150> do<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.450> video<00:04:36.750> when<00:04:36.870> I'm<00:04:36.960> taking

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
like I'll do the video when I'm taking

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.440 
like I'll do the video when I'm taking
the<00:04:37.380> motor<00:04:37.530> out<00:04:37.680> but<00:04:38.400> that's<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.760> easiest<00:04:39.150> way

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
the motor out but that's the easiest way

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.040 
the motor out but that's the easiest way
to<00:04:39.800> get<00:04:40.800> your<00:04:41.040> window<00:04:41.340> up<00:04:41.780> like<00:04:42.780> I<00:04:42.870> said
