okay<00:00:01.079> so<00:00:01.140> what<00:00:01.500> we<00:00:01.589> will<00:00:01.709> talk<00:00:01.860> about<00:00:01.979> today<00:00:02.550> is

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:02.990 
okay so what we will talk about today is

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.680 
okay so what we will talk about today is
only<00:00:03.990> 25<00:00:04.380> ones<00:00:04.879> and<00:00:05.879> how<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.029> solo<00:00:06.299> over<00:00:06.480> them

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
only 25 ones and how to solo over them

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.940 
only 25 ones and how to solo over them
my<00:00:07.560> first<00:00:07.830> thing<00:00:08.069> would<00:00:08.760> be<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.590> think<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:10.740> key

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
my first thing would be to think in key

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.530 
my first thing would be to think in key
whatever<00:00:11.340> Kissinger<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:11.940> your<00:00:12.090> minor<00:00:12.300> key

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
whatever Kissinger and your minor key

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.760 
whatever Kissinger and your minor key
and<00:00:13.429> you<00:00:14.429> outline<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.480> trailer<00:00:16.049> tones<00:00:16.440> for

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
and you outline the trailer tones for

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.980 
and you outline the trailer tones for
that<00:00:17.010> key<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.789> we'll<00:00:18.150> be<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.570> case<00:00:18.810> C

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
that key so we'll be in this case C

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.580 
that key so we'll be in this case C

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.589 
flat G and you learn those everywhere so
I<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.730> positions<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.910> tribes<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.449> like

I have positions of tribes that I like

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.689 
I have positions of tribes that I like
to<00:00:27.720> play<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.920> two<00:00:29.189> notes<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.609> the

string and then one note of the string

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.139 
string and then one note of the string
and<00:00:33.300> then<00:00:34.020> what<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.100> got<00:00:35.309> there<00:00:35.579> unknown<00:00:36.030> on

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and then what do we got there unknown on

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.459 
and then what do we got there unknown on
the<00:00:36.300> string<00:00:36.570> us<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:36.870> two<00:00:37.020> notes<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:37.350> that

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the string us are two notes on that

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.450 
the string us are two notes on that
string<00:00:37.710> which<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> D<00:00:38.370> string<00:00:38.579> 1<00:00:39.570> 12<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.250> one

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
string which is the D string 1 12 so one

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
string which is the D string 1 12 so one
of<00:00:41.489> my<00:00:41.579> positions<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:51.469> next

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
of my positions are like this next

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:13.630 
of my positions are like this next
position<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:59.690> in<00:01:00.690> something<00:01:01.050> 21<00:01:01.800> 21<00:01:02.539> 12

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.219 

and<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> last<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.600> starting

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and then the last one will be starting

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:25.130 
and then the last one will be starting
from<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:18.439> get<00:01:19.520> 21<00:01:21.710> 2012<00:01:23.509> to<00:01:24.509> speed<00:01:24.750> microsemi

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
from the get 21 2012 to speed microsemi

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:37.430 
from the get 21 2012 to speed microsemi
we're<00:01:25.560> not<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> speed

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.810 

okay<00:01:37.620> so<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.010> first<00:01:38.130> thing<00:01:38.250> i<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
okay so that's the first thing i do I

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.020 
okay so that's the first thing i do I
would<00:01:39.150> also<00:01:39.300> do<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.660> same<00:01:39.870> thing<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.440> the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
would also do the same thing for the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.920 
would also do the same thing for the
problem<00:01:42.030> user<00:01:42.150> seemeth<00:01:42.540> accordionist

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
problem user seemeth accordionist

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.510

diminished<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:54.170> maybe<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.350> that'll<00:01:55.830> be<00:02:10.580> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
diminished and maybe on that'll be the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.610 
diminished and maybe on that'll be the
heaps<00:02:11.790> obviously<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.690> g7<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:13.320> well<00:02:13.470> do<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
heaps obviously in g7 as well do the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.110 
heaps obviously in g7 as well do the
same<00:02:13.830> sort<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.100> thing<00:02:14.160> or<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.490> two<00:02:14.880> major

same sort of thing or just two major
training<00:02:22.550> rough<00:02:23.550> bidding<00:02:23.820> me<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.150> idea<00:02:24.390> so

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
training rough bidding me the idea so

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.000 
training rough bidding me the idea so
you<00:02:24.570> could<00:02:24.720> do<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.990> but<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.740> would<00:02:25.860> sit<00:02:25.980> down

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
you could do that but I would sit down

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.230 
you could do that but I would sit down
and<00:02:26.250> I'll<00:02:26.340> do<00:02:26.460> each<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.850> those<00:02:26.970> things

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
and I'll do each of those things

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.790 
and I'll do each of those things
separately<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.170> quite<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> while<00:02:28.560> I'd

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
separately for quite a while I'd

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.130 
separately for quite a while I'd
actually<00:02:28.950> speak<00:02:29.220> quite<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> lot<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.700> time<00:02:29.850> just

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
actually speak quite a lot of time just

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.590 
actually speak quite a lot of time just
running<00:02:31.140> over<00:02:31.440> those<00:02:31.590> chord<00:02:32.130> points<00:02:32.700> naming

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
running over those chord points naming

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.400 
running over those chord points naming

just<00:02:41.040> sort<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.340> seeing<00:02:41.880> where<00:02:42.120> they<00:02:42.239> all<00:02:42.420> said

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
just sort of seeing where they all said

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.740 
just sort of seeing where they all said
on<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.380> neck<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:44.640> relation<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:45.270> sound

on the neck in relation to that sound

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.860 
on the neck in relation to that sound
and<00:02:46.440> probably<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.880> know<00:02:47.910> doing<00:02:48.270> exercises

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
and probably you know doing exercises

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.560 
and probably you know doing exercises
like<00:02:49.020> singing<00:02:49.410> everything<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.100> played

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
like singing everything that I played

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.479 
like singing everything that I played
and<00:02:51.570> then<00:02:51.720> when<00:02:51.900> you've<00:02:52.020> done<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.489> you

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
and then when you've done that you

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.350 
and then when you've done that you
should<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:53.850> able<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.530> put<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.790> music<00:02:57.239> or

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
should be able to put that music or

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.199 
should be able to put that music or
