00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
guitar curriculum here at Mi I wanted to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.630 
guitar curriculum here at Mi I wanted to
talk<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.829> you<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:30.919> little<00:00:30.980> bit<00:00:31.099> about<00:00:31.310> playing

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
talk to you a little bit about playing

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.350 
talk to you a little bit about playing
funk<00:00:32.000> in<00:00:32.210> seven<00:00:33.050> you<00:00:33.680> know<00:00:33.710> years<00:00:34.610> ago<00:00:34.699> I<00:00:35.150> used

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
funk in seven you know years ago I used

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.509 
funk in seven you know years ago I used
to<00:00:35.480> struggle<00:00:35.930> with<00:00:36.080> how<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:36.830> play<00:00:37.129> over<00:00:37.400> odd

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
to struggle with how to play over odd

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.720 
to struggle with how to play over odd
time<00:00:37.820> signatures<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.720> a<00:00:39.250> drummer<00:00:40.250> sat<00:00:40.580> me

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
time signatures and a drummer sat me

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.180 
time signatures and a drummer sat me
down<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.350> explained<00:00:42.350> a<00:00:42.440> few<00:00:42.470> things<00:00:42.860> that

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
down and explained a few things that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.720 
down and explained a few things that
changed<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.059> way<00:00:44.180> I<00:00:44.210> looked<00:00:44.510> at<00:00:44.600> it<00:00:44.660> forever

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
changed the way I looked at it forever

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
changed the way I looked at it forever
basically<00:00:46.730> what<00:00:46.879> he<00:00:47.000> said<00:00:47.239> to<00:00:47.390> me<00:00:47.540> was<00:00:47.720> that

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
basically what he said to me was that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.619 
basically what he said to me was that
any<00:00:48.650> odd<00:00:49.190> time<00:00:49.579> signature<00:00:50.090> no<00:00:50.239> matter<00:00:50.420> how

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
any odd time signature no matter how

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:51.790 
any odd time signature no matter how
complex<00:00:51.140> it<00:00:51.350> is

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
complex it is

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.490 
complex it is
can<00:00:52.100> be<00:00:52.219> broken<00:00:52.399> down<00:00:52.610> into<00:00:53.000> groups<00:00:53.930> of<00:00:54.230> twos

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
can be broken down into groups of twos

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.130 
can be broken down into groups of twos
and<00:00:54.800> threes<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:55.309> fours<00:00:55.629> like<00:00:56.629> little<00:00:56.899> blocks

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
and threes and fours like little blocks

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.630 
and threes and fours like little blocks
that<00:00:57.379> you<00:00:57.500> can<00:00:57.649> move<00:00:57.829> around<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.340> it<00:00:58.460> really

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
that you can move around so it really

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.790 
that you can move around so it really
doesn't<00:00:58.879> matter<00:00:59.149> what<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.020> time<00:01:00.260> signature

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
doesn't matter what the time signature

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.180 
doesn't matter what the time signature
is<00:01:00.829> it<00:01:01.129> could<00:01:01.250> be<00:01:01.370> seven<00:01:02.199> thirteen<00:01:03.199> 33

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
is it could be seven thirteen 33

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.330 
is it could be seven thirteen 33
whatever<00:01:04.580> it<00:01:04.699> is<00:01:04.820> if<00:01:05.149> you<00:01:05.780> break<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.170> down<00:01:06.340> you

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
whatever it is if you break it down you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.460 
whatever it is if you break it down you
can<00:01:07.550> kind<00:01:08.060> of<00:01:08.149> digest<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:08.810> it<00:01:09.110> makes<00:01:09.289> more

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
can kind of digest it and it makes more

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.080 
can kind of digest it and it makes more
sense<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.009> what<00:01:10.490> we're<00:01:10.580> going<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:10.729> do<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:10.970> we're

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
sense so what we're going to do is we're

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.240 
sense so what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.240> take<00:01:12.050> a<00:01:12.259> common<00:01:12.950> time<00:01:13.220> signature

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
going to take a common time signature

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.690 
going to take a common time signature
seven<00:01:14.060> eight<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.920> break<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.070> down<00:01:16.100> into<00:01:16.250> three

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
seven eight and break it down into three

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.669 
seven eight and break it down into three
groups<00:01:16.729> two<00:01:17.539> groups<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.899> two<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.380> group<00:01:18.560> of

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
groups two groups of two and a group of

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.249 
groups two groups of two and a group of
three<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:19.550> it'll<00:01:19.700> be<00:01:19.789> one<00:01:20.060> two<00:01:20.090> one<00:01:20.720> two<00:01:20.750> one

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
three so it'll be one two one two one

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.830 
three so it'll be one two one two one
two<00:01:21.439> three<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.159> instead<00:01:22.490> of<00:01:22.549> counting<00:01:23.030> one<00:01:23.570> two

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
two three so instead of counting one two

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.560 
two three so instead of counting one two
three<00:01:24.259> four<00:01:24.560> five<00:01:24.860> six<00:01:25.250> seven<00:01:25.580> we're<00:01:26.360> going<00:01:26.509> to

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
three four five six seven we're going to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.590 
three four five six seven we're going to
count<00:01:26.840> one<00:01:27.200> two<00:01:27.439> one<00:01:27.950> two<00:01:28.159> one<00:01:28.520> two<00:01:29.000> three<00:01:29.030> one

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
count one two one two one two three one

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.609 
count one two one two one two three one

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
two one two one two that on the guitar

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.530 
two one two one two that on the guitar
we're<00:01:33.829> just<00:01:33.979> going<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.159> mute<00:01:34.400> mute<00:01:35.390> the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
we're just going to mute mute the

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.740 
we're just going to mute mute the
strings<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.140> scratch<00:01:36.560> eighth<00:01:36.890> notes<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.750> in

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
strings and scratch eighth notes and in

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.140 
strings and scratch eighth notes and in
the<00:01:38.840> first<00:01:39.049> figure<00:01:39.290> you'll<00:01:40.159> see<00:01:40.369> that<00:01:40.549> we're

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
the first figure you'll see that we're

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.670 
the first figure you'll see that we're
going<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.360> have<00:01:41.540> alternating<00:01:42.200> eighth<00:01:42.409> notes

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
going to have alternating eighth notes

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.230 
going to have alternating eighth notes
but<00:01:42.920> at<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.130> end<00:01:43.159> of<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.520> bar<00:01:43.729> because

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
but at the end of the bar because

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.539 
but at the end of the bar because
there's<00:01:44.479> an<00:01:44.659> odd<00:01:45.320> number<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.829> attacks<00:01:46.250> we're

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
there's an odd number of attacks we're

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.980 
there's an odd number of attacks we're
going<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.729> have<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.210> double<00:01:47.689> up<00:01:47.810> the

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
going to have to double up the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.870 
going to have to double up the
downstroke<00:01:48.530> at<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.799> end<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.130> bar<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:49.549> look

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
downstroke at the end of the bar so look

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.030 
downstroke at the end of the bar so look
for<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.450> one<00:01:51.200> thing<00:01:51.470> before<00:01:51.829> we<00:01:51.860> get

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
for that and one thing before we get

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.130 
for that and one thing before we get
started<00:01:52.430> in<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.610> lesson<00:01:52.970> is<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.119> all<00:01:53.840> the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
started in the lesson is that all the

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.020 
started in the lesson is that all the
examples<00:01:54.470> we're<00:01:54.710> going<00:01:54.829> to<00:01:54.890> count<00:01:55.189> in<00:01:55.430> in<00:01:55.670> four

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
examples we're going to count in in four

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.789 
examples we're going to count in in four
and<00:01:56.299> then<00:01:56.810> we're<00:01:56.930> going<00:01:57.049> to<00:01:57.110> start<00:01:57.350> playing<00:01:57.500> in

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
and then we're going to start playing in

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.889 
and then we're going to start playing in
seven<00:01:58.189> when<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.460> music<00:01:58.759> begins<00:01:58.790> let's<00:01:59.659> try<00:01:59.840> it

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
seven when the music begins let's try it

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.330 
seven when the music begins let's try it

thing<00:02:12.830> he<00:02:13.010> mentioned<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.400> me<00:02:13.460> was<00:02:13.730> if<00:02:14.570> the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
thing he mentioned to me was if the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.440 
thing he mentioned to me was if the
tempo<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.140> appropriate<00:02:15.770> it's<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.670> good<00:02:16.850> idea<00:02:17.000> to

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
tempo is appropriate it's a good idea to

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.020 
tempo is appropriate it's a good idea to
subdivide<00:02:17.780> even<00:02:18.230> even<00:02:18.590> further<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.220> if

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
subdivide even even further and if

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.440 
subdivide even even further and if
you're<00:02:20.870> scratching<00:02:21.530> sixteenth<00:02:22.190> notes<00:02:22.460> at

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
you're scratching sixteenth notes at

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.300 
you're scratching sixteenth notes at
that<00:02:23.630> same<00:02:23.870> tempo<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.410> seven<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.950> won't<00:02:25.130> have

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
that same tempo and seven you won't have

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.460 
that same tempo and seven you won't have
to<00:02:25.610> interrupt<00:02:26.270> your<00:02:26.570> strumming<00:02:26.960> pattern<00:02:27.320> you

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
to interrupt your strumming pattern you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.440 
to interrupt your strumming pattern you
can<00:02:27.620> just<00:02:27.770> keep<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.190> same<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.090> let's<00:02:29.270> try

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
can just keep it the same so let's try

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.440 
can just keep it the same so let's try
the<00:02:29.510> same<00:02:29.870> thing<00:02:29.930> muted<00:02:30.760> muted<00:02:31.760> strings<00:02:32.120> and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
the same thing muted muted strings and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.780 
the same thing muted muted strings and
scratch<00:02:33.230> sixteenth<00:02:33.740> notes<00:02:33.980> through<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.340> bar

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.310 

one<00:02:37.790> two<00:02:38.390> three<00:02:39.580> one<00:02:40.580> two<00:02:40.790> one<00:02:41.330> two<00:02:41.570> one<00:02:42.080> two

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
one two three one two one two one two

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:52.630 
one two three one two one two one two
three<00:02:50.740> right<00:02:51.740> so<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:52.010> can<00:02:52.130> just<00:02:52.310> keep<00:02:52.430> your

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
three right so you can just keep your

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.280 
three right so you can just keep your
hand<00:02:52.880> pumping<00:02:53.210> away<00:02:53.300> on<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.570> sixteenths<00:02:54.200> and

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
hand pumping away on the sixteenths and

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.770 
hand pumping away on the sixteenths and
it<00:02:54.440> doesn't<00:02:54.710> feel<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.100> awkward<00:02:55.390> now<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.450> next

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it doesn't feel so awkward now the next

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.240 
it doesn't feel so awkward now the next
thing<00:02:56.960> and<00:02:57.170> this<00:02:57.260> was<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.470> big<00:02:57.680> revelation<00:02:58.070> for

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
thing and this was a big revelation for

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.550 
thing and this was a big revelation for
me<00:02:58.610> was<00:02:58.850> this<00:02:59.090> group<00:02:59.360> of<00:02:59.510> three<00:02:59.720> which<00:03:00.380> is

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
me was this group of three which is

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.460 
me was this group of three which is
generally<00:03:01.010> what<00:03:01.040> makes<00:03:01.400> any<00:03:02.180> odd<00:03:02.450> bar<00:03:02.780> feel

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
generally what makes any odd bar feel

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.550 
generally what makes any odd bar feel
odd<00:03:03.880> if<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.210> break<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.540> in<00:03:05.870> half<00:03:05.900> once

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
odd if you break that in half once

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.620 
odd if you break that in half once
you're<00:03:06.710> doing<00:03:06.830> sixteenth<00:03:07.400> notes<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:07.970> you

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
you're doing sixteenth notes and you you

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.260 
you're doing sixteenth notes and you you
split<00:03:08.990> that<00:03:09.110> in<00:03:09.290> half<00:03:09.320> it<00:03:10.190> tends<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.730> even<00:03:11.120> out

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
split that in half it tends to even out

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.670 
split that in half it tends to even out
the<00:03:11.450> flow<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:11.870> make<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.170> groove<00:03:12.410> feel<00:03:12.650> a

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
the flow and make the groove feel a

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.320 
the flow and make the groove feel a
little<00:03:12.920> bit<00:03:13.130> more<00:03:13.310> natural<00:03:13.490> even<00:03:14.240> though

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
little bit more natural even though

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330 
little bit more natural even though
you're<00:03:14.480> playing<00:03:14.720> an<00:03:14.900> odd<00:03:15.020> time<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:16.010> for<00:03:16.250> this

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
you're playing an odd time so for this

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.800 
you're playing an odd time so for this
next<00:03:16.400> example<00:03:17.060> we're<00:03:17.150> going<00:03:17.240> to<00:03:17.300> play<00:03:17.510> an<00:03:17.630> e

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
next example we're going to play an e

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.770 
next example we're going to play an e
nine<00:03:18.020> chord<00:03:19.120> right<00:03:20.120> there<00:03:20.330> in<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.480> seventh

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
nine chord right there in the seventh

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.770 
nine chord right there in the seventh
position<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:22.210> we're<00:03:23.210> going<00:03:23.240> to<00:03:23.390> have<00:03:23.540> four

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
position and we're going to have four

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.570 
position and we're going to have four
attacks<00:03:24.080> in<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.380> bar<00:03:24.530> now<00:03:24.740> rather<00:03:25.100> than<00:03:25.310> three

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
attacks in the bar now rather than three

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.780 
attacks in the bar now rather than three
and<00:03:26.050> this<00:03:27.050> example<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.740> has<00:03:27.860> a<00:03:27.890> swing<00:03:28.280> feel<00:03:28.520> to

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
and this example it has a swing feel to

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:53.220 
and this example it has a swing feel to
it<00:03:29.230> like<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.440> here<00:03:30.710> we<00:03:30.800> go<00:03:30.920> two<00:03:31.550> three<00:03:32.330> oh

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.660 

right<00:03:54.230> so<00:03:54.500> now<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.709> groove<00:03:54.980> starts<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.459> feel<00:03:55.640> a

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
right so now the groove starts to feel a

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.070 
right so now the groove starts to feel a
little<00:03:55.850> bit<00:03:56.090> more<00:03:56.240> familiar<00:03:56.450> even<00:03:56.959> though

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
little bit more familiar even though

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.740 
little bit more familiar even though
you're<00:03:57.260> playing<00:03:57.380> it<00:03:57.650> on<00:03:57.770> time<00:03:58.209> okay<00:03:59.209> so<00:03:59.540> what

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
you're playing it on time okay so what

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.300 
you're playing it on time okay so what
we're<00:03:59.840> going<00:03:59.930> to<00:03:59.990> do<00:04:00.140> now<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:00.709> take<00:04:01.130> that

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
we're going to do now is to take that

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.880 
we're going to do now is to take that
exact<00:04:01.760> pattern<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.450> add<00:04:03.320> a<00:04:03.350> couple<00:04:03.620> little

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
exact pattern and add a couple little

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.670 
exact pattern and add a couple little
guitar<00:04:04.550> istic<00:04:05.090> elements<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:06.380> make<00:04:06.560> it

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
guitar istic elements to it to make it

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.070 
guitar istic elements to it to make it
feel<00:04:06.860> more<00:04:07.070> like<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.280> real<00:04:07.490> guitar<00:04:07.640> part<00:04:08.090> in

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
feel more like a real guitar part in

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.140 
feel more like a real guitar part in
this<00:04:09.350> case<00:04:09.530> we're<00:04:09.709> going<00:04:09.800> to<00:04:09.860> add<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.520> 13<00:04:10.940> to

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
this case we're going to add the 13 to

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.970 
this case we're going to add the 13 to
that<00:04:11.300> nine<00:04:11.510> chord<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:11.959> C<00:04:11.990> sharp<00:04:12.320> up<00:04:12.560> on<00:04:12.740> top

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
that nine chord the C sharp up on top

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.710 
that nine chord the C sharp up on top
and<00:04:13.280> it's<00:04:13.850> going<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.000> give<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:14.270> kind<00:04:14.420> of<00:04:14.570> a

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
and it's going to give it kind of a

groove staple and it's exactly the same
time<00:04:45.940> same<00:04:46.330> feel<00:04:46.660> everything<00:04:47.169> just<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.500> little

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
time same feel everything just a little

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.969 
time same feel everything just a little
bit<00:04:47.860> of<00:04:47.950> variation<00:04:48.190> on<00:04:48.550> what<00:04:48.700> we<00:04:48.820> did<00:04:49.979> two

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
bit of variation on what we did two

00:04:50.979 --> 00:05:04.440 
bit of variation on what we did two
three<00:04:51.729> boom<00:05:02.940> great<00:05:03.940> so<00:05:04.090> now<00:05:04.180> we're<00:05:04.300> going<00:05:04.389> to

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
three boom great so now we're going to

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.750 
three boom great so now we're going to
take<00:05:04.660> those<00:05:04.900> two<00:05:05.290> patterns<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:06.010> we're<00:05:06.639> going

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
take those two patterns and we're going

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.010 
take those two patterns and we're going
to<00:05:06.790> combine<00:05:07.090> them<00:05:07.419> actually<00:05:07.750> we're<00:05:07.810> going<00:05:07.930> to

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
to combine them actually we're going to

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.680 
to combine them actually we're going to
alternate<00:05:08.530> them<00:05:08.710> four<00:05:09.700> times<00:05:09.940> each<00:05:10.180> for<00:05:10.660> a

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
alternate them four times each for a

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.990 
alternate them four times each for a
total<00:05:10.720> of<00:05:11.050> eight<00:05:11.229> bars<00:05:11.530> now<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.550> one<00:05:12.790> thing

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
total of eight bars now the one thing

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.700 
total of eight bars now the one thing
that's<00:05:13.180> going<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.389> change<00:05:13.660> is<00:05:14.080> that<00:05:14.290> for<00:05:14.560> each

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
that's going to change is that for each

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.650 
that's going to change is that for each
of<00:05:14.919> these<00:05:15.040> patterns<00:05:15.639> we're<00:05:16.210> going<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.389> drop

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
of these patterns we're going to drop

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.330 
of these patterns we're going to drop
the<00:05:16.870> downbeat<00:05:17.350> and<00:05:17.470> when<00:05:17.830> you're<00:05:17.950> playing<00:05:18.130> odd

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
the downbeat and when you're playing odd

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.740 
the downbeat and when you're playing odd
meters<00:05:18.639> sometimes<00:05:18.820> that's<00:05:19.210> kind<00:05:19.330> of<00:05:19.479> a<00:05:19.570> cool

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
meters sometimes that's kind of a cool

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.080 
meters sometimes that's kind of a cool
device<00:05:19.960> because<00:05:20.620> you<00:05:20.830> don't<00:05:21.280> always<00:05:21.580> want<00:05:22.000> to

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
device because you don't always want to

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.779 
device because you don't always want to
mark<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.450> downbeat<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:22.930> give<00:05:23.200> it<00:05:23.350> away<00:05:23.440> so

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
mark the downbeat and give it away so

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.010 
mark the downbeat and give it away so
we're<00:05:24.789> going<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:24.940> play<00:05:25.120> those<00:05:25.360> two<00:05:25.419> patterns

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
we're going to play those two patterns

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.380 
we're going to play those two patterns
drop<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.740> downbeat<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:28.030> temple<00:05:28.330> is

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
drop the downbeat and the temple is

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.270 
drop the downbeat and the temple is
going<00:05:28.510> to<00:05:28.570> going<00:05:29.560> to<00:05:29.590> go<00:05:29.710> up<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:29.950> little<00:05:29.979> bit

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
going to going to go up a little bit

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:51.230 
going to going to go up a little bit
like<00:05:30.610> ten<00:05:30.850> clicks<00:05:31.180> here<00:05:31.450> we<00:05:31.539> go

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.620 

there<00:05:52.240> you<00:05:52.360> are

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
there you are
