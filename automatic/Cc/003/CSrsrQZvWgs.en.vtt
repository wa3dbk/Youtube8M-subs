00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.860
 welcome to the first cello tutorial 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.900
 alternative this time we'll talk 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.969
 how to play blues in elche then 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.919
 first part since there will be other parts 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.349
 where we will explain some other 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.669
 elements of the blues first thing we're going 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.830
 to learn today is how to 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.420
 make up a blues we will talk about the return 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.240
 traditional or the basic turn of blues 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.240
 which is composed of 12 measures and only 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.080
 they use three degrees of the scale 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.359
 accommodated in different ways than 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.599
 inhabit we will see how these are accommodated 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.800
 three degrees is the first grade with its 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.260
 seventh minor is to say a chord 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.149
 dominant of the first degree a chord of 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.059
 dominant fourth grade and a chord 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.030
 of fifth degree dominant what is the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.010
 arrangement then of the return of 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.910
 good blues as an example we'll see 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.469
 about the scale of two then it would be a 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.210
 alive greater with seventh minor is the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.059
 first grade we would play four bars 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.260
 from willing that we would do two 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.260
 fourth degree compasses 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.590
 we return to two bars of the first 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.080
 grade 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.810
 we play a fifth degree compass 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.229
 a compass of the fourth degree 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.050
 a compass of the first degree and finally 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.270
 a compass fifth grade again 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.190
 very good since we have the structure of 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.440
 in this case the cross return now 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.390
 we'll talk a little about boxing or 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.760
 chords as they are arranged in the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.650
 good cello cello in case it 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.410
 we have four ropes so only 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.480
 so we can use four notes to 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.100
 sometimes sometimes three notes and so on 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.260
 this time I decided to omit the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.420
 fifth truth since I want to give it better 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.160
 a color now get the notes that it gives 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.750
 the color and according to the notes 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.710
 important that give you the characteristic 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.330
 of the rope that is the fundamental the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.820
 It can be applied with rope 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.300
 fourth the good after I have here the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.300
 seventh 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.039
 that is the bag that I will use 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.350
 done well also used it for 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:06.390
 the lack agreement because the fa 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.280
 funk and we see the and there I have then the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.840
 disposition how to play the fifth grade 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.140
 the agreement of the good sun we have two 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.370
 options for this occasion we can play 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.440
 only the air is seventh and third 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.660
 sometimes we can vary it with only the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.269
 air again the third now in the co 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.990
 the second and the seventh of the string 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.120
 first 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.550
 ok very well we will talk outside a little bit of 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.070
 the accompaniment first we're going to 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.070
 do what is called forbid they are 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.320
 play the four bars in the case of 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.520
 four quarter note in black in 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.720
 this time we will use the thumb 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.490
 and let's do then they will know the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.850
 black for this we are going to use the 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.850
 metronome 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:57.260
 23 42 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.320
 22 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.190
 this was the complete turn now this 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.360
 what I just did was fortuitous does not want 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.190
 say that you always have to accompany 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.290
 A green flower to the sun forbid is used 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.210
 more when it's jazz blues true 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.940
 sometimes there is the tube 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.650
 but there is also a structure a 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.470
 little bit more when we play a cruise 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.320
 with faster 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.510
 or it's blues or we want to vary the truth 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.210
 you can do a little more variation 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.410
 rhythmic I'm going to play the continuation 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.450
 rhythmic combinations where he used 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.980
 not only the thumb truth as a 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.720
 Cuba is to say as a pen towards 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.150
 below but you also use the index 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.450
 in the middle playing a bit more with rhythm 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.800
 to do it more with says 1 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.800
 one two three four
