greetings everyone it's great to see all

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.000 
greetings everyone it's great to see all
of<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.910> again<00:00:12.469> what<00:00:13.469> I'm<00:00:13.559> going<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.769> cover

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
of you again what I'm going to cover

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.550 
of you again what I'm going to cover
today<00:00:14.430> is<00:00:16.039> evolution<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.190> low-mass<00:00:17.609> stars<00:00:18.560> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
today is evolution of low-mass stars the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.490 
today is evolution of low-mass stars the
Sun<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> low-mass<00:00:20.520> star<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.390> what<00:00:22.320> you're

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
Sun is a low-mass star and what you're

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.159 
Sun is a low-mass star and what you're
about<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.770> see<00:00:23.130> really<00:00:23.550> portrays<00:00:24.119> what<00:00:24.660> will

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
about to see really portrays what will

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.210 
about to see really portrays what will
happen<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.890> Sun<00:00:26.480> Sun<00:00:27.480> today<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.470> about<00:00:28.890> 4

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
happen with the Sun Sun today is about 4

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.339 
happen with the Sun Sun today is about 4
billion<00:00:29.640> years<00:00:29.669> old<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.289> middle

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
billion years old so it's in the middle

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.940 
billion years old so it's in the middle
of<00:00:31.859> its<00:00:32.579> main<00:00:32.940> sequence<00:00:35.840> after<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.770> will

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
of its main sequence after that it will

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.189 
of its main sequence after that it will
continue<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.820> burn<00:00:39.000> as<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.480> does<00:00:39.720> for<00:00:39.989> above

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
continue to burn as it does for above

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.369 
continue to burn as it does for above
another<00:00:40.469> 4<00:00:40.859> billion<00:00:41.129> years<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.930> then<00:00:42.930> will

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
another 4 billion years and then will

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.090 
another 4 billion years and then will
happen<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.039> it<00:00:44.219> will<00:00:44.280> turn<00:00:44.609> into<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.090> red<00:00:45.420> giant

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
happen is it will turn into a red giant

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.430 
happen is it will turn into a red giant
it'll<00:00:47.100> go<00:00:47.309> through<00:00:47.550> different<00:00:48.059> phases<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it'll go through different phases as it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.150 
it'll go through different phases as it
does<00:00:49.649> different<00:00:50.190> things<00:00:50.809> related<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.199> what's

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
does different things related to what's

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.790 
does different things related to what's
happening<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.820> its<00:00:54.000> core<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.410> doing

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
happening in its core what it's doing

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.369 
happening in its core what it's doing
with<00:00:55.980> respect<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.789> fusing<00:00:57.570> helium<00:00:59.210> hydrogen

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
with respect to fusing helium hydrogen

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.349 
with respect to fusing helium hydrogen
other<00:01:01.379> things<00:01:01.769> eventually<00:01:02.210> it<00:01:03.210> will<00:01:03.300> turn

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
other things eventually it will turn

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.360 
other things eventually it will turn
into<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.620> nebula<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:06.530> then<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.740> will<00:01:07.890> start<00:01:08.190> to

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
into a nebula and then it will start to

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.940 
into a nebula and then it will start to
fade<00:01:08.670> away<00:01:08.900> into<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> white<00:01:10.440> dwarf<00:01:12.530> this<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
fade away into a white dwarf this is the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.630 
fade away into a white dwarf this is the
life<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:15.479> star<00:01:15.810> stars<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.710> Lawrence<00:01:17.100> started

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
life of a star stars of Lawrence started

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.590 
life of a star stars of Lawrence started
that<00:01:17.820> would<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.299> I'm<00:01:18.990> going<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.290> show<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
that would like I'm going to show you a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.760 
that would like I'm going to show you a
simulation<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:23.000> again<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.210> not

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
simulation of that again it's not

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.960 
simulation of that again it's not
perfectly<00:01:25.770> scientific<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:26.700> you'll

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
perfectly scientific but you'll

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
perfectly scientific but you'll
certainly<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.659> idea<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.890> various

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
certainly get the idea of the various

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.020 
certainly get the idea of the various
phases<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:30.000> notice<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> upper<00:01:32.030> right

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
phases you notice in the upper right

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.660 
phases you notice in the upper right
hand<00:01:33.060> corner<00:01:33.600> there's<00:01:34.200> an<00:01:34.380> HR<00:01:34.770> diagram<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.549> as

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
hand corner there's an HR diagram and as

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.719 
hand corner there's an HR diagram and as
this<00:01:35.939> simulation<00:01:36.899> goes<00:01:37.380> through<00:01:37.770> you'll<00:01:38.399> see

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
this simulation goes through you'll see

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.600 
this simulation goes through you'll see
the<00:01:39.210> different<00:01:39.689> places<00:01:40.140> where<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.280> star

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the different places where the star

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.120 
the different places where the star
appears<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> HR<00:01:42.899> diagram<00:01:42.990> again<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.890> is

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
appears on the HR diagram again this is

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.910 
appears on the HR diagram again this is
for<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.520> star<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.420> one<00:01:45.659> solar<00:01:45.990> mass<00:01:46.110> which<00:01:46.890> is

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
for a star of one solar mass which is

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.420 
for a star of one solar mass which is
the<00:01:47.100> Sun<00:01:47.460> oh<00:01:47.939> by<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.329> way<00:01:48.680> does<00:01:49.680> mean<00:01:49.979> that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the Sun oh by the way does mean that

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.819 
the Sun oh by the way does mean that
we're<00:01:51.240> only<00:01:51.360> going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.869> able<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.469> live<00:01:52.740> on

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
we're only going to be able to live on

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.319 
we're only going to be able to live on
earth<00:01:53.450> for<00:01:54.450> about<00:01:54.539> another<00:01:54.810> 1<00:01:55.259> billion<00:01:55.560> years

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
earth for about another 1 billion years

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.670 
earth for about another 1 billion years
because<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.509> Sun<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.899> gradually<00:01:58.469> getting

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
because the Sun is gradually getting

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.999 
because the Sun is gradually getting
hotter<00:01:59.130> even<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.759> little<00:01:59.939> standing<00:02:00.600> sequence

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
hotter even a little standing sequence

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.609 
hotter even a little standing sequence
for<00:02:02.009> about<00:02:02.399> another<00:02:02.670> 4<00:02:03.090> billion<00:02:03.450> years<00:02:03.619> in

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
for about another 4 billion years in

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.620 
for about another 4 billion years in
about<00:02:04.979> 1<00:02:05.189> billion<00:02:05.430> years<00:02:05.789> it's<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.509> be

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
about 1 billion years it's going to be

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.010 
about 1 billion years it's going to be
way<00:02:06.840> too<00:02:06.869> hot<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:08.000> even<00:02:09.000> if<00:02:09.090> we<00:02:09.270> solve<00:02:09.539> global

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
way too hot so even if we solve global

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.700 
way too hot so even if we solve global
warming<00:02:10.619> with<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.610> next<00:02:12.000> century<00:02:12.390> or<00:02:12.420> two<00:02:12.720> in

the other billion years life will be

the other billion years life will be
unsustainable<00:02:17.489> on<00:02:18.030> earth

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640

of course we'll discuss some

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.730 
of course we'll discuss some
applications<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.990> them<00:02:23.200> later
