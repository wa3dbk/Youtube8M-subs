00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello youtube people from that baquero 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.890
 hey I'm scared fast to tell you 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.690
 which they are already available 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.450
 grand theft online features 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.330
 5 car if we play right now 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.039
 it's not going to come out that there's a new patch on 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.930
 which is very small, we lower it from a 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.490
 touch and you will not be able to enable 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.560
 online features of this game 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.300
 also at the time that I'm recording 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.789
 this video is almost twelve o'clock 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.039
 I still could not enter by 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.900
 either of the two reasons I think that a 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.300
 this height or are the serv are 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.559
 saturated that does not let more people in or 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.750
 directly they are not yet 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.160
 available to play at the end 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.020
 of the video are going to see the poster that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.879
 jump but I wanted to comment that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.280
 the moment we are going to be able to do our 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.960
 thing that I do not recommend 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.090
 do it right now because it's not going to 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.190
 save is to say for example if what 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.480
 we do everything and we put it to keep 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.730
 it will not be saved in the cloud 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.070
 Rockstar online but it will stay 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 saved on our hard drive 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.690
 console but in the long run it will not be able to 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.670
 be registered to play online 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.290
 what I recommend for now for the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.420
 moment surely in the next 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.799
 this is going to solve 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.900
 what I recommend for the moment is 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.210
 keep playing offline keep playing 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.070
 the campaign mode of this game or if not 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.960
 enjoy in another game go and play 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.939
 conductive and to play fifa or al 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.890
 battlefield to what you want 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.440
 but at the moment we will not be able to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.930
 enter to play online and surely 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.119
 in the next few hours maybe at 8 9 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.909
 of Argentine night time or maybe 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.140
 before this is solved for the moment 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.610
 I will quickly show you what is 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.530
 can do at the time of lacoste 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.659
 humiliation of the characters by 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.950
 example we can choose the origin of 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.140
 our life say our 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.580
 descendants and that way we're going to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.979
 to be able to arm our character to our 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.899
 taste if we want it to be white 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.420
 or black hair color 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.830
 among other things later in another of the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.740
 sections we can choose the style of 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.319
 our life as we are going to devote the 24 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.420
 hours of our day that is we can 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.580
 select if we want to work more for 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.009
 the legal side is to dedicate 6 hours 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.850
 to the legal side or work more by the side 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.159
 illegal 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.049
 surely the drug trade another 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.910
 thing and also if we want to rest 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.250
 how many hours are we going to be able to devote to 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.290
 I also dream how long we want to go 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.299
 to party with our friends 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.099
 etcetera also part of the section 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.409
 origins we have the aspects section 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.170
 that if we can devote more resources to 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.000
 our character by age what kind 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.129
 of hair what hair color the beard the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.230
 hat the lenses is also good 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.420
 because we can choose the shirt of 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.280
 our club is to say the clan that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.569
 we have in the grand theft auto 'too 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.939
 the emblem if we want to put the 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.220
 shirt and all that I think they are handled 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.109
 rockstar social club I joined recently 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.939
 a clan of some friends or you can also 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.040
 build your own clan to your liking 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.049
 invite your friends of course I do not know 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.549
 if there is a club for Argentina armed and 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.680
 random or someone created a cross 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.359
 Argentina and people can join or 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.950
 ask for friendship request to enter 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.959
 so for all those who do not 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.329
 have a clan can join that the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.970
 Argentina or if not afterwards they can see with 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.349
 your friends if they build a clan or not for the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.329
 These are the aspects that 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.159
 they have the creation of the character are 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.810
 little bit to my opinion but equally 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.400
 surely you have to dedicate a lot 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.889
 online time to analyze it better 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.989
 the question is to be able to enter especially 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.700
 see what we can do supposedly goes 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.069
 have many missions because the online 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.140
 It seems that it is located 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.629
 to grand theft auto 5 events is 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.650
 say time before the true 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.049
 history of michael 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.030
 trevor and franklin and I think it's going to 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.920
 be much better than online the grand 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.499
 theft auto 4 now that nobody then 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.060
 I played and since I played it I was very bad 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.709
 people so I hope you liked it 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.099

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.180
