default<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.240> tweens<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.570> any<00:02:03.960> motion<00:02:04.439> I

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
default can be tweens in any motion I

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.440 
default can be tweens in any motion I
don't<00:02:05.159> fully<00:02:05.280> understand<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.939> either<00:02:06.240> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
guess since it's in this box it

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.350 
guess since it's in this box it
considers<00:02:10.950> itself<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.610> movie<00:02:12.000> clip<00:02:12.120> or
