00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.960 

so<00:00:14.540> I'm<00:00:14.750> just<00:00:14.930> going<00:00:15.170> to<00:00:15.550> start<00:00:16.550> out<00:00:16.640> with<00:00:16.760> some

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
so I'm just going to start out with some

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
so I'm just going to start out with some
chalk<00:00:17.240> we've<00:00:19.210> sure<00:00:20.210> how<00:00:20.390> much<00:00:20.600> to<00:00:20.780> put<00:00:20.930> in

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
chalk we've sure how much to put in

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.190 
chalk we've sure how much to put in
there<00:00:21.290> really<00:00:22.360> just<00:00:23.360> a<00:00:23.540> little<00:00:23.960> bit<00:00:24.080> the

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
there really just a little bit the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.130 
there really just a little bit the
conservative<00:00:28.510> the<00:00:29.510> wax<00:00:29.689> tries<00:00:29.990> really

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
conservative the wax tries really

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.560 
conservative the wax tries really
quickly<00:00:30.770> I<00:00:31.039> want<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:31.820> keep<00:00:31.940> it<00:00:32.090> pretty<00:00:32.210> thick

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
quickly I want to keep it pretty thick

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:45.720 
quickly I want to keep it pretty thick
so<00:00:32.930> I<00:00:33.290> guess<00:00:34.190> that<00:00:34.370> might<00:00:34.520> as<00:00:34.610> well<00:00:34.760> go<00:00:34.910> for<00:00:35.120> it

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.319 

it<00:00:46.540> didn't<00:00:46.840> really<00:00:47.110> blend<00:00:47.710> very<00:00:48.010> well<00:00:48.460> it

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
it didn't really blend very well it

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.030 
it didn't really blend very well it
doesn't<00:00:49.600> look<00:00:49.780> like<00:00:49.809> it's<00:00:50.079> gonna<00:00:50.230> soak<00:00:50.800> you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
doesn't look like it's gonna soak you

00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:09.179 
doesn't look like it's gonna soak you
know<00:00:51.100> all<00:00:51.610> that<00:00:51.820> good<00:00:54.180> we'll<00:00:55.180> see

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:15.520 

splinting<00:01:10.189> pretty<00:01:10.640> nicely<00:01:14.140> it's<00:01:15.140> blended

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
splinting pretty nicely it's blended

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.440 
splinting pretty nicely it's blended
pretty<00:01:16.040> well<00:01:16.250> but<00:01:16.580> it<00:01:16.700> doesn't<00:01:16.880> really<00:01:17.180> seem

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
pretty well but it doesn't really seem

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.030 
pretty well but it doesn't really seem
any<00:01:17.600> thicker<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.170> I'm<00:01:18.229> gonna<00:01:18.409> add<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.710> rest<00:01:18.740> of

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
any thicker so I'm gonna add the rest of

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:28.660 
any thicker so I'm gonna add the rest of
my<00:01:19.189> child<00:01:26.350> it<00:01:27.350> seems<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.740> work<00:01:27.950> pretty<00:01:27.979> well<00:01:28.220> so

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
my child it seems to work pretty well so

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.490 
my child it seems to work pretty well so
I'm<00:01:28.729> gonna<00:01:28.880> try<00:01:29.210> a<00:01:29.570> little<00:01:29.990> bit<00:01:30.080> more<00:01:30.350> than

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
I'm gonna try a little bit more than

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.240 
I'm gonna try a little bit more than
this<00:01:30.619> screaming<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.820> I<00:01:32.060> really<00:01:32.860> just<00:01:33.860> like<00:01:34.070> it

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
this screaming and I really just like it

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.870 
this screaming and I really just like it
max<00:01:34.520> out<00:01:36.729> yeah

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
max out yeah

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.370 
max out yeah
load<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.050> much<00:01:39.200> I<00:01:39.319> can<00:01:39.500> load<00:01:39.710> in<00:01:39.890> there<00:01:44.380> it

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
load so much I can load in there it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.010 
load so much I can load in there it
seems<00:01:45.619> like<00:01:45.770> this<00:01:45.920> Chuck<00:01:46.250> really<00:01:49.810> drove<00:01:50.810> us<00:01:50.929> a

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
seems like this Chuck really drove us a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:02:00.630 
seems like this Chuck really drove us a
long<00:01:51.200> ways

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:12.480 

so<00:02:01.640> here<00:02:02.119> we<00:02:02.210> go<00:02:03.369> see<00:02:04.369> how<00:02:04.490> this<00:02:04.640> works

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.670 

this<00:02:13.150> seemed<00:02:13.420> sicker

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.959 

I<00:02:16.769> mean<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.519> seemed<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.849> be<00:02:17.939> going<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:18.269> I

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:19.969 
I mean this seemed to be going on I

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.539 
I mean this seemed to be going on I
think<00:02:20.969> the<00:02:21.120> question<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.629> how<00:02:21.989> will<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:22.620> flat

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
think the question is how will it flat

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.410 
think the question is how will it flat
now<00:02:23.849> am<00:02:24.150> i<00:02:25.340> yeah<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.760> definitely<00:02:26.969> going<00:02:27.329> on

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
now am i yeah it's definitely going on

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:48.140 
now am i yeah it's definitely going on
thicker<00:02:29.209> it's<00:02:30.209> building<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.689> quickly

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.830 

there's<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.840> definite<00:02:49.290> grittiness<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:50.840> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
there's a definite grittiness to the the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.160 
there's a definite grittiness to the the
pain<00:02:52.110> as<00:02:52.319> well<00:02:52.940> but<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.629> mean<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:54.989> feels

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
pain as well but I like I mean it feels

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.410 
pain as well but I like I mean it feels
pretty<00:02:55.379> good

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.990 

I<00:03:00.510> mean<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.080> problem<00:03:01.290> with<00:03:02.069> with<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.580> patch

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
I mean the problem with with this patch

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.180 
I mean the problem with with this patch
right<00:03:03.270> here<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.690> it's<00:03:03.900> really<00:03:04.230> typical<00:03:04.410> now<00:03:04.890> it

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
right here is it's really typical now it

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.110 
right here is it's really typical now it
doesn't<00:03:06.830> it<00:03:07.830> doesn't<00:03:08.040> seem<00:03:08.310> like<00:03:08.489> it's<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.849> part

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
doesn't it doesn't seem like it's a part

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.410 
doesn't it doesn't seem like it's a part
of<00:03:09.270> they<00:03:10.370> typically<00:03:11.370> if<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.580> hold<00:03:11.760> my<00:03:11.849> brush<00:03:12.150> up

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
of they typically if I hold my brush up

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.260 
of they typically if I hold my brush up
like<00:03:12.599> this<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.989> don't<00:03:13.319> get<00:03:13.500> as<00:03:13.620> many<00:03:13.800> drips

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
like this I don't get as many drips

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.120 
like this I don't get as many drips
because<00:03:15.270> these<00:03:15.450> slots<00:03:15.870> seem<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.380> hold<00:03:16.530> the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
because these slots seem to hold the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.059 
because these slots seem to hold the
paint<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.520> little<00:03:17.730> bit<00:03:17.880> better<00:03:18.830> but<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:19.920> can

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
paint a little bit better but you can

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.090 
paint a little bit better but you can
see<00:03:20.370> how<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.630> wax<00:03:21.989> dries<00:03:22.440> fairly<00:03:22.709> quickly

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
see how the wax dries fairly quickly

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.660 
see how the wax dries fairly quickly
that's<00:03:24.000> quite<00:03:24.270> fascinating

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
that's quite fascinating

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.190 
that's quite fascinating
now<00:03:26.670> one<00:03:26.819> idea<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.660> build<00:03:28.350> up<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.800> pigment

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
now one idea is to build up the pigment

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.840 
now one idea is to build up the pigment
with<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.380> wax<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:32.010> then<00:03:32.130> kind<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.550> go<00:03:32.700> over

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
with the wax and then kind of go over

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.199 
with the wax and then kind of go over
the<00:03:32.940> top<00:03:33.180> with<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.450> thin<00:03:33.780> layer<00:03:33.959> that<00:03:34.019> might<00:03:34.530> be

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
the top with a thin layer that might be

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.910 
the top with a thin layer that might be
kind<00:03:36.209> of<00:03:36.269> adjust<00:03:36.630> some<00:03:37.080> like<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:37.739> can

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
kind of adjust some like you so I can

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.180 
kind of adjust some like you so I can
have<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> thick<00:03:39.090> mixture<00:03:39.620> with<00:03:40.620> this<00:03:40.799> thick<00:03:41.040> of

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
have a thick mixture with this thick of

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.690 
have a thick mixture with this thick of
pigment<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:41.640> can<00:03:41.790> almost<00:03:43.190> just<00:03:44.190> sort<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.459> dry

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
pigment I can almost just sort of dry

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.930 
pigment I can almost just sort of dry
brush<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:46.500> pigment<00:03:46.920> on<00:03:47.069> and<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.549> just<00:03:47.580> seems

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
brush the pigment on and it just seems

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.110 
brush the pigment on and it just seems
to<00:03:48.030> build<00:03:48.330> up<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:48.900> much<00:03:48.959> quicker<00:03:49.819> now<00:03:50.819> I<00:03:50.850> will

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
to build up so much quicker now I will

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.090 
to build up so much quicker now I will
have<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.450> fuse<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:51.959> on<00:03:52.140> that's<00:03:52.410> probably<00:03:52.860> not

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
have to fuse this on that's probably not

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.630 
have to fuse this on that's probably not
adequately<00:03:54.060> fused<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:54.810> by<00:03:54.900> fusing<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.739> just

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
adequately fused and by fusing I just

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.090 
adequately fused and by fusing I just
mean<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:56.850> it's<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.480> needs<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.810> be<00:03:57.959> heated<00:03:58.680> so

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
mean that it's it needs to be heated so

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.020 
mean that it's it needs to be heated so
that<00:03:59.250> the<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:01.739> layer<00:04:02.010> will<00:04:02.430> fuse<00:04:02.760> with<00:04:03.000> the

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
that the the layer will fuse with the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.670 
that the the layer will fuse with the
layer<00:04:03.299> beneath<00:04:03.569> it<00:04:05.870> before<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.959> try<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.200> blend<00:04:07.470> I

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
layer beneath it before I try to blend I

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.380 
layer beneath it before I try to blend I
want<00:04:07.859> to<00:04:07.950> see<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.900> will<00:04:10.200> scrape<00:04:10.410> off<00:04:10.709> oh<00:04:11.390> it's

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
want to see this will scrape off oh it's

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.690 
want to see this will scrape off oh it's
pretty<00:04:12.600> tough<00:04:12.920> it<00:04:13.920> seems<00:04:14.130> like<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.400> chalk<00:04:14.670> is

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
pretty tough it seems like the chalk is

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.479 
pretty tough it seems like the chalk is
toughened<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.540> film<00:04:15.810> actually<00:04:17.030> that's<00:04:18.030> uh

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
toughened of the film actually that's uh

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.130 
toughened of the film actually that's uh
it's<00:04:20.489> quite<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:20.789> sharp<00:04:21.209> tool<00:04:21.630> there<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.019> it's

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
it's quite a sharp tool there and it's

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:29.830 
it's quite a sharp tool there and it's
just<00:04:22.260> barely<00:04:26.000> interesting

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.540 

there<00:04:30.840> we<00:04:30.990> go<00:04:31.110> it's<00:04:31.590> just<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.980> tool<00:04:32.190> to<00:04:32.430> use

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
there we go it's just the tool to use

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.880 
there we go it's just the tool to use
right<00:04:32.820> here<00:04:34.280> yeah<00:04:35.280> this<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:35.610> where<00:04:35.790> it<00:04:35.880> can<00:04:36.000> get

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
right here yeah this is where it can get

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.380 
right here yeah this is where it can get
we<00:04:37.890> kind<00:04:38.100> of<00:04:38.160> break<00:04:38.340> up<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.700> edge<00:04:38.880> soften

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
we kind of break up that edge soften

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
we kind of break up that edge soften
that<00:04:39.480> edge<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.720> little<00:04:40.020> bit<00:04:42.020> scrape<00:04:43.020> down<00:04:43.200> to

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
that edge a little bit scrape down to

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:53.370 
that edge a little bit scrape down to
the<00:04:43.530> original<00:04:43.920> layer<00:04:46.640> it's<00:04:47.640> not<00:04:47.850> good

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.060 

and<00:04:53.920> it<00:04:54.040> seems<00:04:54.400> like<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.700> really<00:04:55.920> toughens<00:04:56.920> out

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
and it seems like it really toughens out

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.700 
and it seems like it really toughens out
of<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.190> pain<00:04:57.400> of<00:04:57.520> film<00:04:57.700> which<00:04:57.850> is<00:04:58.710> not

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
of the pain of film which is not

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.320 
of the pain of film which is not
completely<00:05:00.190> unexpected<00:05:00.910> that's<00:05:01.000> what<00:05:01.240> it

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
completely unexpected that's what it

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.130 
completely unexpected that's what it
does<00:05:01.480> with<00:05:01.720> oils<00:05:02.140> as<00:05:02.530> well<00:05:03.390> so<00:05:04.390> actually<00:05:04.960> I'm<00:05:05.050> a

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
does with oils as well so actually I'm a

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.450 
does with oils as well so actually I'm a
little<00:05:05.260> surprised<00:05:05.740> because<00:05:05.920> I<00:05:06.070> thought<00:05:06.280> it

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
little surprised because I thought it

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
little surprised because I thought it
might<00:05:06.670> make<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.950> paint<00:05:09.550> film<00:05:09.790> seem<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.360> little

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
might make the paint film seem a little

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.440 
might make the paint film seem a little
gritty<00:05:10.870> or<00:05:11.080> grainy<00:05:11.410> but<00:05:11.650> it<00:05:11.800> isn't<00:05:12.160> at<00:05:12.280> all<00:05:12.460> so

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
gritty or grainy but it isn't at all so

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.110 
gritty or grainy but it isn't at all so
it's<00:05:13.630> really<00:05:14.040> quite<00:05:15.040> surprising

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
it's really quite surprising

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.300 
it's really quite surprising
these<00:05:17.080> drips<00:05:17.380> are<00:05:17.590> very<00:05:17.800> hard<00:05:18.040> to<00:05:18.070> get<00:05:18.250> off

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
these drips are very hard to get off

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.550 
these drips are very hard to get off
though<00:05:18.730> they're<00:05:18.970> I<00:05:19.000> mean<00:05:19.260> it<00:05:20.260> just<00:05:20.410> really

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
though they're I mean it just really

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.010 
though they're I mean it just really
makes<00:05:20.980> this<00:05:21.160> sticky<00:05:22.770> sticky<00:05:23.770> sticky

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
makes this sticky sticky sticky

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:35.310 
makes this sticky sticky sticky
interesting<00:05:33.330> okay<00:05:34.330> well<00:05:34.630> I'm<00:05:34.750> going<00:05:34.990> to<00:05:35.080> use

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
interesting okay well I'm going to use

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.350 
interesting okay well I'm going to use
the<00:05:35.560> heat<00:05:36.070> gun<00:05:36.810> cleaned<00:05:37.810> up<00:05:37.930> this<00:05:38.080> round<00:05:39.360> so

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
the heat gun cleaned up this round so

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.240 
the heat gun cleaned up this round so
I'm<00:05:40.660> expecting<00:05:41.350> this<00:05:41.470> to<00:05:41.740> soften<00:05:41.980> enough

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
I'm expecting this to soften enough

00:05:42.250 --> 00:06:01.110 
I'm expecting this to soften enough
considerably<00:05:42.970> see

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.360 

but<00:06:02.110> it's<00:06:02.860> it's<00:06:03.220> softening<00:06:03.790> the<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:05.020> wax<00:06:05.370> that

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
but it's it's softening the the wax that

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.340 
but it's it's softening the the wax that
doesn't<00:06:06.729> have<00:06:06.820> a<00:06:06.850> chalk<00:06:07.150> first<00:06:07.540> so<00:06:07.930> it's<00:06:08.260> a

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
doesn't have a chalk first so it's a

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.260 
doesn't have a chalk first so it's a
little<00:06:08.440> tricky<00:06:09.120> that<00:06:10.120> way<00:06:10.300> but<00:06:12.120> so<00:06:13.120> it's

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
little tricky that way but so it's

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.659 
little tricky that way but so it's
working<00:06:13.540> pretty<00:06:13.660> good<00:06:13.780> the<00:06:14.680> only<00:06:14.830> thing<00:06:15.040> I<00:06:15.280> can

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
working pretty good the only thing I can

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.879 
working pretty good the only thing I can
complain<00:06:16.090> about<00:06:16.150> here<00:06:16.630> is<00:06:16.870> that<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:20.139> non

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
complain about here is that the the non

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.580 
complain about here is that the the non
chalk<00:06:21.340> pigment<00:06:22.889> melts<00:06:23.889> a<00:06:23.979> lot<00:06:24.130> sooner<00:06:24.490> than

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
chalk pigment melts a lot sooner than

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.290 
chalk pigment melts a lot sooner than
the<00:06:28.620> the<00:06:29.620> chalky<00:06:30.100> pigment<00:06:30.520> which<00:06:30.669> which<00:06:31.090> could

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
the the chalky pigment which which could

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.719 
the the chalky pigment which which could
be<00:06:31.449> a<00:06:31.479> problem<00:06:31.750> I<00:06:32.080> mean<00:06:32.190> what<00:06:33.190> I<00:06:33.220> might<00:06:33.460> need<00:06:33.580> to

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
be a problem I mean what I might need to

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.540 
be a problem I mean what I might need to
do<00:06:33.820> is<00:06:33.970> get<00:06:34.180> one<00:06:34.210> of<00:06:34.389> those<00:06:34.830> plumbers<00:06:35.830> heaters

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
do is get one of those plumbers heaters

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.270 
do is get one of those plumbers heaters
and<00:06:36.789> use<00:06:37.150> a<00:06:37.180> torch<00:06:37.960> on<00:06:38.199> here<00:06:38.500> so<00:06:39.070> I<00:06:39.130> have<00:06:39.250> a

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
and use a torch on here so I have a

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.080 
and use a torch on here so I have a
little<00:06:39.460> bit<00:06:39.639> more<00:06:39.850> accurate<00:06:40.660> heating<00:06:41.590> of<00:06:42.090> the

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
little bit more accurate heating of the

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.540 
little bit more accurate heating of the
areas<00:06:43.500> the<00:06:44.500> theory<00:06:44.860> here's<00:06:45.070> working<00:06:45.400> pretty

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
areas the theory here's working pretty

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.020 
areas the theory here's working pretty
good<00:06:45.990> actually<00:06:46.990> I<00:06:47.430> don't<00:06:48.430> think<00:06:48.639> I<00:06:48.910> don't

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
good actually I don't think I don't

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.370 
good actually I don't think I don't
think<00:06:49.180> there's<00:06:49.449> much<00:06:49.630> problem<00:06:50.110> with<00:06:50.139> the

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
think there's much problem with the

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.939 
think there's much problem with the
theory<00:06:54.120> so<00:06:55.120> I<00:06:55.150> conclude<00:06:55.810> that<00:06:55.840> adding<00:06:56.680> chopped

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:56.949 
theory so I conclude that adding chopped

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:00.480 
theory so I conclude that adding chopped
to<00:06:57.190> encaustic<00:06:57.910> is<00:06:58.120> a<00:06:58.570> safe<00:06:59.289> practice<00:06:59.530> and<00:07:00.130> it

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
to encaustic is a safe practice and it

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.330 
to encaustic is a safe practice and it
actually<00:07:01.110> strengthens<00:07:02.110> the<00:07:02.410> paint<00:07:02.650> film<00:07:02.889> so

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
actually strengthens the paint film so

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.029 
actually strengthens the paint film so
I'll<00:07:04.090> be<00:07:04.240> using<00:07:04.389> this<00:07:04.720> in<00:07:05.229> future<00:07:05.440> paintings

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 
I'll be using this in future paintings

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:10.170 
I'll be using this in future paintings
and<00:07:06.280> I<00:07:07.410> hope<00:07:08.410> you<00:07:08.620> will<00:07:09.400> give<00:07:09.550> it<00:07:09.669> a<00:07:09.729> try<00:07:09.880> and
