00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
and you know this is a first sample and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.590 
and you know this is a first sample and
I<00:02:48.040> have<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.280> say<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.760> very<00:02:48.940> first<00:02:49.180> sample

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
I have to say for the very first sample

they hit it dead on you know so I look

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.920 
they hit it dead on you know so I look
forward<00:02:51.609> to<00:02:51.700> seeing<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.000> finished<00:02:52.150> product<00:02:52.660> I

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
forward to seeing the finished product I

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.789 
forward to seeing the finished product I
mean<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.670> am<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.930> material<00:02:55.930> choices<00:02:56.170> basically

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
mean I am I material choices basically

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.440 
mean I am I material choices basically
we're<00:02:56.920> like<00:02:57.010> nylon<00:02:57.519> ripstop<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:58.060> little<00:02:58.359> bit

more<00:02:58.569> breathable<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.230> like<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.190> suede<00:03:00.549> and<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
more breathable I like the suede and the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.150

the<00:03:01.660> new<00:03:01.810> book<00:03:02.019> together<00:03:02.200> because<00:03:02.709> i<00:03:02.829> think<00:03:02.890> it

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
the new book together because i think it

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.670 
the new book together because i think it
just<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:04.150> takes<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.720> shoe<00:03:04.989> in<00:03:05.019> a<00:03:05.290> completely

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
just it takes a shoe in a completely

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.970 
just it takes a shoe in a completely
different<00:03:05.769> direction<00:03:06.900> they'll<00:03:07.900> for<00:03:08.709> what<00:03:08.859> I'm

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
different direction they'll for what I'm

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.979 
different direction they'll for what I'm
working<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.430> there<00:03:09.549> may<00:03:09.670> be<00:03:09.700> colorways<00:03:10.569> and

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
working and there may be colorways and

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.170 
working and there may be colorways and
this<00:03:11.560> color<00:03:11.859> palette<00:03:12.310> may<00:03:12.430> translate<00:03:12.910> into

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
this color palette may translate into

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.740 
this color palette may translate into
maybe<00:03:14.079> a<00:03:14.200> headphone

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
maybe a headphone

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.720 
maybe a headphone
you<00:03:16.750> know<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.049> we're<00:03:17.739> working<00:03:17.920> on<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.340> now<00:03:18.370> we

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
you know so we're working on it now we

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.100 
you know so we're working on it now we
