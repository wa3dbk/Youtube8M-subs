00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.859 
to do something like honesty and so I
might<00:01:36.000> say<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.270> know<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.840> things

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
might say you know one of the things

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
might say you know one of the things
that<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> think<00:01:37.590> makes<00:01:38.100> us<00:01:38.280> feel<00:01:38.460> really<00:01:38.790> strong

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that I think makes us feel really strong

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.819 
that I think makes us feel really strong
is<00:01:39.299> how<00:01:39.420> we're<00:01:39.600> honest<00:01:39.960> even<00:01:40.200> when<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.680> hard

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
is how we're honest even when it's hard

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.340 
is how we're honest even when it's hard
to<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.130> honest<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.509> I'm<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.020> cut<00:01:43.229> out
