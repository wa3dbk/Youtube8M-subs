00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.990 
not really fixed it looks bad that's
because<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.239> lg<00:03:33.480> optimus<00:03:33.680> one<00:03:34.680> has<00:03:35.580> a

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
because the lg optimus one has a

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.449 
because the lg optimus one has a
different<00:03:38.750> graphics<00:03:39.750> card<00:03:39.930> or<00:03:40.049> GPU<00:03:40.380> in<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
different graphics card or GPU in the

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.520 
different graphics card or GPU in the
system<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.120> requires<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:43.019> different<00:03:43.170> driver

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
system and requires a different driver

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.009 
system and requires a different driver
which<00:03:43.859> we<00:03:44.549> just<00:03:44.790> don't<00:03:44.970> have<00:03:45.180> on<00:03:45.450> this<00:03:45.750> phone

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
which we just don't have on this phone

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.830 
which we just don't have on this phone
so<00:03:46.829> what<00:03:46.980> we're<00:03:47.100> gonna<00:03:47.160> do<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.519> install<00:03:47.819> a<00:03:47.880> so

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
here we go Android version 2.3 point

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.270 
here we go Android version 2.3 point
seven<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.470> baseband<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.620> course<00:03:52.859> is<00:03:52.980> unknown

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
seven and baseband of course is unknown

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.520 
seven and baseband of course is unknown
so<00:03:54.090> we're<00:03:54.180> gonna<00:03:54.269> reboot<00:03:54.750> back<00:03:54.989> into<00:03:55.290> recovery

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
to be extra safe but it's not needed all

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.000

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.270 
right we're gonna reboot into phone
again<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:56.110> you'll<00:04:57.110> see<00:04:57.260> that<00:04:57.350> me<00:04:57.530> but<00:04:57.889> it<00:04:58.130> is

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
again and you'll see that me but it is

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:40.629 
again and you'll see that me but it is
running<00:04:58.460> perfectly

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.879 

all<00:05:41.240> right<00:05:41.449> some<00:05:41.840> changes<00:05:42.289> you<00:05:42.319> can<00:05:42.469> see<00:05:42.710> is

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
all right some changes you can see is

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.700 
all right some changes you can see is
that<00:05:43.129> you<00:05:44.030> can<00:05:44.090> we<00:05:44.419> notice<00:05:44.810> difference<00:05:45.379> but

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
that you can we notice difference but

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.209 
that you can we notice difference but
the<00:05:46.370> color<00:05:46.729> it's<00:05:47.509> actually<00:05:48.020> fixed<00:05:48.409> now<00:05:48.560> all

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
the color it's actually fixed now all

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.129 
the color it's actually fixed now all
those<00:05:49.400> blue<00:05:49.759> lost<00:05:50.000> time<00:05:50.210> too<00:05:50.419> so<00:05:50.750> we're<00:05:50.960> gonna

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
those blue lost time too so we're gonna

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:59.610 
those blue lost time too so we're gonna
wait<00:05:51.289> for<00:05:51.349> it<00:05:51.530> to<00:05:51.620> boot

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.770 

alright<00:06:00.620> so<00:06:01.129> let's<00:06:01.400> just<00:06:01.460> continue<00:06:01.789> giving<00:06:02.509> it

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
alright so let's just continue giving it

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.040 
alright so let's just continue giving it
time<00:06:03.759> I'll<00:06:04.759> probably<00:06:05.180> fix<00:06:05.539> itself<00:06:05.810> up

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
time I'll probably fix itself up

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.080 
time I'll probably fix itself up
eventually

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
eventually

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.029 
eventually
okay<00:06:08.120> and<00:06:08.599> I<00:06:08.689> think<00:06:08.870> it<00:06:09.169> does<00:06:09.319> take<00:06:09.500> a<00:06:09.560> while<00:06:09.740> to

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
okay and I think it does take a while to

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:17.519 
okay and I think it does take a while to
start<00:06:10.280> up<00:06:11.710> but<00:06:12.710> okay<00:06:13.580> it's<00:06:13.849> almost<00:06:13.969> done<00:06:14.210> now

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:25.010 

or<00:06:18.529> maybe<00:06:18.800> not

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.360 

all<00:06:26.020> right<00:06:26.229> so<00:06:26.439> now<00:06:26.620> that<00:06:26.680> we're<00:06:26.919> done<00:06:27.039> booting

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
all right so now that we're done booting

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:35.329 
all right so now that we're done booting
up<00:06:27.490> as<00:06:28.120> you<00:06:28.300> can<00:06:28.389> see<00:06:28.449> the<00:06:28.809> color<00:06:29.110> is<00:06:30.749> fixed<00:06:31.749> now

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:35.339 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:38.909 

so<00:06:36.870> really<00:06:37.870> nice<00:06:38.020> we're<00:06:38.559> going<00:06:38.680> to<00:06:38.740> check<00:06:38.830> the

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
so really nice we're going to check the

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.619 
so really nice we're going to check the
setting<00:06:39.219> skins<00:06:39.490> just<00:06:39.580> to<00:06:39.939> make<00:06:40.089> sure<00:06:40.360> that

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:40.629 
setting skins just to make sure that

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:43.769 
setting skins just to make sure that
everything<00:06:41.409> is<00:06:41.589> indeed<00:06:41.979> still<00:06:42.819> the<00:06:43.360> same<00:06:43.569> as

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:43.779 
everything is indeed still the same as

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:46.350 
everything is indeed still the same as
you<00:06:44.439> can<00:06:44.559> see<00:06:44.740> Android<00:06:45.099> phone<00:06:45.370> two<00:06:46.120> point

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
you can see Android phone two point

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.149 
you can see Android phone two point
three<00:06:46.779> point<00:06:47.020> two<00:06:47.469> point<00:06:47.740> three<00:06:47.800> point<00:06:47.979> seven

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:48.159 
three point two point three point seven

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:50.610 
three point two point three point seven
which<00:06:48.430> is<00:06:48.460> Gingerbread<00:06:49.089> but<00:06:50.080> this<00:06:50.229> will<00:06:50.409> work
