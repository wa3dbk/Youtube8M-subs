let me explain what we're doing here in
1969<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.460> astronauts<00:00:32.879> on<00:00:33.030> Apollo<00:00:33.059> 11

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
1969 the astronauts on Apollo 11

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.510 
1969 the astronauts on Apollo 11
positioned<00:00:34.230> reflectors<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:34.980> surface<00:00:35.399> of

positioned reflectors on the surface of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.650 
positioned reflectors on the surface of
the<00:00:35.579> moon<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.910> we're<00:00:36.000> gonna<00:00:36.090> shoot<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.449> laser

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
the moon and we're gonna shoot a laser

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.540 
the moon and we're gonna shoot a laser
off<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> them<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.829> let<00:00:37.949> the<00:00:38.070> light<00:00:38.190> bounce

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
off one of them and let the light bounce

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.840 
off one of them and let the light bounce

one<00:00:42.899> question<00:00:43.250> how<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.519> sure<00:00:44.550> it

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
one question how can you be sure it

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.630 
one question how can you be sure it
won't<00:00:45.000> blow<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.150> a<00:00:46.640> laser<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.120> moon

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.599 

see<00:00:52.329> now<00:00:52.480> this<00:00:52.749> is<00:00:52.809> a<00:00:53.050> man<00:00:53.320> for<00:00:53.620> penny

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
see now this is a man for penny

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.779 
see now this is a man for penny
that's<00:00:56.570> great<00:00:57.109> question<00:00:57.589> Zach<00:00:57.920> no<00:00:58.399> it's<00:00:58.609> not

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
play nice what's not a great question

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.240 
play nice what's not a great question
how<00:01:02.719> could<00:01:02.870> somebody<00:01:03.079> possibly<00:01:03.469> think<00:01:04.100> we're

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
how could somebody possibly think we're

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.109 
how could somebody possibly think we're
going<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.519> blow<00:01:04.699> up<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.030> moon<00:01:06.700> that's<00:01:07.700> a<00:01:07.909> great

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
going to blow up the moon that's a great

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.260 
going to blow up the moon that's a great
question

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
question

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.910 
question
don't<00:01:11.270> worry<00:01:11.450> about<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.899> moon<00:01:12.020> we<00:01:12.229> we<00:01:12.560> set<00:01:12.799> our

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
don't worry about the moon we we set our

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.010 
don't worry about the moon we we set our
laser<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.399> stun<00:01:14.530> smart<00:01:16.330> now<00:01:17.330> we'll<00:01:17.600> be<00:01:17.720> able<00:01:17.840> to

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
laser to stun smart now we'll be able to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.450 
laser to stun smart now we'll be able to
see<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.320> beam<00:01:18.500> when<00:01:18.649> it<00:01:18.740> leaves<00:01:18.950> but<00:01:19.250> it<00:01:19.340> won't

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
see the beam when it leaves but it won't

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.679 
see the beam when it leaves but it won't
be<00:01:19.549> strong<00:01:19.759> enough<00:01:19.970> when<00:01:20.119> it<00:01:20.210> comes<00:01:20.420> back<00:01:20.630> to

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
be strong enough when it comes back to

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:21.940 
be strong enough when it comes back to
be<00:01:20.930> seen<00:01:21.080> by<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.289> naked<00:01:21.439> eye

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
be seen by the naked eye

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.940 
be seen by the naked eye
naked

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.690 

funny<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.990> device<00:01:32.350> there<00:01:32.740> will<00:01:33.100> measure<00:01:33.490> the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
funny that device there will measure the

funny that device there will measure the
photons<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.210> return<00:01:34.510> and<00:01:34.780> let<00:01:34.900> us<00:01:34.990> see<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.170> on

this computer Raj get them some glasses

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:45.830 
this computer Raj get them some glasses
cool<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:38.650> be<00:01:38.830> in<00:01:38.890> 3d

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.980 

preparing<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> fire<00:01:47.250> laser<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> moon

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
preparing to fire laser at the moon

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.840 
preparing to fire laser at the moon
make<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.409> so

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.539 

there's<00:01:55.850> this<00:01:55.970> fight<00:01:57.009> 2.5<00:01:58.009> seconds<00:01:58.369> for<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
there's this fight 2.5 seconds for the

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.840 
there's this fight 2.5 seconds for the
light<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:58.700> return<00:01:59.030> that's<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.509> moon<00:01:59.689> we

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.669 

that's<00:02:04.850> your<00:02:05.000> big<00:02:05.119> experiment<00:02:08.229> yeah<00:02:09.229> but

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
that's your big experiment yeah but

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.280 
that's your big experiment yeah but
think<00:02:10.160> about<00:02:10.399> what<00:02:10.880> this<00:02:11.060> represents<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
think about what this represents the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.110 
think about what this represents the
fact<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.650> we<00:02:12.739> can<00:02:12.920> do<00:02:13.069> this<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.580> only<00:02:13.760> way

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
fact that we can do this is the only way

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.760 
fact that we can do this is the only way
of<00:02:14.150> definitively<00:02:14.959> proving<00:02:15.470> that<00:02:15.590> there<00:02:15.739> are

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
of definitively proving that there are

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.280 
of definitively proving that there are
man-made<00:02:15.860> objects<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.120> moon<00:02:17.300> put<00:02:18.140> there

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
man-made objects on the moon put there

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.110 
man-made objects on the moon put there
by<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.500> member<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:19.040> species<00:02:19.280> at<00:02:19.580> only<00:02:19.700> 60

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
by a member of a species at only 60

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.490 
by a member of a species at only 60
years<00:02:20.150> before<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:20.630> just<00:02:20.930> invented<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
years before I just invented the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.330 
years before I just invented the
airplane<00:02:22.209> what<00:02:23.209> species<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:27.310> wrong

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
airplane what species is that wrong

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.319 
airplane what species is that wrong
penny<00:02:29.060> can<00:02:29.239> do<00:02:29.390> better<00:02:32.319> thanks
