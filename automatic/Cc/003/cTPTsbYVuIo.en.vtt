playing<00:02:13.110> around<00:02:13.230> right<00:02:13.560> now<00:02:13.680> they're<00:02:14.640> gonna

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
playing around right now they're gonna

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.610 
playing around right now they're gonna
do<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> hard<00:02:15.510> push<00:02:15.840> forward<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.349> think<00:02:16.530> this

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
do a hard push forward and I think this

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.650 
do a hard push forward and I think this
is<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> very<00:02:16.950> wise<00:02:17.130> idea

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
is a very wise idea

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.059 
is a very wise idea
Skelly<00:02:18.660> King<00:02:18.840> stepping<00:02:19.260> forward<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:19.920> they're

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069

comment here made on the manners so I

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.090 
comment here made on the manners so I
didn't<00:03:26.220> exactly<00:03:26.609> see<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.560> Skelly<00:03:28.560> king<00:03:28.799> pops

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
didn't exactly see that Skelly king pops

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.530 
didn't exactly see that Skelly king pops
his<00:03:29.340> armlet<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:29.819> they're<00:03:30.000> gonna<00:03:30.090> try<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.420> take

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
his armlet and they're gonna try to take

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.599 
his armlet and they're gonna try to take
out<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:31.019> barracks<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.040> hopefully<00:03:32.370> take<00:03:32.489> out

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
out this barracks and hopefully take out

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.160 
out this barracks and hopefully take out
the<00:03:32.700> other<00:03:32.819> barracks<00:03:33.120> as<00:03:33.269> well<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:34.140> think

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
the other barracks as well and I think

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.449 
the other barracks as well and I think
this<00:03:34.470> games<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.769> little<00:03:34.859> bit<00:03:35.069> out<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.280> reach

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
this games a little bit out of reach

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.400 
this games a little bit out of reach
especially<00:03:35.880> because<00:03:35.970> at<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.299> point<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.780> lyric

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
especially because at this point a lyric

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.840 
especially because at this point a lyric
is<00:03:37.500> such<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.739> great<00:03:38.069> lake<00:03:38.310> carry<00:03:38.579> with<00:03:38.700> this

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
is such a great lake carry with this

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.220 
is such a great lake carry with this
life<00:03:39.060> stealing's<00:03:39.480> crit<00:03:41.840> this<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:42.959> gonna<00:03:43.079> be

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
life stealing's crit this is gonna be

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.690 
life stealing's crit this is gonna be
tough<00:03:43.440> for<00:03:45.799> really<00:03:46.799> tough<00:03:47.010> for<00:03:47.190> not<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.519> come

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
tough for really tough for not to come

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.509 
tough for really tough for not to come
back<00:03:47.880> from<00:03:48.030> this

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
back from this

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.920 
back from this
so<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.670> replicant<00:03:51.150> has<00:03:51.239> been<00:03:51.389> made<00:03:51.630> by

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
so the replicant has been made by

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.720 
so the replicant has been made by
morphling<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.799> he's<00:03:52.889> going<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.160> trudge<00:03:53.430> away

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
morphling and he's going to trudge away

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.300 
morphling and he's going to trudge away
maybe<00:03:54.420> he<00:03:54.630> might<00:03:54.780> catch<00:03:54.930> an<00:03:55.109> opportunity<00:03:55.769> to

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
maybe he might catch an opportunity to

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.610 
maybe he might catch an opportunity to
pounce<00:03:56.609> in<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.090> take<00:03:57.239> out<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.720> low<00:03:58.410> health

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
pounce in and take out a low health

firing<00:04:37.040> somewhere<00:04:37.310> else<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.640> think<00:04:37.880> at<00:04:38.120> this

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
firing somewhere else I think at this

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.580 
firing somewhere else I think at this
point<00:04:38.360> Effie<00:04:38.840> knows<00:04:39.050> they've<00:04:39.260> won<00:04:39.470> and

his arm light activated he actually does
680<00:04:44.150> crits<00:04:44.450> so<00:04:44.920> that's<00:04:45.920> enough<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.460> eat

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
680 crits so that's enough to eat

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.200 
King is he's at 300 the crows bring him
something

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
something

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.990 
something
an<00:04:59.330> entire<00:04:59.870> BKB<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:01.070> is<00:05:01.250> exactly<00:05:01.669> what<00:05:01.910> he

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
an entire BKB that is exactly what he

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.070 
an entire BKB that is exactly what he
needed<00:05:04.510> so<00:05:07.240> this<00:05:08.240> is<00:05:08.390> going<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.750> hurt<00:05:10.810> that<00:05:11.810> in

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
needed so this is going to hurt that in

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.080 
needed so this is going to hurt that in
the<00:05:12.260> next<00:05:12.530> engagement<00:05:12.800> he's<00:05:13.760> going<00:05:13.910> to<00:05:13.970> be

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
the next engagement he's going to be

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.540 
the next engagement he's going to be
able<00:05:14.150> to<00:05:14.330> basically<00:05:15.200> charge<00:05:15.530> freely<00:05:16.040> forwards

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
able to basically charge freely forwards

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.950 
able to basically charge freely forwards
and<00:05:16.760> I<00:05:17.090> think<00:05:17.300> they're<00:05:17.419> not<00:05:17.510> gonna<00:05:17.630> be<00:05:17.780> able<00:05:17.840> to

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
and I think they're not gonna be able to

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.210 
and I think they're not gonna be able to
stop<00:05:18.140> him<00:05:18.230> especially<00:05:18.440> when<00:05:18.770> he<00:05:18.830> has<00:05:18.919> to<00:05:19.010> speak

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
stop him especially when he has to speak

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.219 
stop him especially when he has to speak
it<00:05:19.370> be<00:05:19.490> activated<00:05:19.910> along<00:05:20.120> with<00:05:20.240> his<00:05:20.360> armlet

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.200 

okay<00:05:24.229> he<00:05:24.410> just<00:05:24.440> activated<00:05:25.010> BKB<00:05:25.280> what<00:05:25.820> the<00:05:26.030> hell

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
okay he just activated BKB what the hell

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.960 
okay he just activated BKB what the hell
that<00:05:28.510> is<00:05:29.510> a<00:05:29.540> total<00:05:30.140> waste<00:05:30.320> I<00:05:30.770> think<00:05:31.340> that<00:05:31.640> must

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
that is a total waste I think that must

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.909 
that is a total waste I think that must
have<00:05:32.150> been<00:05:32.270> a<00:05:32.300> Miss<00:05:32.540> klegg<00:05:32.900> I<00:05:33.080> think<00:05:33.680> he<00:05:33.740> may<00:05:33.890> be

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
have been a Miss klegg I think he may be
