00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.910
 or not 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.590
 hello that as it is I hope that very 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.090
 well good today I 'm going to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.299
 show how to make this nice 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.000
 elephant remember that the day is coming 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.369
 of the child and it is a very nice gift that 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.280
 they tell the children or one that is in 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.230
 birthday in a richard gere where 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.200
 they want to use it just to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.410
 decorating a room and then we're going 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.100
 to the list of patterns 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.070
 for this craft we need a 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.010
 cloth of the color of your preference and the 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.330
 stamping we're also going to be felt 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.670
 also to the colors of your preference 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.970
 and a bit of black felt 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.629
 we're going to need gun scissors and 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.629
 silicone 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:59.110
 can use sequins in strips or 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:02.430
 gems to decorate good we start 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.620
 as in each tutorial we mark and 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.130
 we mark the piece as indicated in the 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.490
 mold the charities we're going to do 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.720
 a very nice elephant cushion then the 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.900
 let's mark with the fabrics once 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.540
 let's mark our little elephant and 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.630
 we will always leave a margin for 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.630
 sewing 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.630
 we mark 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.700
 since we mark we are going to sew for all 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.700
 the line that we always leave leaving 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.050
 an opening to turn our piece 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.610
 maybe we can see but when 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.890
 you mark it, they are going to sew 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.290
 over the whole line then I'm going to 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.900
 mark I'm going to forgive sewing my piece 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.369
 I show you how we are staying since 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.190
 We knew this is how we will stay 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.080
 now I did leave the opening here for 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.660
 flip but remember that whenever 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.910
 do a craft though they sew on 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.070
 machine before flipping it have to 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.739
 make small cuts around the 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.980
 outline of the piece without reaching the 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:16.660
 sewing for the moment of flipping the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.290
 that a whole better form our piece 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.290
 then we flipped it 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.879
 so we have something very important that 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.519
 ask to mention them is that we need 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.760
 Fill them up and we'll fill them 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.829
 close your opening for the little ear 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.870
 to also cut two pieces but before 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.510
 of cutting them takes a piece in 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.650
 We will sew the piece 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.620
 in one of the fabric of the ears 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.890
 and then we're going to join it too 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.650
 leaving an opening to turn it around I'm going 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.450
 to sew it and I show you how to put it 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.299
 that we knew the little ear is going to be 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.329
 so now yes and here we just close 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.819
 We're not going to fill the little ear 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.670
 we are going to fill it in here we close 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.530
 we sew and the tail is ready 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.780
 we have are the two pieces 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.900
 and we are also going to cook the whole contour 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.290
 and we are going to leave to turn the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.250
 piece we are going to leave open to this to 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.680
 this is optional I 'm going to put some 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.340
 bits of yarn that we use 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.340
 to weave 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.489
 I'm going to put it before closing it here 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.990
 by the time you flip the ones you 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.450
 stay 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.040
 hanging these bits of yarn 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.510
 as I say this is optional if 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.700
 you want to put it is fine 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.310
 also if we probably need a 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.260
 little button to put the tail on 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.700
 elephant then I'm going to sew my piece 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.700
 I'm going to put them here 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.410
 I'm going to sew all the contour and return 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.450
 so they can see how I have left 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.380
 we close the little ear we will be like this 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.320
 and the tail in this way 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.320
 now we have the pieces that we cut 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.230
 the felt as indicated in the mold and 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.050
 we are going to 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.970
 To decorate them we have two pieces that 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.370
 let's put the elephant already stuffed 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.740
 so we are left this way these 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.570
 pieces can decorate them with sequin 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.570
 entity can be stuck 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.310
 here in this part of here 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.310
 or 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.840
 you can put it in strips or you can 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:50.530
 can put acrylic themes 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.919
 You can paste them or you can know them 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.370
 these gems bring some perforations that 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.320
 they can be kept the same they can 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.330
 paste as you like are two pieces 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.150
 that we are going to put the elephant then 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.949
 I'm going to put the gems and return with 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.470
 to see how you tell the 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.889
 You can know or paste as we decorate 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.320
 with these pieces we are going to put them in 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.639
 we are going to paste these elephants in this 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.639
 part of removes the head 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.449
 i 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.449
 Y 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:06.279
 that's how we have this game 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.990
 so beautiful remember that it already comes as 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:10.539
 I told you before the day of the 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.249
 child battery very good option to make 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.529
 and give away the one that does not have a machine 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:16.869
 sew you can do everything in felt it 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.789
 It looks just as nice and so take in 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:21.219
 count the children in their day as well as 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.679
 we give mom a gift also show them 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:26.559
 our love to the children who sit 

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:28.209
 loved ones is a nice detail so that what 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:31.029
 put in your room so they can 

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:32.979
 putting them smaller can also 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:35.080
 do to give as a baby shower in a 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:37.449
 birthday party or just to 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.129
 decorating your home is very beautiful remember 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.199
 that if they want to make it much bigger 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.419
 so they have to amplify the 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:45.309
 mold to the size of your preference 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.800
 I also remind you that the molds 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:49.509
