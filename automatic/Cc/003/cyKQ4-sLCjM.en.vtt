00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.670 
right over the wrist it's a very small
bag<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.000> this<00:01:57.000> particular<00:01:57.750> one<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.320> decided

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
bag and this particular one we decided

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.550 
bag and this particular one we decided
to<00:01:58.740> put<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.000> optional<00:02:00.000> leaf<00:02:00.630> embellishments

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
to put the optional leaf embellishments

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.580 
to put the optional leaf embellishments
on<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.820> they<00:02:03.030> that's<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.049> separate<00:02:04.469> little

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
on and they that's a separate little

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.870 
on and they that's a separate little
piece<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.009> pattern<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.610> put<00:02:05.759> these

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
piece of the pattern you can put these

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.010 
piece of the pattern you can put these
on<00:02:06.119> any<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.659> them

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
on any of them

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.290 
on any of them
one<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.470> it's<00:02:08.710> just<00:02:08.980> I<00:02:09.220> think<00:02:10.060> it's

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
one and it's just I think it's

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.700 
one and it's just I think it's
appropriate<00:02:10.480> for<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.990> pee<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.970> these<00:02:13.180> these<00:02:13.570> are

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
appropriate for a pee so these these are

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.750 
appropriate for a pee so these these are
there<00:02:14.710> all<00:02:14.860> done<00:02:15.040> using<00:02:15.220> different

then very very lightly fold which is not

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.280 
then very very lightly fold which is not
quite<00:03:50.320> felted<00:03:50.860> but<00:03:51.610> fold<00:03:51.910> in<00:03:52.270> order<00:03:52.660> to<00:03:52.990> just

quite felted but fold in order to just

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.290 
quite felted but fold in order to just
make<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.800> fabric<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.250> little<00:03:54.520> bit<00:03:54.640> more<00:03:54.790> solid

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
make the fabric a little bit more solid

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.240 
make the fabric a little bit more solid
so<00:03:55.570> that<00:03:55.720> it<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:56.020> carry<00:03:56.380> a<00:03:56.680> little<00:03:57.010> bit<00:03:57.130> more

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
so that it can carry a little bit more

technique<00:04:04.540> first<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.380> rind<00:04:05.620> has<00:04:05.860> worked

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
technique first the rind has worked

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.670 
technique first the rind has worked
there<00:04:07.090> this<00:04:07.510> one<00:04:07.660> does<00:04:07.810> not<00:04:07.959> include<00:04:08.320> short

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
there this one does not include short

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.720 
there this one does not include short
rows<00:04:08.860> and<00:04:09.220> then<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:11.380> fruit<00:04:11.800> is<00:04:12.100> worked<00:04:12.340> in<00:04:12.550> the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
rows and then the fruit is worked in the

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.930 
rows and then the fruit is worked in the
round<00:04:12.970> from<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.080> outside<00:04:14.530> into<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.459> center
