 bring some outfit proposals in 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.980
 concrete are going to be three outfits that go 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:19.690
 to have as a center a touch of color 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.490

 proposals since I have a bag in this 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.890

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.960
 we can use in winter that can 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.750
 Give a touch of joy and color to 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.760
