and sapling planting and planting of new
trees<00:00:15.960> basically<00:00:16.339> so<00:00:17.339> you're<00:00:17.789> gonna<00:00:18.029> need<00:00:18.239> two

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
trees basically so you're gonna need two

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.200 
trees basically so you're gonna need two
things<00:00:18.630> for<00:00:19.339> both<00:00:20.339> of<00:00:20.489> these<00:00:20.579> if<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.060> got<00:00:21.179> a

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
things for both of these if you got a

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.389 
things for both of these if you got a
force<00:00:21.419> to<00:00:21.539> your<00:00:21.659> equipment<00:00:22.050> your<00:00:22.949> stump

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:23.399 
force to your equipment your stump

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.759 
force to your equipment your stump
removal<00:00:23.759> tool<00:00:24.569> is<00:00:24.810> right<00:00:25.019> here<00:00:25.229> really<00:00:25.589> really

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
removal tool is right here really really

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.399 
removal tool is right here really really
cheap<00:00:26.009> and<00:00:26.249> then<00:00:27.029> your<00:00:27.300> planting<00:00:27.839> tool<00:00:28.050> is

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:28.409 
cheap and then your planting tool is

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:32.030 
cheap and then your planting tool is
right<00:00:29.399> here<00:00:29.639> also<00:00:29.939> not<00:00:30.210> too<00:00:30.329> expensive<00:00:31.040> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
right here also not too expensive and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.709 
right here also not too expensive and
you<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.279> see<00:00:32.429> in<00:00:32.519> fruit<00:00:32.730> types<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.300> has<00:00:33.449> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
you can see in fruit types it has the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.439 
you can see in fruit types it has the
picture<00:00:34.109> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.320> tree<00:00:35.059> so<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.149> first<00:00:36.300> thing

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
picture of the tree so the first thing

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.119 
picture of the tree so the first thing
we'll<00:00:36.539> look<00:00:36.660> at<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.809> stump<00:00:37.530> removal<00:00:37.859> I<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.100> a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
we'll look at is stump removal I have a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.709 
we'll look at is stump removal I have a
quite<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> few<00:00:38.820> stumps<00:00:39.089> here<00:00:39.120> I'm<00:00:39.269> not<00:00:39.359> going<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
quite a few stumps here I'm not going to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.630 
quite a few stumps here I'm not going to
remove<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.230> them<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.250> video<00:00:41.489> for

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
remove all of them in this video for

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.750 
remove all of them in this video for
time<00:00:41.850> sake<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:42.629> I'll<00:00:43.109> do<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> couple<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.489> go

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
time sake but I'll do a couple so go

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.439 
time sake but I'll do a couple so go
ahead<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:44.969> put<00:00:45.269> your<00:00:45.359> stump<00:00:45.629> removal<00:00:47.149> tool<00:00:48.149> or

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
ahead and put your stump removal tool or

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.500 
ahead and put your stump removal tool or
implement<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:50.640> front<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.179> back<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.329> your

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
implement on the front or back of your

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.419 
implement on the front or back of your
tractor<00:00:51.839> doesn't<00:00:52.140> matter<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.559> then<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.280> can

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
tractor doesn't matter and then you can

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.970 
tractor doesn't matter and then you can
notice<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.179> raise<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.480> lower<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.839> if<00:00:55.829> you

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
notice you can raise and lower it if you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.299 
notice you can raise and lower it if you
hit<00:00:56.100> B<00:00:56.339> it'll<00:00:56.760> turn<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.089> and<00:00:57.769> if<00:00:58.769> you<00:00:58.949> lower<00:00:59.159> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
hit B it'll turn on and if you lower it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.189 
hit B it'll turn on and if you lower it
on<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> tree<00:00:59.789> stump<00:00:59.969> it'll<00:01:00.749> start<00:01:00.960> cutting

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
on to a tree stump it'll start cutting

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.340 
on to a tree stump it'll start cutting
away<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.829> give<00:01:02.339> it<00:01:02.460> time<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.350> eventually

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
away and you give it time and eventually

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.830 
away and you give it time and eventually
it'll<00:01:04.799> cut<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.460> away<00:01:05.549> sometimes<00:01:06.509> it'll<00:01:06.720> do

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
it'll cut it away sometimes it'll do

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
it'll cut it away sometimes it'll do
this<00:01:06.990> where<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.680> goes<00:01:07.829> for<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> long<00:01:08.310> time<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
this where it goes for a long time and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.819 
this where it goes for a long time and
won't<00:01:09.119> cut<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.259> sort<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.649> to

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
won't cut it so you just sort of have to

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.760 
won't cut it so you just sort of have to
play<00:01:11.009> with<00:01:11.420> moving<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.540> around<00:01:12.770> raising

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
play with moving it around raising

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.170 
play with moving it around raising
lowering<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.399> more

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
lowering it more

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.060 
lowering it more
and<00:01:16.450> eventually<00:01:16.990> there<00:01:17.140> you<00:01:17.230> go<00:01:17.350> eventually

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
and eventually there you go eventually

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.670 
and eventually there you go eventually
it'll<00:01:18.250> actually<00:01:18.430> cut<00:01:18.820> get<00:01:19.570> rid<00:01:19.720> of<00:01:19.750> it

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.670 

just<00:01:23.280> lower<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.640> until<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.960> whole<00:01:25.140> stump<00:01:25.470> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
just lower it until the whole stump is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.400 
just lower it until the whole stump is
gone<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.400> there<00:01:26.550> you<00:01:26.610> go<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.020> raise

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
gone and there you go so I can raise

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.090 
gone and there you go so I can raise
this<00:01:28.620> back<00:01:28.830> up<00:01:29.010> go<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.820> my<00:01:30.090> next<00:01:30.150> stump

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.510 

and

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.190 

and<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.119> nice<00:01:37.270> thing<00:01:37.299> about<00:01:37.479> this<00:01:37.780> implement

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
and the nice thing about this implement

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.740 
and the nice thing about this implement
is<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:38.649> can<00:01:38.909> move<00:01:39.909> it<00:01:40.060> from<00:01:40.090> side<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.450> side<00:01:40.570> so

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
is you can move it from side to side so

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.929 
is you can move it from side to side so
you<00:01:40.990> don't<00:01:41.079> have<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.380> line<00:01:41.530> it<00:01:41.560> up<00:01:41.939> exactly

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
you don't have to line it up exactly

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.249 
you don't have to line it up exactly
with<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.240> fern<00:01:43.420> your<00:01:43.540> tractor<00:01:43.899> you<00:01:44.110> have<00:01:44.229> a

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
with the fern your tractor you have a

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.020 
with the fern your tractor you have a
lot<00:01:44.619> of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
lot of

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.740 
lot of
room<00:01:46.659> to<00:01:46.840> move<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.110> up<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:47.680> down<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:48.010> around

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
room to move it up and down and around

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.870 
room to move it up and down and around
we're<00:01:49.750> rid<00:01:49.900> of<00:01:49.930> this<00:01:50.080> guy

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.080 

a<00:01:55.909> lot<00:01:56.180> more

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.450 

you<00:01:59.510> can<00:01:59.630> also<00:01:59.750> hit<00:01:59.960> V<00:02:00.260> and<00:02:00.650> it'll<00:02:01.040> lower<00:02:01.220> it

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
you can also hit V and it'll lower it

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.940 
you can also hit V and it'll lower it
like<00:02:01.760> you<00:02:02.180> know<00:02:02.270> most<00:02:02.510> other<00:02:02.750> implements<00:02:03.440> plot

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
like you know most other implements plot

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.350 
like you know most other implements plot
V

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
V

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.300 
V
I'll<00:02:05.450> get<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.780> closer<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.200> ground<00:02:06.380> and

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.390 

and<00:02:10.759> there<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:10.970> go<00:02:11.060> it's<00:02:11.360> very<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:12.680> very<00:02:12.830> simple

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
and there you go it's very a very simple

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.240 
and there you go it's very a very simple
process

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
process

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.360 
process
raise<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:15.880> up<00:02:16.060> turn<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.780> off<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:18.070> that's<00:02:18.220> it

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
raise it up turn it off and that's it

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.430 
raise it up turn it off and that's it
for<00:02:18.550> some<00:02:18.700> removal<00:02:19.060> very<00:02:19.240> simple<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:20.320> can

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
for some removal very simple you can

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.480 
for some removal very simple you can
also<00:02:20.590> use<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.400> get<00:02:21.910> rid<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.090> logs<00:02:22.540> or

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
also use it to get rid of logs or

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.260 
also use it to get rid of logs or
branches<00:02:24.490> on<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.700> ground<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.120> don't

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
branches on the ground that you don't

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.060 
branches on the ground that you don't
want<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.450> pick<00:02:25.660> up<00:02:25.840> or<00:02:26.050> woodchip<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.800> can<00:02:26.920> just

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
want to pick up or woodchip you can just

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.670 
want to pick up or woodchip you can just
grind<00:02:27.520> them<00:02:27.580> down<00:02:27.820> with<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.810> same<00:02:28.960> implement

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
grind them down with the same implement

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.100 
grind them down with the same implement
there<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.820> now<00:02:31.060> let's<00:02:31.270> look<00:02:31.420> at<00:02:31.570> actually

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
there so now let's look at actually

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.840 
there so now let's look at actually
planting<00:02:32.650> new<00:02:32.830> saplings<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.460> their<00:02:33.610> place

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
planting new saplings in their place

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.600 
planting new saplings in their place
you're<00:02:34.810> going<00:02:34.960> to<00:02:35.080> need<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:36.190> implement

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
you're going to need the this implement

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.270 
you're going to need the this implement
here<00:02:36.730> on<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.880> back<00:02:37.030> that's<00:02:37.330> tree<00:02:38.290> planter<00:02:38.650> and

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
here on the back that's tree planter and

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.680 
here on the back that's tree planter and
the<00:02:39.790> first<00:02:39.970> thing<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.180> have<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:40.330> do<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.480> load

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
the first thing you have to do is load

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.339 
the first thing you have to do is load
it<00:02:40.720> up<00:02:40.930> with<00:02:40.960> new<00:02:41.320> saplings

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.550 

again<00:02:45.069> if<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.790> watch<00:02:45.909> my<00:02:46.090> other<00:02:46.120> videos<00:02:46.560> once

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
again if you watch my other videos once

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.920 
again if you watch my other videos once
perhaps<00:02:47.859> is<00:02:48.099> on<00:02:48.249> the<00:02:48.849> performance<00:02:49.659> and<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
perhaps is on the performance and the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.449 
perhaps is on the performance and the
lag<00:02:50.200> issues<00:02:50.590> happen<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.129> I'm<00:02:51.189> sorry<00:02:51.370> about

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
lag issues happen so I'm sorry about

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.369 
lag issues happen so I'm sorry about
that<00:02:51.609> but<00:02:51.939> anyway<00:02:52.209> so<00:02:53.079> you<00:02:53.170> need<00:02:53.290> this

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
that but anyway so you need this

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.809 
that but anyway so you need this
implement<00:02:53.799> but<00:02:54.099> you<00:02:54.159> have<00:02:54.249> to<00:02:54.340> fill<00:02:54.489> it<00:02:54.609> with

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
implement but you have to fill it with

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.759 
implement but you have to fill it with
saplings<00:02:55.540> first<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.109> if<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.260> go<00:02:56.379> over<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.680> the

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
saplings first so if you go over to the

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.009 
saplings first so if you go over to the
garden<00:02:57.010> center<00:02:57.310> which<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.389> in<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.719> bottom

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
garden center which is in the bottom

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.929 
garden center which is in the bottom
left<00:02:59.049> it's<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.799> little<00:03:00.159> northwest<00:03:00.609> of<00:03:00.790> your

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
left it's a little northwest of your

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.649 
left it's a little northwest of your
cows<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:03.040> can<00:03:03.430> go<00:03:04.090> ahead<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.680> purchase<00:03:05.680> I

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
cows you can go ahead and purchase I

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.259 
cows you can go ahead and purchase I
think<00:03:07.659> 20<00:03:08.049> trees<00:03:08.290> at<00:03:08.829> a<00:03:08.889> time<00:03:09.189> yeah<00:03:09.790> 20<00:03:10.120> pieces

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
think 20 trees at a time yeah 20 pieces

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.679 
think 20 trees at a time yeah 20 pieces
for<00:03:10.569> 40<00:03:10.840> bucks<00:03:10.989> really<00:03:11.439> cheap<00:03:12.329> so<00:03:13.329> purchase

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
for 40 bucks really cheap so purchase

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.920 
for 40 bucks really cheap so purchase
some<00:03:14.280> they'll<00:03:15.280> lay<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.180> there<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:16.719> then<00:03:16.840> you

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
some they'll lay in there so then you

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.590 
some they'll lay in there so then you
just<00:03:17.139> have<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.409> back<00:03:17.560> up<00:03:18.000> into<00:03:19.000> it

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.110 

hit<00:03:25.140> f1<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.680> know<00:03:25.740> and<00:03:26.160> then<00:03:26.280> push<00:03:26.520> our<00:03:26.760> and

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
hit f1 so I know and then push our and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.360 
hit f1 so I know and then push our and
it'll<00:03:27.420> just<00:03:27.630> hop<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.380> there<00:03:28.590> like<00:03:28.800> that

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
it'll just hop on there like that

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.160 
it'll just hop on there like that
so<00:03:30.879> now<00:03:30.970> we<00:03:31.030> can<00:03:31.239> plant<00:03:31.450> trees<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.810> can<00:03:31.840> plant

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
so now we can plant trees I can plant

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.720 
so now we can plant trees I can plant
them<00:03:32.349> basically<00:03:32.800> wherever<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.190> want<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.670> could

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
them basically wherever I want I could

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.559 
them basically wherever I want I could
put<00:03:33.849> them<00:03:34.030> there

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
put them there

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.750 
put them there
I<00:03:34.599> could<00:03:34.840> buy<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:34.989> field<00:03:35.319> fill<00:03:36.310> up<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.550> field

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
I could buy a field fill up the field

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.150 
I could buy a field fill up the field
with<00:03:36.940> them<00:03:37.739> they<00:03:38.739> give<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:39.010> lot<00:03:39.129> of

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
with them they give you a lot of

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.600 
with them they give you a lot of
liberties<00:03:39.580> with<00:03:39.959> where<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:40.989> put<00:03:41.290> them<00:03:41.610> I'm

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
liberties with where to put them I'm

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.089 
liberties with where to put them I'm
gonna<00:03:42.819> just<00:03:43.000> go<00:03:43.150> put<00:03:43.360> them<00:03:43.450> back<00:03:43.629> in<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.319> place

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
gonna just go put them back in and place

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.960 
gonna just go put them back in and place
with<00:03:45.250> these<00:03:45.340> stumps<00:03:45.610> over<00:03:45.879> here<00:03:46.120> just

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
with these stumps over here just

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.610 
with these stumps over here just
before<00:03:47.480> us<00:03:47.630> together<00:03:48.260> basically

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.350 

there's

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
there's

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.540 
there's
more<00:03:53.870> performance<00:03:54.500> issues<00:03:54.890> of<00:03:55.100> course

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.090 

all<00:03:58.030> right<00:03:58.390> so<00:03:58.870> I'll<00:03:59.140> find<00:03:59.320> where<00:03:59.740> I<00:03:59.770> want<00:04:00.010> to

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
all right so I'll find where I want to

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.550 
all right so I'll find where I want to
start<00:04:00.490> so<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.180> just<00:04:01.480> kind<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.690> want<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:01.900> do<00:04:02.020> maybe

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
start so I just kind of want to do maybe

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.580 
start so I just kind of want to do maybe
a<00:04:02.680> line<00:04:02.890> of<00:04:03.040> trees<00:04:03.220> right<00:04:03.430> here<00:04:04.410> so<00:04:05.410> you<00:04:05.470> go

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
a line of trees right here so you go

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.690 
a line of trees right here so you go
ahead<00:04:05.710> and<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:06.250> lower<00:04:06.490> it<00:04:06.610> Oh<00:04:08.310> got<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.340> changed

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
ahead and you lower it Oh got a changed

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.040 
ahead and you lower it Oh got a changed
by<00:04:09.910> there<00:04:10.540> we<00:04:10.630> go

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
by there we go

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.340 
by there we go
lower<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.570> you'll<00:04:13.570> see<00:04:13.720> it<00:04:13.810> kind<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:13.990> digs<00:04:14.200> into

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
lower it you'll see it kind of digs into

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.770 
lower it you'll see it kind of digs into
the<00:04:14.440> ground<00:04:14.710> push<00:04:15.340> B<00:04:15.670> we'll<00:04:16.120> turn<00:04:16.270> it<00:04:16.420> on<00:04:16.540> and

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
the ground push B we'll turn it on and

turn<00:04:43.120> it<00:04:43.210> off

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.309 

oh<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:50.639> guess<00:04:51.419> I<00:04:51.569> didn't<00:04:51.750> turn<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.900> off<00:04:52.080> but

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
oh I guess I didn't turn it off but

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.330 
oh I guess I didn't turn it off but
anyway<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:54.000> there<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.240> go

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
anyway and there you go

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.730 
anyway and there you go
very<00:04:55.820> simple<00:04:56.120> process<00:04:56.470> mmm<00:04:57.500> I've<00:04:57.590> never

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
very simple process mmm I've never

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.720 
very simple process mmm I've never
actually<00:04:57.950> had<00:04:59.860> raise<00:05:00.860> this<00:05:01.100> turn<00:05:01.490> it<00:05:01.610> off

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
actually had raise this turn it off

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.730 
actually had raise this turn it off
there<00:05:02.000> we<00:05:02.090> go<00:05:02.180> so<00:05:03.050> I've<00:05:03.140> never<00:05:03.260> actually<00:05:03.350> had

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
there we go so I've never actually had

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.520 
there we go so I've never actually had
trees<00:05:04.460> fully<00:05:04.760> grown<00:05:05.120> yet

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530
