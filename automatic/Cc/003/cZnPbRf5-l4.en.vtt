00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 traffic accidents 

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.420
 violation of rules of disputes on 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.730
 the road to identify the culprit or vice versa 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.550
 to prove the case more often help 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.870
 device called 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.230
 DVR device extremely 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.279
 useful but you need to be able to use it 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.230
 DVR is essentially digital 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.020
 camera with a set of specific functions 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.760
 which is installed in the car 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.350
 the main purpose of the vision is continuous 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.050
 shooting road conditions during 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.420
 the market movement is literally swamped today 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.309
 dozens of different models and high 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.020
 price does not guarantee quality 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.360
 First of all you should pay attention 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.460
 on the appearance of the recorder quality 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.910
 Products can be seen immediately 2 parameters on 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.800
 which should pay attention this 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.940
 video quality that do 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.710
 DVR most 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.020
 high-quality DVRs are filmed 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.700
 as hd with a frequency of 30 frames in 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.680
 give me a sec 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.930
 but some DVRs with 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.920
 lower video recording characteristics 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.390
 take a picture so on it 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.620
 Itâ€™s impossible to view the numbers even in 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.629
 clear sunny weather 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.360
 also a very important parameter is the angle 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.900
 review it should be about 120 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.400
 degrees otherwise in the lens 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.170
 DVR may not fall and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.920
 events that should be recorded 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.409
 car enthusiast 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.409
 Many manufacturers point to their 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.630
 corner viewing boxes and 120 and 130 and 140 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.060
 degrees but in this case they of course 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.759
 disingenuous because they indicate the angle 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.880
 review diagonally and this parameter 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.470
 it is important to measure almost everything in width 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.229
 DVRs record video 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.549
 breaking it up into fragments will end 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.619
 memory card location 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.810
 earlier fragments are erased and 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.360
 new ones are recorded and pay here 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.610
 attention some DVRs 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.860
 between the fragments leave a pause to 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.770
 a few seconds it is fraught with the fact that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.619
 the desired video does not fit into the frame useful 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.310
 function is a built-in shock sensor it 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.600
 allows in case of an accident 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.619
 automatically block the last 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.270
 recorded file from further overwriting 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.009
 another useful feature which 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.090
 must be present 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.619
 DVR is a built-in 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.000
 battery since at the time of strong 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.310
 strike can end power 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.790
 DVR and the fact of the accident 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.440
 may simply not be fixed yet 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.800
 It should be noted that many 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.940
 DVRs come with a built-in 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.310
 gps receiver this allows you to bind 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.150
 video image to a specific place on 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.640
 map 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.300
 important as a DVR 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.030
 will transfer our winter 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.380
 you can check it yourself 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.630
 place the device for several hours 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.970
 in the freezer and then turn it on 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.190
 cheap fakes write nothing 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.570
 good device will continue 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.580
 record modern quality 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.410
 DVRs have great 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.630
 number of additional functions and 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.220
 options so the product must be 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.700
 necessarily localized for Russian 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.459
 of the market 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.110
 so when buying a DVR 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.940
 be sure to check availability 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.790
 instructions in Russian 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.340
 They are in Chinese characters also very 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.870
 important point is the method of attachment 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.660
 video recorder to glass 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.800
 at the moment there are two 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.410
 method of attachment is using 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.310
 classic suction pad or substrate on 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.200
 adhesive base 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.670
 if you are planning rearranging 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.769
 DVR from one machine to 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.709
 other make sure to 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.959
 DVR kit included 2 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.760
 substrates if you plan to rearrange 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.000
 on different machines should also be paid 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.930
 attention to how it is established 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.480
 DVR some manufacturers 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.380
 offer offers hidden installation 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.120
 This will protect the device from 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.250
 vandals since 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.720
 secretly installed DVR is not 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.670
 will attract attention and 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.250
 remember the recording from the DVR 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.319
 may be evidence of a trial and 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.379
 clarify parsing in traffic police 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.530
 Well, there was a situation when traveling 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:56.560
 but the green light intersection happened 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.680
 The accident in the left part of my car all 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.409
 rode gazelle 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.810
 traffic cops arrived once a situation analysis I 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.510
 indicated that I have a registrar that I 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.299
 came to the green light the whole thing 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.079
 recorded the consequences of the truth that 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:17.470
 the gazelle driver also reported that 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:19.840
 drove through the green and even brought with 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.289
 fake witnesses well since it was 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.720
 record I won the limit in the event of an accident 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.490
 inform the inspector who arrived at the place 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.560
 accidents that you have in 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.660
 car mounted video recorder 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.120
 let him take it to the protocol indicating 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.250
 model and device number memory card 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.139
 to the inspector, pass the grown out of and into 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.360
 presence of witnesses but before that 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.280
 it is desirable to make a copy of the video 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.070
 using a laptop or mobile 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.470
 phone and finally here's another one of 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.570
 advantages of the DVR, he can help 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.060
 in the so-called auto situation 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.400
 suppliers because the attackers do not 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.160
 love to get into the camera lens like 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.620
 the rule is that the crash recorded video they 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.490
 quickly leave the scene and you 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.490
 call gai
