 but with a star in the middle 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:21.189

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.859
 Marburg cake bake a dark and 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.439

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.070
 with the rest what was then 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.940
 of course my problem 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.789
 but since I had a recipe anyway 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.980

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.280

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.840
 I will first have a tree where 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.770

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.180

 flour no 300 grams please was that must 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.170
 then its now a more supple dough 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.060
 which can flow properly 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.280
 the dark cut out correctly i have 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.310

 wide that top edge cut off 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.170
 Now you can do the dough in three to 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.870
 I'll cut four parts like that 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.870

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.550

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.239
 different sizes always look which 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.870
 Size best fits the fit 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.870
 that is too small 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:04:01.790
 that could fit and of course 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.790
 live small star shape 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.239

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:22.980
 given and then you will like 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.980
 just because burst so exactly in the middle 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.390

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.720

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.430

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.800
 Of course you can also do a whole 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.860
 normal tin cake make for you 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.530

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.620

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.930
 marble dolls made because the first one 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.390
 I will continue to use it 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:58.220
 The recipe is still coming 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:00.110
 namely, what a delicious thing out like 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.880
 said if you only bake this customer 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.430
 you want then for the dark 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.080
 Just make all the tin cake of the day 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:11.410
 is also true is solid is at 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.240
 steam cake is a bit 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.760
 looser and is not easy to 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.280
 cut out 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.930
 now I will the cake at 180 degrees approx 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.330
 Bake 50 minutes 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.640
 the rest I have in one 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.630
 Freezer bag not put into it 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.419
 dry out 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.690
 i just have chocolate in front of me 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.760
 or just to melt lattice and 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.880
 then have a tablespoon of zimble 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.010
 Enter and mix everything 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.360
 The cake is completely cooled 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:46.930
 I just give the closed door 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.930
 about that 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:03.749
 so leave or decorate further 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:07.259
 because I have Christmas 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:12.560
 bought chocolate decoration and I will 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:12.560
 then just give it a shot on the dome 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.000
 because my co 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.669
 ready decorated and you can do that 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.850
 star in the middle really recognize 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:39.580
 and he is also really tasty 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.010
 So I can really recommend it 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:46.120
 that there is a prescription in her necessarily times 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:48.639
 must do and through the cinnamon of 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.050
 Couverture is there then right 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.270
 become Christmas 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.310
 the prescription with the exact disclosures 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.889

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:01.600
 This is not anymore 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.120
 so hard a star in such a look 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.669
 It is only necessary to know it 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.380
 and stay tuned for the next recipe 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:10.090
 the rest of the recovery will be the 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.940
 namely, the next days follow 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.310
 Of course you can also use the recipe 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.330
