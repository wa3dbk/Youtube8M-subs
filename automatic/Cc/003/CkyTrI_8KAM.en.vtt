00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.590
 hello out there love spectators love 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.060
 photographers it continues with one 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.060
 practice tip here on the blog 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.260
 and that's where we want to get in 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.850
 the practice you already have 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.220
 I saw a lot of things like myself 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.070
 photographed here hotel room very 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.840
 chic in budapest model and what had 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.330
 I use camera of course but 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.870
 a softbox with a plug-in flash 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.910
 turn it on and on a tripod what 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.290
 is the behind-the-wall behind this 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.420
 light is what I really want 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.840
 just suggest it is relative 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.700
 simple and I have one here 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.020
 Ancient photographers trick taken no 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.220
 I did not invent it, even if I did 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.250
 I would like to say so 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.500
 I do not have I hide one 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.880
 artificial light actually turns 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.209
 here in this location a very 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.130
 unpleasant or yes a very artificial 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.180
 generate the artificial light course 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.160
 would be considered a kind of chandelier as art 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.890
 Light source around us anyway 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.510
 exists if we umgucken times or 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.010
 if we look at such hotels then 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.080
 we could very well imagine 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.790
 that is exactly where obendrÃ¼ber this 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.360
 sitting location where I just here me 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.580
 located 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.630
 actually a chandelier would be the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.299
 would shine down 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.830
 And that's the trick, that's it 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.840
 what I like to put to your heart 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.250
 would you like to go out and try 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.290
 your rise of not always somehow 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.590
 on the motive to flash on it but 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.799
 trying to shape the light in one 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.030
 way that you naturally more 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.799
 or less natural light though 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.840
 Neighbors can use a chandelier in that way 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.030
 a location is a certain way 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.920
 natural light source and exactly this 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.840
 I can therefore imitate light as 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.280
 Photographer I do not choose to imitate 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.110
 I can do that with lateral ones 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.820
 Exposure with in flash somewhere pure 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.160
 put with them directly with windows like 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.040
 otherwise my whole light guide as 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.260
 artificially staged light sat 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.299
 is based on the 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.310
 principle what we as humans around us 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.370
 see around and what we as humans around 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.500
 We are used to long tripods here 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.180
 hung over the parapet and pressed by 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.220
 above, this is crazy 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.900
 high-contrast light and that 's me 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.910
 able with a relatively small 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.350
 Light source the softbox 60 centimeters 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.180
 and is an up in it one 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.870
 to take a picture sometimes even of 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.480
 Whole room here is in a position 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.710
 this this this artificial lightness 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.290
 to hide 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.920
 I have hard shadow here 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.680
 contrasts 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.910
 but they are set that way 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.430
 somehow the entire room 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.750
 uniformly undress my 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.550
 They usually shadow me 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.050
 they usually always interfere 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.760
 are somehow disgusting in the picture so 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.100
 take this blow city from the rise 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.540
 The field path scans lightly or unfolds 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.310
 or he is still there but he 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.920
 is positioned differently and that would be the 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.660
 second point of this videos because if you 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.250
 not positioned and if it is 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.630
 not ten meter light sources are then 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.210
 you can play a bit and you can 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.280
 can not always hide well or 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.780
 Shadow hide well if you put it in 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.230
 projected the ground 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.780
 So the more shadows go into the ground 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.160
 the less visible they are of course 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.110
 then I get the problem out of the 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.060
 Skull eyes and also the one to glare 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.470
 contrast on the body but what can 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.480
 I do I can he the model 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.420
 Body with the head or with the body 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.160
 posen and then me 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.300
 hide the remaining contrasts 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.880
 this is a very simple example 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.680
 This bench has been this table where 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.570
 I'm just sitting on it 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.250
 with a side light wave one 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.870
 extreme drop shadow on the other 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.630
 throw aside if it is not from above 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.010
 then comes one to one shade 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.050
 under the table and I almost see it 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.420
 Not at all two important aspects 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.830
 Try it out does not need so much 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.630
 factory has no giant lightning system 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.310
 but we even have cls 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.930
 so ignited on tickets so easy 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.760
 hung up on now works out because 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.590
 the 800 and let's go and we have 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.540
 photographed at aperture four iso 100 and 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.620
 1 52 exposure time and the flash was 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.750
 I think even an eighth or one 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.740
 quarter set in the performance 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.480
 great pictures great location great 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.940
 ideas hopefully try it out 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.920
 imitate is desired or 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.990
 I would also like feedback from you 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.430
 got where you did not hide where 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.910
 maybe you have other sources of light 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.910
 imitated 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.770
