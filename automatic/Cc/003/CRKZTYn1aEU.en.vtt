go<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:56.600> think<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.750> what<00:00:58.260> he's<00:00:58.379> trying<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.829> do

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
go I think that what he's trying to do

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.029 
go I think that what he's trying to do
is<00:00:59.430> leave<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.210> lineage<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.960> himself<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.920> he

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
is leave a lineage of himself because he

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.830 
is leave a lineage of himself because he
knows<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.430> he<00:01:02.460> has<00:01:02.670> AIDS<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.300> he's<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.719> he's

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
knows if he has AIDS and he's and he's

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.929 
knows if he has AIDS and he's and he's
that<00:01:04.049> sickly<00:01:04.589> he<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.250> wants<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> leave

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
that sickly he just wants to leave

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.000 
that sickly he just wants to leave
something<00:01:06.540> an<00:01:06.900> impression<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.530> he<00:01:07.740> did

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
something an impression that he did

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.760 
something an impression that he did
something<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.390> he<00:01:09.720> wrote<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.229> entire<00:01:10.320> Bible

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
something so he wrote the entire Bible

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.289 
something so he wrote the entire Bible
out<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.220> gave<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> st.<00:01:11.760> Peter's<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.180> do

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
out and gave it to st. Peter's I do

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.850 
out and gave it to st. Peter's I do
think<00:01:12.720> he<00:01:12.840> should<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.110> changed<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.470> few<00:01:13.650> words

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
think he should have changed a few words

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
think he should have changed a few words
so<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.280> could<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.490> at<00:01:14.640> least<00:01:14.670> been<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> feel

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
so it could have at least been the feel

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.200 
so it could have at least been the feel
of<00:01:15.450> paterson<00:01:15.990> version<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:18.060> that's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
of paterson version but I think that's

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.020 
of paterson version but I think that's
Noble<00:01:20.299> Jason<00:01:21.299> Frederick's<00:01:21.720> your<00:01:21.930> tango<00:01:22.470> I

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
Noble Jason Frederick's your tango I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.700 
Noble Jason Frederick's your tango I
think<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> completely<00:01:24.600> waste<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.500> time

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
think that is a completely waste of time

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.160 
think that is a completely waste of time
um<00:01:26.600> why<00:01:27.600> didn't<00:01:27.869> he<00:01:27.960> type<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.470> um<00:01:30.049> what<00:01:31.049> if

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
um why didn't he type it um what if

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.130 
um why didn't he type it um what if
everybody<00:01:31.409> can't<00:01:31.829> read<00:01:32.009> his<00:01:32.189> handwriting<00:01:33.140> why

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
everybody can't read his handwriting why

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.109 
everybody can't read his handwriting why
didn't<00:01:34.409> he<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.530> google<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> king<00:01:35.820> james
