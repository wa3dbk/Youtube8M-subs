like<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> follow<00:00:25.019> up<00:00:25.230> review<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.859> we<00:00:25.949> like

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130

to<00:00:26.279> do<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.210> think<00:00:28.609> you<00:00:29.609> could<00:00:29.730> probably

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
to do and I think you could probably

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.849 
to do and I think you could probably
just<00:00:30.119> go<00:00:30.240> watch<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.750> review<00:00:31.080> again<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
just go watch the review again and the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.020 
just go watch the review again and the
only<00:00:31.980> thing<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.340> might<00:00:32.460> change<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.940> our

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
only thing that might change is our

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.590 
only thing that might change is our
preferred<00:00:33.210> setup<00:00:33.750> because<00:00:33.899> i<00:00:34.110> hate<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.100> gun

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
preferred setup because i hate this gun

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.319 
preferred setup because i hate this gun
yeah<00:00:36.739> i<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:38.160> believe<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.670> thing<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.059> said

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
yeah i do believe the thing that I said

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.030 
yeah i do believe the thing that I said
that<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.719> was<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.200> number<00:00:40.739> one<00:00:40.770> thing<00:00:41.010> that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
that like was the number one thing that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.319 
that like was the number one thing that
stood<00:00:41.280> out<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.430> me<00:00:41.550> about<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.850> gun<00:00:42.059> was<00:00:42.210> he

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
stood out to me about this gun was he

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.900 
stood out to me about this gun was he
was<00:00:42.420> inconsistent<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.700> playing<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.820> again

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
was inconsistent and playing it again

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.819 
was inconsistent and playing it again
just<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.870> know<00:00:45.989> that's<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.710> with

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
these file reviews would go back play a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.639 
these file reviews would go back play a
couple<00:00:48.450> games<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> gun<00:00:49.050> refresh<00:00:49.500> your

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649

rely on the splash damage right and then
as<00:04:32.130> opposed<00:04:32.640> to<00:04:32.760> direct<00:04:33.090> hits<00:04:33.620> exactly<00:04:34.620> splash

interesting thing that i don't know if a

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.030 
interesting thing that i don't know if a
lot<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.610> people<00:04:53.700> know<00:04:54.090> or<00:04:54.120> not<00:04:54.500> in<00:04:55.500> battlefield

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
lot of people know or not in battlefield

lot of people know or not in battlefield
3<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.790> like<00:04:57.390> let's<00:04:57.660> say<00:04:57.750> every<00:04:58.410> palate<00:04:58.770> does

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
3 the like let's say every palate does

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.640 
3 the like let's say every palate does
12<00:04:59.700> damage<00:05:00.120> or<00:05:00.270> something<00:05:00.480> like<00:05:00.540> that<00:05:00.650> the

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
12 damage or something like that the

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.370 
12 damage or something like that the
legs<00:05:01.950> actually<00:05:02.520> do<00:05:03.060> like<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.780> multiplier<00:05:04.350> for

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
legs actually do like the multiplier for

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.130 
legs actually do like the multiplier for
the<00:05:04.770> damage<00:05:05.100> on<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.310> legs<00:05:05.520> is<00:05:05.730> point<00:05:06.030> 9<00:05:06.240> so<00:05:07.080> you

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
the damage on the legs is point 9 so you

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.180 
the damage on the legs is point 9 so you
actually<00:05:07.380> do<00:05:07.680> less<00:05:07.980> damage<00:05:08.010> than<00:05:09.740> each<00:05:10.740> pellet

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
actually do less damage than each pellet

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.900 
actually do less damage than each pellet
10<00:05:11.880> do<00:05:12.150> if<00:05:12.480> you<00:05:12.660> if<00:05:12.900> you're<00:05:13.080> hitting<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.440> legs

10 do if you if you're hitting the legs

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.250

really<00:05:44.910> affects<00:05:45.330> I<00:05:45.600> mean<00:05:46.100> it's<00:05:47.100> hard<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.460> do

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
really affects I mean it's hard to do

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.400 
really affects I mean it's hard to do
the<00:05:47.700> math<00:05:47.850> of<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.180> shotguns<00:05:48.630> because<00:05:49.020> it's

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
the math of the shotguns because it's

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.770 
the math of the shotguns because it's
firing<00:05:49.770> out<00:05:50.070> so<00:05:50.280> many<00:05:50.400> pellets<00:05:50.880> that<00:05:51.030> should

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
firing out so many pellets that should

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.480 
firing out so many pellets that should
be<00:05:51.990> lethal<00:05:52.440> because<00:05:52.650> there's<00:05:53.010> so<00:05:53.190> many<00:05:53.340> of

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
be lethal because there's so many of

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.940 
be lethal because there's so many of
them<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:53.790> they<00:05:53.850> do<00:05:53.910> so<00:05:54.030> much<00:05:54.450> damage<00:05:54.680> but<00:05:55.680> it's

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
them and they do so much damage but it's

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.530 
them and they do so much damage but it's
something<00:05:56.220> with<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.550> spread<00:05:56.850> pattern<00:05:57.120> on<00:05:57.390> the

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
something with the spread pattern on the

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.909 
something with the spread pattern on the
m10<00:05:57.960> like<00:05:58.370> it's<00:05:59.570> it's<00:06:00.570> just<00:06:00.690> atrocious<00:06:01.380> and

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
m10 like it's it's just atrocious and

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.190 
m10 like it's it's just atrocious and
whether<00:06:02.700> you're<00:06:02.940> pulling<00:06:03.240> all<00:06:03.390> leg<00:06:03.660> shots<00:06:03.960> or

you<00:06:56.699> know<00:06:56.789> seven<00:06:57.150> rounds<00:06:57.600> is<00:06:57.750> pretty<00:06:57.990> good<00:06:58.169> but

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 
you know seven rounds is pretty good but

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.420 
you know seven rounds is pretty good but
with<00:06:58.440> a<00:06:58.470> semi-auto<00:06:58.949> you're<00:06:59.130> gonna<00:06:59.220> rip

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
with a semi-auto you're gonna rip

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.850 
with a semi-auto you're gonna rip
through<00:06:59.610> so<00:07:00.000> fast<00:07:00.360> yeah<00:07:01.229> I<00:07:02.039> don't<00:07:02.880> know<00:07:03.060> I<00:07:03.860> it's

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
through so fast yeah I don't know I it's

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.439 
through so fast yeah I don't know I it's
the<00:07:05.010> inconsistency<00:07:05.669> that<00:07:05.760> gets<00:07:06.090> me<00:07:06.270> you<00:07:06.300> know

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:06.449 
the inconsistency that gets me you know

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.480 
the inconsistency that gets me you know
like<00:07:06.539> even<00:07:06.870> the<00:07:06.930> 870<00:07:07.470> MCS<00:07:07.949> is<00:07:08.190> a<00:07:08.220> much<00:07:08.460> better

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
like even the 870 MCS is a much better

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.420 
like even the 870 MCS is a much better
shot<00:07:08.789> gun<00:07:09.330> because<00:07:09.539> you<00:07:10.080> can<00:07:10.229> rely<00:07:10.620> on<00:07:10.650> it<00:07:11.039> the

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
shot gun because you can rely on it the

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.689 
shot gun because you can rely on it the
m1014<00:07:11.729> it's<00:07:13.190> there's<00:07:14.190> no<00:07:14.340> other<00:07:14.370> way<00:07:14.550> to<00:07:14.580> put

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 
m1014 it's there's no other way to put

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:16.700 
m1014 it's there's no other way to put
it<00:07:14.820> it's<00:07:15.330> just<00:07:15.510> bad<00:07:15.690> it's<00:07:16.050> inconsistent<00:07:16.440> like

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.710 
it it's just bad it's inconsistent like

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.219 
it it's just bad it's inconsistent like
at<00:07:16.979> one<00:07:17.160> point<00:07:17.370> you<00:07:17.490> get<00:07:17.639> a<00:07:17.699> kill<00:07:17.940> and<00:07:17.970> then<00:07:18.360> two

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:19.229 
at one point you get a kill and then two

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:21.350 
at one point you get a kill and then two
minutes<00:07:19.320> later<00:07:19.530> you're<00:07:19.949> in<00:07:20.070> the<00:07:20.160> same<00:07:20.610> exact

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
minutes later you're in the same exact

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.779 
minutes later you're in the same exact
situation<00:07:22.020> the<00:07:22.110> same<00:07:22.349> distance<00:07:22.860> everything

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:23.789 
situation the same distance everything

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:26.029 
situation the same distance everything
isn't<00:07:24.120> it<00:07:24.360> absolutely<00:07:24.479> identical<00:07:25.110> to<00:07:25.889> the

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 
isn't it absolutely identical to the

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:27.860 
isn't it absolutely identical to the
previous<00:07:26.070> situation<00:07:26.940> yet<00:07:27.419> you<00:07:27.510> don't<00:07:27.599> get<00:07:27.810> the

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
previous situation yet you don't get the

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.900 
previous situation yet you don't get the
kill<00:07:28.080> and<00:07:28.260> even<00:07:29.070> worse<00:07:29.280> you<00:07:29.490> only<00:07:29.610> get<00:07:29.760> the<00:07:29.820> guy

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:29.910 
kill and even worse you only get the guy

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.219 
kill and even worse you only get the guy
down<00:07:30.090> to<00:07:30.210> like<00:07:30.330> sixty<00:07:30.750> or<00:07:30.780> seventy<00:07:30.990> percent

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
down to like sixty or seventy percent

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.589 
down to like sixty or seventy percent
health<00:07:31.620> so<00:07:31.800> it's<00:07:31.860> like<00:07:32.070> I<00:07:32.280> don't<00:07:33.210> get<00:07:33.479> it

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599
