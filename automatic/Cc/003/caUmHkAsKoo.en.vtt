00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.370 
together and she started coming when she
was<00:02:09.310> in<00:02:09.429> elementary<00:02:09.580> school<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:11.110> she's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
was in elementary school so she's

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.320 
was in elementary school so she's
something<00:02:11.739> doing<00:02:11.920> her<00:02:11.980> hair<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.220> long<00:02:12.459> time<00:02:12.760> and

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
something doing her hair a long time and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.440 
something doing her hair a long time and
one<00:02:14.019> reason<00:02:14.470> why<00:02:14.650> we<00:02:14.890> used<00:02:15.190> why<00:02:15.940> she's<00:02:16.150> had<00:02:16.360> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
one reason why we used why she's had the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.390 
one reason why we used why she's had the
problem<00:02:17.019> with<00:02:17.049> it<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.500> because<00:02:17.680> she's<00:02:18.100> been<00:02:18.310> on

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
problem with it is because she's been on

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.280 
problem with it is because she's been on
medications<00:02:19.180> different<00:02:19.660> medications

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
medications different medications

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.070 
medications different medications
throughout<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.920> years<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:22.630> think<00:02:22.660> that

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
throughout the years and I think that

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.220 
throughout the years and I think that
this<00:02:23.319> has<00:02:24.060> been<00:02:25.060> good<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.420> use<00:02:25.630> along<00:02:25.959> with<00:02:26.110> all

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
this has been good to use along with all

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.259 
this has been good to use along with all
the<00:02:26.350> medications<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:27.280> keep<00:02:27.430> her<00:02:27.610> hair<00:02:27.850> looking

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
the medications to keep her hair looking

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.979 
the medications to keep her hair looking
healthy<00:02:29.459> it's<00:02:30.459> really<00:02:30.910> shiny<00:02:31.180> now<00:02:31.480> compared

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
healthy it's really shiny now compared

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.259 
healthy it's really shiny now compared
to<00:02:32.019> when<00:02:32.830> we<00:02:32.980> started<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.580> was<00:02:33.610> really<00:02:34.030> dull

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
to when we started it was really dull

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.020 
to when we started it was really dull
yes<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.200> didn't<00:02:35.680> have<00:02:35.799> any<00:02:36.010> shine<00:02:36.370> at<00:02:36.610> all<00:02:36.730> to

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
yes it didn't have any shine at all to

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.000
