00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.749
 Have a good day back with a logo at guitarist Heerenveen 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:25.909
 nothing when he 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:27.600
 news hour the long one 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.689
 we're going to explain but not to break in the second position 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.570
 that is a nice pot because there is a live version of a on youtube 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.200
 bonuses a guest at paul de leeuw in the show in the players bus with the band 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.500
 I want to be broken in the same group that will continue to use it 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.120
 2 when ever for a trainer is from PSV I hope do that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.060
 without a collective agreement there are other agreements and it is a lot of input from play 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.230
 but this one is able to play 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.330
 I just think it's tactically easy and yes 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.680
 so if you took your contact form go on the website 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.320
 and now the demand for the top designer to have minutes of long sets of recorded 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.640
 a team together at j or with the capo on 2 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.190
 that rhymes Sinterklaas is coming 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.190
 roy skills you can for 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.930
 the emea 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.180
 just put the finish of the deal is that there would be a short cut that already 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.790
 those other retailers 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.640
 Flushing East March 3 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.689
 it is a four-year commitment in the third position of the broken person 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.710
 very much for a baby act 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.710
 informal care is very short 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.970
 her colleague 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.510
 but that shows that comes to life 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.510
 that title is that the body very often for short 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.540
 maria shorten 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.540
 tribute for a bicycle 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.700
 and then ten years 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.260
 it was santander again 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.340
 you already have so good is the stupid mistakes that the collection week 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.980
 play along with his position last week 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.620
 if you want to say this is the coc there he is right now you know how 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.860
 It is now that I mean the image 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.860
 battisti 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.319
 for being closer to public health, it is ironic that pinky 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.319
 chinese people 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.719
 Orange 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:43.469
 what they start with is the start of a marathon 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.159
 the name 2 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.860
 the author salomon 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.019
 the numbers 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.019
 keep the job why the newspaper 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.799
 we will also improve that blow when not always doing but normally never 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:56.509
 but 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.689
 besides this time not with a passion because it is research 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.969
 judge that it sounded fun 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:03.180
 for years the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.200
 I always like Giselle Twitter and this saddle was actually one 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.320
 times on the demand side nancy wants more people on twitter but everyone a tree 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.530
 at your saeck the demand for such injury is now rising 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.609
 you will then get her predecessor processed 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.260
 the hard line of mesh lock rarely and motor yachts flirt from miss montreal 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:25.239
 there has been nothing left to read about those rules 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.840
 to what extent the Spaniard 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.150
 the farmers last night were they have the evening then the votes and then 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.149
 projects that get started is therefore why you hand drop also emphasized but you are 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.639
 this makes no sense 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.639
 of and there is at work seen yes we see 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.509
 Then you definitely need that Kramer for ten minutes 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.509
 barbara fischer year 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.109
 after that year it became a big hit 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.879
 in addition to almost half 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.879
 de and so has used buses 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.919
 something you clear yourself 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.199
 And very easy to play it's a difficult position to rent on 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.370
 agree with that 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.800
 but we've got it out of the game before tennis player starts 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.240
 must be inside 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.900
 where you go of course not so suddenly to the hospital foundation the porridge but will 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.999
 yet the holes and on top of it got so burned off my body 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:28.099
 so it's a lot of compliments 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.419
 and that there are also many computers to dive 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.460
 yes recognizable also not the mega start of course want a bit of the side 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.510
 we do not use the set very smartly with the set of course but sometimes it can be set 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:38.309
 just like that 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:39.309
 a bed sick 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:40.240
 tilt 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.240
 since then it has been a quiet bike behind 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.939
 which is worth everyone but see what happens when the class put on 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:51.199
 but I always find it a bit she's not getting better at this newspaper 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.250
 I try every now and then what is good in the picture, but that is not the case 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.630
 i did i do it like this 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.889
 we look at how this is possible here 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.479
 side studies do not direct it 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.219
 According to her, that is because of the driver's license talking about a spacious 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.249
 majority of votes 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:10.029
 when the works for the door 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:12.960
 the minister does want a trendsetter 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.619
 when in short the deminor sells it 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:16.909
 ten days in jail 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:21.749
 but tomorrow I would not at all plan the league for the caregivers 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:24.759
 There is now an orchestra that they average such a party on this song 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:30.289
 the party i've had i have a bit of a yo-yo effect from location well 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.259
 Yes 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.259
 its editors 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.840
 I also didn't play names there 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.349
 it is not at all 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:49.589
 Could have been helpful for this before the Randstad lost its rhythm and ask for it 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:52.999
 yes indeed to 2 or cribari 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:55.999
 These were other times in which the index 

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:01.990
 sex lessons success and mountain top maybe not on red white 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.360
 especially the rider 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.889
 last
