00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
swampy version of grass and so we're

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.229 
swampy version of grass and so we're
going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> start<00:00:47.460> off<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.820> lily<00:00:48.030> pads

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
going to start off with the lily pads

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
going to start off with the lily pads
just<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> water<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:50.190> can

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
just in the water right here and you can

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.740 
just in the water right here and you can
see<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.730> place<00:00:50.940> them<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.390> when<00:00:51.660> you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
see you can place them and when you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.319 
see you can place them and when you
break<00:00:51.930> them<00:00:52.199> then<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.280> creative<00:00:53.550> mode<00:00:53.730> so

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
break them then on the creative mode so

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.150 
break them then on the creative mode so
nothing<00:00:54.660> happens<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.110> um<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.129> basically

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
nothing happens but um so basically

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.569 
nothing happens but um so basically
their<00:00:56.670> water<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.100> actually<00:00:59.219> stand

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
their water and you can actually stand

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.099 
their water and you can actually stand
on<00:00:59.760> them<00:00:59.910> that's<00:01:00.359> pretty<00:01:00.570> cool<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.989> can

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
on them that's pretty cool so you can

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.959 
on them that's pretty cool so you can
make<00:01:01.230> kind<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> water<00:01:02.190> lily<00:01:02.370> past<00:01:02.730> your

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
which are just a cow mushroom hybrids

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.700 
which are just a cow mushroom hybrids
that<00:01:35.200> are<00:01:35.950> kind<00:01:36.190> of<00:01:36.220> weird<00:01:36.490> mutants<00:01:36.850> so

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
that are kind of weird mutants so

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.870 
that are kind of weird mutants so
basically<00:01:38.710> you<00:01:38.890> find<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.310> little<00:01:39.520> island

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
basically you find a little island

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.660 
basically you find a little island
that's<00:01:40.450> made<00:01:40.810> of<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:41.170> stuff<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:41.979> there

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
that's made of this stuff and there

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.240 
that's made of this stuff and there
would<00:01:42.790> be<00:01:42.820> some<00:01:43.000> mushrooms<00:01:43.390> on<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.840> and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
would be some mushrooms on it and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.830 
would be some mushrooms on it and
basically<00:01:45.250> that's<00:01:45.580> just<00:01:45.940> having<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.540> good<00:01:46.690> time

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
basically that's just having a good time

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.430 
basically that's just having a good time
yeah<00:01:47.110> so<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.700> is<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.030> missus<00:01:49.570> ileum<00:01:49.990> I<00:01:50.170> think

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
yeah so that is the missus ileum I think

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.170 
yeah so that is the missus ileum I think
it's<00:01:50.560> called<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:51.250> that<00:01:51.460> is<00:01:51.580> a<00:01:51.610> very<00:01:52.000> cool

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
it's called so that is a very cool

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.240 
it's called so that is a very cool
update<00:01:52.509> now<00:01:52.750> obviously<00:01:53.350> we<00:01:53.740> need<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.040> check

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
update now obviously we need to check

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.190 
update now obviously we need to check
out<00:01:54.369> some<00:01:54.550> of<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.759> end<00:01:54.970> rock<00:01:55.420> or<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:56.020> end

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
out some of the end rock or the end

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.950 
out some of the end rock or the end
stone<00:01:56.789> what's<00:01:57.789> it<00:01:57.880> called<00:01:58.060> em<00:01:58.180> estonia<00:01:58.810> in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
stone what's it called em estonia in

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.440 
stone what's it called em estonia in
stone<00:01:59.350> so<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.399> official<00:02:00.700> name<00:02:00.820> is<00:02:01.000> n<00:02:01.180> stone

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
stone so the official name is n stone

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.510 
stone so the official name is n stone
and<00:02:01.720> as<00:02:02.320> you<00:02:02.440> can<00:02:02.530> see<00:02:02.560> it's<00:02:02.770> very<00:02:02.860> similar<00:02:03.399> to

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
and as you can see it's very similar to

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.100 
and as you can see it's very similar to
sand<00:02:03.910> you<00:02:04.390> almost<00:02:04.600> can't<00:02:04.869> tell<00:02:05.020> the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
sand you almost can't tell the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.200 
sand you almost can't tell the
difference<00:02:05.289> if<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:05.680> just<00:02:05.920> were<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.729> be

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
difference if you just were to be

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.940 
difference if you just were to be
walking<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.630> desert<00:02:07.930> or<00:02:08.050> some<00:02:08.200> he's<00:02:08.739> like

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
walking the desert or some he's like

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.680 
walking the desert or some he's like
walk<00:02:09.340> over<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.090> probably<00:02:10.420> wouldn't

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
walk over it and you probably wouldn't

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.750 
walk over it and you probably wouldn't
even<00:02:10.750> notice<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.200> done<00:02:11.380> but<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:12.280> doesn't<00:02:12.580> bond

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
even notice it done but it doesn't bond

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.780 
even notice it done but it doesn't bond
in<00:02:12.940> regular<00:02:13.930> world<00:02:14.080> so

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
in regular world so

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.550 
in regular world so
to<00:02:15.060> worry<00:02:15.209> about<00:02:15.299> that<00:02:15.569> not<00:02:16.290> sure<00:02:16.409> why<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
to worry about that not sure why that

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.949 
to worry about that not sure why that
would<00:02:16.829> be<00:02:16.920> something<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.250> worry<00:02:17.430> about<00:02:17.519> but<00:02:18.239> it

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
would be something to worry about but it

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.530 
would be something to worry about but it
looks<00:02:19.170> very<00:02:19.349> nice<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.709> looks<00:02:19.859> kind<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.099> like<00:02:20.159> um
