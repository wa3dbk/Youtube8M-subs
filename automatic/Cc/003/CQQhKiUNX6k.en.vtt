00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.010
 in our stories we tell you about 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.160
 unusual museums so it will be in 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.499
 this time the museum where we decided to go 

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:08.630
 today is quite an extraordinary but 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.309
 here are live exhibits 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.959
 since it was a hoax for the inhabitants 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.210
 Chelyabinsk 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.870
 i can't read myself 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.640
 that is, participate in the hunt along with 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.690
 man for these feathered matter 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.759
 habitual 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.419
 to say exactly when it started 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.029
 cooperation 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.390
 identity and viewers 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.090
 according to some reports it happened around 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.829
 three thousand years ago 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.760
 it managed to find for the client 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.170
 which depicted Putin came turn 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.120
 related created were produced yet 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.460
 BC 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.630
 other social benefits considered 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.380
 Asia 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.860
 here the tradition came to Europe 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.370
 but since then the messengers whose birds too 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.780
 was very common 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.600
 I wonder what aesthetic 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.580
 component of this activity is always 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.120
 prevailed over who could 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.700
 return to her find was not 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.399
 just Korean entertainment than 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.610
 or even social networks 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.140
 then this is a wrong estimate 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.420
 Falconers area 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.930
 and here are the prices 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.370
 well, and then the measure has changed and this 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.090
 traditions also went 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.090
 almost all the kings 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.490
 others to alexey mikhalycha the walking father 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.050
 Peter the First were kings falconers 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.650
 people having falconry the most 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.160
 direct relation 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.070
 viburnum in Russia was so popular 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.380
 that the threats associated with it even appear 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.950
 from holy books 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.119
 for example in Novgorod 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.719
 psalms of the fourteenth century 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.020
 one of the prescribed letters represents 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.740
 a man of words whose market position 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.450
 at some point chekalin hunt 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.790
 acquired political 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.380
 value after all during her 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.670
 contacts were established with 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.119
 foreign ambassadors who were invited 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.250
 take part in this action 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.260
 in January the number of points 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.159
 graduated 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.280
 she was considered very honorable and get 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.610
 this rank was incredibly difficult 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.369
 with such a number of constant companion 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.750
 and sometimes the king's advisor 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.110
 people are used to conquer nature 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.990
 and be gentlemen 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.260
 to rest the dogs horses 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.519
 something else 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.939
 I'm here the situation is a reverse petition 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.499
 should become mr amz okolnikov and 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.579
 falconer serve well birds then 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.180
 relationships develop and birds 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.999
 remains human 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.339
 red sox but we don't change the bird we 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.459
 we change ourselves 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.289
 and in this 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.309
 fundamental difference from all 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.709
 rest of the hunting arts 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.729
 for the preparation of 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.729
 such relations 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.299
 for birds you need m 4 weeks 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.639
 and she needs to devote under four weeks and 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.499
 all her life next 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.049
 percentage to change 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.199
 man and he became falconers need 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.729
 about four years 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:49.669
 very interesting attributes of falconry 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.810
 hunting on the head of the bird club chock 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.599
 He is needed to protect her from 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.140
 extra impressions and more books tied 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.130
 bells to keep track of 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.029
 bird during flight 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.649
 equipment for hunting cases residents in this 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.859
 the whole hall is dedicated to the museum 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.739
 what kind of feathered falconers like 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.089
 rule syringes in Russia these attributes 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.829
 were made of alder she and velvet 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.439
 pearl and gold embroidery 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.959
 now of course this does not happen but all 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:17.460
 equally 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.310
 modern feathered equipment 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.060
 workers also looks very 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.239
 spectacularly 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.729
 this museum appeared about a year ago 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:26.849
 but the story began much 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:27.989
 earlier 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.829
 face ago my mother took away zones museum 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.879
 the case for the pen took away there did not see the percentage 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.129
 the professor dementieva collection which 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.349
 was dedicated 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.809
 percentage of words just a little bit son 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.399
 here we see the fuse 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:43.009
 got a hunter with a knee 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:45.049
 falconers 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.289
 but some 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.319
 a year ago the museum of bulgaria was opened 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.479
 because 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:57.289
 our organization union revival course of what 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:59.729
 art after finishing the union invited here 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.329
 for the museum to be here 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.919
 people could meet became 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.079
 finds case of absence 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.409
 at all times falconers 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.820
 treated hares with particular trepidation 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.360
 it was believed that a true hunting friend in 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.730
 in no case can you sell for years 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.900
 held together with a person 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.289
 birds a piece of his soul 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.019
 The first bird appeared 12 years ago 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.889
 it was a whole hour preference item 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.900
 later me 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.340
 but the social shene lined up very 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.020
 complicated 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.700
 several times 500 tons I ran 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.949
 Moscow is not busy in the Moscow region 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.349
 then all the same was the first production 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.599
 random is the merit of the edge of course attention 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.869
 here and then he flew away how often fly 

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:44.069
 bird trap 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.790
 so only a gang live here 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.790
 private carriers contracts 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.500
 their hunting and tactics are incredible 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500
 varied 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.270
 we managed to get to know 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.719
 balcony with her 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:58.379
 and simple things 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.650
 Besides that 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.650
 I'm afraid of hunters 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.409
 part 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.569
 percentage with this disposition museum 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:09.689
 searched for a find 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.799
 she still plays in the theater on the taganka tt 

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:14.559
 favorite favorite birds Yuri Petrovich 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:15.819
 loved 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.810
 the work of the staff of Shakespeare 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.740
 in the Diet 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.900
 percentage of falconry reaching in general 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.629
 most important actor 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.719
 last deal was probably the most bed 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:26.560
 from Samara 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.889
 in her speech she go well on 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.220
 human contact with their effects 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.630
 the series is moving the most perhaps on this 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.350
 similarity with the four-legged friend 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.280
 does not end the effect of treatment in 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.430
 these feathered and this time relationship 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.240
 Saker Falcon landscaped 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.210
 the program 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.169
 this text most likely leads 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.669
 than 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.719
 somehow obeys 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.260
 in the most general analysis 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.550
 on confident 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.240
 very strong very different from a ton 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.409
 because we are her prosperity 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.519
 from the acquaintance to introduce but when 

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:01.569
 the area was a commission 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.319
 here 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:05.819
 flew a lot that is one special 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.369
 bait drove through a large field 

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:10.629
 bait bait 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:12.000
 to have more 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.020
 good powerful breasts to be good 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.339
 wings 

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:18.429
 feathered life in this unusual museums 

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:19.779
 subject to strict routine 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.889
 certain time they must 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.639
 flying in the air for them it's like 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.259
 training athletes 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.110
 lack of movement for learners accurately 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.680
 same hunting time 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.900
 morning comes 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.830
 this 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.039
 6 7 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.939
 8 am depending on the weather 

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.659
 the birds go to the gym 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.129
 the percentage of an hour in the air 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:47.029
 hawks at least 

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:50.599
 for half an hour m but the difference is that for 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:53.599
 to work falcon percent 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:57.429
 it is necessary to almost stand still falcon 

00:06:57.429 --> 00:07:00.429
 flourishing around you 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:03.069
 to work with the hawk 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:04.349
 you have to move 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:05.949
 decent distance 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:08.340
 it is undesirable to run to reduce time 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.009
 aviastar same goes following you 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:12.779
 maybe the same we are forest 

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:13.809
 specialty application 

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:15.770
 special training techniques 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.710
 in the last years of his work on 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.930
 unique 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.820
 and not only because there are living 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.240
 exhibits having been here we will touch 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.759
 simultaneously in nature their history 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.580
 this is a common position this is incredible 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.900
 interesting representatives 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.539
 animal life viburnum like this 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:34.169
 they are fundamentally cultural heritage 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:35.120
 recognized
