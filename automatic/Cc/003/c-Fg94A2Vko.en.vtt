00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.790 

so<00:00:26.030> what<00:00:26.510> we've<00:00:26.690> developed<00:00:26.900> here<00:00:27.320> is<00:00:27.500> the

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
so what we've developed here is the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.580 
so what we've developed here is the
first<00:00:28.340> fully<00:00:29.300> electric<00:00:29.690> high-capacity<00:00:30.080> bus

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
first fully electric high-capacity bus

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.979 
first fully electric high-capacity bus
which<00:00:31.279> what<00:00:32.029> makes<00:00:32.210> it<00:00:32.330> special<00:00:32.419> it<00:00:32.780> runs

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
which what makes it special it runs

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.479 
which what makes it special it runs
without<00:00:33.290> contact<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.830> their<00:00:33.980> way<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:34.280> wires

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
without contact to their way and wires

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.710 
without contact to their way and wires
and<00:00:34.930> we<00:00:35.930> do<00:00:36.080> that<00:00:36.260> by<00:00:36.500> doing<00:00:37.300> recharges<00:00:38.300> at<00:00:38.420> bus

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
and we do that by doing recharges at bus

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.439 
and we do that by doing recharges at bus
stops<00:00:39.100> those<00:00:40.100> are<00:00:40.340> well<00:00:40.580> situated<00:00:40.730> at<00:00:41.300> the

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
stops those are well situated at the

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.030 
stops those are well situated at the

ends of the lines where we do a longer
stop<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:43.460> then<00:00:43.580> it<00:00:43.610> intermediate<00:00:44.300> stops

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
stop and then it intermediate stops

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.780 
stop and then it intermediate stops
along<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.930> line<00:00:45.080> and<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:46.190> energy<00:00:46.489> that<00:00:46.640> we

you flush stations and the fresh station

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.609 
you flush stations and the fresh station
has<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.939> be<00:01:41.060> splitted<00:01:41.630> all<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.200> way<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.469> the

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
has to be splitted all the way of the

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.160 
has to be splitted all the way of the

reload<00:01:45.469> quite<00:01:45.829> very<00:01:46.130> fast<00:01:46.429> the<00:01:46.700> bus<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.119> a

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
reload quite very fast the bus in a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.120 
reload quite very fast the bus in a
couple<00:01:47.630> of<00:01:47.689> second<00:01:48.140> we're<00:01:48.259> talking<00:01:48.530> about<00:01:48.590> 15

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
couple of second we're talking about 15

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.110 
couple of second we're talking about 15
second<00:01:49.609> energy<00:01:50.119> transfer

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.580 

but<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.720> reason<00:01:56.930> this<00:01:57.020> has<00:01:57.200> not<00:01:57.320> been<00:01:57.470> done

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
but the reason this has not been done

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.980 
but the reason this has not been done
before<00:01:57.620> I<00:01:58.220> think<00:01:58.790> that<00:01:58.910> there<00:01:59.210> are<00:01:59.690> two<00:01:59.810> main

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
before I think that there are two main

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.650 
before I think that there are two main
reasons<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.920> first<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:01.880> really

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
reasons the first is that you really

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.429 
reasons the first is that you really
need<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.990> do<00:02:03.230> a<00:02:03.260> quick<00:02:03.440> connection

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
need to do a quick connection

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.830 
need to do a quick connection
so<00:02:06.009> that<00:02:06.159> you<00:02:06.249> don't<00:02:06.429> waste<00:02:06.640> time<00:02:06.880> making<00:02:07.509> your

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
so that you don't waste time making your

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.969 
so that you don't waste time making your
connection<00:02:08.229> when<00:02:08.379> you<00:02:08.470> want<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.769> do<00:02:08.860> the

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
connection when you want to do the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.699 
connection when you want to do the
charging<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.729> think<00:02:10.060> that's<00:02:10.360> that's<00:02:10.899> been<00:02:11.650> a

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
charging so I think that's that's been a

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.710 
charging so I think that's that's been a
real<00:02:12.400> innovation<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.120> project<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.599> we

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
real innovation in this project that we

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.289 
real innovation in this project that we
come<00:02:14.379> along<00:02:14.590> with<00:02:14.799> something<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.299> connects

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
come along with something that connects

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.030 
come along with something that connects
more<00:02:16.840> quickly<00:02:17.049> than<00:02:17.260> anybody<00:02:17.650> else<00:02:17.769> has<00:02:17.920> been

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
more quickly than anybody else has been

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.800 
more quickly than anybody else has been
able<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.340> do<00:02:18.489> that<00:02:18.670> but<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.540> battery

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
able to do that but the battery

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.780 
able to do that but the battery
technology<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.319> also<00:02:20.680> evolved<00:02:21.129> in<00:02:21.250> recent

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
technology is also evolved in recent

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.619 
technology is also evolved in recent
years<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:23.500> which<00:02:23.920> allows<00:02:24.220> us<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.629> make

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
years and that which allows us to make

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.250 
years and that which allows us to make
these<00:02:25.840> fast<00:02:26.019> charges<00:02:27.690> as<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.840> know<00:02:28.959> we<00:02:29.110> have<00:02:29.200> a

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
these fast charges as you know we have a

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.600 
these fast charges as you know we have a
stronger<00:02:29.500> VB<00:02:29.830> railroad<00:02:30.129> business<00:02:30.250> it

this<00:02:33.519> railroad<00:02:33.790> business<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.299> decided<00:02:34.660> to

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
this railroad business we decided to

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.880 
this railroad business we decided to
move<00:02:34.900> toward<00:02:35.230> sustainable<00:02:35.739> mobility

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890

which<00:02:39.819> came<00:02:40.060> in<00:02:40.480> online<00:02:40.780> when<00:02:40.989> we<00:02:41.079> decided<00:02:41.530> to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
which came in online when we decided to

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.490 
which came in online when we decided to
go<00:02:41.799> for<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:43.150> big<00:02:43.360> mass<00:02:43.569> transportation<00:02:43.989> was

in<00:02:49.209> today<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:53.349> challenges<00:02:53.829> is<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.190> come<00:02:54.370> with

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
in today the challenges is to come with

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.650 
in today the challenges is to come with
a<00:02:54.579> new<00:02:54.849> system<00:02:55.150> in<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.540> public

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
a new system in the public

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.170 
a new system in the public
transportation<00:02:56.170> because<00:02:57.129> there<00:02:57.849> is<00:02:57.970> so

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
transportation because there is so

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.240 
transportation because there is so
already<00:02:58.450> established<00:02:59.200> systems<00:02:59.530> like<00:02:59.739> metros

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
already established systems like metros

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.440 
already established systems like metros
trans<00:03:01.060> trolleybuses<00:03:01.950> buses<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.609> every<00:03:04.269> time

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
trans trolleybuses buses so every time

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.240 
trans trolleybuses buses so every time
that<00:03:04.629> you<00:03:04.750> come<00:03:04.900> with<00:03:05.079> something<00:03:05.410> new<00:03:05.590> then

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
that you come with something new then

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.039 
that you come with something new then
you<00:03:06.489> have<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.910> understand<00:03:07.359> that<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.870> it

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
you have to understand that is it

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.319 
you have to understand that is it
difficult<00:03:08.560> some<00:03:08.829> time<00:03:09.040> for<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.700> operators<00:03:10.299> to

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
difficult some time for the operators to

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.229 
difficult some time for the operators to
integrate<00:03:11.019> a<00:03:11.049> new<00:03:11.319> system<00:03:11.829> in<00:03:12.700> their<00:03:12.970> in<00:03:13.150> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
integrate a new system in their in the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.790 
integrate a new system in their in the
package

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.160 

you<00:03:19.550> know<00:03:19.670> we<00:03:19.820> decided<00:03:20.240> to<00:03:20.330> go<00:03:20.450> for<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.810> after<00:03:21.140> a

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
you know we decided to go for it after a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.390 
you know we decided to go for it after a
feasibility<00:03:21.470> study<00:03:21.740> we<00:03:22.100> did<00:03:22.220> with<00:03:22.340> the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
feasibility study we did with the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.770 
feasibility study we did with the
partners<00:03:22.850> because<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.300> was<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.480> really

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
partners because it was a really

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.560 
partners because it was a really
important<00:03:24.260> weather<00:03:24.940> operator<00:03:25.940> also<00:03:26.150> involved

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
important weather operator also involved

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.360 
important weather operator also involved
so<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.140> people<00:03:27.290> who<00:03:27.560> know<00:03:27.650> all<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:27.980> run<00:03:28.100> a<00:03:28.160> bus

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
so the people who know all to run a bus

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.600 
so the people who know all to run a bus
within<00:03:28.730> an<00:03:28.880> inner<00:03:29.300> city<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:30.560> after<00:03:30.890> ten<00:03:31.460> months

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
within an inner city so after ten months

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.780 
within an inner city so after ten months
of<00:03:33.130> teamwork<00:03:34.130> with<00:03:34.400> them
