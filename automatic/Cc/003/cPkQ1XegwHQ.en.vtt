00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
yeah as you see here right now he'll

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.779 
yeah as you see here right now he'll
just<00:00:51.300> take<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:52.860> lead<00:00:53.039> from<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.430> really

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
just take the the lead from a really

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.279 
just take the the lead from a really
hard<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.480> defend<00:00:54.750> against<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.050> all<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.260> is

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
hard to defend against at all which is

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.930 
hard to defend against at all which is
basically<00:00:55.800> when<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.309> low<00:00:56.489> chemistry<00:00:56.879> at

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
basically when you have low chemistry at

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.520 
basically when you have low chemistry at
the<00:00:57.000> beginning<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.390> ultimate<00:00:57.809> team<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.500> all

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the beginning of ultimate team you all

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
the beginning of ultimate team you all
can<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.219> well<00:00:59.399> at<00:00:59.879> least<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.180> my<00:01:00.329> case<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
can see that well at least in my case I

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.389 
can see that well at least in my case I
found<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> conceded<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.770> lot<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.129> headers

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
found a conceded a lot of headers

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.729 
found a conceded a lot of headers
whether<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.879> from<00:01:03.030> corners<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.719> crosses<00:01:04.589> in

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
whether it be from corners or crosses in

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.560 
whether it be from corners or crosses in
general<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.820> really<00:01:06.030> hard<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> defend

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
general and it's really hard to defend

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.330 
general and it's really hard to defend
against<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.170> my<00:01:07.409> chemistry<00:01:07.799> rose<00:01:08.070> I

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
against what as my chemistry rose I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.310 
against what as my chemistry rose I
found<00:01:08.610> us<00:01:08.760> considered<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.450> lot<00:01:09.780> less<00:01:10.049> goals

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
found us considered a lot less goals

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.140 
found us considered a lot less goals
like<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.520> was<00:01:11.610> easy<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.939> actually

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
like that and it was easy to actually

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.170 
like that and it was easy to actually
like<00:01:12.450> control<00:01:12.810> my<00:01:12.900> defense<00:01:13.700> but<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.760> was<00:01:15.000> saying

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
like control my defense but I was saying

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.810 
like control my defense but I was saying

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.659 
see here getting up scoring two goals in
this<00:04:26.169> four<00:04:26.379> little<00:04:26.650> victory<00:04:26.979> but<00:04:27.219> I<00:04:27.400> didn't

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
this four little victory but I didn't

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.240 
this four little victory but I didn't
have<00:04:27.729> the<00:04:27.819> rest<00:04:28.060> of<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.210> goals<00:04:29.250> captured

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
have the rest of the goals captured

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.670 
have the rest of the goals captured
because<00:04:30.520> my<00:04:31.419> capture<00:04:31.689> card<00:04:31.750> has<00:04:32.050> died<00:04:32.349> acting

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
because my capture card has died acting

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.409 
because my capture card has died acting
glitchy<00:04:32.919> as<00:04:33.099> well<00:04:33.250> as<00:04:33.580> long<00:04:33.819> as<00:04:33.939> my<00:04:34.060> laptop

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
glitchy as well as long as my laptop

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.589 
glitchy as well as long as my laptop
being<00:04:34.810> really<00:04:35.169> badly<00:04:35.379> it<00:04:35.889> crashes<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.759> it

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
being really badly it crashes and it

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.059 
being really badly it crashes and it
just<00:04:37.750> like<00:04:37.960> midway<00:04:38.469> through<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.740> match<00:04:38.919> it

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
just like midway through the match it

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:40.499 
just like midway through the match it
was<00:04:39.129> just<00:04:39.310> like<00:04:39.460> stopping<00:04:39.819> and<00:04:40.150> stuff<00:04:40.360> it's

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
was just like stopping and stuff it's

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:41.429 
was just like stopping and stuff it's
probably<00:04:40.629> because<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:40.960> was<00:04:41.080> running<00:04:41.259> low<00:04:41.409> on

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:41.439 
probably because I was running low on

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:43.589 
probably because I was running low on
memory<00:04:41.710> but<00:04:42.490> my<00:04:42.610> laptop<00:04:42.969> is<00:04:43.090> really<00:04:43.419> really

it was really really easy to do on
people<00:05:41.589> 10<00:05:41.740> I<00:05:41.949> think<00:05:42.490> anyone<00:05:43.150> but<00:05:43.270> what<00:05:43.419> the

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
people 10 I think anyone but what the

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.170 
people 10 I think anyone but what the
five<00:05:43.690> star<00:05:43.960> skill<00:05:44.229> move<00:05:44.460> on<00:05:45.460> people<00:05:45.909> ten<00:05:46.029> could

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
five star skill move on people ten could

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.240 
five star skill move on people ten could
do<00:05:46.300> it<00:05:46.449> but<00:05:46.810> um<00:05:46.930> on<00:05:47.229> this<00:05:47.560> I<00:05:47.680> think<00:05:47.740> any<00:05:48.039> player

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
do it but um on this I think any player

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
do it but um on this I think any player
could<00:05:48.460> actually<00:05:48.550> do<00:05:48.729> because<00:05:48.819> it<00:05:49.000> is<00:05:49.089> actually

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
could actually do because it is actually

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.420 
could actually do because it is actually
a<00:05:49.509> pass<00:05:49.719> it's<00:05:49.930> not<00:05:50.110> a<00:05:50.139> shot<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:50.620> it's<00:05:51.250> just

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
a pass it's not a shot and it's just

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.579 
a pass it's not a shot and it's just
like<00:05:51.610> an<00:05:51.759> exploit<00:05:52.089> same<00:05:52.360> as<00:05:52.479> the<00:05:52.659> rabona<00:05:53.319> chip

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:53.589 
like an exploit same as the rabona chip

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:55.290 
like an exploit same as the rabona chip
it's<00:05:53.770> just<00:05:53.979> an<00:05:54.069> exploit<00:05:54.669> to<00:05:54.789> actually<00:05:55.060> like<00:05:55.210> to

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
it's just an exploit to actually like to

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.689 
it's just an exploit to actually like to
score<00:05:55.539> as<00:05:55.659> well<00:05:55.810> but<00:05:56.560> it<00:05:56.680> just<00:05:56.830> looks<00:05:57.039> nice<00:05:57.310> and

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
score as well but it just looks nice and

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.749 
score as well but it just looks nice and
that's<00:05:58.360> basically<00:05:58.750> how<00:05:58.839> it<00:05:59.699> school<00:06:00.699> the

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
that's basically how it school the

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.189 
that's basically how it school the
fourth<00:06:00.969> goal<00:06:01.150> and<00:06:01.449> then<00:06:01.539> Callen<00:06:01.930> gets<00:06:02.080> the

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
fourth goal and then Callen gets the

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:03.959 
fourth goal and then Callen gets the
last<00:06:02.349> goal<00:06:02.589> in<00:06:02.800> a<00:06:02.860> minute<00:06:03.099> and<00:06:03.279> I<00:06:03.400> think<00:06:03.909> we

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
last goal in a minute and I think we

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:06.149 
last goal in a minute and I think we
coming<00:06:04.270> up<00:06:04.330> to<00:06:04.479> the<00:06:04.569> end<00:06:04.779> but<00:06:05.139> actually<00:06:05.919> saw<00:06:06.039> in

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
coming up to the end but actually saw in

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:07.350 
coming up to the end but actually saw in
this<00:06:06.279> match<00:06:06.430> the<00:06:06.610> goals<00:06:06.759> that<00:06:06.879> he<00:06:07.000> scored<00:06:07.270> a

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
this match the goals that he scored a

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.490 
this match the goals that he scored a
basically<00:06:07.719> these<00:06:07.900> are<00:06:08.050> the<00:06:08.110> kind<00:06:08.259> of<00:06:08.289> goals

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
basically these are the kind of goals

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.930 
basically these are the kind of goals
you<00:06:08.710> would<00:06:08.800> concede<00:06:09.039> a<00:06:09.159> lot<00:06:09.310> when<00:06:09.460> you<00:06:09.550> got<00:06:09.699> low

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
you would concede a lot when you got low

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.689 
you would concede a lot when you got low
chemistry<00:06:10.539> which<00:06:10.719> is<00:06:10.750> like<00:06:11.699> basically

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
chemistry which is like basically

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.999 
chemistry which is like basically
rebound<00:06:13.240> goals<00:06:13.509> and<00:06:13.839> corners<00:06:14.469> like<00:06:14.710> from

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
rebound goals and corners like from

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.589 
rebound goals and corners like from
headers<00:06:15.310> and<00:06:15.430> just<00:06:15.610> just<00:06:15.879> headers<00:06:16.210> in<00:06:16.330> general

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
headers and just just headers in general

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:17.640 
headers and just just headers in general
are<00:06:16.690> really<00:06:16.839> really<00:06:17.020> hard<00:06:17.139> to<00:06:17.319> defense

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
are really really hard to defense

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.230 
are really really hard to defense
defending<00:06:18.490> against<00:06:18.669> when<00:06:18.879> you<00:06:18.969> got<00:06:19.089> low

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
defending against when you got low

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.149 
defending against when you got low
