was he took fish tank tubing that has a
3/8<00:00:34.080> diameter<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:35.370> he<00:00:35.430> took<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.670> piece<00:00:35.940> of

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
3/8 diameter and he took a piece of

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.299 
3/8 diameter and he took a piece of
plastic<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.720> he<00:00:36.780> cut<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.050> off<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.470> foot<00:00:38.070> long

plastic and he cut it off a foot long
and<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.629> end<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.900> the<00:00:40.020> tube<00:00:40.290> he<00:00:40.559> melted<00:00:40.949> it

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
and on one end of the tube he melted it

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.310 
and on one end of the tube he melted it
he<00:00:41.670> didn't<00:00:41.910> close<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.149> off<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:42.780> he<00:00:42.840> left<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.170> so

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
he didn't close it off but he left it so

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.930 
he didn't close it off but he left it so
that<00:00:43.470> it<00:00:43.620> would<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.739> slightly<00:00:44.220> smaller<00:00:44.460> than

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
that it would be slightly smaller than

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.060 
that it would be slightly smaller than
the<00:00:45.149> other<00:00:45.360> end<00:00:45.630> and<00:00:46.320> then<00:00:46.470> what<00:00:46.620> he<00:00:46.680> did<00:00:46.860> was

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the other end and then what he did was

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.940 
the other end and then what he did was
he<00:00:47.220> inserted<00:00:47.579> into<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.260> bulb<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.739> which

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
he inserted into a bulb like this which

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.910 
he inserted into a bulb like this which
could<00:00:50.130> be<00:00:50.280> taken<00:00:51.090> from<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.329> baby<00:00:51.540> enema<00:00:52.110> or<00:00:52.530> from

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
could be taken from a baby enema or from

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.910 
could be taken from a baby enema or from
an<00:00:53.010> ear<00:00:53.190> syringe<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.410> what<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
an ear syringe and what you do is you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.590 
an ear syringe and what you do is you
take<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.280> plastic<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.030> shove<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.420> into

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
take the plastic and you shove it into

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.190 
take the plastic and you shove it into
the<00:00:58.340> bowl<00:00:59.340> so<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.690> something<00:01:01.050> like

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
the bowl so now you have something like

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.619 
the bowl so now you have something like
a<00:01:01.350> base<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.219> what<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.420> this

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
a base there and what you do with this

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.570 
a base there and what you do with this
is<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.140> draw<00:01:04.800> water<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.399> into<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.360> bowl<00:01:07.580> and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
is you draw water up into the bowl and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.690 
is you draw water up into the bowl and
then<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.720> yourself<00:01:10.789> some<00:01:11.789> newer<00:01:12.509> peas

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
then you get yourself some newer peas

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.310 
then you get yourself some newer peas
because<00:01:14.700> peas<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.330> round<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.930> they'll<00:01:16.140> come

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
because peas are round and they'll come

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.680 
because peas are round and they'll come
out<00:01:16.440> of<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.680> tube<00:01:16.920> rather<00:01:17.400> easily<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.510> I'm

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
out of the tube rather easily so I'm

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.910 
out of the tube rather easily so I'm
using<00:01:19.310> Canadian<00:01:20.310> peas<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:22.290> peas<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
using Canadian peas and the peas have to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.740 
using Canadian peas and the peas have to
be<00:01:23.040> small<00:01:23.340> enough<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.670> fit<00:01:23.820> inside<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.330> tube

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
be small enough to fit inside the tube

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.649 
be small enough to fit inside the tube
and<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.950> diameter<00:01:26.460> at<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> end<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.420> tube

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
and the diameter at the end of the tube

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.149 
and the diameter at the end of the tube
is<00:01:27.990> 3/8<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.070> an<00:01:29.220> inch<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.320> of<00:01:31.320> course<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.770> peas

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
is 3/8 of an inch and of course the peas

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.310 
is 3/8 of an inch and of course the peas
have<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.640> smaller<00:01:32.970> than<00:01:33.240> two<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.810> fit<00:01:34.140> in

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
have to be smaller than two to fit in

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.990 
have to be smaller than two to fit in
and<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.619> should<00:01:34.740> use<00:01:35.100> new<00:01:35.369> piece

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and you should use new piece

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.899 
and you should use new piece
they<00:01:36.360> can't<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.840> cracked<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.530> they<00:01:38.460> can't<00:01:38.729> be

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
they can't be cracked and they can't be

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.910 
they can't be cracked and they can't be
scaling<00:01:39.509> because<00:01:39.659> they'll<00:01:40.080> stick<00:01:40.320> inside<00:01:40.680> of

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
scaling because they'll stick inside of

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.990 
scaling because they'll stick inside of
the<00:01:41.100> tube

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the tube

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.640 
the tube
so<00:01:42.450> now<00:01:42.570> what<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.140> take<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:43.380> baby

and if you wanted to give him water just
playing<00:03:31.479> water<00:03:31.689> later<00:03:31.989> on<00:03:32.169> just<00:03:32.409> use<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.560> simple

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
playing water later on just use a simple

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.699 
playing water later on just use a simple
syringe<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.849> case<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.449> water<00:03:34.659> rub<00:03:35.049> leaves<00:03:35.530> the

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
syringe in case the water rub leaves the

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.879 
syringe in case the water rub leaves the
crop<00:03:35.949> and<00:03:36.189> then<00:03:36.280> he<00:03:36.489> has<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:38.079> peas<00:03:38.349> left<00:03:38.680> there

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
crop and then he has the peas left there

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.319 
crop and then he has the peas left there
because<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.159> peas<00:03:39.370> will<00:03:39.579> swell<00:03:39.849> up<00:03:39.879> a<00:03:40.150> little

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
because the peas will swell up a little

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.390 
because the peas will swell up a little
bit<00:03:40.509> and<00:03:40.689> they'll<00:03:41.109> last<00:03:41.259> a<00:03:41.439> little<00:03:41.590> longer<00:03:41.739> you

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
bit and they'll last a little longer you

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.149 
bit and they'll last a little longer you
can<00:03:42.639> give<00:03:42.849> him<00:03:43.030> soft<00:03:43.750> food<00:03:44.139> but<00:03:44.470> I'll<00:03:44.680> do<00:03:45.009> that

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
can give him soft food but I'll do that

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.939 
can give him soft food but I'll do that
in<00:03:45.340> another<00:03:45.459> video<00:03:46.409> so<00:03:47.409> I'm<00:03:47.530> going<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.739> do<00:03:47.829> this
