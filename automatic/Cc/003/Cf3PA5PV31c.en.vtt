00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.799
 moin moin to a long awaited 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.640
 tutorial and indeed the relocation of 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.040
 chevron overhead line 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.900
 this is quite nice that me 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.900
 this is independent of the rails 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.369
 means you can lay it everywhere and 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.680
 just as you would like it and before 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.570
 Everything has a straight line or knows 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.230
 such a nice one says if you have this 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.360
 viewed above as in reality 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.430
 that does not have the pantographs like that 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.530
 The path is traversed 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.059
 back and forth in the distance of 40 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.210
 centimeters that is always 80 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.930
 centimeters from the middle out respectively 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.930
 so 40 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.220
 In the first part, we want one like that 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.210
 bit on the basics and 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:02.809
 especially the installation without the 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.280
 you do not need to carry on like that 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.049
 should ultimately draw from it if 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.040
 we are through with this little course 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:13.210
 and at the end we will on this plant 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.540
 come back again 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:22.240
 yes our zigzag top line or 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.730
 just zo we get in the bora shop 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.580
 that is again and again when we are in 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.860
 go for free we have some 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.250
 beautiful free models and in the middle 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.720
 also the zigzag overhead line 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.850
 on the one hand we have the basic set here 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.960
 the mÃ¼sstet download her with a 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.820
 look at the free model store 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.070
 The next set is the whole as a track 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.980
 object that we need that too 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.080
 So also saved next 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.770
 cross wearing work and guy mast the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.300
 we also need to and last at last 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.880
 the accessories even if we had it 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.050
 not necessarily come in but one 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.420
 few things can be more and more of 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.650
 use 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.620
 who later have it a little easier 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.640
 wanna get the masks from benny here 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.560
 sat download 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.890
 I myself do not need him we will 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.909
 also in the course not with this first 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.230
 work sets 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:20.440
 he is very helpful though 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.690
 I definitely need it, I think so 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.150
 after we downloaded a set 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.659
 to have 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.659
 we can do that 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.900
 if you the because of course wants to 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.630
 you can unpack this whole and 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.739
 then it looks like any normal one 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.950
 installation means many many 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.410
 models and a demo plant now 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.940
 maybe not as telling as that 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.390
 I find but it must always itself 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.940
 knowledge 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.819
 the most important are these df files 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.510
 here in which the overhead line 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.590
 describe and with the decor I want 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.769
 you are given that is whole 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:05.959
 practically, however, you need e5 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:11.330
 the patch 2 if I'm not mistaken and 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:14.510
 the plug-in 2 and or 6 where the hex 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.360
 entire course is already so simple 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.830
 with a click on the model installer 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.390
 or install two clicks 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:26.150
 I will not do it all now 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:30.379
 but through and on 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.560
 we can start that depending on how 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.450
 he treats, so to speak, you have to do now 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.170
 whom he himself knows again or with 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.540
 the tool of f1 do the whole thing me 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.900
 I already have the whole thing in it myself 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.150
 can you save that now so if 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.510
 after which he installs all four sets 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.730
 you will be under the waterways 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.140
 find the top line when they are down 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.310
 under guidance with many 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.920
 additional names probably first 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.209
 will not tell anyone as well as from 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.879
 still not build with to the 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.639
 that's why in the next course first 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.560
 the basics as we said we find 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.030
 the catenary are the concepts here 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.370
 about only left left left right and so on 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.470
 this does not mean anything else 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.530
 left left are both bicycle and 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.440
 holder or bicycle holder on the 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.020
 right side right side exactly 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.539
 the other way around at the right left is moving 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.130
 Only the bike to back and thus still 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.960
 from left to right from right to 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.680
 Left 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.780
 as we stretch it on straight 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.660
 need 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.440
 explained from left to right 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.910
 by itself 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.260
 from left to right goes 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.440
 again the normal operation over 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.560
 so to speak, and the rest just like that 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.440
 built that we still need to 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.979
 we are the masts to it 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.270
 there are concrete pylons where now 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.919
 not sure where to download them 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.060
 but can and where are they through 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.669
 the link only out is the then 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:06.740
 Customers in the description and in the 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.280
 You will then find glass objects in others 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.610
 all the other lattice outrigger you like that 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.800
 they might all need it 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.060
 finish labeled that means we will 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.590
 hopefully with this flat 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.349
 water works on straight and stretch 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.080
 So curves with the bike near 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:27.830
 So the advice left is the left 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.659
 father of the right or bike and 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.789
 holder country right or bike and 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.500
 omniscient left that is so 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.909
 standard dimensions use unfortunately there is 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.250
 no real lattice masts the 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.779
 probably something but okay with it 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.900
 to come back to right now 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:42.969
 there are only two-tracked 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.440
 had 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.000
 the whole thing is going to be indiscriminate as well 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.320
 Indizien the whole bit further from 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.659
 track away and then of course the 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.710
 bike for the contract with which we 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:58.849
 us the penultimate video or course 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.800
 to deal with 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:07.430
 we need the double outriggers over 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:11.620
 next course be in guess of 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.620
 parallel connections change fields 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:18.279
 and the trailer loads need that 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:18.279
 same course 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.759
 that 's just the preparations 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.600
 ie, the glass objects 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.020
 mainly with the glass objects 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:31.830
 The real estate is also available and 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:37.080
 though and an overhead line and then 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:40.949
 we also find it down here somewhere 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.970
 they go less is of course the 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:44.720
 means we have the bow above all 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.039
 deduction we will consume 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.229
 he always comes to where actually no 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:52.800
 what should be where still the 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:55.680
 there is a cords there is a kink 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.680
 here a double arm with a for 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.810
 I still have three tracks 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.930
 not needed but you never know what 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.270
 we need a grounding rod we have 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.620
 we will not need that during the course 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.430
 you can later to the design 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.410
 when euro emperor construction work are 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.789
 the whole thing is still under construction here 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.180
 can represent the man 

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:19.910
 below the cross member there are special 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.539
 masts with which I do not work 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.500
 Maybe we can do it with it 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:27.630
 someday bypass and infect ours 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.979
 let and the normal lattice mast two 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.599
 the same and so on, there are still here 

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:35.909
 times the you will have for the reason 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:39.570
 but as the construction method is again so 

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:43.860
 That's why we only work 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:47.570
 with the glass objects yes so much to the 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:52.010
 preparations and the next geo 

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.010
 Let's start with the straight stretch
