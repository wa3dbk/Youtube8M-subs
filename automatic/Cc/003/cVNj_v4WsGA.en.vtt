see when the train is going to the man
co<00:01:54.960> headquarters<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.610> not<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.030> main

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
co headquarters but it's not the main

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.630 
co headquarters but it's not the main
part<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.229> said<00:01:58.469> end<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.490> line

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
part of it like I said end of the line

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.050 
part of it like I said end of the line
is<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.119> be<00:02:00.270> an<00:02:00.540> online<00:02:01.469> game<00:02:02.430> play<00:02:02.759> an

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
is going to be an online game play an

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.260 
is going to be an online game play an
online<00:02:03.240> game<00:02:03.750> mode<00:02:04.350> where<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.969> going<00:02:06.210> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
online game mode where this is going to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.749 
online game mode where this is going to
be<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.590> man<00:02:07.590> v<00:02:07.799> machine<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.310> completely

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
be just man v machine it's completely

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460 
be just man v machine it's completely
different<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.179> say<00:02:09.390> you've<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.780> seen<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> video

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
different I say you've just seen a video

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.990 
different I say you've just seen a video
yourself<00:02:10.770> anyways<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.550> should<00:02:11.580> fully

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
yourself anyways you should fully

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.590 
yourself anyways you should fully
understand<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.480> nothing<00:02:12.780> like<00:02:12.930> ended

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
understand it's nothing like ended

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.180 
understand it's nothing like ended
it's<00:02:13.720> completely<00:02:14.170> different<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.830> only<00:02:15.010> thing

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
it's completely different the only thing

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.660 
it's completely different the only thing
that<00:02:15.340> similar<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.180> trains<00:02:16.660> but<00:02:17.410> yeah<00:02:17.710> so<00:02:18.340> I

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
that similar is the trains but yeah so I

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.720 
that similar is the trains but yeah so I
think<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.660> way<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.290> operation<00:02:21.160> decay

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
think the way that this operation decay

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.590 
think the way that this operation decay
of<00:02:21.760> war<00:02:22.210> could<00:02:22.780> potentially<00:02:23.710> become<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.600> new

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
of war could potentially become a new

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.830 
of war could potentially become a new
operation<00:02:26.140> for<00:02:26.530> manvi<00:02:26.860> machine<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.660> way

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
operation for manvi machine is the way

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.110 
operation for manvi machine is the way
it's<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.680> know<00:02:29.800> got<00:02:30.040> some<00:02:30.280> involvement<00:02:30.790> with

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
it's you know got some involvement with

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.490 
it's you know got some involvement with
that<00:02:31.270> train<00:02:31.540> already<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.050> they<00:02:32.140> could<00:02:32.320> take

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
that train already so they could take

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.740 
that train already so they could take
that<00:02:32.560> from<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.130> end<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.460> line<00:02:33.700> aspect<00:02:34.270> and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
that from the end of the line aspect and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.870 
that from the end of the line aspect and
then<00:02:34.900> implement<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.800> into<00:02:36.190> this<00:02:36.310> new<00:02:36.580> way

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
then implement that into this new way

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.790 
then implement that into this new way
and<00:02:37.180> also<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.540> don't<00:02:37.690> think<00:02:37.870> it'd<00:02:38.080> be<00:02:38.260> too<00:02:38.500> hard

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
and also I don't think it'd be too hard

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.400 
and also I don't think it'd be too hard
for<00:02:39.100> Val<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.270> create<00:02:40.720> some<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.080> stuff<00:02:41.380> that

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
for Val to create some of the stuff that

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.490 
for Val to create some of the stuff that
crass<00:02:42.190> TB<00:02:42.550> has<00:02:42.790> in<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:43.270> whole<00:02:44.080> video<00:02:44.320> you

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
crass TB has in this whole video you

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500 
crass TB has in this whole video you
know<00:02:44.680> like<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.190> flying<00:02:45.520> jet<00:02:45.970> ping<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.420> all

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
know like the flying jet ping and all

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.420 
know like the flying jet ping and all
that<00:02:46.720> sort<00:02:46.960> of<00:02:47.080> stuff<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.310> idea

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
that sort of stuff and I like the idea

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.460 
that sort of stuff and I like the idea
of<00:02:48.730> how<00:02:48.880> they<00:02:49.060> put<00:02:49.300> fake<00:02:49.630> turrets<00:02:50.140> in<00:02:50.260> these

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
of how they put fake turrets in these

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.290 
of how they put fake turrets in these
Manco<00:02:50.980> crates<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.550> all<00:02:51.640> that<00:02:51.790> stuff<00:02:51.940> as

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
Manco crates and all that stuff as

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.810 
Manco crates and all that stuff as
you've<00:02:52.870> seen<00:02:53.110> in<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.320> video<00:02:53.500> which<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.340> know

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
you've seen in the video which you know

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.610 
you've seen in the video which you know
offering<00:02:55.210> all<00:02:55.360> these<00:02:55.570> aspects<00:02:56.140> could<00:02:56.350> be<00:02:56.470> new

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
offering all these aspects could be new

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.530 
offering all these aspects could be new
aspects<00:02:57.160> implement<00:02:57.640> into<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:57.910> different<00:02:58.300> form

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
aspects implement into a different form

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.110 
aspects implement into a different form
of<00:02:58.690> operation<00:02:59.350> which<00:02:59.500> could<00:02:59.770> be<00:03:00.120> absolutely

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
of operation which could be absolutely

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.640 
of operation which could be absolutely
amazing<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:03.180> yeah<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.420> think<00:03:04.570> that's<00:03:05.350> about<00:03:05.470> it

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
amazing and yeah I think that's about it

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.520 
amazing and yeah I think that's about it
but<00:03:06.100> also<00:03:06.280> before<00:03:06.970> i<00:03:07.000> leave<00:03:07.210> it<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.170> it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
but also before i leave it to it to it

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.410 
but also before i leave it to it to it
or<00:03:08.980> whatever<00:03:09.160> guys<00:03:09.490> I'd<00:03:09.760> like<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.210> quickly

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
or whatever guys I'd like to quickly

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.360 
or whatever guys I'd like to quickly
show<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.750> as<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.020> see<00:03:11.200> on<00:03:11.230> screen<00:03:11.350> I<00:03:11.920> think

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
show you as you see on screen I think

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.580 
show you as you see on screen I think
this<00:03:12.490> is<00:03:12.640> possibly<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.300> best<00:03:14.020> interpretation

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
this is possibly the best interpretation

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.220 
this is possibly the best interpretation
of<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.430> female<00:03:15.640> pyro<00:03:16.120> ever<00:03:16.510> because<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.020> still

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
of a female pyro ever because it still

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.130 
of a female pyro ever because it still
has<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.620> bodily<00:03:18.010> shape<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.520> normal<00:03:18.880> pyro

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
has the bodily shape of the normal pyro

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.020 
has the bodily shape of the normal pyro
but<00:03:20.140> as<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.980> see<00:03:21.160> what<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.430> mask<00:03:21.640> off<00:03:21.880> it

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
but as you see what the mask off it

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.370 
but as you see what the mask off it
looks<00:03:22.120> like<00:03:22.270> there's<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.630> female<00:03:22.990> underneath

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
looks like there's a female underneath

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.230 
looks like there's a female underneath
where<00:03:23.590> I've<00:03:23.740> always<00:03:24.010> considered<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.730> pyro<00:03:24.970> to

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
where I've always considered the pyro to

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.970 
where I've always considered the pyro to
be<00:03:25.360> male<00:03:25.600> I've<00:03:25.840> never<00:03:26.050> been<00:03:26.260> into<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.830> know<00:03:26.950> I

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
be male I've never been into you know I

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.170 
be male I've never been into you know I
just<00:03:27.310> always<00:03:27.460> thought<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.790> was<00:03:27.820> a<00:03:27.940> male

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
just always thought it was a male

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.060 
just always thought it was a male
underneath<00:03:28.630> there<00:03:28.900> I<00:03:29.080> know<00:03:29.620> there<00:03:29.830> was<00:03:29.950> this

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
underneath there I know there was this

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.880 
underneath there I know there was this
whole<00:03:30.310> could<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.240> be<00:03:31.450> or<00:03:31.840> could<00:03:32.020> it<00:03:32.080> not<00:03:32.200> be<00:03:32.380> but

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
whole could it be or could it not be but

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.740 
whole could it be or could it not be but
I<00:03:33.130> think<00:03:33.370> this<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:33.850> definitely<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.570> best

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
I think this is definitely the best

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.290 
I think this is definitely the best
interpretation<00:03:35.230> I've<00:03:35.770> seen<00:03:36.130> of<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.880> anyway

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
interpretation I've seen of it anyway
