00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
covering the screws take those two

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.460 
covering the screws take those two
screws<00:01:23.829> out<00:01:24.070> and<00:01:24.540> once<00:01:25.540> you've<00:01:25.689> got<00:01:25.930> that<00:01:26.200> the

by sliding back and that will slide back

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.499 
by sliding back and that will slide back
and<00:01:48.670> up<00:01:49.659> and<00:01:50.579> we'll<00:01:51.579> have<00:01:51.759> to<00:01:51.939> release<00:01:52.240> the

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
and up and we'll have to release the

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.050 
and up and we'll have to release the
wires<00:01:52.750> but<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.350> entire<00:01:53.680> console<00:01:54.670> will<00:01:54.909> now

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
wires but the entire console will now

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.440 
wires but the entire console will now
come<00:01:55.750> out<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:55.899> place<00:01:58.590> okay<00:01:59.590> now<00:01:59.770> we've<00:01:59.979> got<00:02:00.009> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
come out of place okay now we've got the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.580 
come out of place okay now we've got the
console<00:02:01.450> out<00:02:01.659> let<00:02:01.840> me<00:02:01.869> kind<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.229> show<00:02:02.289> you<00:02:02.469> how

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
console out let me kind of show you how

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.090 
console out let me kind of show you how
it<00:02:02.920> fit<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.810> see<00:02:05.140> on<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:05.409> back<00:02:05.590> here<00:02:05.619> we've

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
it fit if you see on the back here we've

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.609 
it fit if you see on the back here we've
got<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.579> middle<00:02:07.360> pieces<00:02:07.869> with<00:02:08.080> an<00:02:08.229> insert

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
got the middle pieces with an insert

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.190 
got the middle pieces with an insert
there's<00:02:09.430> actually<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:09.880> little<00:02:10.090> tab<00:02:10.420> on<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.960> box

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
there's actually a little tab on the box

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.650 
there's actually a little tab on the box
that<00:02:11.500> slides<00:02:11.890> up<00:02:12.160> in<00:02:12.430> there<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:13.210> that<00:02:13.240> comes

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
that slides up in there so that comes

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.730 
that slides up in there so that comes
loose<00:02:13.960> when<00:02:14.260> we<00:02:14.410> pull<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.680> back

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.190 

and<00:02:18.740> this<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.850> connector<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.780> needs<00:02:21.080> to

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
and this is the connector that needs to

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.440 
and this is the connector that needs to
pull<00:02:21.230> loose<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.920> just<00:02:21.950> pull<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.400> screw<00:02:23.000> and

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
pull loose you just pull that screw and

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.840 
pull loose you just pull that screw and
it's<00:02:24.050> got<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.260> little<00:02:24.440> push<00:02:24.890> spot<00:02:25.280> here<00:02:25.700> you

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
it's got a little push spot here you

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.790 
it's got a little push spot here you
kinda<00:02:26.090> have<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.300> push<00:02:26.540> in<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.080> pull<00:02:27.140> up<00:02:27.560> and

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
kinda have to push in and pull up and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.340 
kinda have to push in and pull up and
you'll<00:02:28.550> have<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:29.000> monkey<00:02:29.630> with<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.110> little

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
you'll have to monkey with it a little

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.949 
you'll have to monkey with it a little
bit<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.820> know<00:02:31.880> pull<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.330> off<00:02:32.570> and<00:02:32.870> the

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
bit but you know pull that off and the

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.500 
bit but you know pull that off and the
entire<00:02:33.350> console<00:02:33.860> comes<00:02:34.130> out<00:02:34.430> our<00:02:35.060> next<00:02:35.360> step

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
entire console comes out our next step

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.840 
entire console comes out our next step
will<00:02:35.720> be<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.350> remove<00:02:36.470> this<00:02:36.860> piece<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.280> plastic

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
will be to remove this piece of plastic

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.260 
will be to remove this piece of plastic
and<00:02:38.060> we'll<00:02:38.690> start<00:02:38.930> going<00:02:39.110> after<00:02:39.590> this<00:02:39.740> vent<00:02:40.270> in

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
and we'll start going after this vent in

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.140 
and we'll start going after this vent in
the<00:02:41.510> center<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.760> some<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:43.970> may<00:02:44.120> have

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
the center and some of you may have

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.780 
the center and some of you may have
noticed<00:02:44.630> in<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.870> video<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:46.160> dollar<00:02:46.820> bill<00:02:48.790> thank

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
noticed in the video a dollar bill thank

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.890 
noticed in the video a dollar bill thank
you<00:02:49.910> very<00:02:50.090> much<00:02:51.790> okay<00:02:52.790> with<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.090> console<00:02:53.630> out

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
you very much okay with the console out

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.470 
you very much okay with the console out
I've<00:02:54.290> now<00:02:54.680> come<00:02:54.980> back<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.280> split<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.300> piece

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
I've now come back and split the piece

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.160 
I've now come back and split the piece
of<00:02:56.660> carpet<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.320> runs<00:02:57.560> underneath<00:02:58.130> the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
of carpet that runs underneath the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.170 
of carpet that runs underneath the
console<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:00.440> I<00:03:00.530> have<00:03:00.770> that<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.190> two<00:03:01.400> pieces<00:03:01.640> and

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
console so I have that in two pieces and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.400 
console so I have that in two pieces and
I<00:03:03.140> can<00:03:03.380> fold<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:03.739> back<00:03:03.860> fairly<00:03:04.550> easily<00:03:04.760> and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
I can fold that back fairly easily and

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.620 
I can fold that back fairly easily and
now<00:03:06.410> you'll<00:03:06.650> see<00:03:06.739> a<00:03:07.630> plastic<00:03:08.630> vent<00:03:09.260> this<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:09.770> a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
now you'll see a plastic vent this is a

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.420 
now you'll see a plastic vent this is a
distribution<00:03:11.630> vent<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.530> will<00:03:12.680> send<00:03:12.950> air<00:03:13.280> to

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
distribution vent that will send air to

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.699 
distribution vent that will send air to
the<00:03:13.520> back<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.270> it's<00:03:15.050> coming<00:03:15.410> out<00:03:15.530> of<00:03:15.650> the

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
the back and it's coming out of the

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.240 
the back and it's coming out of the
bottom<00:03:15.890> of<00:03:16.070> here<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:17.500> not<00:03:18.500> all<00:03:18.739> models<00:03:18.950> are

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
bottom of here and not all models are

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.020 
bottom of here and not all models are
going<00:03:19.520> to<00:03:19.640> have<00:03:19.820> this<00:03:20.560> if<00:03:21.560> yours<00:03:21.830> does<00:03:22.160> we<00:03:22.880> need

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
going to have this if yours does we need

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.180 
going to have this if yours does we need
to<00:03:23.150> get<00:03:23.269> this<00:03:23.420> out<00:03:23.630> of<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.810> way<00:03:24.019> so<00:03:24.860> what<00:03:25.070> I'm

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
to get this out of the way so what I'm

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.970 
to get this out of the way so what I'm
going<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.549> do<00:03:25.820> is<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.690> come<00:03:27.260> down<00:03:27.290> on<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.680> side

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
going to do is to come down on the side

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.850 
going to do is to come down on the side
here<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.700> will<00:03:29.269> make<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.450> cut<00:03:29.840> through<00:03:30.200> this<00:03:30.410> vent

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
here I will make a cut through this vent

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.030 
here I will make a cut through this vent
so<00:03:31.640> that<00:03:31.790> we<00:03:31.910> can<00:03:32.120> remove<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.840> entire<00:03:33.709> piece

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
so that we can remove the entire piece

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.810 
so that we can remove the entire piece
and<00:03:34.660> once<00:03:35.660> we<00:03:35.840> do<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.070> we'll<00:03:37.070> patch<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.610> back

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
and once we do that we'll patch it back

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.840 
and once we do that we'll patch it back
with<00:03:38.590> metal<00:03:39.590> duct<00:03:39.830> tape<00:03:40.100> it's<00:03:40.370> not<00:03:40.580> a<00:03:40.610> high

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
with metal duct tape it's not a high

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.360 
with metal duct tape it's not a high
pressure<00:03:41.209> vent<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:42.200> just<00:03:42.799> so<00:03:42.890> you<00:03:43.010> can<00:03:43.190> see

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
pressure vent and just so you can see

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.979 
pressure vent and just so you can see
where<00:03:43.519> we're<00:03:43.670> going<00:03:44.060> we<00:03:44.269> can<00:03:44.450> now<00:03:44.600> see<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
where we're going we can now see the

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.800 
where we're going we can now see the
actuator<00:03:45.680> motor<00:03:45.980> that's<00:03:46.600> what<00:03:47.600> we're

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
actuator motor that's what we're

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.600 
actuator motor that's what we're
eventually<00:03:48.079> going<00:03:48.320> to<00:03:48.620> get<00:03:48.829> to<00:03:51.070> okay<00:03:52.070> so<00:03:52.130> now

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
eventually going to get to okay so now

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.180 
eventually going to get to okay so now
we<00:03:52.670> have<00:03:52.880> cut<00:03:53.239> out<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.480> portion<00:03:54.320> of<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.890> center

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
we have cut out a portion of the center

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.699 
we have cut out a portion of the center
vent<00:03:55.489> here<00:03:56.060> which<00:03:56.329> was<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.680> distribution<00:03:57.680> to

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
vent here which was a distribution to

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.979 
vent here which was a distribution to
the<00:03:57.890> back<00:03:58.070> and<00:03:58.370> our<00:03:59.150> next<00:03:59.450> step<00:03:59.660> we're<00:03:59.870> going

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
the back and our next step we're going

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.069 
the back and our next step we're going
to<00:04:00.079> remove<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:01.250> little<00:04:01.459> bracket<00:04:01.940> here

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
to remove the little bracket here

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.479 
to remove the little bracket here
there's<00:04:03.079> a<00:04:03.170> couple<00:04:03.440> of<00:04:03.620> screws<00:04:03.920> I'll<00:04:04.160> show<00:04:04.430> you

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
there's a couple of screws I'll show you

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.330 
there's a couple of screws I'll show you
there<00:04:04.760> holding<00:04:05.360> this<00:04:06.170> plastic<00:04:06.799> piece<00:04:07.040> in

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
there holding this plastic piece in

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.390 
there holding this plastic piece in
place<00:04:07.549> you<00:04:07.970> can<00:04:08.150> see<00:04:08.329> it's<00:04:08.480> fairly<00:04:08.780> loose<00:04:09.400> but

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
place you can see it's fairly loose but

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.910 
place you can see it's fairly loose but
our<00:04:10.519> goal<00:04:10.730> is<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.060> get<00:04:11.329> this<00:04:11.660> out<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.320> then<00:04:12.709> be

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
our goal is to get this out and then be

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.740 
our goal is to get this out and then be
able<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.220> access<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:14.090> actuator<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:17.600> we're

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
able to access the actuator and we're

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.039 
able to access the actuator and we're
now<00:04:17.930> under<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.530> driver's<00:04:19.519> side<00:04:19.790> -<00:04:20.180> looking<00:04:20.870> at

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
now under the driver's side - looking at

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.550 
now under the driver's side - looking at
the<00:04:22.000> distribution<00:04:23.000> vent<00:04:23.660> that<00:04:23.930> goes

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
the distribution vent that goes

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.760 
the distribution vent that goes
under<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.160> plenum<00:04:25.490> box<00:04:25.730> and<00:04:26.150> you'll<00:04:27.110> see<00:04:27.440> this

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
under the plenum box and you'll see this

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.420 
under the plenum box and you'll see this
is<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.040> vacuum<00:04:28.669> canister<00:04:29.000> this<00:04:30.430> controls

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
see where it's attached to the plastic

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.480 
see where it's attached to the plastic
piece<00:04:44.930> we'll<00:04:45.230> pull<00:04:45.440> that<00:04:45.560> out<00:04:45.800> so<00:04:46.100> we'll<00:04:46.280> pull

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
piece we'll pull that out so we'll pull

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.720 
piece we'll pull that out so we'll pull
the<00:04:46.639> vacuum<00:04:47.150> canister<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:48.080> one<00:04:49.070> bolt<00:04:49.370> that's

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
the vacuum canister and one bolt that's

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.879 
the vacuum canister and one bolt that's
kind<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.120> hidden<00:04:50.389> by<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.720> vacuum<00:04:50.990> cannon<00:04:53.889> okay

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
kind of hidden by the vacuum cannon okay

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.440 
kind of hidden by the vacuum cannon okay
we've<00:04:55.070> got<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.370> bolt<00:04:55.580> out<00:04:55.850> of<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.000> vacuum

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
we've got the bolt out of the vacuum

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.080 
we've got the bolt out of the vacuum
canister<00:04:56.780> and<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.710> disconnected<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.669> vacuum

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
canister and I disconnected the vacuum

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.330 
canister and I disconnected the vacuum
lines<00:04:59.389> that<00:04:59.600> are<00:04:59.690> going<00:04:59.900> into<00:05:00.380> it<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:00.740> that

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
lines that are going into it and that

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.960 
lines that are going into it and that
will<00:05:01.490> make<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.910> fairly<00:05:02.660> easy<00:05:03.020> to<00:05:03.260> move<00:05:03.490> and<00:05:04.490> if

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
will make it fairly easy to move and if

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.730 
will make it fairly easy to move and if
you<00:05:05.030> pull<00:05:05.270> it<00:05:05.300> down<00:05:05.419> I'm<00:05:06.050> not<00:05:06.229> sure<00:05:06.380> you<00:05:06.530> can

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
you pull it down I'm not sure you can

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.520 
you pull it down I'm not sure you can
see<00:05:06.979> it<00:05:07.130> but<00:05:07.250> there's<00:05:07.490> a<00:05:07.660> wire<00:05:08.660> that<00:05:08.960> goes<00:05:09.020> up

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
see it but there's a wire that goes up

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.120 
see it but there's a wire that goes up
and<00:05:10.210> that<00:05:11.210> actually<00:05:11.690> hooks<00:05:11.960> on<00:05:12.169> to<00:05:12.410> a<00:05:12.440> door<00:05:12.770> and

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
and that actually hooks on to a door and

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.110 
and that actually hooks on to a door and
it's<00:05:14.000> a<00:05:14.150> a<00:05:14.889> little<00:05:15.889> tricky<00:05:16.280> to<00:05:16.550> connect<00:05:16.970> that

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
it's a a little tricky to connect that

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.210 
it's a a little tricky to connect that
back<00:05:17.180> up<00:05:17.660> so<00:05:17.900> I'm<00:05:18.020> just<00:05:18.320> going<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:18.889> kind<00:05:19.160> of

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
back up so I'm just going to kind of

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.830 
back up so I'm just going to kind of
leave<00:05:19.400> it<00:05:19.430> hanging<00:05:19.970> there<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.300> get<00:05:20.419> it<00:05:20.570> out<00:05:20.690> of

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
leave it hanging there to get it out of

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.400 
leave it hanging there to get it out of
the<00:05:20.900> way

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
the way

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.870 
the way
and<00:05:22.310> if<00:05:22.490> you<00:05:22.610> look<00:05:22.820> way<00:05:23.090> up<00:05:23.120> in<00:05:23.720> there<00:05:23.990> now<00:05:24.880> you

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
and if you look way up in there now you

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.830 
and if you look way up in there now you
can<00:05:26.120> see<00:05:27.610> towards<00:05:28.610> the<00:05:28.760> back<00:05:29.060> when<00:05:29.360> this<00:05:29.450> last

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
can see towards the back when this last

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.279 
can see towards the back when this last
screw<00:05:30.380> is<00:05:30.650> that<00:05:30.919> we're<00:05:31.010> going<00:05:31.160> to<00:05:31.280> pull<00:05:31.490> out

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.719 

there<00:05:36.289> are<00:05:36.410> no<00:05:36.530> laws<00:05:36.770> against<00:05:37.220> just<00:05:37.460> taking

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
there are no laws against just taking

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.960 
there are no laws against just taking
your<00:05:37.789> Dremel<00:05:38.060> tool<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:39.560> cutting<00:05:40.520> this<00:05:40.700> damn

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
your Dremel tool and cutting this damn

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.870 
your Dremel tool and cutting this damn
thing<00:05:41.300> off<00:05:41.740> that<00:05:42.740> screw<00:05:43.130> is<00:05:43.310> kind<00:05:43.550> of<00:05:43.610> hard<00:05:43.820> to

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
thing off that screw is kind of hard to

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.159 
thing off that screw is kind of hard to
get<00:05:44.060> to<00:05:44.120> on<00:05:44.450> this<00:05:44.600> one<00:05:44.750> we're<00:05:44.900> going<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.080> go

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
get to on this one we're going to go

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.600 
get to on this one we're going to go
ahead<00:05:45.229> and<00:05:45.380> take<00:05:45.500> the<00:05:45.620> screw<00:05:45.860> out<00:05:45.890> and<00:05:46.190> replace

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
ahead and take the screw out and replace

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.060 
ahead and take the screw out and replace
it<00:05:46.990> but<00:05:47.990> if<00:05:48.110> you<00:05:48.169> want<00:05:48.320> to<00:05:48.410> do<00:05:48.500> it<00:05:48.620> quick<00:05:48.860> and

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
it but if you want to do it quick and

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.320 
it but if you want to do it quick and
easy<00:05:49.720> that<00:05:50.720> will<00:05:50.900> stay<00:05:51.140> in<00:05:51.169> place<00:05:52.330> even

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
easy that will stay in place even

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.600 
easy that will stay in place even
without<00:05:53.450> the<00:05:53.660> screw<00:05:54.110> there<00:05:54.440> the<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:55.370> screw

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
without the screw there the the screw

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.150 
without the screw there the the screw
kind<00:05:55.850> of<00:05:55.940> helps<00:05:56.210> some<00:05:56.560> when<00:05:57.560> you<00:05:57.680> remove<00:05:57.979> the

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
kind of helps some when you remove the

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.800 
kind of helps some when you remove the
entire<00:05:58.490> -<00:05:58.760> and<00:05:59.090> you<00:05:59.150> don't<00:05:59.330> want<00:05:59.479> it<00:05:59.539> to<00:05:59.630> fall

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
entire - and you don't want it to fall

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.960 
entire - and you don't want it to fall
down<00:06:00.110> but<00:06:00.590> since<00:06:01.340> we're<00:06:01.520> not<00:06:01.610> going<00:06:01.789> to<00:06:01.850> do

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
down but since we're not going to do

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.000 
down but since we're not going to do
that<00:06:02.180> you<00:06:02.479> could<00:06:02.750> do<00:06:02.960> without<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.440> screw<00:06:03.830> and

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
that you could do without that screw and

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.990 
that you could do without that screw and
just<00:06:04.070> cut<00:06:04.430> it<00:06:04.460> your<00:06:05.210> choices

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
just cut it your choices

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.879 
just cut it your choices
okay<00:06:08.000> I'm<00:06:08.180> back<00:06:08.419> sorry<00:06:08.780> it<00:06:08.930> took<00:06:09.139> so<00:06:09.200> long<00:06:09.410> but

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
okay I'm back sorry it took so long but

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.040 
okay I'm back sorry it took so long but
that<00:06:10.070> back<00:06:10.340> bolt<00:06:10.669> is<00:06:10.940> really<00:06:11.360> difficult<00:06:11.930> to

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
that back bolt is really difficult to

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.070 
that back bolt is really difficult to
get<00:06:12.200> to<00:06:12.260> I<00:06:12.650> kind<00:06:13.010> of<00:06:13.039> wrestled<00:06:13.520> with<00:06:13.669> that

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
get to I kind of wrestled with that

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.750 
get to I kind of wrestled with that
anyway<00:06:15.080> that<00:06:15.289> is<00:06:15.470> out<00:06:15.680> now<00:06:15.919> and<00:06:16.220> there<00:06:16.580> is

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
anyway that is out now and there is

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.980 
anyway that is out now and there is
another<00:06:17.660> bolt<00:06:17.960> on<00:06:18.229> this<00:06:18.500> side<00:06:19.570> you<00:06:20.570> can<00:06:20.600> see

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
another bolt on this side you can see

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.680 
another bolt on this side you can see
where<00:06:21.200> that<00:06:21.350> fits<00:06:21.970> and<00:06:22.970> we've<00:06:23.240> got<00:06:23.419> it<00:06:23.570> all

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
where that fits and we've got it all

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.270 
where that fits and we've got it all
loose<00:06:24.020> now<00:06:25.210> we'll<00:06:26.210> just<00:06:26.450> kind<00:06:26.720> of<00:06:26.810> rain

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
loose now we'll just kind of rain

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:36.300 
loose now we'll just kind of rain
spang<00:06:27.910> up<00:06:28.300> and<00:06:28.630> out<00:06:28.780> of<00:06:28.930> here<00:06:34.650> and<00:06:35.650> just<00:06:36.100> to

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.550 
spang up and out of here and just to
show<00:06:36.669> you<00:06:36.730> what<00:06:37.360> you've<00:06:37.660> been<00:06:37.840> working<00:06:38.230> at<00:06:38.380> if

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
show you what you've been working at if

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.020 
show you what you've been working at if
you<00:06:38.680> went<00:06:38.830> to<00:06:38.919> all<00:06:39.040> the<00:06:39.130> work<00:06:39.280> of<00:06:39.460> removing<00:06:39.610> the

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
you went to all the work of removing the

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.870 
you went to all the work of removing the
bolt<00:06:40.270> that<00:06:41.050> bolt<00:06:41.380> is<00:06:41.680> on<00:06:41.980> this<00:06:42.550> little

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
bolt that bolt is on this little

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.970 
bolt that bolt is on this little
pedestal<00:06:43.270> that's<00:06:43.720> sticking<00:06:44.050> up<00:06:44.380> on<00:06:44.620> the<00:06:44.740> back

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 
pedestal that's sticking up on the back

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.210 
pedestal that's sticking up on the back
and<00:06:45.400> it's<00:06:46.090> very<00:06:46.330> difficult<00:06:46.810> to<00:06:46.930> get<00:06:47.080> to<00:06:47.139> if<00:06:47.980> you

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
and it's very difficult to get to if you

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.470 
and it's very difficult to get to if you
wanted<00:06:48.520> to<00:06:48.730> you<00:06:48.910> could<00:06:49.030> just<00:06:49.270> take<00:06:49.450> your

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.480 
wanted to you could just take your

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.750 
wanted to you could just take your
dremel<00:06:50.050> and<00:06:50.230> just<00:06:50.500> cut<00:06:50.830> this<00:06:51.070> off

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
dremel and just cut this off

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.480 
dremel and just cut this off
that's<00:06:52.450> wedged<00:06:52.810> in<00:06:53.169> there<00:06:53.410> well<00:06:53.770> enough<00:06:54.100> that

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
that's wedged in there well enough that

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.080 
that's wedged in there well enough that
you<00:06:54.669> don't<00:06:54.880> really<00:06:55.530> need<00:06:56.530> this<00:06:56.770> bolt<00:06:57.100> and<00:06:57.940> it

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
you don't really need this bolt and it

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.659 
you don't really need this bolt and it
certainly<00:06:58.360> makes<00:06:58.630> it<00:06:58.720> a<00:06:58.810> lot<00:06:58.930> easier<00:06:59.320> so<00:06:59.669> now

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
certainly makes it a lot easier so now

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:03.960 
certainly makes it a lot easier so now
we're<00:07:01.860> at<00:07:02.860> the<00:07:03.070> point<00:07:03.280> where<00:07:03.490> we<00:07:03.580> can<00:07:03.790> actually

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
we're at the point where we can actually

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.560 
we're at the point where we can actually
see<00:07:04.510> the<00:07:04.660> actuator<00:07:05.169> motor<00:07:05.910> you<00:07:06.910> can<00:07:07.120> see<00:07:07.330> that

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
see the actuator motor you can see that

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.340 
see the actuator motor you can see that
I've<00:07:09.540> disconnected<00:07:10.540> the<00:07:10.630> wire<00:07:10.810> and<00:07:11.110> pulled

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.350 
I've disconnected the wire and pulled

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.170 
I've disconnected the wire and pulled
that<00:07:11.500> out<00:07:11.680> of<00:07:11.800> the<00:07:11.890> harness<00:07:12.280> and<00:07:12.490> back<00:07:12.730> up<00:07:12.970> out

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
that out of the harness and back up out

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.900 
that out of the harness and back up out
of<00:07:13.330> the<00:07:13.390> way<00:07:13.890> everything<00:07:14.890> is<00:07:15.010> nice<00:07:15.310> and<00:07:15.340> free

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:15.910 
of the way everything is nice and free

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.480 
of the way everything is nice and free
and<00:07:16.090> clear<00:07:16.360> and<00:07:16.510> open<00:07:16.630> and<00:07:17.110> we'll<00:07:17.950> begin<00:07:18.100> doing

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
and clear and open and we'll begin doing

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.300 
and clear and open and we'll begin doing
the<00:07:18.640> actual<00:07:19.000> heater<00:07:19.419> treater<00:07:19.750> work

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.310 
the actual heater treater work

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.469 
the actual heater treater work
everything<00:07:21.310> we've<00:07:21.580> done<00:07:21.729> up<00:07:21.790> to<00:07:21.970> this<00:07:22.210> point

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 
everything we've done up to this point

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:24.090 
everything we've done up to this point
has<00:07:22.690> just<00:07:22.900> been<00:07:23.080> getting<00:07:23.200> access<00:07:23.800> to<00:07:23.860> the

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100 
has just been getting access to the

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.580 
has just been getting access to the
motor<00:07:24.280> I<00:07:24.640> know<00:07:25.270> it's<00:07:25.570> been<00:07:25.750> difficult<00:07:25.780> but

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
motor I know it's been difficult but

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:36.050 
motor I know it's been difficult but
laying<00:07:26.950> forward<00:07:27.490> not<00:07:27.729> me

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.060 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.120
