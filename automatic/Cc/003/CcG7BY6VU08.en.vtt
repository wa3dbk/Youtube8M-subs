00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.450 

before<00:00:10.340> I<00:00:10.370> start<00:00:10.760> any<00:00:11.120> new<00:00:11.530> smoke<00:00:12.530> piece<00:00:13.040> I

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
before I start any new smoke piece I

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.460 
before I start any new smoke piece I
essentially<00:00:14.120> have<00:00:14.330> to<00:00:14.450> teach<00:00:14.720> myself<00:00:15.050> how<00:00:15.380> to

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
essentially have to teach myself how to

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.580 
essentially have to teach myself how to
redo<00:00:15.920> it<00:00:15.950> all<00:00:16.280> all<00:00:16.640> over<00:00:17.150> again<00:00:17.300> it's<00:00:18.110> amazing

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
redo it all all over again it's amazing

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.540 
redo it all all over again it's amazing
and<00:00:18.710> so<00:00:19.520> I'll<00:00:19.820> press<00:00:20.810> different<00:00:21.220> strokes<00:00:22.220> that

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
and so I'll press different strokes that

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.179 
and so I'll press different strokes that
I<00:00:22.580> think<00:00:22.910> I'm<00:00:23.029> going<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.420> need<00:00:24.290> in<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:24.920> piece

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
I think I'm going to need in the piece

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.179 
I think I'm going to need in the piece
but<00:00:25.490> just<00:00:25.730> also<00:00:25.939> get<00:00:26.720> get<00:00:27.230> warmed<00:00:27.560> up<00:00:27.740> because

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
but just also get get warmed up because

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.490 
but just also get get warmed up because
once<00:00:28.490> I'm<00:00:29.000> working<00:00:29.570> on<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:29.810> real<00:00:29.990> canvas

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
once I'm working on the real canvas

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.499 
once I'm working on the real canvas
there's<00:00:30.770> no<00:00:30.980> going<00:00:31.880> back<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.300> there's<00:00:32.450> no

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
there's no going back and there's no

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.610 
there's no going back and there's no
erasing<00:00:33.290> make<00:00:33.860> all<00:00:34.040> these<00:00:34.220> weird<00:00:34.550> little

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
erasing make all these weird little

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.850 
erasing make all these weird little
tools<00:00:37.570> depending<00:00:38.570> on<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:42.140> direction<00:00:42.350> where

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
tools depending on the direction where

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.190 
tools depending on the direction where
I'm<00:00:43.130> standing<00:00:44.470> and<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.750> angle<00:00:48.050> of<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.290> canvas

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
I'm standing and the angle of the canvas

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.290 
I'm standing and the angle of the canvas
you<00:00:51.200> can<00:00:51.350> make<00:00:51.500> different<00:00:51.650> marks<00:00:52.120> one<00:00:53.120> of<00:00:53.240> the

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
you can make different marks one of the

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.580 
you can make different marks one of the
things<00:00:53.480> I'm<00:00:53.690> going<00:00:53.810> to<00:00:53.870> try<00:00:54.020> practice<00:00:54.380> is<00:00:54.470> how

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
things I'm going to try practice is how

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.030 
things I'm going to try practice is how
to<00:00:54.650> make<00:00:54.830> this<00:00:55.040> texture<00:00:56.740> on<00:00:57.740> the<00:00:58.130> Rhino<00:00:58.370> and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
to make this texture on the Rhino and

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.100 
to make this texture on the Rhino and
we're<00:01:01.040> part<00:01:01.310> of<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.520> Rhino<00:01:01.730> I<00:01:02.090> will<00:01:02.270> create<00:01:02.630> a

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
we're part of the Rhino I will create a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.609 
we're part of the Rhino I will create a
stencil<00:01:03.980> for<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.640> very<00:01:04.850> dark<00:01:05.210> darks<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.930> I<00:01:06.560> do

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
stencil for the very dark darks and I do

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.690 
stencil for the very dark darks and I do
that<00:01:07.009> on<00:01:07.159> AutoCAD<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.210> then<00:01:09.009> laser<00:01:10.009> route<00:01:10.430> it

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
that on AutoCAD and then laser route it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.700 
that on AutoCAD and then laser route it
out<00:01:10.850> of<00:01:12.490> paper<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.909> then<00:01:14.840> place<00:01:15.050> that<00:01:15.080> with

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
out of paper and then place that with

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.890 
out of paper and then place that with
magnets<00:01:16.190> on<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.790> top<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.480> bottom<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
magnets on the top and the bottom of the

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:26.050 
magnets on the top and the bottom of the
canvas<00:01:23.710> for<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.800> first<00:01:25.100> thing<00:01:25.400> that<00:01:25.430> I'll<00:01:25.790> do

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
canvas for the first thing that I'll do

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.380 
canvas for the first thing that I'll do
is<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:29.390> make<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.810> light<00:01:30.170> tonal<00:01:31.100> ground<00:01:31.940> of

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
is to to make a light tonal ground of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.840 
is to to make a light tonal ground of
grey<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:33.200> will<00:01:34.040> use<00:01:34.420> an<00:01:35.420> oil<00:01:35.750> lamp<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:37.190> hardest

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
grey I will use an oil lamp the hardest

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.789 
grey I will use an oil lamp the hardest
thing<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.299> most<00:01:38.450> important<00:01:39.110> thing<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:39.620> do

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
thing and the most important thing to do

thing and the most important thing to do
is<00:01:39.979> to<00:01:40.100> protect<00:01:40.520> your<00:01:40.790> whites<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.420> that<00:01:41.570> way

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
is to protect your whites and that way

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.060 
is to protect your whites and that way
it's<00:01:42.020> like<00:01:42.229> watercolor<00:01:43.010> so<00:01:43.940> all<00:01:44.240> of<00:01:44.810> these
