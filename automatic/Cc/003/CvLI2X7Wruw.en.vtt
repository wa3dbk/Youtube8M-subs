 there were not the nine that the people 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.980

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.620
 He believes that trauma does not bring me pain 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.010
 It gave to us it gained of misery that the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.989
 people and the alleged as it is difficult because 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.240

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 but when the game is lost below 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.939
 we played 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.939
 8 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.150
 watch standing 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.150
 space is not 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.650
 the dance of the cases with rooms already have 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.650
 I want 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.080

 playing this song is the fifth 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.259
 reconquest in that format 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.060
 The third who sent two is being 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.980

 stifling the fourth 3 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.070
 let's also use the biggest sun 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.270
 and a minor with seventh in that format 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.050

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.710
 use in the introduction and the first 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.470
