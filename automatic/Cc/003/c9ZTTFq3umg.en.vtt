00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the major pentatonic scale with a bit of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.580 
the major pentatonic scale with a bit of
groove<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:36.180> starting<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> offbeat

going to take the three draw slowly bend

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.300 
going to take the three draw slowly bend
it<00:02:47.610> down<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.299> whole<00:02:48.540> step<00:02:48.890> slower<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.070> and

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
it down to this whole step slower it and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.760 
it down to this whole step slower it and
then<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.820> draw<00:02:54.380> so

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:06.320 

oh<00:03:03.290> okay<00:03:04.340> get<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.490> bit<00:03:05.700> down<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:05.910> then<00:03:06.240> it

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
oh okay get that bit down and then it

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.460 
oh okay get that bit down and then it
just<00:03:06.360> ends<00:03:06.720> with<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.050> little<00:03:07.320> bit<00:03:07.440> of

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
just ends with a little bit of

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.070 
just ends with a little bit of
punctuation<00:03:08.040> which<00:03:08.490> is<00:03:11.540> so<00:03:12.540> that's<00:03:12.720> just

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
punctuation which is so that's just

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.800
