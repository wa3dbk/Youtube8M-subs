00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:30.759
 open this ideal to open because 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.759
 I understand everything for de vido 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.690
 but it is not national necessary that each 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.750
 year there is a bomb for a media theme 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.820
 for an image subject because that lasts a 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.550
 It lasts the day the presentation and for 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.860
 what we want are great players 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.140
 that day by day they work that they understand what 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.989
 which is the club that understand what is 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.640
 the history of this club what 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:00.910
 represents and more 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.280
 it's a possibility but I do not know, I think 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.510
 that in these days that is to say it can be that 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.670
 today or tomorrow 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.670
 advertise in paris saint germain 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.110
 let's say the agreement by which it allows 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.990
 Ancelotti can then sign but to day 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.450
 today he has not signed us yet 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.280
 the world knows that if possible my 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.280
 ancelotti trainers just jump on 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.760
 world 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:36.310
 well every coach has let's say your 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:38.610
 his way of being and are stages 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.610
 different 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.689
 well I think it has many 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.789
 possibilities also to be a player of 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.090
 real because he wants to be in real 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.060
 madrid I also know that he does a lot 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.270
 Illusion come to Madrid the same dog 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.610
 and if everything develops as it seems 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.610
 soon we will make the signing 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.380
 and the players are never neither expensive nor 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.690
 cheap but let's say it depends on the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.300
 performance that I give I always say that 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.540
 fixed citizens ronaldo and beckham about 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.120
 alright huge revenue jumps were 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.129
 players who 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.110
 and some until new did not understand 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.420
 and we went from entering 100 million to 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.370
 enter 300 million euros I can 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.049
 say that we were entering 400 million 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.730
 when the year 2009 arrives in the 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.390
 season is ending we are going to 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.680
 enter more than 520 and also sure that 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.610
 had to see the signing of 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.760
 kaká de benzema Christian 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:44.140
 in the first year safe or acil the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.450
 second what the technicians say 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.970
 we need to improve is in the middle line 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.310
 is what they say let's say the common of the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.690
 technical, well, that's a subject that 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.950
 when the next coach comes 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.950
 we will see how to improve 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.420
 it is all life 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.280
 the players always from the quarry will 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.260
 they went to form when they were very young 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.569
 to other loaned teams and then they came 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.590
 Madrid is very difficult for Madrid 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:16.019
 that triumphs a kid with 17 or 18 years 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.690
 not except for rare exceptions I do not know how 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.629
 intaur raul utrero the others are 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.299
 have gone elsewhere and here the people are 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.680
 very impatient that is 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.209
 he prefers trained players but also 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.579
 you prefer players from the quarry for 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.010
 I think that this year we are going to 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.249
 incorporate returning several players from the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.249
 quarry 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.090
 well we did not get anywhere 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.780
 agreement of that type and it would also be 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.150
 absurd 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.190
 mourinho has shown what it is and how 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.770
 it's until the end because it's not going to change 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.110
 of personality because by one with it 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.510
 until the end I think he has done 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.920
 what he believed he should do and another 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.959
 thing is that some criticize him the 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.760
 forms because the fund does not criticize it 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.200
 or almost nobody criticize the forms 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.200
 well everyone has their way 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.540
 mourinho let's say he has not cheated anyone 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.670
 he is how is he is very demanding and 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:14.329
 justified in their demands 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:17.269
 I can not but say that the club 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.609
 I had confidence in the coach what 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.139
 does it does it with all the players 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.880
 he gave a touch of attention as he 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.310
 I said it Christian as I gave it to everything 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.080
 the world then came the fatality of the 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.639
 injury that has nothing to do with 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.419
 the touch of attention and already then to 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.729
 from there 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.889
 another issue we had to bring increased a 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.590
 goalkeeper who was not out as it was diego 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.210
 lopez and then good then when it came out 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.680
 well diego lopez had not done it wrong 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.560
 I had done very well because it is a 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.070
 magnificent goalkeeper also and that's it over 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.919
 the story 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.590
 I know it was this film that is 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.500
 It was used by those who wanted 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.910
 attack mou used to boxes and I 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.410
 I think that boxes are very good in not 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.570
 be used by boxes not 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.850
 needs to be useful because if it is 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.870
 the best goalkeeper in the world is because he is 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.669
 he has won was over the years 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.800
 the image of madrid gets dirty when 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.259
 has been fed for six years in a row 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.910
 eighths and not being unseeded I 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.090
 I think that does deteriorate the image of 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.220
 bad and I say it 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.310
 the image of madrid does not deteriorate 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.290
 because you reach 33 semifinals and the 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.080
 lose especially if we do not win the 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.180
 champions we have taken the place that we 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.889
 corresponds that is to be among the 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.720
 first four as we have always 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.639
 been because I was in my stage that 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.860
 in nine and a half years there are six 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.080
 final and one and one we won the cup 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.580
 europe is where we have to be what 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.110
 that can not be is that six years 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.030
 followed this limit eliminate in eighths 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.889
 madrid that's what I can not accept 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.210
 the house marks a second kiss the 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.740
 mark that rage 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.900
 Well mario is sorry with all 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.080
 modesty in football the brand of 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.080
 renown 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.210
 that I have no doubts I have no doubts 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.810
 come on I think that when you throw in realmadrid and 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.810
 I say it again 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.290
 I think he wants to be a coach 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.810
 man I think nobody starts being 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.850
 first team coach in some 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.890
 side starts before it was like that of the night to 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:11.880
 the morning I take the title to madrid 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:14.630
 it's not normal and the only thing I'm going to 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.210
 to say is that I will be here while 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:21.860
 continue to have hope and desire 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.860
 work for Madrid and the partners are left 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.910
 ministry not all the partners of the royal 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.970
 madrid that have hope and that and that 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:34.440
 as I said do these principles 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.440
 because they will seem perfect 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.650
 I have no idea because I do not know what 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:42.020
 happens but what I'm convinced is that 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.330
 Messi does not know anything about what was 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.190
 happening that safe and good because I guess 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.199
 that if there is a problem they will fix it 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.880
 and although now it is clear that everything 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.310
 happens around is great players 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.550
 come a great transcendence and 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.310
 at the moment we do not know in another person 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.560
 when I was in the schalke I agreed 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.480
 that those dates were because they 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.070
 they had to play the previous one and then 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.070
 Well we've never gotten 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:09.620
 could come and now that he's there in 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.060
 qatar then we have managed not to come 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.730
 here we are going to give a tribute if 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:17.210
 what do you want is from the spectacular public 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:20.090
 but come on he does not need more than the one 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.620
 nor the affection of the people who have it and 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.600
 he knows that his house is and that one day 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.340
 when he wants 

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.550
 when he decides that he should already 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.550
 stop being a player because it is his plácet 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.740
 no no
