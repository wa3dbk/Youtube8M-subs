00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.069 
as far as all the writings concerned but
the<00:03:53.700> depth<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.359> I<00:03:54.389> think<00:03:54.720> people<00:03:54.840> don't

deep some of it is you know because it's

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.170 
deep some of it is you know because it's
probably<00:04:01.650> delivered<00:04:02.040> at<00:04:02.130> such<00:04:02.370> high<00:04:02.400> velocity

I<00:04:17.010> think<00:04:17.430> Lemmy<00:04:17.669> as<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.849> lyricist<00:04:18.090> is

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
I think Lemmy as a lyricist is

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.690 
I think Lemmy as a lyricist is
completely<00:04:19.019> underrated<00:04:19.320> as<00:04:19.709> well<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:20.039> mean<00:04:20.160> how

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
completely underrated as well I mean how

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.130 
completely underrated as well I mean how
many<00:04:20.789> other<00:04:21.030> guys<00:04:21.269> in<00:04:21.510> rock-and-roll<00:04:21.900> bands

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
many other guys in rock-and-roll bands

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.230 
many other guys in rock-and-roll bands
can<00:04:22.409> you<00:04:22.620> name<00:04:23.070> but<00:04:23.460> have<00:04:23.550> managed<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:23.969> fit<00:04:24.150> the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
can you name but have managed to fit the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.610 
can you name but have managed to fit the
word<00:04:24.360> parallelogram<00:04:25.140> into

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
word parallelogram into

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.010 
word parallelogram into
so<00:04:25.770> not<00:04:26.550> very<00:04:26.580> many<00:04:27.090> I<00:04:27.210> say<00:04:27.419> he's<00:04:27.600> in<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.810> field

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
so not very many I say he's in a field

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.920 
so not very many I say he's in a field
of<00:04:28.169> one<00:04:28.350> in<00:04:28.560> terms<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.979> that<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.280> then<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:30.270> think

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
of one in terms of that and then I think

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.890 
of one in terms of that and then I think
lyrically<00:04:31.470> Isis<00:04:31.800> pays<00:04:32.010> as<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.610> record<00:04:33.090> it's<00:04:33.300> you

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
lyrically Isis pays as a record it's you

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.390 
lyrically Isis pays as a record it's you
know<00:04:34.020> it's<00:04:34.229> got<00:04:34.260> some<00:04:34.410> fantastic<00:04:34.680> wordplay

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
know it's got some fantastic wordplay

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.670 
know it's got some fantastic wordplay
it's<00:04:36.060> got<00:04:36.180> some<00:04:36.300> straight-up<00:04:36.720> indirect<00:04:37.410> stuff

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
it's got some straight-up indirect stuff

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.390 
it's got some straight-up indirect stuff
on<00:04:37.919> there<00:04:38.550> as<00:04:38.910> well<00:04:39.110> but<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.199> is<00:04:40.350> a<00:04:40.620> hugely

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
on there as well but it is a hugely

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.969 
on there as well but it is a hugely
romantic<00:04:41.940> record<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.380> think<00:04:43.410> his<00:04:43.680> lyrics

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
romantic record and I think his lyrics

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.189 
romantic record and I think his lyrics
are<00:04:44.100> very<00:04:44.160> romantic<00:04:44.850> on<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.180> they<00:04:45.630> are<00:04:46.020> they

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
are very romantic on that they are they

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.080 
are very romantic on that they are they
do<00:04:46.350> celebrate<00:04:46.800> life<00:04:47.010> on<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.250> road<00:04:47.430> but<00:04:48.000> they

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
do celebrate life on the road but they

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.780 
do celebrate life on the road but they
also<00:04:48.240> celebrate<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:48.870> notion<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.790> swaggering

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
also celebrate the notion of swaggering

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.969 
also celebrate the notion of swaggering
rock-and-roll<00:04:51.300> if<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.630> will<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.740> Rock

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
and I think that's what that record

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.600 
and I think that's what that record

with<00:05:51.930> words<00:05:52.320> I<00:05:52.770> think<00:05:53.220> one<00:05:53.370> of<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.550> problems

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
with words I think one of the problems

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.879 
with words I think one of the problems
with<00:05:54.180> Motorhead<00:05:54.780> and<00:05:54.810> I<00:05:55.050> was<00:05:55.470> always<00:05:55.590> a<00:05:55.710> bit

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
with Motorhead and I was always a bit

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.890 
with Motorhead and I was always a bit
disappointed<00:05:56.550> that<00:05:56.580> people<00:05:56.910> didn't<00:05:57.630> read

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
disappointed that people didn't read

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.439 
disappointed that people didn't read
Lemmy<00:05:58.320> his<00:05:58.500> lyrics<00:05:59.010> which<00:05:59.610> are<00:05:59.789> very<00:06:00.090> very

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
Lemmy his lyrics which are very very

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.379 
Lemmy his lyrics which are very very
pungent<00:06:00.990> very<00:06:01.789> meaningful<00:06:02.789> they're<00:06:02.970> not<00:06:03.150> just

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
pungent very meaningful they're not just

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.589 
pungent very meaningful they're not just
ordinary<00:06:03.570> lyrics<00:06:04.760> and<00:06:05.760> I<00:06:05.910> think<00:06:06.120> people<00:06:06.330> took

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
ordinary lyrics and I think people took

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.659 
ordinary lyrics and I think people took
more<00:06:06.870> notice<00:06:07.289> that<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:07.860> trouble<00:06:08.220> was<00:06:08.370> it<00:06:08.550> was

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
more notice that the trouble was it was

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.330 
more notice that the trouble was it was
very<00:06:08.699> easy<00:06:09.210> to<00:06:09.539> dismiss<00:06:10.440> what<00:06:10.770> motor<00:06:11.039> had

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
very easy to dismiss what motor had

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.300 
very easy to dismiss what motor had
played<00:06:12.110> and<00:06:13.110> we<00:06:13.320> had<00:06:13.470> terrible<00:06:13.889> trouble<00:06:14.099> with

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
played and we had terrible trouble with

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.430 
played and we had terrible trouble with
our<00:06:14.520> licensees<00:06:15.120> I<00:06:15.150> mean<00:06:15.449> nobody<00:06:15.870> wants<00:06:16.020> to<00:06:16.199> put

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
our licensees I mean nobody wants to put

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.550

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
mode to head out and we had to really

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.770 
mode to head out and we had to really
talk<00:06:19.949> everybody<00:06:20.550> into<00:06:20.940> it<00:06:21.000> once<00:06:21.240> they<00:06:21.419> started
