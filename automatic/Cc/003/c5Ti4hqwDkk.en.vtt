00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
and all my roots especially and that's

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.300 
and all my roots especially and that's
where<00:03:01.079> you<00:03:01.109> want<00:03:01.409> to<00:03:01.500> clean<00:03:01.859> your<00:03:01.980> hair<00:03:02.159> the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
most is on the roots so that way you can

most is on the roots so that way you can
go<00:03:04.260> longer<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:04.739> between<00:03:05.040> washes<00:03:05.250> if<00:03:05.609> your

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
go longer in between washes if your

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.569 
go longer in between washes if your
