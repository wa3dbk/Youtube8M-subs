00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.770 
weight can be deceiving a lot of this
phenomena<00:02:57.859> can<00:02:58.040> be<00:02:58.099> explained<00:02:58.640> by<00:02:58.939> the<00:02:59.359> shape

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
phenomena can be explained by the shape

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.360 
phenomena can be explained by the shape
and<00:02:59.989> size<00:03:00.349> of<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.590> different<00:03:00.920> ingredients

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
and size of the different ingredients

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.500 
and size of the different ingredients
and<00:03:01.489> how<00:03:01.640> they<00:03:01.819> interact<00:03:02.150> with<00:03:02.239> each<00:03:02.359> other

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
and how they interact with each other

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.229 
and how they interact with each other
you<00:03:03.170> were<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.349> get<00:03:03.439> very<00:03:03.980> close<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.579> salt<00:03:04.849> you'd

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
you were to get very close to salt you'd

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.599 
you were to get very close to salt you'd
see<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.629> they<00:03:05.750> were<00:03:05.810> tiny<00:03:06.409> squares<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.219> they

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
see that they were tiny squares and they

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.390 
see that they were tiny squares and they
would<00:03:07.760> pack<00:03:08.019> very<00:03:09.019> thin<00:03:09.349> like<00:03:10.040> these<00:03:10.219> sheets

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
would pack very thin like these sheets

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.309 
would pack very thin like these sheets
of<00:03:10.549> paper<00:03:10.670> however<00:03:11.569> if<00:03:11.629> you<00:03:11.719> got<00:03:11.900> really<00:03:12.170> close

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
of paper however if you got really close

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.569 
of paper however if you got really close
to<00:03:12.560> flower<00:03:13.810> you'd<00:03:14.810> find<00:03:15.159> that<00:03:16.159> the<00:03:16.250> sheets<00:03:16.459> of

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
to flower you'd find that the sheets of

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.179 
to flower you'd find that the sheets of
paper<00:03:16.870> packs<00:03:17.870> more<00:03:18.079> like<00:03:18.290> this<00:03:18.500> with<00:03:18.859> all<00:03:18.889> the

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:19.189 
paper packs more like this with all the

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.670 
paper packs more like this with all the
space<00:03:19.459> in<00:03:19.730> between<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:21.170> can<00:03:21.290> see<00:03:21.469> these<00:03:21.620> are

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
space in between you can see these are

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.580 
space in between you can see these are
both<00:03:21.859> 10<00:03:22.400> sheets<00:03:22.700> of<00:03:22.849> paper<00:03:23.169> but<00:03:24.169> this<00:03:24.349> one

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
both 10 sheets of paper but this one

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.649 
both 10 sheets of paper but this one
takes<00:03:24.859> up<00:03:25.069> way<00:03:25.280> more<00:03:25.310> volume<00:03:25.879> than<00:03:26.090> this<00:03:26.419> one

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
takes up way more volume than this one

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.240 
takes up way more volume than this one
despite<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:27.500> fact<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.799> they<00:03:27.980> would<00:03:28.099> weigh

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
despite the fact that they would weigh

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.699 
despite the fact that they would weigh
the<00:03:28.400> same<00:03:28.549> on<00:03:28.609> the<00:03:28.819> scale<00:03:29.060> as<00:03:29.379> you<00:03:30.379> can<00:03:30.470> see

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
the same on the scale as you can see

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.470 
the same on the scale as you can see
weight<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.459> volume<00:03:31.579> are<00:03:31.909> very<00:03:32.180> different

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
weight and volume are very different

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.780 
weight and volume are very different
however<00:03:33.260> they<00:03:33.379> are<00:03:33.409> interrelated<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.400> play<00:03:34.760> a

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
however they are interrelated and play a

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.899 
however they are interrelated and play a
huge<00:03:35.150> part<00:03:35.480> in<00:03:35.689> how<00:03:36.079> we<00:03:36.139> design<00:03:36.680> blend<00:03:37.669> and
