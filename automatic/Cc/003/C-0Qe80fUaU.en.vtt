stretch<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.709> find<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.160> most<00:03:13.820> athletes<00:03:14.450> have

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
stretch I find that most athletes have

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.539 
stretch I find that most athletes have
very<00:03:15.019> tight<00:03:15.320> ankles<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:15.920> that's<00:03:16.070> really<00:03:16.370> the

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
very tight ankles and that's really the

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.550 
very tight ankles and that's really the
big<00:03:16.760> restriction<00:03:17.480> with<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:17.989> lot<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.290> their

big restriction with a lot of their

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.009 
big restriction with a lot of their
inability<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:19.190> squat<00:03:19.700> that's<00:03:20.390> where<00:03:20.690> most<00:03:20.870> of

inability to squat that's where most of

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.720 
inability to squat that's where most of
the<00:03:21.110> problems<00:03:21.500> start<00:03:21.860> so<00:03:22.340> what<00:03:22.489> you're<00:03:22.610> going

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
the problems start so what you're going

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.860 
the problems start so what you're going
to<00:03:22.760> do<00:03:22.940> is<00:03:23.120> you're<00:03:23.239> gonna<00:03:23.299> stand<00:03:23.510> in<00:03:23.660> front<00:03:23.720> of
