tutorial<00:00:06.000> we're<00:00:06.420> going<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.660> look<00:00:06.839> at<00:00:07.020> how<00:00:07.290> to

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
tutorial we're going to look at how to

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.720 
tutorial we're going to look at how to
create<00:00:07.560> really<00:00:08.370> good<00:00:08.780> wireframes<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.020> cycles

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
create really good wireframes and cycles

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.850 
create really good wireframes and cycles
this<00:00:11.730> tutorial<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:12.720> intermediate<00:00:13.620> noobs

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
this tutorial is for intermediate noobs

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.500 
this tutorial is for intermediate noobs
not<00:00:14.190> really<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:14.580> beginning<00:00:14.880> noobs<00:00:15.180> and<00:00:15.360> not

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510 
not really for beginning noobs and not

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.270 
not really for beginning noobs and not
really<00:00:15.750> for<00:00:15.930> advanced<00:00:16.320> noobs<00:00:16.530> because<00:00:17.190> they

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
really for advanced noobs because they

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.440 
really for advanced noobs because they
probably<00:00:17.430> already<00:00:17.640> know<00:00:17.850> how<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.940> do<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.270> but

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
probably already know how to do it but

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.540 
probably already know how to do it but
at<00:00:18.540> least<00:00:18.750> an<00:00:18.930> intermediate<00:00:19.680> user<00:00:20.310> and

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
at least an intermediate user and

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.260 
at least an intermediate user and
blender<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.780> let's<00:00:22.080> get<00:00:22.200> started

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
blender so let's get started

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.850 
blender so let's get started
what<00:00:24.270> you<00:00:24.390> need<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.780> first<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.440> need<00:00:25.470> to

what you need to do first is you need to

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.680 
what you need to do first is you need to
download<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.610> Python<00:00:27.000> script<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.510> will

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
download the Python script that will

download the Python script that will
allow<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.110> create<00:00:28.470> these<00:00:29.750> wireframes<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
allow you to create these wireframes and

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.770 
allow you to create these wireframes and
cycles<00:00:31.440> and<00:00:32.310> I'll<00:00:32.489> put<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> link<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.329> that

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
cycles and I'll put the link to that

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.390 
cycles and I'll put the link to that

find it the next thing you need to do is
bring<00:00:39.060> up<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.540> model<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.230> want<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
bring up the model that you want a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.880 
bring up the model that you want a
wireframe<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.780> make<00:00:42.780> sure<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.560> save

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
wireframe of and make sure that you save

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.490 
wireframe of and make sure that you save
it<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.730> different<00:00:45.420> name<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.320> don't

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.450 
mind thrashing because you don't want to
trash<00:00:48.360> your<00:00:48.540> original<00:00:48.960> model<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.320> course<00:00:49.559> this

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
trash your original model of course this

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.150 
trash your original model of course this
particular<00:00:50.670> model<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.620> had<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:52.980> idea

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
particular model is a I had this idea

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.700 
particular model is a I had this idea
with<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.550> big<00:00:53.880> gun<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> wanted<00:00:55.649> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
with this big gun that I wanted to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.040 
with this big gun that I wanted to
create<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.880> I'm<00:00:57.120> trying<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> create<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
create that I'm trying to create a

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.810 
create that I'm trying to create a
cyborg<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.890> want<00:00:59.070> him<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.399> holding<00:00:59.730> this

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
cyborg and I want him to be holding this

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.180 
cyborg and I want him to be holding this
gun<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> that's<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.129> case

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
gun so that's what this is just in case

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.179 
gun so that's what this is just in case
anybody's<00:01:02.700> wondering<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:04.110> once<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.889> bring<00:01:05.009> up

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
anybody's wondering so once you bring up

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.309 
anybody's wondering so once you bring up
your<00:01:05.339> model<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:06.539> want<00:01:06.719> to<00:01:06.780> go<00:01:06.899> to<00:01:06.959> the

00:01:07.309 --> 00:01:07.319 
your model you want to go to the

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:11.120 
your model you want to go to the
outliner<00:01:08.749> to<00:01:09.749> bring<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.139> up<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:11.009> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
outliner to bring that up and what you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.059 
outliner to bring that up and what you
need<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.299> need<00:01:12.509> to<00:01:12.709> have<00:01:13.709> your

00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:14.069 
need to do is you need to have your

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:16.639 
need to do is you need to have your
model<00:01:14.999> all<00:01:15.329> one<00:01:15.630> piece<00:01:15.869> instead<00:01:16.109> of<00:01:16.380> different

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
model all one piece instead of different

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.910 
model all one piece instead of different
different<00:01:17.340> parts<00:01:17.749> okay<00:01:18.749> so<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.590> course<00:01:19.740> in

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
different parts okay so of course in

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.219 
different parts okay so of course in
order<00:01:20.039> to<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.359> need<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> select<00:01:21.840> all

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
order to do that you need to select all

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.249 
order to do that you need to select all
the<00:01:22.409> different<00:01:22.709> pieces<00:01:22.859> of<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:23.189> model<00:01:24.139> so<00:01:25.139> I'm

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the different pieces of the model so I'm

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:34.310 
the different pieces of the model so I'm
just<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:25.529> to<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.709> that<00:01:25.859> really<00:01:26.069> quick<00:01:26.399> here

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.200 

okay<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.310> think<00:01:35.580> those<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.060> pieces

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
okay I think those are all the pieces

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.730 
okay I think those are all the pieces
once<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:37.350> pieces<00:01:37.500> selected

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
once you have all the pieces selected

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.830 
once you have all the pieces selected
you<00:01:38.220> want<00:01:38.370> to<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> ctrl<00:01:38.910> J<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.480> join<00:01:39.690> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you want to do a ctrl J to join the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.170 
you want to do a ctrl J to join the
parts<00:01:41.330> and<00:01:42.770> make<00:01:43.770> them<00:01:44.070> if<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.730> go<00:01:44.820> into<00:01:44.910> tab

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
parts and make them if you go into tab

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.440 
parts and make them if you go into tab
or<00:01:45.950> yeah<00:01:46.950> tap<00:01:47.340> into<00:01:47.580> edit<00:01:47.790> mode<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:48.180> you'll

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
or yeah tap into edit mode then you'll

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.780 
or yeah tap into edit mode then you'll
select<00:01:49.080> you'll<00:01:49.440> see<00:01:49.620> that<00:01:49.800> you've<00:01:50.340> joined<00:01:50.550> all

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
select you'll see that you've joined all

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.030 
select you'll see that you've joined all
the<00:01:50.910> pieces<00:01:51.120> and<00:01:51.660> actually<00:01:52.380> pulled<00:01:52.680> my<00:01:52.860> light

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
the pieces and actually pulled my light

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.650 
the pieces and actually pulled my light
emission<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:53.640> that's<00:01:53.790> okay<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
emission but that's okay so there that

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.290 
emission but that's okay so there that
is<00:01:57.870> keep<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.680> mind<00:01:58.920> when<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.970> you

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
is keep in mind when you do that and you

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.120 
is keep in mind when you do that and you
join<00:02:00.600> them<00:02:00.810> all<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.260> last<00:02:01.500> piece<00:02:01.800> that<00:02:01.830> you

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
join them all to the last piece that you

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160 
join them all to the last piece that you
selected<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.540> take<00:02:03.690> over<00:02:04.050> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
selected it's going to take over the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.990 
selected it's going to take over the
properties<00:02:04.650> properties<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.790> last

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
properties properties of what that last

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.050 
properties properties of what that last
piece<00:02:06.330> was<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.770> had<00:02:08.009> something<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:09.030> a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
piece was so if you had something with a

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.340 
piece was so if you had something with a
modifier<00:02:09.570> on<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:09.990> they're<00:02:10.610> mirrored<00:02:11.610> or

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
modifier on it they're mirrored or

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.300 
modifier on it they're mirrored or
subdivision<00:02:13.350> service<00:02:13.680> whatever<00:02:13.860> just<00:02:14.220> keep

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
subdivision service whatever just keep

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.920 
subdivision service whatever just keep
in<00:02:14.459> mind<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.030> entire<00:02:15.360> model<00:02:15.630> will

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
in mind that the entire model will

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.800 
in mind that the entire model will
takeover<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.620> those<00:02:16.920> properties<00:02:17.600> okay<00:02:18.600> so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
takeover that those properties okay so

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.600 
takeover that those properties okay so
now<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.170> got<00:02:19.410> your<00:02:19.440> model<00:02:19.890> all<00:02:20.100> one<00:02:20.370> piece

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
now you got your model all one piece

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.850 
now you got your model all one piece
good<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.750> next<00:02:21.900> thing<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.440> need<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.680> do

once you have it in the directory then

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.620 
once you have it in the directory then
you<00:02:57.090> can<00:02:57.239> go<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.450> file<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.940> go<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.120> user

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
you can go to file and go to user

preferences and go to your add-ons and I
think<00:03:05.459> it's<00:03:05.549> on<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> 3d<00:03:06.060> view<00:03:06.269> but<00:03:06.600> if<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.290> just

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
think it's on a 3d view but if you just

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.550 
think it's on a 3d view but if you just
type<00:03:07.620> wire<00:03:08.750> then<00:03:09.750> it'll<00:03:09.989> bring<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.230> right<00:03:10.350> up

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
type wire then it'll bring it right up

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.759 
type wire then it'll bring it right up
and<00:03:10.769> you'll<00:03:11.580> see<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.850> here<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.630> called<00:03:12.870> setup

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
and you'll see it here it's called setup

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.600 
and you'll see it here it's called setup
wire<00:03:14.070> materials<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.650> just<00:03:16.650> click<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:17.310> that

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
wire materials and just click it so that

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.670 
wire materials and just click it so that
it's<00:03:18.709> enabled<00:03:21.260> okay<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.410> I'm<00:03:22.470> just<00:03:22.560> gonna

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
it's enabled okay and I'm just gonna

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.370 
it's enabled okay and I'm just gonna
close<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:24.000> then<00:03:24.209> once<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.540> go<00:03:24.660> into<00:03:24.840> t4

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
close that so then once you go into t4

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.190 
close that so then once you go into t4
tools<00:03:25.620> you'll<00:03:26.580> see<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.390> here<00:03:27.750> running<00:03:27.959> and

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
tools you'll see this here running and

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.360 
tools you'll see this here running and
that's<00:03:28.350> because<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.830> have<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.070> script

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
that's because you have that script

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.160 
that's because you have that script
running<00:03:29.580> or<00:03:30.239> turned<00:03:30.600> on<00:03:31.280> okay<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:32.340> by<00:03:32.700> default

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
running or turned on okay so by default

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.220 
running or turned on okay so by default
it<00:03:34.170> uses<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:35.010> color<00:03:35.310> as<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:36.510> material<00:03:36.959> color

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
it uses this color as the material color

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.220 
it uses this color as the material color
overall<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.820> uses<00:03:39.000> this<00:03:39.299> color<00:03:39.570> as<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
overall and it uses this color as the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.039 
overall and it uses this color as the
wires<00:03:41.090> by<00:03:42.090> default<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.660> kind<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:42.959> a

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
wires by default this is kind of a

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.830 
wires by default this is kind of a
reddish<00:03:43.350> color<00:03:43.380> which<00:03:43.859> I<00:03:43.980> don't<00:03:44.160> like<00:03:44.720> just<00:03:45.720> my

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
reddish color which I don't like just my

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.030 
reddish color which I don't like just my
preference

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
preference

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.850 
preference
so<00:03:47.400> what<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:47.670> do<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.120> go<00:03:48.239> into<00:03:48.390> HSV<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.439> I<00:03:49.620> just

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
so what I do is I go into HSV and I just

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.940 
so what I do is I go into HSV and I just
back<00:03:50.549> off<00:03:50.580> on<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.120> saturation<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:52.650> bring<00:03:52.829> it

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
back off on the saturation to bring it

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.339 
back off on the saturation to bring it
up<00:03:53.069> into<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.480> center<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.629> that<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:55.019> it's<00:03:55.200> just

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
up into the center of that so it's just

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.850 
up into the center of that so it's just
really<00:03:55.769> just<00:03:55.920> black<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.790> black<00:03:57.060> color<00:03:57.799> okay<00:03:58.799> so

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
really just black a black color okay so

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.740 
really just black a black color okay so
once<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.459> have<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.849> make<00:04:00.209> sure<00:04:00.360> that<00:04:00.599> your

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
once you have that make sure that your

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.280 
once you have that make sure that your
model<00:04:01.079> selected<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.920> just<00:04:02.930> click<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.140> want

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
model selected and just click you want

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.140 
model selected and just click you want
to<00:04:04.379> apply<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.709> selected<00:04:05.310> message<00:04:05.700> meshes

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
to apply it to selected message meshes

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.220 
to apply it to selected message meshes
and<00:04:07.129> you<00:04:08.129> want<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.459> create<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:09.030> wire<00:04:09.390> object<00:04:10.019> so

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
and you want to create a wire object so

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.330 
and you want to create a wire object so
you<00:04:10.319> want<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.530> select<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:12.200> okay<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.890> I'm<00:04:14.220> not

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
you want to select that okay and I'm not

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.039 
you want to select that okay and I'm not
gonna<00:04:14.430> go<00:04:14.640> over<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:14.970> different<00:04:15.480> parts<00:04:15.959> of

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
gonna go over the different parts of

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.199 
gonna go over the different parts of
this<00:04:16.169> script<00:04:16.889> because<00:04:17.039> I'm<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.820> only<00:04:17.940> part

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
this script because I'm the only part

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.900 
this script because I'm the only part
I'm<00:04:18.299> really<00:04:18.329> familiar<00:04:18.690> with<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.260> the

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
I'm really familiar with is the

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.700 
I'm really familiar with is the
wireframe<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:20.940> that's<00:04:21.269> what<00:04:21.570> I'm<00:04:22.019> creating

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
wireframe and that's what I'm creating

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.219 
wireframe and that's what I'm creating
in<00:04:22.830> this<00:04:22.949> tutorial<00:04:23.570> okay<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:24.630> once<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.080> have

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
in this tutorial okay so once you have

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.890 
in this tutorial okay so once you have
those<00:04:25.380> selected<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:26.699> just<00:04:26.880> want<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.240> apply

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
those selected you just want to apply

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.550 
those selected you just want to apply
materials<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:30.810> crunches<00:04:31.139> away<00:04:31.350> for<00:04:31.530> a

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
materials and it crunches away for a

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.840 
materials and it crunches away for a
little<00:04:31.770> bit<00:04:31.919> depend<00:04:32.190> on<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.430> size<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.789> your

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
little bit depend on the size of your

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.480 
little bit depend on the size of your
model<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.690> I'm<00:04:34.440> gonna<00:04:34.500> hit<00:04:34.860> T<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.220> get<00:04:35.310> that

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
model and I'm gonna hit T to get that

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.360 
model and I'm gonna hit T to get that
out<00:04:35.639> of<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:35.760> way<00:04:36.169> and<00:04:37.169> you<00:04:37.440> can<00:04:37.590> see<00:04:37.800> that's

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
out of the way and you can see that's

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.550 
out of the way and you can see that's
what<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.000> is<00:04:39.210> I'm<00:04:39.419> not<00:04:39.539> even<00:04:39.600> in<00:04:39.990> wireframe

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
what it is I'm not even in wireframe

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.909 
what it is I'm not even in wireframe
mode<00:04:40.889> if<00:04:41.340> izn<00:04:41.820> you'll<00:04:42.150> see<00:04:42.389> that<00:04:43.320> Squire<00:04:43.620> frame

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
mode if izn you'll see that Squire frame

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.200 
mode if izn you'll see that Squire frame
mode<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.880> shows<00:04:45.240> that<00:04:46.229> as<00:04:46.470> a<00:04:46.500> material<00:04:47.010> so<00:04:47.970> once

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
mode it shows that as a material so once

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.750 
mode it shows that as a material so once
that's<00:04:48.389> done<00:04:48.830> then<00:04:49.830> all<00:04:50.010> you<00:04:50.130> really<00:04:50.430> have<00:04:50.550> to

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
that's done then all you really have to

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.180 
that's done then all you really have to
do<00:04:50.940> is<00:04:51.240> select<00:04:51.599> your<00:04:51.780> camera<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:53.010> I'm<00:04:53.099> gonna

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
do is select your camera and I'm gonna

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.159 
do is select your camera and I'm gonna
select<00:04:53.400> my<00:04:53.669> perspective<00:04:54.330> camera<00:04:54.690> here<00:04:54.960> come

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
select my perspective camera here come

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.570 
select my perspective camera here come
over<00:04:55.289> here<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:55.800> ctrl<00:04:56.760> 0<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:58.830> make<00:04:58.949> that<00:04:59.160> active

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
over here and ctrl 0 to make that active

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:11.379 
over here and ctrl 0 to make that active
and<00:05:00.770> hit<00:05:01.770> f12<00:05:02.039> to<00:05:02.280> do<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.490> render

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.840 

okay<00:05:12.389> so<00:05:12.449> there<00:05:13.110> you<00:05:13.320> have<00:05:13.350> it<00:05:13.560> a<00:05:13.889> nice<00:05:14.250> good

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
okay so there you have it a nice good

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.850 
okay so there you have it a nice good
clear<00:05:15.830> wireframe<00:05:16.830> looks<00:05:17.130> really<00:05:17.400> nice<00:05:17.840> and

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
clear wireframe looks really nice and

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.990 
clear wireframe looks really nice and
through<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.010> magic<00:05:20.340> of<00:05:20.460> video<00:05:20.669> editing

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
through the magic of video editing

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.480 
through the magic of video editing
luckily<00:05:21.720> you've<00:05:22.380> seen<00:05:22.590> it<00:05:22.740> in<00:05:22.830> seconds<00:05:23.280> rather

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
luckily you've seen it in seconds rather

luckily you've seen it in seconds rather
than<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.880> 11<00:05:24.240> minutes<00:05:24.510> my<00:05:24.630> poor<00:05:24.990> computer

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
than the 11 minutes my poor computer

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.580 
than the 11 minutes my poor computer
took<00:05:25.620> to<00:05:26.190> actually<00:05:26.430> render<00:05:26.729> this<00:05:26.850> I<00:05:27.560> need<00:05:28.560> a

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
took to actually render this I need a

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.810 
took to actually render this I need a
new<00:05:28.770> graphics<00:05:29.130> card<00:05:29.160> anyway<00:05:30.290> a<00:05:31.760> couple<00:05:32.760> of

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
new graphics card anyway a couple of

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.030 
new graphics card anyway a couple of
things<00:05:33.000> about<00:05:33.150> this<00:05:33.419> render<00:05:33.840> that<00:05:34.139> you<00:05:34.290> may<00:05:34.680> or

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
things about this render that you may or

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.370 
things about this render that you may or
may<00:05:35.070> not<00:05:35.220> notice<00:05:35.520> one<00:05:36.270> is<00:05:36.540> all<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.110> bullets

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
may not notice one is all the bullets

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.080 
may not notice one is all the bullets
are<00:05:37.530> missing<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.550> I<00:05:38.639> did<00:05:38.790> that<00:05:38.940> on<00:05:39.060> purpose

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
are missing and I did that on purpose

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.600 
are missing and I did that on purpose
just<00:05:39.479> to<00:05:39.720> show<00:05:39.930> you<00:05:39.990> that<00:05:40.410> if<00:05:40.710> you<00:05:41.100> don't<00:05:41.430> apply

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
just to show you that if you don't apply

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.909 
just to show you that if you don't apply
your<00:05:41.880> modifiers<00:05:42.419> before<00:05:43.289> you<00:05:43.440> join<00:05:43.740> your

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
your modifiers before you join your

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.770 
your modifiers before you join your
objects<00:05:44.340> then<00:05:44.970> of<00:05:45.090> course<00:05:45.300> they're<00:05:45.479> not<00:05:45.630> gonna

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
objects then of course they're not gonna

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.050 
objects then of course they're not gonna
show<00:05:46.229> up<00:05:46.380> when<00:05:46.620> you<00:05:46.650> join<00:05:47.400> it<00:05:47.550> to<00:05:47.669> that<00:05:47.789> last

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
show up when you join it to that last

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.430 
show up when you join it to that last
object<00:05:48.360> so<00:05:48.690> you<00:05:48.750> want<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.050> make<00:05:49.139> sure<00:05:49.169> you

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
object so you want to make sure you

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.590 
object so you want to make sure you
apply<00:05:49.650> those<00:05:49.949> correctly<00:05:50.430> and<00:05:50.610> then<00:05:50.729> join<00:05:51.449> them

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
apply those correctly and then join them

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.930 
apply those correctly and then join them
together<00:05:51.900> the<00:05:52.860> other<00:05:53.010> thing<00:05:53.250> that<00:05:53.280> you<00:05:53.610> may<00:05:53.880> be

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
together the other thing that you may be

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.909 
together the other thing that you may be
able<00:05:54.240> to<00:05:54.360> see<00:05:54.570> here<00:05:54.840> is<00:05:55.050> there<00:05:55.320> some<00:05:55.530> lines

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
able to see here is there some lines

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.620 
able to see here is there some lines
going<00:05:56.310> off<00:05:56.490> this<00:05:56.699> way<00:05:56.880> well<00:05:57.120> what<00:05:57.300> is<00:05:57.419> that

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
going off this way well what is that

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.350 
going off this way well what is that
well<00:05:58.380> let's<00:05:58.530> take<00:05:58.680> a<00:05:58.710> look<00:05:58.979> if<00:05:59.699> we<00:05:59.789> go<00:05:59.910> back<00:06:00.120> to

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
well let's take a look if we go back to

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.529 
well let's take a look if we go back to
the<00:06:00.600> actual<00:06:00.960> image<00:06:01.320> here<00:06:01.729> can<00:06:02.729> we<00:06:02.880> see<00:06:03.150> them

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.439 

yes<00:06:06.539> we<00:06:06.750> can<00:06:07.050> can<00:06:07.590> we<00:06:07.740> select<00:06:08.100> them<00:06:08.449> yes

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
yes we can can we select them yes

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:13.010 
yes we can can we select them yes
actually<00:06:09.780> we<00:06:10.110> can<00:06:10.380> now<00:06:11.130> this<00:06:11.400> is<00:06:11.669> an<00:06:12.270> artifact

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
actually we can now this is an artifact

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.950 
actually we can now this is an artifact
of<00:06:13.200> the<00:06:13.919> script<00:06:14.400> that<00:06:14.610> I've<00:06:15.000> seen<00:06:15.510> this<00:06:15.690> this

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
of the script that I've seen this this

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.750 
of the script that I've seen this this
part<00:06:16.260> is<00:06:16.410> actually<00:06:16.560> my<00:06:16.889> laser<00:06:17.160> sight<00:06:17.490> so

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
part is actually my laser sight so

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.440 
part is actually my laser sight so
that's<00:06:17.940> okay

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
that's okay

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.370 
that's okay
but<00:06:19.139> these<00:06:20.010> are<00:06:20.840> vertices<00:06:21.840> that<00:06:21.870> have<00:06:22.229> just

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
but these are vertices that have just

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.950 
but these are vertices that have just
shot<00:06:22.650> out<00:06:22.950> of<00:06:23.070> nowhere<00:06:23.280> or<00:06:23.729> shot<00:06:24.830> way<00:06:25.830> off<00:06:25.860> into

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
shot out of nowhere or shot way off into

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.430 
shot out of nowhere or shot way off into
oblivion<00:06:27.960> and<00:06:29.180> I<00:06:30.180> don't<00:06:30.660> know<00:06:30.780> what<00:06:30.960> causes

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
oblivion and I don't know what causes

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.779 
oblivion and I don't know what causes
that<00:06:31.770> there's<00:06:32.010> something<00:06:32.220> the<00:06:32.400> script<00:06:32.669> that's

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
that there's something the script that's

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.270 
that there's something the script that's
doing<00:06:33.090> it<00:06:33.210> and<00:06:33.389> the<00:06:33.840> more<00:06:34.050> complex<00:06:34.710> your<00:06:34.889> model

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
doing it and the more complex your model

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.029 
doing it and the more complex your model
is<00:06:35.490> the<00:06:35.789> more<00:06:36.000> you'll<00:06:36.120> run<00:06:36.330> into<00:06:36.479> these<00:06:37.039> what

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
is the more you'll run into these what

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:43.159 
is the more you'll run into these what
I've<00:06:38.160> done<00:06:38.510> lately<00:06:39.740> or<00:06:41.750> the<00:06:42.750> best<00:06:42.930> way<00:06:43.050> I've

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
I've done lately or the best way I've

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.180 
I've done lately or the best way I've
found<00:06:43.199> to<00:06:43.500> take<00:06:43.800> care<00:06:44.070> of<00:06:44.099> these<00:06:44.310> is<00:06:45.139> to<00:06:46.190> go

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
found to take care of these is to go

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.570 
found to take care of these is to go
into<00:06:47.340> the<00:06:47.520> model<00:06:47.880> go<00:06:48.750> into<00:06:49.199> your<00:06:49.770> edit<00:06:50.039> mode<00:06:50.070> go

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
into the model go into your edit mode go

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.240 
into the model go into your edit mode go
and<00:06:50.760> make<00:06:50.940> sure<00:06:51.240> in<00:06:51.360> your<00:06:51.389> vertex<00:06:52.289> mode<00:06:52.560> go

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
and make sure in your vertex mode go

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.700 
and make sure in your vertex mode go
find<00:06:53.580> the<00:06:53.760> ones<00:06:53.970> that<00:06:54.150> are<00:06:54.389> stray<00:06:54.720> and<00:06:55.080> just

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
find the ones that are stray and just

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.980 
find the ones that are stray and just
delete<00:06:56.010> them<00:06:56.220> it<00:06:57.060> doesn't<00:06:57.539> hurt<00:06:57.750> your

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
delete them it doesn't hurt your

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.110 
delete them it doesn't hurt your
wireframe<00:06:58.620> usually<00:06:58.919> unless<00:06:59.220> it's<00:06:59.580> in<00:06:59.669> a<00:06:59.760> place

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
wireframe usually unless it's in a place

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.920 
wireframe usually unless it's in a place
that's<00:07:00.419> just<00:07:01.039> really<00:07:02.039> messing<00:07:02.460> it<00:07:02.580> up<00:07:02.760> but<00:07:03.720> you

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
that's just really messing it up but you

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.500 
that's just really messing it up but you
can<00:07:04.080> clean<00:07:04.320> that<00:07:04.349> up<00:07:04.530> that<00:07:05.460> is<00:07:05.699> the<00:07:05.940> only<00:07:06.180> thing

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
can clean that up that is the only thing

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.529 
can clean that up that is the only thing
that<00:07:06.720> I've<00:07:06.840> found<00:07:06.870> wrong<00:07:07.440> with<00:07:07.620> the<00:07:07.710> script

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:08.539 
that I've found wrong with the script

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:11.270 
that I've found wrong with the script
again<00:07:09.539> I<00:07:09.750> don't<00:07:09.990> know<00:07:10.080> what<00:07:10.229> causes<00:07:10.470> that<00:07:10.860> but

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
again I don't know what causes that but

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.129 
again I don't know what causes that but
it<00:07:11.729> just<00:07:11.940> seems<00:07:12.120> to<00:07:12.240> be<00:07:12.270> a<00:07:12.360> bug<00:07:12.570> with<00:07:12.720> a<00:07:12.750> script

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 
it just seems to be a bug with a script

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:14.810 
it just seems to be a bug with a script
and<00:07:13.289> and<00:07:13.590> the<00:07:13.650> more<00:07:13.800> complex<00:07:14.190> your<00:07:14.310> model<00:07:14.639> is

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
and and the more complex your model is

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.269 
and and the more complex your model is
the<00:07:15.539> more<00:07:15.840> it<00:07:15.990> seems<00:07:16.229> to<00:07:16.410> screw<00:07:16.680> up

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:17.279 
the more it seems to screw up

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:19.459 
the more it seems to screw up
that's<00:07:17.999> kind<00:07:18.239> of<00:07:18.329> something<00:07:18.689> that's<00:07:18.959> going<00:07:19.139> on

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:19.469 
that's kind of something that's going on

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:23.419 
that's kind of something that's going on
there<00:07:19.879> so<00:07:20.879> anyway<00:07:21.499> that's<00:07:22.499> how<00:07:22.649> you<00:07:22.769> get<00:07:23.159> a

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:23.429 
there so anyway that's how you get a

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:26.779 
there so anyway that's how you get a
really<00:07:23.759> good<00:07:24.529> wireframe<00:07:25.529> render<00:07:25.769> in<00:07:26.069> cycles<00:07:26.549> I

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:26.789 
really good wireframe render in cycles I

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:28.189 
really good wireframe render in cycles I
