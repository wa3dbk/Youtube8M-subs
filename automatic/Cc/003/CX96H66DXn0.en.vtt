and<00:00:15.170> if<00:00:15.260> it<00:00:15.379> fails<00:00:15.620> what<00:00:15.860> our<00:00:15.980> emergency

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
and if it fails what our emergency

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.410

the<00:01:37.010> blackout<00:01:37.490> test<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.270> basically<00:01:38.540> drop<00:01:39.380> the

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
the blackout test you basically drop the

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.649 
the blackout test you basically drop the
