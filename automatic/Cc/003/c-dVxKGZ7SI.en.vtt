00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.490 
because if young gets hurt again as we
actually<00:04:01.290> thought

a<00:04:04.570> pretty<00:04:04.750> big<00:04:05.050> game<00:04:05.290> if<00:04:05.530> young<00:04:05.830> kid<00:04:06.040> gets<00:04:06.400> hurt

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
a pretty big game if young kid gets hurt

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.120 
a pretty big game if young kid gets hurt
again<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:07.180> then<00:04:07.750> Flacco<00:04:08.080> gets<00:04:08.440> hurt<00:04:08.680> after

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
with another touchdown but I was really

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.500 
with another touchdown but I was really
mad<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.260> went<00:05:20.500> back<00:05:20.740> i<00:05:21.040> watch<00:05:21.760> that<00:05:21.970> play<00:05:22.150> over

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.790 
mad I went back i watch that play over
again<00:05:22.780> and<00:05:22.870> we<00:05:22.990> definitely<00:05:23.410> should<00:05:23.590> have<00:05:23.680> had

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
again and we definitely should have had

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.890 
again and we definitely should have had
the<00:05:23.950> user<00:05:24.160> just<00:05:24.790> didn't<00:05:25.090> get<00:05:25.150> an<00:05:25.270> animation<00:05:25.630> I

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
the user just didn't get an animation I

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.719 
the user just didn't get an animation I
guess<00:05:26.080> that<00:05:26.260> just<00:05:26.410> is<00:05:26.770> how<00:05:27.010> things<00:05:27.340> happen

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
guess that just is how things happen

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.990 
guess that just is how things happen
sometimes<00:05:28.680> right<00:05:29.680> here<00:05:29.919> first<00:05:30.460> attend<00:05:30.910> the

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000

sometimes right here first attend the
game<00:05:31.180> pretty<00:05:31.479> much<00:05:31.570> over<00:05:32.020> trying<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:32.860> get<00:05:32.950> a
