00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
anyway we put a heart rate monitor on

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.419 
anyway we put a heart rate monitor on
our<00:00:25.439> stopper<00:00:26.180> to<00:00:27.180> see<00:00:27.539> how<00:00:28.109> much<00:00:28.289> time<00:00:28.710> you

you make a big sprint mm-hmm and then

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.400 
you make a big sprint mm-hmm and then
the<00:00:53.789> rest<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.180> time<00:00:54.390> you're<00:00:54.600> recovering<00:00:55.199> and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the rest of time you're recovering and

we<00:00:58.350> were<00:00:58.620> amazed<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.579> realized<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
we were amazed that we realized that

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.229 
we were amazed that we realized that
scrimmaging<00:01:02.010> wasn't<00:01:02.640> conditioning<00:01:03.149> our

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
scrimmaging wasn't conditioning our

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.609 
scrimmaging wasn't conditioning our
athletes<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:03.750> had<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> spend<00:01:04.170> time<00:01:04.350> than

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
athletes we had to spend time than

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
athletes we had to spend time than
condition<00:01:05.210> hmm

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
condition hmm

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.600 
condition hmm
so<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.990> heart<00:01:07.229> rate<00:01:07.290> monitor<00:01:07.740> really<00:01:08.159> made<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
so that heart rate monitor really made a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.649 
so that heart rate monitor really made a
huge<00:01:08.729> difference<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.920> used<00:01:11.760> them<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.210> use<00:01:12.510> them

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
huge difference I used them I use them

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.590 
huge difference I used them I use them
in<00:01:12.750> Kojak<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.470> coach<00:01:13.770> track<00:01:14.130> four<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:15.180> 40<00:01:15.450> years

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
in Kojak I coach track four for 40 years

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.760 
in Kojak I coach track four for 40 years
I<00:01:15.810> used<00:01:16.049> them<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.350> coaching<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:16.830> spinners<00:01:17.360> and
