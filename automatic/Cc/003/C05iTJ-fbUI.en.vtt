00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.720
 hi this is skit school in motion and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.490
 today we will talk about how to go 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.949
 on a skateboard and how to manage it 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.550
 if gives it never even stood on 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.380
 blackboard 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 start by determining which 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.880
 resistant you will ride for this 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.890
 ask someone to come behind your back 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.930
 and suddenly push your back pay 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.660
 attention which foot you instinctively 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.550
 step forward exactly this leg and will 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.780
 lead that is exactly it will be 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.149
 stand on the board 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.800
 further before each ride you need 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.559
 do a little warm-up 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.789
 which includes stretching and 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.960
 simple exercises 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.890
 such a warm-up warms the joints and 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.289
 prepares skating business 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.399
 it will help you avoid injuries and be 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.189
 more flexible now you can learn to ride 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.830
 100 on the board leading foot putting it 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.909
 front suspension bolts diagonally 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.159
 heel away 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.619
 push off with a jogging foot and put 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.790
 her on the board on the back of the suspension bolts 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.689
 parallel to the leading foot you ride 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.490
 slightly bend your knees become springy 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.950
 trying to distribute your weight equally 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.259
 on both legs and rolls forward or 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.659
 back do not accelerate too much 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.770
 avoid sharp descents try everything 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.380
 do gradually 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.229
 you can control the board by transferring weight 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.570
 body on heels or heels push down 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.680
 stronger on the left side of the board you will go 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.560
 left right right 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.990
 you are hanging on big brackets 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.330
 which are called kingpin and the stronger 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.030
 You spins Kingpin and those who 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.340
 will turn the board over the chest and them 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.570
 to a medium state so that you were 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.150
 convenient to turn 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.490
 to brake on a skateboard 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.490
 you need to gently lower the back 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.229
 jogging foot on the ground holding the sole 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.539
 parallel to the surface of the earth 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.690
 so you shuffle about 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.450
 asphalt and slow it down too 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.090
 requires a certain skill so in 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.670
 at first you can just run off 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.190
 boards so little trick 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.620
 to quickly take the board in hand, click 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.340
 teilu pre-palm 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.620
 near the knee and grabbing her nose for a bit 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.800
 practice and you learn to do it 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.800
 automatically 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.070
 in the next video I will show a couple of tricks 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.900
 which will allow to move safely 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.540
 on a skateboard in the city 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.160
 for now subscribe to updates 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.160
