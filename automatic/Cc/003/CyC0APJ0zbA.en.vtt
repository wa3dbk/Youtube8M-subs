00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
going to come down a little bit and

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.910 
going to come down a little bit and
we'll<00:01:28.470> look<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.040 

in<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.880> foliage<00:01:33.690> near<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> ground<00:01:36.050> the

you can actually scumble with the darker
color<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:11.040> what's<00:05:11.250> happening<00:05:11.729> here<00:05:12.000> is<00:05:12.150> it's

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
color and what's happening here is it's

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.680

very diffused softened diffused area of
light<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.320> because<00:05:20.310> I'm<00:05:20.490> working<00:05:20.820> in<00:05:20.910> acrylic

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.740 
light and because I'm working in acrylic
this<00:05:22.740> is<00:05:22.979> drawing<00:05:23.400> really<00:05:23.729> quickly<00:05:24.240> allowing

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
this is drawing really quickly allowing

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.200 
this is drawing really quickly allowing
me<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:24.900> add<00:05:25.110> layer<00:05:25.470> upon<00:05:26.010> layer<00:05:26.280> upon<00:05:26.310> layer<00:05:26.970> of

me to add layer upon layer upon layer of
stumble<00:05:27.830> very<00:05:28.830> quickly<00:05:29.250> so<00:05:29.700> in<00:05:29.850> oils<00:05:30.210> you'd

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
stumble very quickly so in oils you'd

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.909 
stumble very quickly so in oils you'd
have<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.690> be<00:05:30.810> waiting<00:05:31.229> you<00:05:31.260> know<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.560> your

have to be waiting you know to your
entire<00:05:32.729> area<00:05:33.210> is<00:05:33.360> darker<00:05:33.900> but<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.110> like<00:05:34.440> the

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
entire area is darker but I like the

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.340 
entire area is darker but I like the
acrylic<00:05:35.490> for<00:05:35.760> this<00:05:36.000> reason<00:05:36.540> because<00:05:37.020> it

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
acrylic for this reason because it

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.740 
acrylic for this reason because it
allows<00:05:37.590> me<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:37.860> work<00:05:38.070> quickly<00:05:38.460> it<00:05:39.270> allows<00:05:39.540> me

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
allows me to work quickly it allows me

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.630 
allows me to work quickly it allows me

toning down some of those patches of
more<00:06:36.150> intense<00:06:36.539> color<00:06:36.930> but<00:06:37.860> it's<00:06:37.979> important

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
more intense color but it's important

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.999

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.379 
that they're under there the painting
really<00:06:41.250> wouldn't<00:06:41.520> have<00:06:41.550> the<00:06:41.759> same<00:06:41.940> character

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
really wouldn't have the same character

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.930 
really wouldn't have the same character
at<00:06:42.509> the<00:06:42.630> end<00:06:42.660> if<00:06:43.199> those<00:06:43.410> brighter<00:06:43.940> more

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940
