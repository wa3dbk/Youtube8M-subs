00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.920
 hi friends what about if Jorge de Ferro 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.750
 bar point they will show this 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.160
 multi fuel stove 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.950
 manufacturer cousins 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.530
 this is the reference omni was coming 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.320
 presented in this box these rivers the 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.500
 We can use both for cartridges 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.600
 gas as clean fuel as much as 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.480
 in the same gasoline depends on primus or 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.820
 that of coleman msr with paraffin or with 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.630
 oil here we can see that it has a 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.500
 0.6 bottle and let's see the inside 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.500
 what we find 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.400
 this would be what the priming pump is 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.400
 to put it inside 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.660
 we find the stove 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.840
 fully folded 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.510
 worry less space has a 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.390
 power of about 3,000 watts is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.550
 Fully adjustable on ignition is 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.590
 manual leads to do the 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.550
 preheating for example to very low 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.500
 temperatures 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.640
 here we would take one for wind and one 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.550
 heat reflector that we could 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.830
 put on the bottom 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.630
 a practical transport bag of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.050
 prime manufacturers to bring what is 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.830
 the theme of children 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.060
 and here in this part the stove comes 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.040
 with the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.530
 with the injector that's in here 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.390
 of to use it with the cartridges of 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.789
 gas we can use the cartridges of 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.950
 galdÃ³s of 100 230 2 400 grams 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.380
 defrauding cousins we can also 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.470
 use for example those of coleman msr 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.380
 break is par or when we are in our 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.060
 outdoor activities another in 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.920
 another country see that the step is this one of 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.010
 European thread would not be worth the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.070
 effective cyclist cartridges 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.920
 here you can offer 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.450
 here some fat petroleum jelly for 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.410
 lubricate here we would arrive what is the 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.510
 extractor key for removing the spark plug 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.850
 or an injector that I tell you and here 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.850
 reaches all injectors that as no 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.010
 they deserved 37 and the 28 in the instructions 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.510
 they will not tell you to use it 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.190
 injector to use with fuel 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.380
 we saw that it is similar to the fuel of 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.870
 coleman the other to use it for 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.870
 example with paraffin with good oil 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.060
 if you 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.690
 this would be the key perfectly for 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:47.710
 connect it with the cartridges so it 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:49.660
 we would be here with the bottle at 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.330
 use liquid fuels come 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.210
 very good for low temperatures it 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.860
 requires a preheating leads to a 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.440
 new preheating zone more 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.290
 improved we just have to go pumping 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.330
 to give him pressure what we will be here 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.070
 we would have to change the injector 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.820
 although we will take the step less 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.590
 preheating and the ignition is 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.450
 totally manual this stove is 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.550
 valid for one or four 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.570
 approximately people we can put 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.280
 today it is quite big because 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.840
 soon will have here we can put 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.650
 some pots of about 20 centimeters 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.070
 diameter in the light screw just start 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.240
 the environment that are extremely cold 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.440
 I hope the information is not seen 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.440
 help a greeting and good trip
