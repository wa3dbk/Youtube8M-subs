00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
zoom in and the left side of zoom out

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.280 
zoom in and the left side of zoom out
and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.820> also<00:01:30.000> type<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.780> however

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
and then you can also type in however

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.580 
and then you can also type in however
much<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.860> want<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.869> lowest<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.470> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
much you want now the lowest that you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.520 
much you want now the lowest that you
can<00:01:34.770> go<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.960> 0.39%

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.130 

so<00:01:42.130> like<00:01:42.460> super<00:01:43.000> I<00:01:43.270> don't<00:01:43.540> know<00:01:43.600> why<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.840> want

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
so like super I don't know why you want

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.350 
so like super I don't know why you want
to<00:01:44.230> do<00:01:44.320> that<00:01:44.470> but<00:01:44.880> maybe<00:01:45.880> if<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.210> have

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
to do that but maybe if you have

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.850 
to do that but maybe if you have
something<00:01:46.570> that's<00:01:46.810> like<00:01:46.900> really<00:01:47.020> really<00:01:47.650> big

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
something that's like really really big

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.790 
something that's like really really big
and<00:01:48.160> then<00:01:49.590> 3200<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:51.210> 3200<00:01:52.210> which<00:01:52.960> that's<00:01:53.620> the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
and then 3200 is 3200 which that's the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.650 
and then 3200 is 3200 which that's the
highest<00:01:54.040> that<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.370> can<00:01:54.580> go<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.150> can<00:01:55.479> see

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
highest that you can go so you can see

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.390 
highest that you can go so you can see
basically<00:01:55.780> every<00:01:56.440> single<00:01:56.470> pixel<00:01:56.890> which<00:01:57.280> is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
basically every single pixel which is

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.750 
basically every single pixel which is
pretty<00:01:57.550> cool<00:01:58.560> now<00:01:59.560> I'm<00:02:00.250> going<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.460> go<00:02:00.550> back<00:02:00.729> to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
pretty cool now I'm going to go back to

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.840 
pretty cool now I'm going to go back to
100<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:02.100> what<00:02:03.100> I'm<00:02:03.160> going<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.340> do<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:03.729> I'm

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
100 and what I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.359 
100 and what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.030> zoom<00:02:04.330> in<00:02:04.510> a<00:02:04.570> little<00:02:04.930> bit<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.410> if<00:02:06.160> you

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.819 
to show you so this thumbnail is pretty
small<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.359> might<00:04:18.139> be<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.289> little<00:04:18.410> hard<00:04:18.650> for<00:04:18.709> you

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
small and might be a little hard for you

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.529 
small and might be a little hard for you
to<00:04:18.949> navigate<00:04:19.100> or<00:04:19.549> actually<00:04:20.030> see<00:04:20.269> what's<00:04:20.449> going

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
to navigate or actually see what's going

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.629 
to navigate or actually see what's going
on<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.470> if<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:21.590> come<00:04:21.799> down<00:04:21.829> to<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.280> corner

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
on so if you come down to the corner

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.740 
on so if you come down to the corner
here<00:04:22.669> and<00:04:23.289> drag<00:04:24.289> out<00:04:25.419> make<00:04:26.419> sure<00:04:26.449> it's<00:04:26.660> the

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
here and drag out make sure it's the

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.150 
here and drag out make sure it's the
double<00:04:27.020> arrow<00:04:27.169> there<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.410> drag<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:27.889> out<00:04:27.979> your

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
double arrow there and drag it out your

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.610 
double arrow there and drag it out your
thumbnail<00:04:28.550> will<00:04:28.729> get<00:04:28.880> bigger<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.620> therefore

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
thumbnail will get bigger and therefore

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.550 
thumbnail will get bigger and therefore
your<00:04:30.949> Navigator<00:04:31.870> thumbnail<00:04:32.870> will<00:04:32.990> be<00:04:33.139> easier

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
your Navigator thumbnail will be easier

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.860 
your Navigator thumbnail will be easier
to<00:04:33.620> navigate<00:04:34.400> but<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.090> also<00:04:35.270> gets<00:04:35.479> in<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.750> way

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
to navigate but it also gets in the way

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.379 
to navigate but it also gets in the way
of<00:04:36.020> what<00:04:36.139> you're<00:04:36.199> working<00:04:36.349> on<00:04:36.729> so<00:04:37.729> that's<00:04:38.210> up

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
of what you're working on so that's up

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.270 
of what you're working on so that's up
to<00:04:38.539> you<00:04:38.690> how<00:04:38.900> big<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.199> want<00:04:39.320> to<00:04:39.470> make<00:04:39.590> it<00:04:39.800> so

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
to you how big you want to make it so

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.379 
to you how big you want to make it so
it's<00:04:40.910> not<00:04:41.030> just<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.479> fixed<00:04:41.720> small<00:04:42.139> thumbnail<00:04:43.130> I

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
it's not just a fixed small thumbnail I

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.170 
it's not just a fixed small thumbnail I
like<00:04:44.389> to<00:04:44.479> keep<00:04:44.570> mine<00:04:44.810> about<00:04:45.020> this<00:04:45.289> size<00:04:45.560> and

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
like to keep mine about this size and

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.330 
like to keep mine about this size and
it's<00:04:47.180> not<00:04:47.330> too<00:04:47.510> much<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:47.960> way<00:04:48.139> but<00:04:49.070> if<00:04:49.190> it

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
it's not too much in the way but if it

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.860 
it's not too much in the way but if it
ever<00:04:49.490> does<00:04:49.669> I'll<00:04:49.909> just<00:04:50.090> you<00:04:50.360> can<00:04:50.510> just<00:04:50.690> close
