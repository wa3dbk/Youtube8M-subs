00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.589
 17th century back in Brazil 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:14.860
 blackberry resides everywhere and can be found in 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:19.550
 form under escort in virtually every region of the country. 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.720
 blackberries are characterized by their physical form 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.560
 are generated from the grouping of female pairs with the fruits that film 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.850
 saving you from walking further via your car 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.110
 but we are in the time of the harvest of the motorcycle 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.760
 and to know a little more about the invoice this year we had until 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.910

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.400
 forty tons of blackberry 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.270
 What is this respect? 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.959
 while things are like this 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:02.990
 it's 20 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.960
 20 '- foot 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.160
 how many employees without a portfolio 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
 Nassar I left the world 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.110
 Avoid Employee and Marijuana 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.220
 in the 70's 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.450
 Then I do not work with strawberries alone. 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.830
 not only for his work on land 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.830
 but the fine thing you have there 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.010
 Wow 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.350
 and now it is a very sensitive plant does not take any special care of itself 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.620
 with the support that can not leave the place was at the beginning of the crisis none 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.700
 I'm 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.610
 for 30 years with a cap 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.780
 the parade 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.790
 Every time we have it now it's small 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.090
 but the others are already bigger as it is 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.550
 the rice harvest 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.550
 in her she has a knowledge 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.250
 the ap 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.320
 especially when there is no rain 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.120
 hahaha live 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.120
 the difference between a big and a day in the other 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.230
 for example, this support 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.250
 already on the other day next year in red 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.059
 does not help much 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:11.929
 and if this information is collected this year 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:13.050
 at the time she 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.129
 What happens if senna 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.989
 if you do not eat then you have to go every day every day for ernando 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.180
 since the early 1980s, embrapa has maintained an improvement program 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.759
 genetic 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.249
 is the Indian one of the main purposes is to get as many 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.709
 access and grandchildren without thorns like this one 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.039
 with good productivity has fruit quality 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.289
 this year the first cultivar was launched with these characteristics that 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:46.409
 they said and we already have some other selections like as in the case 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.119
 this is the selection 6 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:51.959
 that I also bought from minds should be made available to 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.959
 supporters 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.169
 climatic factors are important to define a place of worship 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:02.529
 according to this source 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:07.119
 which fits well in regions with moderate summer temperatures 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.119
 low in winter 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:15.269
 the harvest point is determined when the producer agreement is 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.139
 totally black 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.029
 being recommended to harvest every two to three days 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.259
 Tuesday 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:29.579
 this exam is good technician 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.739
 also as proven facts 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.899
 Earth 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.899
 with the advantage of 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.319
 blackberry is a dr culture 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.599
 became fast 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.729
 since in the second year goes into production 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.269
 it provides the small producer 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.799
 income options by the destination of the product market and in painting 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.349
 dairy industry 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.799
 and homemade jelly factories 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.659
 but it is not only the appearance and the sweet taste of the mulberry that attracts the 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.529
 consumers is also known to contain high 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.529
 minerals vitamins that I caused 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:19.760
 fungi and bacteria are the main microorganisms that cause 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.629
 Post-harvest diseases 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:26.119
 and are liable for penalties that may exceed 50% 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:31.819
 to prevent this from occurring it is necessary to clean the palm 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:39.210
 it's the end of 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.150
 in mid-January the blackberry producer and should 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.159
 seventy with some details of the bruise on the plant 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.319
 and the main one would be the cleaning of palmar 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.819
 the escort can observe here 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.599
 with this blackberry plant after the harvest ah the branch that produced the tail 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.370
 of the last year that develops produced in that year it tends to dry and this branch 

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:08.300
 so it has to be eliminated because if a producer did not do it in that 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.199
 winter pruning he may have problems with 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.159
 we can observe that while we have a rod producing 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:24.729
 fruits nee and after they reproduce will dry new gear are coming out of the ground 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.770
 and these wings are so 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.320
 they are growing up are in the opera house they are in the following year there 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.379
 production in 2005 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:40.279
 that the producer has to do now from January until February that he 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.249
 have to eliminate 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:45.559
 all this art then how would it be is 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.949
 the trend of full cecato asia then he would make a cut by eliminating 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.949
 all the material came people will demonstrate here 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.050
 this cut is done until 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.150
 between the soil at the base of the 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:08.000
 the whole of the service he produced this year 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 the purchase of the building it mine with this 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:18.659
 soul the generation prass reunification issue arising and consequently is 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.369
 the strengthening of these kumar areas 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:24.270
 with production the announcement of the subsequent 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.339
 it's important to remember 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:27.529
 cel 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.449
 producer 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:31.419
 on this occasion 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.889
 be able to make a fertilization mainly a new action with 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.689
 organic matter with manure 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:41.969
 the acer is recommended because the fortress will strengthen then the actress 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:44.969
 will potentiate the production of the subsequent year 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:48.889
 the goal 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:54.370
 despite being a culture still little known by the Brazilian population to 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.460
 ease of installation of palmares 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.080
 low maintenance cost 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.999
 the nutritional value and acceptance of the consumer market 

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:09.209
 are just some of the reasons why the delay may be in the future 

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:12.569
 next to one of the fights and what cultures of the region
