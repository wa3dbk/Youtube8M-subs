FIFA<00:00:33.870> literally<00:00:34.140> believed<00:00:34.410> then<00:00:35.070> yeah<00:00:35.550> it's

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
FIFA literally believed then yeah it's

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.010

got<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.149> been<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> fantastic<00:00:36.870> season

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
got it it's been a fantastic season

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.350 
got it it's been a fantastic season
isn't<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.380> yeah<00:00:37.530> player<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.700> season<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.210> me

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
isn't it yeah player the season for me

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.260 
isn't it yeah player the season for me
was<00:00:39.690> Yaya<00:00:40.469> Toure<00:00:40.739> he<00:00:41.460> had<00:00:41.610> his<00:00:41.730> ups<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.120> downs

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
was Yaya Toure he had his ups and downs

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.810 
was Yaya Toure he had his ups and downs
bit<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:43.140> City<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.160> think<00:00:44.370> when<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> comes

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
bit like City but I think when it comes

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.869 
bit like City but I think when it comes
back<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.410> remembering<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> City<00:00:46.739> team<00:00:47.070> he

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
back to remembering the City team he

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.360 
back to remembering the City team he
will<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.300> iconic<00:00:48.780> figure<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:50.129> guy<00:00:50.309> who

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
will be the iconic figure the guy who

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.040 
will be the iconic figure the guy who
turned<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.239> sort<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.570> through<00:00:51.750> sheer

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
turned up and sort of through sheer

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.119 
turned up and sort of through sheer
power<00:00:52.969> walked<00:00:53.969> through<00:00:54.620> opposition<00:00:55.620> defences

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
power walked through opposition defences

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.840 
power walked through opposition defences
and<00:00:56.690> got<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.899> important<00:00:58.289> goals<00:00:58.850> probably

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
and got the important goals probably

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.060 
and got the important goals probably
boring<00:01:00.149> choice<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.469> defender

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
boring choice because it's a defender

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.390 
boring choice because it's a defender
and<00:01:02.809> but<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.019> Vincent<00:01:04.439> Kompany<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and but it's Vincent Kompany in the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.890 
and but it's Vincent Kompany in the
absence<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.909> manager<00:01:06.240> village<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
absence of a manager village from the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.080 
absence of a manager village from the
Manchester<00:01:07.110> United's<00:01:07.830> lineup<00:01:08.430> he<00:01:08.790> set<00:01:09.060> out

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
Manchester United's lineup he set out

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.080 
Manchester United's lineup he set out
his<00:01:09.330> stall<00:01:09.659> as<00:01:09.930> one<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.040> finest<00:01:11.580> defenders

his stall as one of the finest defenders

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.910

petulance of some other players he seems

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.539 
petulance of some other players he seems
like<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:25.200> really<00:01:25.619> nice<00:01:25.740> bloke<00:01:26.130> perhaps

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
like a really really nice bloke perhaps

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.120 
like a really really nice bloke perhaps
if<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.790> look<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.920> American<00:01:28.920> sense

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
if we look at this in the American sense

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.859 
if we look at this in the American sense
they<00:01:29.310> always<00:01:29.549> talk<00:01:29.700> about<00:01:29.729> MVPs<00:01:30.540> most

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
they always talk about MVPs most

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.749 
they always talk about MVPs most
valuable<00:01:31.320> players<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.860> think<00:01:32.220> there's<00:01:32.670> a

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
valuable players I think there's a

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.999 
valuable players I think there's a
possibly<00:01:33.689> no<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.140> player<00:01:34.470> who<00:01:34.680> I'd<00:01:34.770> single

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
possibly no one player who I'd single

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.590 
possibly no one player who I'd single
out<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.310> having<00:01:35.549> been<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.880> important<00:01:36.390> to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
out as having been that important to

out as having been that important to
their<00:01:36.780> side<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.439> van<00:01:37.619> Persie<00:01:38.100> remember<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
their side as van Persie remember it

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.889 
their side as van Persie remember it
back<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.799> October<00:01:40.799> 2009<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.610> was<00:01:41.729> when<00:01:42.060> David

I'm<00:01:47.640> doing<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.119> because<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.360> think

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
really well but with Rodgers you really

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.710 
really well but with Rodgers you really
get<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> sense<00:03:02.460> that<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:02.940> his<00:03:03.150> project

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
scoring records remarkable I think it's

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.890

13<00:03:25.890> goals<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.430> 14<00:03:26.640> games<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.480> some

absolutely incredible goals in there as

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.070 
absolutely incredible goals in there as
well<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.910> think<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.270> was<00:03:30.390> always<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> player<00:03:31.050> that

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
well I think it was always a player that

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.930 
well I think it was always a player that
was<00:03:31.650> tailor-made<00:03:32.010> for<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.459> Premier<00:03:32.820> League

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
was tailor-made for the Premier League

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.210 
was tailor-made for the Premier League
because<00:03:33.300> of<00:03:33.360> his<00:03:33.630> size<00:03:34.290> his<00:03:34.620> power<00:03:34.980> his

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
because of his size his power his

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.720 
because of his size his power his
particular<00:03:35.790> skill<00:03:36.209> set<00:03:36.470> but<00:03:37.470> he<00:03:37.950> still<00:03:38.280> you

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
particular skill set but he still you

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.490 
particular skill set but he still you
know<00:03:38.850> managed<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.390> bring<00:03:39.600> all<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:40.260> bear

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
know managed to bring all that to bear

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.920 
know managed to bring all that to bear
which<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.250> no<00:03:41.700> mean<00:03:41.850> feat<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.420> he<00:03:42.540> didn't<00:03:42.810> take

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
which is no mean feat and he didn't take

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.290 
which is no mean feat and he didn't take
any<00:03:43.170> time<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.500> adjust<00:03:43.980> at<00:03:44.340> all<00:03:44.520> there's<00:03:45.239> been

plenty of players who haven't produced

blimey<00:03:52.620> there's<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.250> many<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.700> choose<00:03:53.730> from

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
that it's difficult to make a choice

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.880 
that it's difficult to make a choice
that's<00:03:57.480> just<00:03:58.020> when<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.260> look<00:03:58.410> at<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.650> players

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
that's just when you look at the players

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.949 
that's just when you look at the players
who<00:03:59.100> signed<00:03:59.370> for<00:03:59.459> Liverpool<00:03:59.730> yeah<00:04:00.600> Jordan

Stewart<00:04:05.160> Downing<00:04:05.370> would<00:04:06.060> have<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.360> go<00:04:06.480> down

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
Stewart Downing would have to go down

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.510 
Stewart Downing would have to go down
with<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.959> flop<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.470> season<00:04:07.920> he's

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
with the flop of the season he's

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.240 
with the flop of the season he's
contributed<00:04:09.330> some<00:04:09.660> total<00:04:10.110> of<00:04:10.290> no<00:04:10.620> goals<00:04:10.950> and

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
contributed some total of no goals and

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.540 
contributed some total of no goals and
no<00:04:11.400> cysts<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.350> I<00:04:13.350> think<00:04:13.770> the<00:04:13.920> only<00:04:14.160> record

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
no cysts and I think the only record

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.460 
no cysts and I think the only record
he's<00:04:14.730> broken<00:04:15.150> as<00:04:15.270> a<00:04:15.300> Liverpool<00:04:15.750> player<00:04:16.020> is

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
he's broken as a Liverpool player is

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.849 
he's broken as a Liverpool player is
that<00:04:17.220> he<00:04:17.459> became<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.270> first<00:04:18.570> player<00:04:19.410> in<00:04:19.440> many

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
that he became the first player in many

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.979 
that he became the first player in many
many<00:04:20.070> years<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:21.120> miss<00:04:21.299> three<00:04:21.600> consecutive

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
many years to miss three consecutive

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.640 
many years to miss three consecutive
penalties<00:04:22.560> in<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.510> Premier<00:04:24.510> League<00:04:24.620> slop<00:04:25.620> of

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
penalties in the Premier League slop of

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.200 
penalties in the Premier League slop of
the<00:04:25.830> season<00:04:26.160> could<00:04:26.340> be<00:04:26.370> probably<00:04:26.760> any<00:04:26.970> one<00:04:27.180> of

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
the season could be probably any one of

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.969 
the season could be probably any one of
Ashley<00:04:27.690> young

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
Ashley young

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.350 
Ashley young
various<00:04:28.979> escapades<00:04:29.639> into<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:29.970> penalty<00:04:30.330> area

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
various escapades into the penalty area

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.439 
various escapades into the penalty area
I<00:04:30.720> think<00:04:30.840> he<00:04:31.169> was<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.590> player<00:04:32.240> supposed<00:04:33.240> to

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
I think he was the player supposed to

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.680 
I think he was the player supposed to
really<00:04:33.750> change<00:04:34.699> United<00:04:35.699> make<00:04:36.419> them<00:04:36.569> more

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
really change United make them more

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.600 
really change United make them more
flexible<00:04:37.229> make<00:04:37.500> them<00:04:37.650> less<00:04:37.800> predictable<00:04:38.400> he

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
flexible make them less predictable he

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.980 
flexible make them less predictable he
was<00:04:38.789> you<00:04:39.090> know<00:04:39.180> playing<00:04:39.449> in<00:04:39.599> a<00:04:39.660> number<00:04:39.930> of

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
positions and he had this early momentum

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.650 
positions and he had this early momentum
and<00:04:42.389> he<00:04:42.780> felt<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:43.319> you<00:04:43.410> know<00:04:43.530> he<00:04:43.979> really<00:04:44.660> was

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
and he felt that you know he really was

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.510 
and he felt that you know he really was

the<00:06:46.890> score<00:06:47.430> line<00:06:47.640> was<00:06:47.820> so<00:06:48.000> significant<00:06:48.930> come

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
the score line was so significant come

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.990 
the score line was so significant come
the<00:06:49.470> end<00:06:49.530> of<00:06:49.680> the<00:06:49.770> season<00:06:50.160> the<00:06:50.760> goal

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
the end of the season the goal

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.420 
the end of the season the goal
difference<00:06:51.480> element<00:06:52.440> of<00:06:52.500> that<00:06:52.650> win<00:06:52.860> for<00:06:53.250> City

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
difference element of that win for City

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.430 
difference element of that win for City
at<00:06:53.580> Old<00:06:53.700> Trafford<00:06:53.850> was<00:06:54.600> huge<00:06:54.900> in<00:06:55.110> the<00:06:55.230> in<00:06:55.350> the

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
at Old Trafford was huge in the in the

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.390 
at Old Trafford was huge in the in the
grand<00:06:55.620> scheme<00:06:55.770> of<00:06:55.830> things<00:06:56.040> and<00:06:56.100> it<00:06:56.190> would<00:06:56.310> have

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
grand scheme of things and it would have

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.890 
grand scheme of things and it would have
made<00:06:56.520> for<00:06:56.550> a<00:06:56.700> very<00:06:56.880> different<00:06:57.240> run<00:06:57.390> I<00:06:57.540> think<00:06:57.750> if

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
made for a very different run I think if

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.170 
made for a very different run I think if
that<00:06:57.930> hadn't<00:06:58.290> happened<00:06:58.410> even<00:06:59.190> though<00:06:59.340> you

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
that hadn't happened even though you

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.330 
that hadn't happened even though you
know<00:07:00.300> a<00:07:00.900> flurry<00:07:01.320> of<00:07:01.410> late<00:07:01.650> goals<00:07:01.920> might<00:07:02.190> have

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
know a flurry of late goals might have

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.680 
know a flurry of late goals might have
skewed<00:07:02.580> the<00:07:02.760> result<00:07:03.060> a<00:07:03.180> little<00:07:03.420> bit<00:07:03.540> I<00:07:03.630> think

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
skewed the result a little bit I think

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.780 
skewed the result a little bit I think
it<00:07:03.900> also<00:07:04.050> showed<00:07:04.380> just<00:07:04.590> how<00:07:04.860> much<00:07:05.520> of<00:07:05.700> a

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:05.790 
it also showed just how much of a

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.900 
it also showed just how much of a
mountain<00:07:06.300> United<00:07:06.840> will<00:07:06.960> have<00:07:07.110> to<00:07:07.260> climb<00:07:07.910> is

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 
mountain United will have to climb is

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.270 
mountain United will have to climb is
testament<00:07:09.420> to<00:07:09.510> them<00:07:09.690> that<00:07:09.870> in<00:07:10.020> nearly<00:07:10.440> you

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
testament to them that in nearly you

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.830 
testament to them that in nearly you
know<00:07:11.400> managed<00:07:11.700> to<00:07:11.940> reel<00:07:12.120> them<00:07:12.330> in<00:07:12.420> in<00:07:12.600> the<00:07:12.660> end

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
know managed to reel them in in the end

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.370 
know managed to reel them in in the end
but<00:07:13.140> that<00:07:14.130> game<00:07:14.540> really<00:07:15.540> summed<00:07:15.810> up<00:07:15.930> city<00:07:16.200> at

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 
but that game really summed up city at

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.520 
but that game really summed up city at
its<00:07:16.410> best<00:07:16.890> and<00:07:17.130> United<00:07:17.640> at<00:07:17.910> its<00:07:18.120> worst<00:07:18.390> it<00:07:18.870> was

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.530 
its best and United at its worst it was

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.100 
its best and United at its worst it was
a<00:07:19.590> great<00:07:19.860> season<00:07:20.160> at<00:07:20.520> a<00:07:20.550> fantastic<00:07:20.850> finish<00:07:21.450> but

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.110 
a great season at a fantastic finish but

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.070 
a great season at a fantastic finish but
personally<00:07:22.680> I'm<00:07:23.460> not<00:07:23.520> sure<00:07:24.330> I<00:07:24.570> always<00:07:24.810> bought

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 
personally I'm not sure I always bought

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.170 
personally I'm not sure I always bought
into<00:07:25.320> this<00:07:25.590> best<00:07:25.890> season<00:07:26.400> ever<00:07:26.520> narrative

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 
into this best season ever narrative

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.970 
into this best season ever narrative
it'd<00:07:27.450> be<00:07:27.540> kind<00:07:27.750> of<00:07:27.810> became<00:07:28.110> the<00:07:28.320> accepted<00:07:28.770> view

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:28.980 
it'd be kind of became the accepted view

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.350 
it'd be kind of became the accepted view
I<00:07:29.040> think<00:07:29.370> was<00:07:29.520> a<00:07:29.550> little<00:07:29.610> bit<00:07:29.790> marketing

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 
I think was a little bit marketing

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.070 
I think was a little bit marketing
