you<00:02:28.130> can<00:02:28.280> wrap<00:02:28.460> that<00:02:28.610> around<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.330> line<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.630> up

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
you can wrap that around and line it up

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.380 
you can wrap that around and line it up
on<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.410> opposite<00:02:30.710> side<00:02:30.950> then<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.000> get<00:02:32.150> nice

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
on the opposite side then you get nice

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.510 
on the opposite side then you get nice
square<00:02:33.380> lon<00:02:35.350> now<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:36.380> mean<00:02:36.590> your<00:02:36.740> cuts<00:02:37.250> gonna<00:02:37.460> be

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
square lon now I mean your cuts gonna be

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.100 
square lon now I mean your cuts gonna be
squared<00:02:37.850> because<00:02:38.090> it's<00:02:38.300> been<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:38.720> get<00:02:38.990> your

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
squared because it's been so get your

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.740 
squared because it's been so get your
behind<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:39.880> put<00:02:40.880> next<00:02:41.030> here<00:02:41.240> so<00:02:41.360> another<00:02:41.510> piece

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
behind so put next here so another piece

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.780 
behind so put next here so another piece
i'm<00:02:41.870> using<00:02:42.200> go<00:02:42.860> ahead<00:02:43.130> just<00:02:43.250> cut<00:02:43.430> again<00:02:43.640> right

the inside Jack they're here now I

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.620 
the inside Jack they're here now I
prefer<00:03:31.430> actually<00:03:31.760> making<00:03:31.910> plans<00:03:32.239> with<00:03:32.330> flux

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
prefer actually making plans with flux

core<00:03:32.870> because<00:03:33.799> you<00:03:33.890> have<00:03:33.980> good<00:03:34.130> control<00:03:34.400> and

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
core because you have good control and

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.370

it keeps the puddle never going in and
you're<00:03:37.220> going<00:03:37.370> from<00:03:37.610> them<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:38.330> gives<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.630> an

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
you're going from them it gives you an

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.180 
you're going from them it gives you an
ice<00:03:38.780> buildup<00:03:39.140> on<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.319> outside<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.950> can

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
ice buildup on the outside that you can

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
grind down your TIG welding will

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.990 
grind down your TIG welding will
actually<00:03:42.380> undercut<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:42.830> lot<00:03:43.130> and<00:03:43.370> get<00:03:43.580> convex

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
actually undercut a lot and get convex

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.750 
actually undercut a lot and get convex
well<00:03:44.349> then<00:03:45.349> you<00:03:45.500> tend<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.739> burn<00:03:46.010> out<00:03:46.069> you're

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
well then you tend to burn out you're

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.820 
well then you tend to burn out you're
going<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:47.150> slow<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:48.200> love<00:03:48.410> is<00:03:48.440> just

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
going so slow and love is just

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.780 
going so slow and love is just
eyeballing<00:03:49.340> I<00:03:51.130> could<00:03:52.130> break<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:52.430> down<00:03:52.459> to

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
eyeballing I could break it down to

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.160 
eyeballing I could break it down to
measuring<00:03:53.180> stuff<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:53.630> how<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.780> break<00:03:53.989> down

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
measuring stuff and how you break down

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.370 
measuring stuff and how you break down
radius

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.410 

right<00:03:59.380> so<00:03:59.530> we're<00:03:59.650> going<00:03:59.890> cut<00:04:00.160> this<00:04:00.280> one<00:04:00.490> now<00:04:01.390> I

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
right so we're going cut this one now I

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.500 
right so we're going cut this one now I
want<00:04:01.780> this<00:04:01.959> to<00:04:02.110> come<00:04:02.290> back<00:04:03.040> like<00:04:03.280> that<00:04:03.610> thing

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
want this to come back like that thing

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.300 
want this to come back like that thing
looks<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.930> best<00:04:05.110> so<00:04:05.650> we're<00:04:05.830> following<00:04:06.220> the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
looks the best so we're following the

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.500 
looks the best so we're following the
line<00:04:06.550> of<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.880> backbone<00:04:07.870> backwards<00:04:09.510> I'll

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
line of the backbone backwards I'll

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:18.999 
line of the backbone backwards I'll
bring<00:04:10.690> those<00:04:10.840> two<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.170> match<00:04:11.319> each<00:04:11.350> other

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
you put cut mall on my bands you put you

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.439 
you put cut mall on my bands you put you
a<00:04:24.690> straight<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.199> still<00:04:25.470> matches<00:04:25.770> flushed<00:04:29.449> to

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
a straight and still matches flushed to

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:38.689 
a straight and still matches flushed to
tax<00:04:36.530> ok<00:04:37.530> now<00:04:37.860> we're<00:04:37.979> going<00:04:38.009> to<00:04:38.130> go<00:04:38.190> ahead<00:04:38.280> got

this<00:04:38.820> one<00:04:38.880> in<00:04:39.060> our<00:04:39.150> done<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:40.110> now<00:04:40.289> we<00:04:40.350> can<00:04:40.470> shape

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
this one in our done so now we can shape

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.830 
this one in our done so now we can shape
this<00:04:40.889> head<00:04:42.590> 3<00:04:43.590> inch<00:04:43.770> radius<00:04:44.210> I'll<00:04:45.210> get<00:04:45.539> this

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
this head 3 inch radius I'll get this

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.719
