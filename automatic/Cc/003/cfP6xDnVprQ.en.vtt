some cool places haven't been camping in
a<00:00:18.060> long<00:00:18.210> time<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.080> allowed<00:00:19.350> us<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.529> get

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
a long time so this is allowed us to get

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.970 
a long time so this is allowed us to get
out<00:00:19.890> there<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.430> relative<00:00:21.330> comfort<00:00:21.710> but<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:22.859> do

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
out there in relative comfort but we do

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.519 
out there in relative comfort but we do
have<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.189> lot<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.460> issues<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:25.170> trailer

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
itself and it seems very difficult to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.169 
itself and it seems very difficult to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
we actually noticed some of these issue

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.660 
we actually noticed some of these issue
they're<00:00:51.570> written<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> sales<00:00:52.260> contract

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
but some of the panels are clearly

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.830 
but some of the panels are clearly
misaligned<00:00:59.219> that<00:01:00.000> may<00:01:00.180> even<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.510> water

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
misaligned that may even be water

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.959 
misaligned that may even be water
damaged<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.190> looks<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.699> tried<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
damaged and it looks like they tried to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.450 
damaged and it looks like they tried to
patch<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.710> those<00:01:04.710> are<00:01:04.890> its<00:01:05.540> patching<00:01:06.540> material

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
patch it those are its patching material

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.490 
patch it those are its patching material
well<00:01:08.460> that's<00:01:08.930> that's<00:01:09.930> got<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.260> be<00:01:10.350> replaced

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
well that's that's got to be replaced

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.100 
well that's that's got to be replaced
that's<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.400> not<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.939> brand<00:01:12.689> new<00:01:12.840> trailer

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that's really not the brand new trailer

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.929 
that's really not the brand new trailer
shouldn't<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.890> there's<00:01:14.729> some

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939

chips<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> things<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:16.159> noticed<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.790> they

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
chips and things we noticed so they

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.570 
chips and things we noticed so they
really<00:01:18.299> didn't<00:01:18.570> take<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:18.930> time<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.979> care

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
really didn't take good time or care

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.560 
really didn't take good time or care
when<00:01:20.790> they<00:01:20.880> put<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.150> together

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
when they put it together

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.300 
when they put it together

laminate between the the stove and the
sink<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:31.350> looks<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.950> they<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.159> didn't<00:01:32.700> get

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
sink it looks like they just didn't get

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.490 
sink it looks like they just didn't get
the<00:01:33.090> sealant<00:01:33.600> down<00:01:33.810> properly

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
them even though I guess that's the way

them even though I guess that's the way
it<00:03:06.520> works<00:03:06.730> but<00:03:07.110> they<00:03:08.110> offered<00:03:08.470> originally<00:03:08.950> to

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070
