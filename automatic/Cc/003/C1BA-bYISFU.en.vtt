nice blooms beautiful plant well I
always<00:00:21.029> think<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.949> hibiscus<00:00:22.949> are<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.939> best

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
always think that hibiscus are the best

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.759 
always think that hibiscus are the best
our<00:00:24.810> best<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.550> container<00:00:27.060> situation<00:00:27.960> so

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
that you can move them around back and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.870 
that you can move them around back and
forth<00:00:31.289> here<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:31.949> there<00:00:32.279> change<00:00:32.700> your

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
doing a container plant you always want

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700 
doing a container plant you always want
to<00:01:32.759> use<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.970> potting<00:01:33.540> soil<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
to use a potting soil because the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.980 
to use a potting soil because the
potting<00:01:35.220> soil<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.759> designed<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.780> that

potting soil is designed for that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.899 
potting soil is designed for that
container<00:01:39.110> once<00:01:40.110> you've<00:01:40.290> done<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.759> keep<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
container once you've done that keep the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
soil stirred up ever so often because

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.420 
soil stirred up ever so often because
with<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.899> watering<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.799> forth<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.280> will

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
with you watering and so forth it will

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.520 
with you watering and so forth it will
tend<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.880> pack<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.509> soil<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.200> want<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
tend to pack the soil so you want to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.300 
tend to pack the soil so you want to
keep<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.890> soil<00:01:50.130> loose<00:01:51.860> once<00:01:52.860> or<00:01:53.040> twice<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
keep the soil loose once or twice a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.230 
keep the soil loose once or twice a
month<00:01:53.520> feed<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.439> a<00:01:55.439> good<00:01:55.950> compost<00:01:56.490> tea<00:01:56.759> once<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
month feed it a good compost tea once a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.950 
month feed it a good compost tea once a
month<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.659> great<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.380> plant<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.960> then

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
month is great for this plant and then

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.740 
month is great for this plant and then
be<00:02:01.799> sure<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.340> over<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> winter<00:02:03.090> they're<00:02:03.540> in
