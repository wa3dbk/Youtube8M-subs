00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
system the way they've done this is

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.280 
system the way they've done this is
they've<00:01:18.430> done<00:01:18.460> away<00:01:18.760> a<00:01:18.790> lot<00:01:19.000> of<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.290> scenes

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.930 
they've done away a lot of the scenes
and<00:01:20.680> they've<00:01:20.800> created<00:01:21.160> just<00:01:21.490> some<00:01:21.700> simple

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
and they've created just some simple

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.390 
and they've created just some simple
welds<00:01:22.540> what<00:01:23.050> this<00:01:23.230> allows<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:23.830> to<00:01:24.010> have<00:01:24.130> a<00:01:24.160> very

this<00:01:37.180> tube<00:01:37.420> drains<00:01:37.810> really<00:01:38.350> really<00:01:38.560> well

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
this tube drains really really well

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.190 
this tube drains really really well
pushes<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.550> moisture<00:01:39.940> act<00:01:40.180> also<00:01:40.720> doesn't

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
pushes the moisture act also doesn't
