00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.959
 unique in its natural 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.160
 diversity Karakansky ridge 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.770
 continues to amaze 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.019
 unusual stone discovered on saturday 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.969
 miner coal mine Belovsky 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.130
 area while working at the foot of the ridge 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.529
 video with a mysterious find on the form 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.119
 saucer-like weekend 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.430
 appeared on social networks and immediately 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.210
 caused a lot of questions and assumptions 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.830
 words diane sinking 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.240
 if not for the miniature sizes then 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.519
 this item has been dug 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.960
 from the depths one could think of a cut and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.030
 in drunk landed ufo 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.430
 However, this hypothesis does or themselves 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.649
 coal miners artifact terrestrial origin 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.340
 Arthur Presnyakov who shot and laid out 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.530
 video to network 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.390
 for many years working on the cut has seen and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.860
 mammoth tusks their bones which 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.340
 had to be found in the breed 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.350
 but such a find is 1 this one for the fight already 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.780
 exploded once the whole breed exploded 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.870
 small pieces but this drive stayed 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.059
 unharmed and I think that it is a disk much 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.489
 even older than here mammoth tusks that 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.800
 found to know that what it was 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.100
 created much earlier than you were taught 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.290
 mounts and what i think is civilization 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.200
 ours is much older than in ours 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.119
 stories talk about not geologist cuts 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.280
 catherine's grains sure reverse 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.780
 natural stone 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.640
 formed as a result of complex 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.189
 geological processes of the crust 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.930
 between young rocks or loams and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.970
 were ancient indigenous 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.390
 mysterious much like a stone 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.460
 opti salt is also not accidental 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.490
 the place is near tectonic 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.670
 violations we have all the breed especially 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.829
 sedimentary formed by water 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.579
 solutions she on system of cracks 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.619
 the cavity is received and by 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.840
 swirls here explains this shape 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.670
 unique find is a special subject 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.500
 the interest of the miners while we were here 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.009
 several people came up and did 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.890
 links 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.290
 however, tomorrow is a stone plate 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.630
 taken away final evaluation must give 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.729
 scientists regional staff 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.040
 local history museum unusual artifact 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.050
 ready to study history knows quite a few 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.000
 amazing at 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.560
 examples when on coal mines and on 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.900
 construction sites were found 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.930
 bones fossil animal foundations of our 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.390
 the museum since 1960 has survived 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.430
 already received more than a hundred such exhibits 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.620
 for example very recently in the summer of this 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.430
 years in Kemerovo on one of the building 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.520
 sites 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.470
 bones of ancient bones were also found 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.470
 animals and now we have them on 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.940
 restoration of finding information from 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.400
 Belovsky District to us no not 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.650
 one thing or another obviously did 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.480
 Karakan ridge opened another 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.820
 mystery how many mysteries keeps 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.550
 unique natures seem to be the answer yet 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.470
 to find diana simkin anastasia 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.970
 Pikulin them or fomin Alexander Piskunov 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.970
 keep Kuzbass Belovsky district
