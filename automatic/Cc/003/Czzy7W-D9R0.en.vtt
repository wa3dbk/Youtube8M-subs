00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
you just jump behind them continue to

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.750 
you just jump behind them continue to
kick<00:02:45.439> the<00:02:45.620> shit<00:02:45.890> out<00:02:46.069> of<00:02:46.099> them<00:02:46.310> really

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.349 
you also can't pull them towards you
evil<00:02:49.129> legacy<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.700> go<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.090> pull<00:02:50.269> yourself

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
evil legacy you go you pull yourself

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.899 
evil legacy you go you pull yourself
towards<00:02:50.989> them<00:02:51.170> but<00:02:52.040> putting<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.370> grab<00:02:52.609> on<00:02:52.760> them

towards them but putting a grab on them
is<00:02:53.030> also<00:02:53.180> very<00:02:53.540> satisfying<00:02:53.750> because<00:02:54.170> their

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
is also very satisfying because their

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.470 
is also very satisfying because their
last<00:02:55.129> is<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.370> somehow<00:02:55.609> rocket-powered<00:02:56.239> or

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
last is a somehow rocket-powered or

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.729 
last is a somehow rocket-powered or
something<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.079> you<00:02:57.140> can<00:02:57.230> use<00:02:57.349> it<00:02:57.470> against

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
something but you can use it against

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.520 
something but you can use it against
them<00:02:57.890> tada<00:02:59.980> sounds<00:03:01.000> two<00:03:02.109> guys<00:03:03.109> were<00:03:03.230> just<00:03:03.349> kill

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
but now to fight two at once they have

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.710 
but now to fight two at once they have
to<00:03:07.579> get<00:03:07.849> to<00:03:07.940> fight<00:03:08.090> use<00:03:08.209> a<00:03:08.299> lot<00:03:08.420> more<00:03:08.599> as<00:03:08.690> well
