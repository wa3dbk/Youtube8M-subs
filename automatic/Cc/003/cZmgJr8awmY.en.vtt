00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.600
 hello girls today I bring you a video of 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.820
 different a different site and it's a 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.400
 returned video I'll teach you to 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.840
 do a simple root trick 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.760
 I hope that you appear because the light in 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.620
 I have this case backwards 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.390
 It is a simple root trend 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.940
 for day to day so you can 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.020
 use it to go daily hairstyles 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.930
 but at the same time and informal 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.790
 so let's start the root the braid 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.230
 root is very simple to do I'm going 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.500
 to teach step by step and nothing 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.500
 let's start 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.510
 and the first thing we're going to do is catch 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.660
 three waters in this case I do not want that 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.600
 the hair is very combed where 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.980
 we will choose one end of each side and another 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.190
 from above but without any motor 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.399
 We spent over and above 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.129
 we take control out in a manner of 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.790
 drug that would be this in this case and you 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.790
 we went up 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.780
 next on the side we take 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.890
 entrance and we came to the one from the whole pass and 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.890
 we passed him over 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.920
 then the same the same the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.870
 corpse of now we take another stroke 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.370
 we live and we go inside 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.780
 next the same same thing 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.890
 we divide the best 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.380
 we grabbed it and passed it over 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.470
 leaving always loose I was tossed aside 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.020
 and perform to the other degree we take another 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.000
 cape 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.910
 and we passed him over the beautiful 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.740
 the trick is always always the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:57.630
 same is dedicated we take another 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.630
 and we passed him as an asset 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.110
 the same we take another 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.450
 and we passed him over 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.810
 there must be careful that it is 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.100
 combed her asked for our prayers and I 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.680
 I got it is a tousled braid 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:20.680
 we take another message 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.680
 we unite and we pass him up 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.370
 finally we take the same lock or 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.520
 trying to design the measure towards the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.400
 side that leads for example me towards the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.280
 left and we throw to that side what 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.290
 we went over and we continue 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.420
 doing nothing more 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.569
 we went through here 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.300
 and that's it 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.440
 we passed here 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.600
 and we continue to do the 30th a corporal for 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.020
 over another out over local or 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:00.030
 above another above another one by 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:04.050
 above and above another above another 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.860
 over like that until we leave in 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.400
 elaborated so that we can 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.460
 what would this be 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.140
 in this case 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.140
 I see some way 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.720
 we continue treating the syndrome you can 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.720
 see well 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.600
 until there is a fixed rubber that is not 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.319
 for nothing and what we do in this case 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.749
 is to put your fingers and pull the braid 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.160
 30th nail we jump hair where 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:42.980
 we want 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.650
 it would be like that we can move it we can 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.930
 open to dedicate the spinal 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.620
 and this is what it would be like to make a press 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.140
 of normal and current root for a day 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.849
 of newspaper and viceroy gives the only 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.159
 advice I give you is that the hair before 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.620
 of stretching them we grind a little bit with 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.670
 the iron that is not completely stiff 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:10.230
 so that stiff hairs from the 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:12.060
 of 30 degrees and serious results I hope 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.040
 which is appreciable because it is difficult 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.040
 talk like that, believe me 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.900
 Oh 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.169
 and we would get like this disheveled 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.419
 but I still hope you liked it 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.600
 that is simple and practice it 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.880
 a lot because it's so easy 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.880
 see you in the next goodbye
