00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 by favoritism and this is a 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.210
 special video 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.770
 I do not want you following my path that 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.160
 do you like r 4 videos? 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.830
 and it rained in the bailique estevÃ£o lima 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.719
 He spoke here because I was the guy who 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.029
 He then asked to say that it was him. 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.490
 who asked for the first time a video of him 4 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.410
 and such is now has a parameter of one 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.670
 music that nobody could put 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.590
 correct configuration 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.140
 already tried to do but could not 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.170
 it was music, I want more of the crime of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.890
 that she is so I did not know the song 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.090
 I was promoted and I so I think 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.420
 there is no secret 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.629
 I'll show you what I 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.910
 I configured as I set that's it 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.379
 depends a lot on the footprint and how you 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.170
 will execute this 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.149
 but I think I got to a good point 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.750
 near the expensive one would then be more 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.750
 least this 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.760
 I did not take the music right but it's more or 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.760
 less here 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.500
 so usually music with that type 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.890
 law sucks because treat cheats 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.890
 such 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:47.430
 here I'm to drive the 808 I stayed 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.920
 thinking I do video I just step 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.450
 setup stay there after i thought 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.369
 pole may be that more people are 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.100
 It matters the law sometimes you do not 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.740
 Interest is the music itself but the delay 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.900
 music is very cool its a one of a kind 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.320
 useful very very nice and such then 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.060
 maybe it's worth everyone then I 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.200
 I'll show you how it happened. 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:16.680
 configuration here tal delhi 4 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:21.030
 there in the first pot was the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.640
 in the second potentiometer 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.150
 The figure 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.579
 if you pick up the manual there will be the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.810
 but I'll show you right that the 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:37.150
 position that okay for you not to lose 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.730
 the pace of law when it comes time for you 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.340
 irregular the team the team works as it is 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.829
 for you to regulate the figure type of rhythm 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.459
 then the location of the rhythm figure is this 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.250
 on here 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:52.209
 here is the link bit twitter or twitter 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.700
 that control the modulation of siderlei eu 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.140
 I liked him at that point actually 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.180
 my point would be a little higher 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.250
 but as the guy does not use much then 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.909
 It stayed at about that point there. 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.799
 mix 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.359
 I also need a little more stress 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.940
 can stay a little less 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.799
 This will depend on your taste as well. 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.870
 if you have the weakest footprint your 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.659
 mix here you have the strongest footprint 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.670
 this may be a little bit back in my 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.870
 If I would go back for a little bit then 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.639
 that's the time 1212 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.970
 This is the time you will hit the foot 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:31.450
 To stay in time of the song then it is 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:35.560
 This is in the beginning I was doing with the 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.120
 club should turn the 808 on and off 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.079
 this is nothing 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.299
 7 is light eleven only anp simulation 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.959
 even here until I was looking 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.959
 So 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.609
 So that's thanks for watching. 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.069
 Thank you for following the channel because 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:57.120
 I can help I'll help you 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.120
 it was worth the iran fact
