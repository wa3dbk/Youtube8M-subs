kusudama<00:00:08.660> this<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.050> 30-piece<00:00:11.179> kusudama<00:00:12.179> and

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
kusudama this is a 30-piece kusudama and

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.320 
kusudama this is a 30-piece kusudama and
in<00:00:13.830> my<00:00:14.099> opinion<00:00:14.630> don't<00:00:15.630> do<00:00:15.839> less<00:00:16.139> than<00:00:16.500> 30

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
in my opinion don't do less than 30

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.720 
in my opinion don't do less than 30
pieces<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.510> paper<00:00:18.900> because<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.619> won't<00:00:19.980> look<00:00:20.310> as

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
pieces of paper because it won't look as

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.410 
pieces of paper because it won't look as
well<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:22.020> pretty<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.340> mean<00:00:24.109> so<00:00:25.109> you'll<00:00:25.650> need<00:00:25.890> 30

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
well as pretty I mean so you'll need 30

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.450 
well as pretty I mean so you'll need 30
square<00:00:27.420> sheets<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.109> paper<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.769> said<00:00:29.039> glue

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
square sheets of paper like I said glue

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.540 
square sheets of paper like I said glue
and<00:00:29.730> your<00:00:30.390> hands<00:00:30.960> because<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.009> good<00:00:32.189> idea

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
and your hands because it's a good idea

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.620 
and your hands because it's a good idea
to<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.880> your<00:00:33.090> hands<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.570> guess<00:00:34.489> also<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.570> you

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
to have your hands I guess also so you

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.319 
to have your hands I guess also so you
can<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.670> model<00:00:39.620> as<00:00:40.620> I'm<00:00:40.920> an

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
can see here the model as I'm an

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:49.610 
can see here the model as I'm an
creepily<00:00:42.329> showing<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:45.530> it's<00:00:46.700> spiked<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.620> I

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
creepily showing you it's spiked and I

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.950 
creepily showing you it's spiked and I
believe<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> variation<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
believe this is a variation of the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
believe this is a variation of the
southern<00:00:52.440> star<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.039> don't<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.370> how

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
southern star so if you don't know how

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.479 
southern star so if you don't know how
to<00:00:56.640> start<00:00:57.059> southern<00:00:57.690> stories<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.829> link<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.250> on

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to start southern stories the link is on

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.890 
to start southern stories the link is on
the<00:01:00.359> sides<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:02.899> this<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.140> also<00:01:04.379> good<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
the sides and this is also good for the

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.109 
the sides and this is also good for the
Christmas<00:01:06.900> tree<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.229> guess<00:01:07.700> because<00:01:08.700> it's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
Christmas tree I guess because it's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.840 
Christmas tree I guess because it's
shiny<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.780> used<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.350> shiny<00:01:10.619> paper<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
shiny I used the shiny paper this is the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.679 
shiny I used the shiny paper this is the
final<00:01:12.479> model<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.500> will<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:14.040> saying

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
final model like I will be saying

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:21.320 
final model like I will be saying
forward<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.900> criswell<00:01:19.549> photo<00:01:20.549> bleeding<00:01:21.210> in

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
forward a criswell photo bleeding in

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:31.580 
forward a criswell photo bleeding in
half<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:27.110> start<00:01:28.110> by<00:01:28.909> folding<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:31.290> flaps

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
half and start by folding the flaps

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.160 
half and start by folding the flaps
inwards<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:33.540> V<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.409> shape<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.579> PS<00:01:35.970> v<00:01:36.930> I

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
inwards like a V in shape of a PS v I

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.170 
inwards like a V in shape of a PS v I
mean

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:52.230 

do<00:01:43.180> as<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.540> do

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.040 

and<00:01:53.240> do<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.380> same<00:01:54.550> 40<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.940> down<00:01:56.150> part<00:01:56.510> and<00:01:56.780> do

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
and do the same 40 the down part and do

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:24.880 
and do the same 40 the down part and do
the<00:01:57.200> same<00:01:57.409> for<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.770> other<00:01:57.920> part

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:45.759 

now<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:27.080> mount<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.620> fold<00:02:27.860> in<00:02:28.010> half

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.369 

now<00:02:46.769> fold<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.670> tips<00:02:47.940> inwards

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
now fold the tips inwards

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
now you can see that the tips go along

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.740 
now you can see that the tips go along
the<00:02:52.620> lines<00:02:53.420> until<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.599> middle<00:02:55.069> C<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:57.420> do<00:02:57.599> the

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the lines until the middle C so do the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:14.229 
the lines until the middle C so do the
same<00:03:06.290> now<00:03:07.489> turn<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:10.700> can<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.819> see<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.959> line

same now turn and can you see the line

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:21.190 
same now turn and can you see the line
goes<00:03:15.239> across<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.290> other<00:03:17.660> line<00:03:18.660> like<00:03:19.290> this

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
goes across to the other line like this

picture
now<00:03:27.450> fold<00:03:27.840> inwards<00:03:31.220> okay<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.879> just<00:03:32.909> repeat

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
now fold inwards okay so just repeat

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:41.539 
now fold inwards okay so just repeat
after<00:03:34.109> me<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:40.049> remember<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.980> crease<00:03:41.250> well

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
after me and remember to crease well

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.259 
after me and remember to crease well
like<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.970> said<00:03:42.030> before<00:03:42.269> because<00:03:43.079> um<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:45.090> will

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
like I said before because um you will

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.809 
like I said before because um you will
have<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.659> glue<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:48.450> will<00:03:48.720> have<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.470> be

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
have to glue it so it will have to be

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.819 
have to glue it so it will have to be
really<00:03:50.819> well<00:03:51.389> creased<00:03:54.079> I'm<00:03:55.079> an<00:03:55.230> egg<00:03:55.380> go<00:03:55.560> into

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
really well creased I'm an egg go into

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.300 
really well creased I'm an egg go into
doing<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.190> really<00:03:57.060> defined<00:03:57.329> crease<00:03:57.870> now<00:03:58.310> so

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
doing a really defined crease now so

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.270 
doing a really defined crease now so
you're<00:03:59.519> going<00:03:59.849> to<00:04:00.030> hear<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.329> lot<00:04:00.569> of<00:04:00.859> crease<00:04:01.859> a

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
you're going to hear a lot of crease a

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.509 
you're going to hear a lot of crease a
lot<00:04:03.269> of<00:04:03.389> the<00:04:03.540> words<00:04:03.750> priests<00:04:04.410> crease<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.280> fold

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
lot of the words priests crease and fold

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.569 
lot of the words priests crease and fold
well<00:04:05.790> increase<00:04:06.799> because<00:04:07.799> it's<00:04:08.099> important

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
well increase because it's important

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.170 
well increase because it's important
known<00:04:08.760> in<00:04:08.970> origami<00:04:10.370> otherwise<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.549> would

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
known in origami otherwise you would

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.630 
known in origami otherwise you would
just<00:04:12.209> do

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
just do

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.850 
just do
a<00:04:14.730> bad<00:04:15.390> work<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:15.960> think<00:04:17.450> now<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:19.500> other<00:04:19.650> part<00:04:19.980> is

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
a bad work I think now the other part is

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.970 
a bad work I think now the other part is
it's<00:04:22.860> not<00:04:23.040> required<00:04:23.370> I'm<00:04:24.360> just<00:04:24.660> too<00:04:24.870> picky<00:04:25.080> and

let's make it our word of the day so do

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.820 
let's make it our word of the day so do
as<00:05:19.550> seen<00:05:20.030> in<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.330> photos<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:20.990> it's<00:05:21.169> it's<00:05:21.560> easy

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
as seen in the photos and it's it's easy

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.149 
as seen in the photos and it's it's easy
to<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.639> do<00:05:22.849> this<00:05:23.030> come<00:05:23.419> on<00:05:23.599> I<00:05:24.039> figured<00:05:25.039> I

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
to to do this come on I figured I

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.580 
to to do this come on I figured I
shouldn't<00:05:25.520> do<00:05:25.969> it<00:05:26.120> on<00:05:26.389> video<00:05:27.139> because<00:05:27.289> it

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
shouldn't do it on video because it

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.119 
shouldn't do it on video because it
would<00:05:27.800> take<00:05:27.979> too<00:05:28.219> much<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:28.849> this<00:05:29.030> is<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.449> fast

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.129 
would take too much and this is the fast

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.610 
would take too much and this is the fast
origami<00:05:31.129> to<00:05:31.280> do<00:05:31.430> so<00:05:31.750> cuz<00:05:32.750> them<00:05:32.990> I<00:05:33.169> mean<00:05:33.319> was

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
origami to do so cuz them I mean was

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.140 
origami to do so cuz them I mean was
done<00:05:34.900> and<00:05:35.900> voila<00:05:36.199> can<00:05:36.770> you<00:05:36.860> see<00:05:37.069> the<00:05:37.219> tips<00:05:37.490> well

I was just gluing them there and taking
a<00:05:41.180> photo<00:05:41.449> so<00:05:41.810> it's<00:05:41.960> not<00:05:42.139> really<00:05:42.800> well-defined

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
a photo so it's not really well-defined
