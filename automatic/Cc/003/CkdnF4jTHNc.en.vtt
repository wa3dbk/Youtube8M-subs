 I have a lot of problems.

 I'll go over a few things. I'm wounded. 

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:12.000
 I'm dying? Can you tell me? 

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:13.500
 I can't tell you that. 

00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:15.000

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:17.700
 No. 

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:19.800
 I am alone. 

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:20.800

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:22.000
 I'm afraid I'm going to die. 

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:23.000
 One more thing? 

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.000
 I don't know what's happening to me ... 

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.500
 ... and I want to do something important while I'm here ... 

00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:28.500

 Like what I smell? 

00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:11.000
 As if you menstruated what I know. 

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.500
 I don't think so I don't know how I could smell it. 

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:14.500
 You tell me. 

00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:18.800
