00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:11.000
 give a tip to you guys until you get there 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:15.080
 close to my friends asking to fling 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.829
 now this stick this ice mis 20 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.660
 pounds 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.029
 It's not a place to do what I'm doing. 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.769
 making a stick for dog fishing 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.900
 it was designed to fish with baits 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.300
 but we adapt a lot 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.939
 well, sure as a vacancy that holds 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.279
 20 pounds about nine pounds 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.900
 around eight kilos of little that people 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.430
 Do you know that the dogs here? 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.950
 It does not spend much of it 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.450
 now it has a but one very thing 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.520
 important 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.880
 You realize that I 'm throwing 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.650
 a little piece of ska with two wells 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.930
 that means that the 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.480
 and weight that approaches about 20 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.350
 and that's where I wanted to go. 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.450
 to arrive 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.790
 What happens is a vacancy that can 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.630
 you calmly catch any 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.239
 fish only to start over is complicated 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:11.270
 what happens is the back somewhere 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.380
 of the written tube what from a room to a 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.579
 Jaguar 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.030
 it means that this stick her consignment 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.600
 well let's put Oz is an ounce 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.499
 equivalent to 30 grams rounded to 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.810
 28.4 thing if she threatens a room until 

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:31.909
 30 grams what we do obviously 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.859
 one contained video with math 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.619
 four is thus bringing the 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:39.859
 about 77 25 out there 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:44.270
 so it will work great for 7 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:46.819
 25 grams to 30 grams above 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.899
 manufacturer does not undertake 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.549
 so we have to take a lot 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:55.819
 careful with that look the weight that I am 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:58.490
 starting two rice balls and one 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.799
 piece of fish 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.219
 This is what I'm starting then with 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.039
 Rest assured I will not be 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.990
 compromising the equipment okay to 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.020
 People have to be very careful about this. 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.620
 lots of people breaking stick exactly the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.620
 pitch
