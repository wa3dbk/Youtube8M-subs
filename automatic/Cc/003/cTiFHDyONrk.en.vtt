it right up the harvesting list in the
morning<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.520> always<00:00:53.699> worth<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.090> double<00:00:54.510> check

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
morning it's always worth a double check

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.959 
morning it's always worth a double check
to<00:00:55.110> see<00:00:55.230> what<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> would<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.070> missed<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:56.820> in

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
to see what I would I missed to put in

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.150 
to see what I would I missed to put in
so<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.800> strawberries<00:00:58.800> got<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> mega

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
so we are strawberries got the mega

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.180 
so we are strawberries got the mega
harvest<00:01:00.170> but<00:01:01.170> while<00:01:01.500> you're<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:01.649> let's<00:01:02.010> just

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
harvest but while you're here let's just

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.280 
harvest but while you're here let's just
wander<00:01:02.430> around<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:03.480> leaf<00:01:03.780> between

gardens<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.260> farming<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.830> think<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> very

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
gardens and farming I think is a very

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.000 
gardens and farming I think is a very
distinct<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.530> don't<00:01:10.710> think<00:01:10.890> we've

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
distinct one and I don't think we've

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.850 
distinct one and I don't think we've
made<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.369> jump<00:01:11.640> yet<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:13.080> actually<00:01:13.409> do<00:01:13.560> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
made that jump yet so to actually do a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.830 
made that jump yet so to actually do a
farm<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.939> city<00:01:15.210> where<00:01:15.479> you're<00:01:15.689> having

farm in the city where you're having

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.320 
farm in the city where you're having
enough<00:01:16.229> time<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.710> let<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.070> soil<00:01:17.790> replenish

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
enough time to let the soil replenish

enough time to let the soil replenish

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.330 
raised above ground and we added at this
point<00:02:07.350> we've<00:02:07.439> added<00:02:07.590> probably<00:02:07.860> about<00:02:08.129> six

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
point we've added probably about six

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.510 
point we've added probably about six
inches<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.700> topsoil<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.899> everything<00:02:10.170> else

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
nice and we get to go out on a on a walk

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.120 
nice and we get to go out on a on a walk
if<00:06:00.710> we<00:06:01.130> can<00:06:01.340> figure<00:06:01.580> out<00:06:01.699> a<00:06:01.849> way<00:06:02.150> to<00:06:02.680> have<00:06:03.680> data

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
if we can figure out a way to have data

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.730 
if we can figure out a way to have data
that<00:06:04.460> the<00:06:05.060> abscessed<00:06:05.539> determine<00:06:06.020> is<00:06:06.199> this<00:06:06.530> a

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
that the abscessed determine is this a

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.370 
that the abscessed determine is this a
sensible<00:06:07.280> path<00:06:08.150> for<00:06:08.509> actually<00:06:08.900> supporting

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
sensible path for actually supporting

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.649 
sensible path for actually supporting
people<00:06:09.560> and<00:06:09.860> and<00:06:10.550> having<00:06:10.880> a<00:06:10.940> resilient

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
people and and having a resilient

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.659 
people and and having a resilient
neighborhood<00:06:12.530> that's<00:06:13.130> excellent<00:06:13.490> I<00:06:13.639> think

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
neighborhood that's excellent I think

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.010 
neighborhood that's excellent I think
that's<00:06:13.970> a<00:06:14.060> question<00:06:14.210> that's<00:06:14.419> totally<00:06:14.840> worth

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
that's a question that's totally worth

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.379 
that's a question that's totally worth
pursuing

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.390 

we'd<00:06:18.990> like<00:06:19.139> to<00:06:19.259> make<00:06:19.379> the<00:06:19.500> claims<00:06:19.770> that<00:06:19.979> we

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
we'd like to make the claims that we

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.760 
we'd like to make the claims that we
make<00:06:20.610> about<00:06:20.849> the<00:06:21.000> farm<00:06:21.210> reflect<00:06:21.750> reality<00:06:21.930> have

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
make about the farm reflect reality have

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.360 
make about the farm reflect reality have
some<00:06:22.979> truth<00:06:23.189> in<00:06:23.400> advertising<00:06:23.930> and<00:06:24.930> just<00:06:25.370> just

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
some truth in advertising and just just

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.059 
some truth in advertising and just just
keep<00:06:26.569> keep<00:06:27.569> pushing<00:06:28.020> ourselves<00:06:28.139> to<00:06:28.650> figure

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:29.069 
keep keep pushing ourselves to figure

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.219 
keep keep pushing ourselves to figure
out<00:06:29.280> how<00:06:29.370> we<00:06:29.430> can<00:06:29.639> do<00:06:29.789> this<00:06:29.939> easier<00:06:30.599> more

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
out how we can do this easier more

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.790 
out how we can do this easier more
efficiently<00:06:31.710> and<00:06:32.069> grow<00:06:32.789> as<00:06:33.800> excellent

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
efficiently and grow as excellent

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.719 
efficiently and grow as excellent
quality<00:06:35.129> of<00:06:35.219> produce<00:06:35.819> as<00:06:36.030> we<00:06:36.180> currently<00:06:36.419> do

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729 
quality of produce as we currently do

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:50.209 
quality of produce as we currently do
right<00:06:47.960> yeah<00:06:48.960> it's<00:06:49.110> said<00:06:49.229> over<00:06:49.469> to<00:06:49.650> to<00:06:50.069> that

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.219 
right yeah it's said over to to that

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:53.420 
right yeah it's said over to to that
field<00:06:50.460> we<00:06:51.210> used<00:06:51.419> to<00:06:51.569> grow<00:06:51.750> a<00:06:51.780> lot<00:06:52.229> more<00:06:52.560> food<00:06:53.099> in

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
field we used to grow a lot more food in

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.939 
field we used to grow a lot more food in
the<00:06:53.849> cities<00:06:54.120> either<00:06:54.960> percentage-wise<00:06:55.560> or

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
the cities either percentage-wise or

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.240 
the cities either percentage-wise or
volume<00:06:56.310> wise<00:06:57.169> so<00:06:58.169> we're<00:06:58.319> catching<00:06:58.620> back<00:06:58.830> up<00:06:59.009> to

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
volume wise so we're catching back up to

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.849 
volume wise so we're catching back up to
where<00:06:59.340> you<00:06:59.520> used<00:06:59.729> to<00:06:59.789> be
