way and say here let's see about the
this<00:00:32.579> colors<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.510> what<00:00:33.809> why<00:00:34.020> did<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.260> choose

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
this colors here what why did you choose

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.400 
this colors here what why did you choose
these<00:00:34.860> colors<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.370> begin<00:00:35.670> with<00:00:35.989> well<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.260> not

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
these colors to begin with well it's not

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.020 
these colors to begin with well it's not
so<00:00:37.649> much<00:00:37.710> about<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.040> colors<00:00:38.399> actually<00:00:38.610> is

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
so much about the colors actually is

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.020 
so much about the colors actually is
more<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.390> about<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.809> shape<00:00:40.110> form<00:00:40.879> is<00:00:41.879> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
more just about the shape form is it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.850 
more just about the shape form is it
this<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.450> call<00:00:42.660> my<00:00:42.780> fragment<00:00:43.020> series<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.770> was

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
this is I call my fragment series it was

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.520 
this is I call my fragment series it was
based<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.340> larger<00:00:45.239> paintings<00:00:45.629> maybe<00:00:46.200> somewhat

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
based on larger paintings maybe somewhat

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
based on larger paintings maybe somewhat
more<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.460> were

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
more like this but that were

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.220 
more like this but that were
multicolored<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> idea<00:00:48.629> was<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.960> kind<00:00:49.079> of

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
multicolored and the idea was to kind of

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.369 
multicolored and the idea was to kind of
zoom<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.969> you<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.809> section<00:00:52.110> of

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
zoom in on you like on one section of

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.200 
zoom in on you like on one section of
the<00:00:52.469> painting<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.489> accentuate<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the painting and just accentuate a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.630 
the painting and just accentuate a
certain<00:00:54.629> intersection<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> disk

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
certain intersection of you know a disk

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.000 
certain intersection of you know a disk
with<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.879> line<00:00:57.210> or<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.230> intersecting<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
with a line or just intersecting the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.330 
with a line or just intersecting the
spaces<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.030> shapes<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:01.410> then<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> colors

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
spaces the shapes and then the colors

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.090 
spaces the shapes and then the colors
was<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> secondary<00:01:04.229> decision

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
was actually like the secondary decision

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.750 
was actually like the secondary decision
so<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.030> thought<00:01:06.150> about<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.840> color<00:01:07.080> sent<00:01:07.530> in

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
so you thought about the color sent in

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.109 
so you thought about the color sent in
okay<00:01:08.760> okay<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.340> just<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.520> look<00:01:11.820> see

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
okay okay so it's like a just a look see

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.289 
okay okay so it's like a just a look see
right<00:01:12.659> into<00:01:12.990> its<00:01:13.950> maybe<00:01:14.220> some<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.640> your<00:01:14.729> larger

Bryant already know what how did you

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.050 
Bryant already know what how did you
decide<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.630> go<00:02:18.930> from<00:02:19.170> color<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:20.610> the

decide to go from color to to the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.770 
decide to go from color to to the
monochromatic<00:02:22.040> well<00:02:23.040> when<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.700> was<00:02:23.850> studying

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
monochromatic well when I was studying

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.870 
monochromatic well when I was studying
our<00:02:25.050> one<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.530> exercises<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.370> didn't<00:02:26.640> any

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
our one of the exercises I didn't any

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.050 
our one of the exercises I didn't any
was<00:02:27.470> just<00:02:28.470> playing<00:02:28.860> with<00:02:28.980> black<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.850> white

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
was just playing with black and white

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.510 
was just playing with black and white
paint<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.800> challenge<00:02:31.800> yourself<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.190> create

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
paint and challenge yourself to create

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.300 
paint and challenge yourself to create
as<00:02:32.610> many<00:02:32.730> shades<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.210> grey<00:02:33.420> as<00:02:33.480> possible<00:02:34.310> and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
as many shades of grey as possible and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.440 
as many shades of grey as possible and
so<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.090> sort<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.950> kind<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.130> that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
so this is sort of kind of in that

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.090 
so this is sort of kind of in that
heritage<00:02:39.450> or<00:02:39.660> whatever<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:39.990> seeing<00:02:40.890> how

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
heritage or whatever just seeing how

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.380 
heritage or whatever just seeing how
many<00:02:41.190> things<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:41.580> could<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:41.880> with<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:42.090> very

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
many things you could do with a very

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.840 
many things you could do with a very
limited<00:02:42.600> palette<00:02:43.020> but<00:02:43.440> just<00:02:43.650> two<00:02:44.520> colors<00:02:44.640> I

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
limited palette but just two colors I

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.160 
limited palette but just two colors I
just<00:02:45.000> had<00:02:45.090> one<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.390> go<00:02:45.510> white<00:02:45.630> paint<00:02:45.900> once<00:02:46.080> you

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
just had one to go white paint once you

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.230 
just had one to go white paint once you
would<00:02:46.320> like<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.620> eat<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:46.970> create<00:02:47.970> what<00:02:48.210> I

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
would like to eat and just create what I

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.610 
would like to eat and just create what I
could<00:02:48.570> with<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:53.750> well<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.020> i<00:02:55.080> see<00:02:55.290> i<00:02:55.320> see

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
could with that well and i see i see

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.650 
could with that well and i see i see
that<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.160> got<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.370> lot<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:56.850> different<00:02:57.390> shades

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
that you got a lot of different shades

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.560 
that you got a lot of different shades

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
colors and it's just a mixture I like

I see it says son and it just

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.190 
I see it says son and it just
automatically<00:03:08.640> just<00:03:08.940> draws<00:03:09.240> me<00:03:09.270> right<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:09.780> in

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
automatically just draws me right on in

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.010 
automatically just draws me right on in
this<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.940> morning<00:03:12.150> would<00:03:12.540> just<00:03:12.750> wake

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
this this in the morning would just wake

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.410 
this this in the morning would just wake
me<00:03:13.050> up<00:03:13.440> if<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.770> looked<00:03:14.040> at<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.280> that's<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.239> lot<00:03:15.390> of

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
me up if I looked at it that's a lot of

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.630 
me up if I looked at it that's a lot of
people<00:03:15.780> said<00:03:16.020> that<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.950> was<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.250> first<00:03:17.489> of

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
people said that this was the first of

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.790 
people said that this was the first of
my<00:03:17.820> actually<00:03:18.120> representation<00:03:18.840> everything

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
my actually representation everything

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.290 
my actually representation everything
else<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.070> not<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> representational<00:03:20.910> something

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
else is not a representational something

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.040 
else is not a representational something
to<00:03:21.420> be<00:03:21.600> anything<00:03:22.050> or<00:03:23.010> have<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.160> message<00:03:24.050> persons

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
to be anything or have a message persons

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.540 
to be anything or have a message persons
that<00:03:25.380> I<00:03:25.470> made<00:03:26.510> purposefully<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.660> represent

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
that I made purposefully to represent

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.150 
that I made purposefully to represent
obviously<00:03:29.550> it's<00:03:29.700> not<00:03:30.440> realism<00:03:31.440> painting<00:03:31.860> does

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
obviously it's not realism painting does

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.830 
obviously it's not realism painting does
look<00:03:32.820> like<00:03:32.970> somebody<00:03:33.390> some<00:03:33.570> kind<00:03:33.810> of

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
look like somebody some kind of

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.890 
look like somebody some kind of
abstraction<00:03:34.530> of

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.259 

okay<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.890> so<00:03:39.519> it's<00:03:39.700> not<00:03:39.849> supposed<00:03:40.209> to

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
okay so so it's not supposed to

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.080 
okay so so it's not supposed to
represent<00:03:40.480> something<00:03:41.140> but<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:42.579> other<00:03:42.879> work

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
represent something but the other work

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.369 
represent something but the other work
doesn't<00:03:43.269> represent<00:03:43.510> something<00:03:43.930> it's<00:03:44.170> not<00:03:44.349> a

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
doesn't represent something it's not a

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.000 
doesn't represent something it's not a
realistic<00:03:45.659> but<00:03:46.659> it<00:03:46.840> represents<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.650> Sun<00:03:47.860> is

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
realistic but it represents the Sun is

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.000 
realistic but it represents the Sun is
an<00:03:48.129> abstraction<00:03:48.610> of<00:03:49.260> abstraction<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.799> Sun

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
an abstraction of abstraction of the Sun

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.449 
an abstraction of abstraction of the Sun
okay<00:03:51.430> so<00:03:51.489> I<00:03:51.700> totally<00:03:52.269> get<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.480> now<00:03:53.189> now<00:03:54.189> we're

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
okay so I totally get that now now we're

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.640 
okay so I totally get that now now we're
getting<00:03:54.579> into<00:03:54.849> it<00:03:55.120> i<00:03:55.239> think<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.780> ripple<00:03:56.319> type

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
getting into it i think the ripple type

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.229 
getting into it i think the ripple type
stuff<00:03:57.099> going<00:03:57.519> here<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.950> is<00:04:00.010> this<00:04:01.000> is

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
stuff going here and this is this is

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.110 
stuff going here and this is this is
really<00:04:01.569> i<00:04:01.840> like<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:02.859> it<00:04:03.280> seems<00:04:03.700> like<00:04:03.790> there's

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
really i like this it seems like there's

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.129 
really i like this it seems like there's
movement<00:04:04.450> going<00:04:04.930> on<00:04:05.230> here<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:07.450> this<00:04:07.750> would

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
movement going on here this this would

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.500 
movement going on here this this would
look<00:04:08.319> great<00:04:08.379> in<00:04:09.010> my<00:04:09.310> trailer<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:10.030> be<00:04:10.180> honest

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
look great in my trailer to be honest

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.809 
look great in my trailer to be honest
with<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:10.870> not<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.709> that<00:04:11.950> that<00:04:12.549> would<00:04:12.790> be

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
with you not that that that would be
