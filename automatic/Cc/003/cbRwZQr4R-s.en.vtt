the ds1 ex is a superior special edition

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.009 
the ds1 ex is a superior special edition
of<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.140> classic<00:00:25.939> ds1<00:00:26.939> which<00:00:27.420> came<00:00:27.630> out<00:00:27.660> back

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
of the classic ds1 which came out back

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.099 
of the classic ds1 which came out back
in<00:00:28.250> 1978<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.609> reason<00:00:30.000> why<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.630> superior

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
in 1978 the reason why it's so superior

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.650 
in 1978 the reason why it's so superior
and<00:00:31.349> special<00:00:31.859> well<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.550> quite<00:00:33.030> simple<00:00:33.450> it

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
and special well is quite simple it

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.520 
and special well is quite simple it
utilizes<00:00:34.700> MDP<00:00:35.700> technology<00:00:36.530> bosses

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530

processing multi-dimensional processing

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.240 
processing multi-dimensional processing
basically<00:00:43.020> means<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.620> they<00:00:43.800> figured<00:00:44.129> out<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
basically means that they figured out a

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.330 
basically means that they figured out a
way<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.550> each<00:00:45.000> string<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.930> react<00:00:46.340> accordingly

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
way for each string to react accordingly

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.190 
way for each string to react accordingly
to<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> gain<00:00:47.969> structure<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> strings

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to the gain structure so the strings

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.110 
to the gain structure so the strings
that<00:00:49.320> are<00:00:49.379> thicker<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.950> diameter<00:00:50.309> are<00:00:50.789> going

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that are thicker in diameter are going

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.910 
that are thicker in diameter are going
to<00:00:51.180> react<00:00:51.480> differently<00:00:51.629> than<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> thinner

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
to react differently than the thinner

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.580 
to react differently than the thinner
strings<00:00:53.370> also<00:00:54.590> multi-dimensional

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
strings also multi-dimensional

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.610 
strings also multi-dimensional
processing<00:00:56.129> technology<00:00:56.760> basically<00:00:57.620> overall

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
processing technology basically overall

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.799 
processing technology basically overall
the<00:00:58.949> general<00:00:59.309> overview<00:00:59.609> means<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> makes

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
the general overview means that it makes

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.619 
the general overview means that it makes
the<00:01:01.109> petal<00:01:01.379> react<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> tube<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.449> gives

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the petal react like a tube so it gives

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.980 
the petal react like a tube so it gives
you<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.780> nice<00:01:04.049> throaty<00:01:04.760> spongy<00:01:05.760> like

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
you that nice throaty spongy like

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.960 
you that nice throaty spongy like
dynamic<00:01:06.990> response<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.250> put<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.760> in

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
dynamic response so you put this in

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.490 
dynamic response so you put this in
front<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.360> favorite<00:01:09.720> amp<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.080> don't<00:01:10.350> care

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
front of your favorite amp I don't care

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.200 
front of your favorite amp I don't care
if<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.740> solid-state<00:01:11.280> tube<00:01:11.549> amp<00:01:11.760> doesn't

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
if it's solid-state tube amp doesn't

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.140 
if it's solid-state tube amp doesn't
matter<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:13.350> guy<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.979> gonna<00:01:14.369> bring<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.909> life

matter this guy is gonna bring the life

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.420 
matter this guy is gonna bring the life
out<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.570> amp<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.350> gonna<00:01:16.560> really<00:01:17.009> give

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
out of that amp it's gonna really give

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.929 
out of that amp it's gonna really give
you<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.850> user<00:01:18.770> dynamic<00:01:19.770> input<00:01:19.979> interface

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
you that user dynamic input interface

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.690 
you that user dynamic input interface
that<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.540> need<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.200> when<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.439> dig<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.310> it's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
that you need so when you dig in it's

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.480 

again<00:01:50.150> all<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:51.140> settings<00:01:51.650> are<00:01:52.009> straight

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
again all of the settings are straight

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.270 
again all of the settings are straight
up<00:01:52.520> at<00:01:53.060> 12<00:01:53.420> o'clock<00:01:53.780> that's<00:01:54.200> my<00:01:54.409> favorite<00:01:55.070> way

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
up at 12 o'clock that's my favorite way

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.450 
up at 12 o'clock that's my favorite way
to<00:01:55.640> try<00:01:56.119> out<00:01:56.330> any<00:01:56.659> piece<00:01:57.049> of<00:01:57.229> gear<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:57.710> you<00:01:57.979> know

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
to try out any piece of gear so you know

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.359 
to try out any piece of gear so you know
how<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:58.850> responds<00:01:59.509> just<00:01:59.930> with<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.110> flat<00:02:00.650> line

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
how it responds just with a flat line

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.510 
how it responds just with a flat line
across<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.360> board<00:02:02.600> okay<00:02:03.200> same<00:02:03.560> thing<00:02:03.590> if<00:02:04.100> you

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
across the board okay same thing if you

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:23.920 
across the board okay same thing if you
treat<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.420> little<00:02:05.600> nicer<00:02:09.610> just<00:02:10.610> lighten<00:02:10.910> up

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.420 

and<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.110> love<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.560> about<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.920> all<00:02:26.220> you're

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
and I love that about it all you're

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.550 
and I love that about it all you're
doing<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.760> backing<00:02:27.210> up<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.810> backs<00:02:28.050> up<00:02:28.290> with

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
doing is backing up and it backs up with

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.220 
doing is backing up and it backs up with
you<00:02:29.240> another<00:02:30.240> thing<00:02:30.480> about<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.930> pedal

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
you another thing about this pedal

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.290 
you another thing about this pedal
that's<00:02:31.380> way<00:02:31.740> cool<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.760> really<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.150> a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
that's way cool is that it really is a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.180 
that's way cool is that it really is a
shredder<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.320> crank<00:02:34.590> up<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.920> drive<00:02:35.160> a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
shredder if you crank up the drive a

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.920 
shredder if you crank up the drive a
little<00:02:35.550> bit<00:02:35.700> Hey

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:53.500
