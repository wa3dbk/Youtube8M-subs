00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 good note that the note said 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.120
 something that is very important in fact the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.580
 pillars the conversation that I would like 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.769
 that we debated are two milk 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.389
 mother is something irreplaceable to 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.219
 I regret more completely than obviously 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.650
 generates the amount of antibodies that the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.080
 man the human being needs is the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.670
 perfect food and organization 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.289
 World Health Organization recommends the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.330
 breastfeeding until the year hopefully 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.830
 indeed it is tremendously necessary 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.570
 for the guaguitas but as I said in the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.399
 note however when one of adult 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.219
 because notice that all the animals 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.410
 they even stop giving milk to their young 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.300
 and then they feed on something else and 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.670
 it's because information like the body 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.700
 the resins that I'm drinking milk 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.440
 so I'm not big, I need to grow up and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.969
 unlike according to several tubes of what 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.140
 that many think instead of affirming that 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.329
 the bones says 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.250
 I'm still growing and start 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.809
 to open everything and you get osteoporosis 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.300
 that is because I have an information 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.859
 mistaken the body that are good the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.410
 breast milk is that I remembered when 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.730
 we the gator told us that the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.210
 milk at the base of the first 3 months 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.210
 was 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.979
 We freeze eight months between cold 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:22.420
 thawed your mom was compadre to 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:25.119
 another day to maintain breast milk 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.580
 I wish I could give your children up 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.580
 the 28 or more hopefully a year 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.369
 until it is appropriate to give a child 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.509
 exactly good it is said that the 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.580
 problem that many studies is that 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.500
 take liquid fat and supposedly the 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.360
 chub that you have are not or are you have it 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.460
 but as it has more phosphorus finally 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.319
 what I contribute with what the advertising 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.750
 is full of mouth are not such 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.700
 so it's very complicated to sergio 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.850
 only American pediatrician recently 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.470
 time is an experiment and for the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.209
 components of milk because really 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.240
 people do not know but it has a high 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.830
 percentage of phosphorus not barefoot as 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.110
 Salfate explained it and also what 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.490
 the note said the expert the organism 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.890
 human is not prepared for milk 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.030
 of cow and I want him to do when there is a 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.250
 child one 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.020
 our game that will be with cold the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.350
 bottle with milk to calm down 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:22.690
 forgives 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:25.120
 when the child has a cold , 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.489
 generates a paste was suspended the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.110
 milk and he ran out of regimen either 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.660
 we can deny what has meant the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.090
 milk in our diet along like 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.890
 of I do not know about the story of the average but 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.420
 at least follow the evolution exactly 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.400
 first first the evolution of man 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.980
 and second place too but I hope that 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.280
 I think it 's the most important thing in the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.260
 nutrition of children in the 70s 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.560
 of the year 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.239
 there was a lot of malnutrition in the world 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.319
 thanks to the milk because the milk 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.569
 distribute for free because everything is 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:05.410
 many less malnourished children but without 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:07.030
 however many for a quantity of 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.489
 falencia in the body making 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.890
 product of milk and here I believe that 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.019
 things 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.019
 the consumption but as many think that 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.959
 does only well is sent in its midst the 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.939
 money milk in the morning all life 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.280
 it is in the breakfast of all the children and 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:27.069
 after that custom 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.689
 they are varied and that is not to mention that 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.549
 currently as soil I feed the 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.590
 animals when you drink milk you are 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.120
 sending the antibiotics that they give to 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.650
 the pay will give a bacterium amount 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.560
 that does not correspond to the human body 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.719
 and that together with the chÃ¢teau the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.579
 body make you intestinal flora but 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.560
 I 'll read what fao says 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.269
 about the law to see says the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.799
 milk has become fundamental in the 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.859
 diet in places where consumption was 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.480
 very low in 1970 good nutrition and 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.889
 access to a proper and healthy diet is 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.930
 essential for growth and 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.450
 development of a child and his health in the 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.430
 future this influences your intelligence and 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.049
 economic future milk has 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.810
 multiple nutrients and contributes to 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.939
 organism with calcium magnesium selene or 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.099
 vitamin b12 which is what makes 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:12.129
 finally our neurons work and 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.940
 b5 among others milk reduces the risk 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.630
 of osteoporosis 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.010
 colorectal cancer and diabetes type 2 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.750
 fat in milk could influence 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.400
 possible cardiovascular diseases 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.840
 in that we agree and so 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.510
 It is advised to consume dairy products 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.000
 low in fat but attention what 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.560
 also said the expert and is that being 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.100
 that gives you wrong information 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.080
 the body generates a cause in the 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.790
 cellular reproduction and can generate 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.130
 cancer with its vocation of milk because 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.990
 they have training or radamel or do not deny it 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.400
 says even that when analyzing the 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.200
 effect of dairy health is made 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.750
 considering all the food 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.610
 consumed in its entirety because a 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.610
 Sometimes one over consumes at last 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.120
 and byler nationally there has been a 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.280
 increased milk consumption as 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.800
 data about the organization of the 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.840
 The World Health exists 1.4 million 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.850
 overweight people if you go back 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.370
 attention to see if this you in the house 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.080
 it sounds like it causes milk 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.670
 we are side the negative key has its 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.730
 positive part but this the great 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.510
 problem with being consumed in excess 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.310
 irritant to the digestive system 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.889
 especially to sensitive people with 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.689
 abdominal colic that recording colon 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.189
 can generate bracelet how many times the 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.900
 movement of this villa and it's wrong 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:25.060
 made and it's over 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.590
 the pdk says that milk is poor in 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.990
 iron and for the small hemorrhage 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.939
 intestinal is that obviously especially 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.199
 in infants he says he has been 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.090
 considered as a main 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.650
 cause of cataracts and is 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.900
 related to various types of cancer 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.870
 obviously the risk of cancer 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.009
 of prostate ovaries and lymphoma to me what 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.680
 that draws my attention to the 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:46.330
 milk is because more and more people are 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:55.810
 children who have intolerance to 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:59.710
 lactose or allergy the protein daughter of 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.479
 actor was born with protein allergy 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.849
 the casein casein 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.969
 effectively and it's a subject if it's that 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.930
 giant the subject we could finally 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.639
 finally what I did was the most 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.979
 natural and what I would recommend 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.839
 So it's back to you, you have no milk 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.880
 not if you have milk without doing if your 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:18.450
 son is born with normal milk 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.800
 everyone leaves the dairy to be able 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.490
 deliver them felipe but the time came 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.490
 of the
