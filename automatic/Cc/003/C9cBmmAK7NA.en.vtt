00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.289
 Hi there, doom is approaching you 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.529
 us end 2013 and it is worth summing up 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.849
 the best games 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.470
 of the outgoing year I made all the top five games 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.790
 so probably I think better the top 5 so 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:37.800
 say here well let's start right away 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 in fifth place I put an action from 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.739
 ubisoft company is our assassin's 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.250
 creed black flag with us chief with 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.640
 character is edward kenway what 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.350
 As for the game that I liked the game 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.820
 she is not to regard her as 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.230
 assassin's creed a separate 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.620
 this game is about pirates 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.300
 In general, I think that assassin's creed 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.460
 quotes as it died after the first 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.170
 parts yes these are the next parts this already 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.790
 assassin's creed, that is, there is no 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.490
 stealth and so on further in the first 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.740
 parts, we kind of tried well, personally, I 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.659
 tried when to do everything quietly there 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.330
 the guards can still die 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.200
 and here I can calmly fight against 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.259
 so 15-20 and opponents and calm them 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.140
 kill all like a game 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.350
 it became very easy but more to me 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.119
 liked the wallpaper on the ships here 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.310
 more than assassin's creed 3 somehow 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.630
 there it was all very not here 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.670
 worked it all assasins creed black 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.020
 flag 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.060
 as already there jubisofty said that they 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.500
 will make a separate game about pirates 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.939
 look at this here this game i will leave 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.280
 her in fifth place is the best action 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:59.070
 2013 action but to me personally so 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:02.470
 it seemed so assassin's creed 1 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.299
 as follows 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.580
 kings they have a disc i don't have but on 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.619
 fourth place I will leave dota 2 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.810
 Do not be surprised dota 2 officially 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.140
 official factory please note came out 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.170
 2013 is July 9th, that is, before 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.030
 how we played it personally i started to play 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.959
 into it in early 2012 sometime in january 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.730
 or I donâ€™t remember the key and got it 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.730
 someone else again 2011 that is it we 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.660
 everyone played only official beta test 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.130
 and launched in 2012 that is 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.110
 Six months ago, it is even a little more 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.130
 so that in fourth place I have 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.890
 dota 2 is probably more now 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.440
 just playing it I never know 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.989
 probably not get tired of this game 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:57.110
 here is dota in fourth place next 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.140
 next game I have is this year 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:04.239
 in climbing 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.440
 so I'm a fan of the year for and 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.340
 I could not actually buy this game 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.820
 he also bought me with bang here 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.900
 pictured kratos why you liked 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.590
 great graphics 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.840
 action has become much more than the third part 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.250
 but still I liked the third part 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.019
 more but still this game is worth 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.320
 attention especially to those who love slasher 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.320
 This ears hear that I will play thousands 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.610
 thirteenth year here so that the shutter 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.180
 climbing I will leave in third place 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.180
 good exclusive 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.620
 this is our 3rd place 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.010
 go to the final places this is the second 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.760
 and first place and for a long time I thought that 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.459
 put in second place and actually 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.830
 In second place I put forward a game that 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.930
 according to the version I do not remember how it is called yes 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.600
 it accept the games of the year games there the best action 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.200
 yes xxxiv better they picked the best games 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:13.980
 years but I'm still not better for me 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.980
 game years it's grand theft aut of life 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.040
 the fifth part of the famous series from the company 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:27.310
 rockstar actually why i put it 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.280
 to second place well personally for myself i am there 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.669
 Especially new since the time of 4 parts I am especially 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.169
 such a lot did not find all these there 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.020
 microtransactions yes here with the phone 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.580
 car to buy a building just so that I 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.990
 I do not use only passed 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.250
 story campaign and all plus more 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.630
 disappointed that the multiplayer is there 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.760
 buggy as it did not work 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.340
 ok run like i was really waiting 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.660
 multiplayer and these 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.850
 glitches there but the network did not work somehow 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.410
 I lost the desire to play on the network even 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.440
 I do not know an hour for it did not even play it 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:06.150
 on the net though really wanted to do it like this 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.150
 what is it still and delivered and late 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.940
 so what about the better game 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.360
 mental while she is also out 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.370
 understandable yes no exact dates many there 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.060
 will show still writing for what it will come out 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.560
 but so far there are no exact dates when 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.120
 rockstar will announce officially then and 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:34.840
 there will be an exact date so but by the way 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.830
 grata is certainly not bad but the best 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.610
 game of the year I would not choose it well and 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.530
 proper 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.110
 the game of the year for me personally is an exclusive 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.060
 playstation 3 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.130
 This game is one of us for me personally. 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.150
 became the best game I played 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.150
 2013 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.530
 I planned it 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.110
 pass well, that you spend 2300 rubles 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.030
 I want to play a little longer 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.069
 Here I decided to stretch the game of the century 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.440
 an hour of 2 a day well and in the end I 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:11.590
 somewhere three times the measure for an hour 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.930
 2 played and then pulled me and I 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.900
 passed to the end 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.240
 sat still remember it was light did not get up already 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.610
 dark shadow is necessary on the street 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.280
 that is, I played for more than seven hours 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:29.139
 exactly in her succession so much then mind 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:32.110
 the game is just super fun 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:36.669
 bad from us does not take the same chart to 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:39.009
 crash bandicoot so personally for 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.919
 me this game of the year which is really 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.690
 fun to play and and i hope again 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:46.289
 I will probably pass another level of complexity 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:50.680
 I do not remember them there like 4 or three 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:53.229
 here so that the last one of us is one of us for 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.020
 me the best exclusive uniquely and 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:58.330
 the best game of the year they are in vain she is there 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:03.520
 received many estimates do not know it 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:05.169
 compare if gta gta and some of us have 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:10.419
 who is there more than any ratings 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:12.520
 but personally I liked it more so 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:15.090
 that everyone who has this action 3:00 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.520
 by the way I don't remember the bundle came out before 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:21.339
 playstation 3 + fins of ace and behind us 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.469
 yes by the way bento sauce is also a good game 

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:26.349
 I played in the demo but somehow 

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:31.659
 Equally, it is not better for me than here alone 

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:37.089
 of us here actually it was all 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:39.820
 there was a video about the best games in my opinion 

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:43.330
 opinion of vich can you have your opinion 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:50.039
 and agree with me all the games by the way 18 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:55.349
 plus advise everyone to play games 

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:55.349
 all everyone thanks for watching all bye
