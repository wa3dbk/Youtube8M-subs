were amazing I heard that they're a
little<00:02:46.680> tough<00:02:46.950> with<00:02:46.980> dual<00:02:47.430> bearing<00:02:47.790> wheels

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
little tough with dual bearing wheels

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.760 
little tough with dual bearing wheels
because<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.740> axles<00:02:50.160> are<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.430> short<00:02:50.610> i'm<00:02:51.060> sure

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
because the axles are so short i'm sure

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.610 
because the axles are so short i'm sure
the<00:02:52.770> axles<00:02:53.160> are<00:02:53.280> short<00:02:53.520> as<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.360> can<00:02:54.510> see<00:02:54.660> like

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
the axles are short as you can see like

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.570 
the axles are short as you can see like
yeah<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:57.300> i<00:02:57.630> use<00:02:58.560> single<00:02:58.950> bearing<00:02:59.220> link<00:02:59.430> with

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
yeah but i use single bearing link with

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.010 
yeah but i use single bearing link with
wheels<00:02:59.820> these<00:03:00.090> aren't<00:03:00.330> black<00:03:00.540> rubber<00:03:00.840> dick

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
wheels these aren't black rubber dick

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.900 
wheels these aren't black rubber dick
and<00:03:01.170> use<00:03:01.260> your<00:03:01.380> big<00:03:01.500> daddy<00:03:01.710> so<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.250> bearing

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
and use your big daddy so the bearing

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.300 
and use your big daddy so the bearing
slides<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.390> sometimes<00:03:03.870> but<00:03:04.320> then<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.280> just

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
slides in sometimes but then you just

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.200 
slides in sometimes but then you just
pop<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.820> right<00:03:05.940> out<00:03:06.440> but<00:03:07.440> uh<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.970> could<00:03:09.120> be

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
pop it right out but uh that could be

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.210 
pop it right out but uh that could be
solved<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:09.810> like<00:03:09.930> super<00:03:10.830> glue<00:03:10.920> I

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
solved with just like super glue I

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.880 
solved with just like super glue I
