00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the realm of possibility so here's the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.429 
the realm of possibility so here's the
genesect<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:33.150> I'm<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.990> give<00:01:34.200> away<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
genesect that I'm going to give away to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.179 
genesect that I'm going to give away to
you<00:01:35.479> let's<00:01:36.479> see<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.930> f7<00:01:37.500> well<00:01:37.740> network<00:01:37.979> that

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
you let's see can I f7 well network that

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.870 
you let's see can I f7 well network that
does<00:01:38.250> work<00:01:38.579> awesome<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.439> uh<00:01:40.759> just<00:01:41.759> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
does work awesome so it is uh just a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.929 
does work awesome so it is uh just a
standard<00:01:42.619> genesect<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.860> ice<00:01:44.280> cream<00:01:44.520> federal

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
standard genesect with ice cream federal

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.980 
standard genesect with ice cream federal
you<00:01:45.060> turn<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.820> opt<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.060> my<00:01:48.540> bus<00:01:48.810> or

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
you turn you can opt for my bus or

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.770 
you turn you can opt for my bus or
something<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:49.500> has

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
something it just has

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.780 
something it just has
I<00:01:50.840> was<00:01:51.470> going<00:01:51.710> for<00:01:51.740> coverage<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:52.430> that's<00:01:52.700> what

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
I was going for coverage so that's what

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.200 
I was going for coverage so that's what
it<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:52.970> it's<00:01:53.240> easy<00:01:53.450> in<00:01:54.040> a<00:01:55.040> special<00:01:55.729> attack<00:01:55.940> and

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
it is it's easy in a special attack and

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.539 
it is it's easy in a special attack and
speed<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:58.220> think<00:01:58.490> like<00:01:58.780> 46<00:01:59.780> attack<00:02:00.200> so

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
speed and I think like 46 attack so

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.390 
speed and I think like 46 attack so
ready<00:02:01.549> for<00:02:01.759> use<00:02:01.900> you<00:02:02.900> can<00:02:03.020> do<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:04.220> then<00:02:04.310> I

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
ready for use you can do that and then I

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.130 
ready for use you can do that and then I
want<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.580> say<00:02:04.729> like<00:02:04.759> if<00:02:05.150> we<00:02:05.270> can<00:02:05.420> get<00:02:05.570> like<00:02:08.140> 500

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
want to say like if we can get like 500

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.559 
want to say like if we can get like 500
