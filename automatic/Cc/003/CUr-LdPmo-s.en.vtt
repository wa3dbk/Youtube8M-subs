money today we ordered too much cryoxide

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.319 
money today we ordered too much cryoxide
that's<00:01:09.710> why<00:01:09.950> look<00:01:10.520> at<00:01:10.640> all<00:01:10.729> these<00:01:10.850> leftover

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
cans we made a bad prediction and if we

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.240 
cans we made a bad prediction and if we
ordered<00:01:14.450> too<00:01:14.630> much<00:01:14.840> we'll<00:01:15.380> waste<00:01:15.680> it<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.070> lose

we'll<00:01:19.010> run<00:01:19.220> out<00:01:19.400> of<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:19.760> make<00:01:20.479> room

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
we'll run out of it make room

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.730 
we'll run out of it make room
I<00:01:21.020> got<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.560> pace<00:01:22.570> me<00:01:23.570> too<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:25.990> don't<00:01:26.990> get<00:01:27.409> it

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
I got a pace me too I don't get it

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.830 
I got a pace me too I don't get it
even<00:01:28.369> though<00:01:28.549> my<00:01:28.729> dad<00:01:28.760> didn't<00:01:29.330> know<00:01:29.360> how<00:01:29.630> many

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
even though my dad didn't know how many

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.380 
even though my dad didn't know how many
jobs<00:01:30.140> he<00:01:30.380> had<00:01:30.619> each<00:01:30.830> day<00:01:31.100> he<00:01:31.700> never<00:01:31.909> had<00:01:32.150> more

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
jobs he had each day he never had more

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.149 
jobs he had each day he never had more
than<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.750> few<00:01:32.780> cans<00:01:33.229> left<00:01:33.560> over

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
than a few cans left over

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.160 
than a few cans left over
maybe<00:01:34.850> we<00:01:35.150> should<00:01:35.360> charge<00:01:35.570> more<00:01:35.840> for<00:01:35.900> a

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
maybe we should charge more for a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.510 
maybe we should charge more for a
cryoxide<00:01:36.560> change<00:01:37.420> no<00:01:38.420> that's<00:01:38.869> not<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.200> answer

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
cryoxide change no that's not the answer

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.190 
cryoxide change no that's not the answer
the<00:01:40.520> answer<00:01:40.549> is<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.510> make<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.840> better

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
the answer is to make a better

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.570 
the answer is to make a better
prediction<00:01:43.100> but<00:01:43.820> how<00:01:44.860> wait<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.890> second

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
prediction but how wait a second

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.990 
prediction but how wait a second
digit<00:01:46.970> is<00:01:47.090> absolutely<00:01:47.780> right<00:01:48.470> I<00:01:51.610> okay<00:01:52.610> what<00:01:52.939> do

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
digit is absolutely right I okay what do

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.870 
digit is absolutely right I okay what do
we<00:01:53.150> know<00:01:53.330> we<00:01:54.020> know<00:01:54.049> my<00:01:54.470> father<00:01:54.740> ordered<00:01:55.189> 66
