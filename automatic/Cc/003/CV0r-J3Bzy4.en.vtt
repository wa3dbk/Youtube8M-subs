Facebook gave you is going to go so I'm
going<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.579> copy<00:02:05.820> all<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:07.170> code<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:08.360> put<00:02:09.360> it

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
going to copy all of the code and put it

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.120 
going to copy all of the code and put it
here

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
here

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.890 
here
and<00:02:12.140> then<00:02:13.140> I'm<00:02:13.290> going<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.860> hit<00:02:14.550> update<00:02:14.850> or<00:02:15.240> safe

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and then I'm going to hit update or safe

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.060 
and then I'm going to hit update or safe
if<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.560> first<00:02:16.770> time<00:02:16.920> you're

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
if this is the first time you're

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.550 
if this is the first time you're
creating<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.520> page<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.940> that's<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.900> once<00:02:19.260> you

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
creating the page and that's it once you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.920 
creating the page and that's it once you
have<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.830> code<00:02:20.460> on<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.060> website<00:02:21.450> then

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
have that code on the website then

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.480 
have that code on the website then
you've<00:02:22.140> got<00:02:22.320> conversion<00:02:22.830> tracking<00:02:22.950> set<00:02:23.370> up

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
you've got conversion tracking set up

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.330 
you've got conversion tracking set up
how<00:02:24.030> do<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.270> verify<00:02:24.810> if<00:02:25.500> you've<00:02:25.770> got<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.130> set

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
how do you verify if you've got it set

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.480 
how do you verify if you've got it set
up<00:02:26.460> it's<00:02:26.610> actually<00:02:26.940> really<00:02:27.150> simple<00:02:27.470> because

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
up it's actually really simple because

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.190 
up it's actually really simple because
Facebook<00:02:29.490> here<00:02:30.090> tells<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.720> if<00:02:30.840> it's<00:02:30.960> active

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
Facebook here tells you if it's active

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.310 
Facebook here tells you if it's active
to<00:02:31.860> unverified<00:02:33.110> if<00:02:34.110> it's<00:02:34.910> sometimes<00:02:35.910> it's

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
to unverified if it's sometimes it's

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.810 
to unverified if it's sometimes it's
inactive<00:02:37.320> meaning<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.100> been<00:02:38.280> verified<00:02:38.550> in

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
inactive meaning it's been verified in

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.120 
inactive meaning it's been verified in
past<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.240> nobody's<00:02:39.600> converted<00:02:40.110> recently<00:02:40.560> so

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
past but nobody's converted recently so

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.790 
past but nobody's converted recently so
the<00:02:41.400> way<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.210> you<00:02:42.330> do<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.530> way

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
the way that you do that is just the way

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.730 
the way that you do that is just the way
you<00:02:43.860> verify<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:45.000> simply<00:02:45.600> by<00:02:45.780> visiting<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
you verify it is simply by visiting the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.070 
you verify it is simply by visiting the
page<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:47.910> put<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.330> code<00:02:48.600> on<00:02:48.810> and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
page that you just put the code on and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.080 
page that you just put the code on and
then<00:02:49.560> give<00:02:49.740> it<00:02:49.770> 5<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.250> 10<00:02:50.430> minutes<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.940> come

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
then give it 5 to 10 minutes and come

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.270 
then give it 5 to 10 minutes and come
back<00:02:51.270> here<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.840> look<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.620> see<00:02:52.800> if<00:02:52.920> it's<00:02:53.040> been

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
back here and look to see if it's been

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.260 
back here and look to see if it's been
activated<00:02:53.700> if<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.660> hasn't<00:02:54.930> then<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.530> means

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
activated if it hasn't then that means

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.580 
activated if it hasn't then that means
there's<00:02:57.270> something<00:02:57.720> wrong<00:02:57.870> either<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.380> codes

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
there's something wrong either the codes

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.590 
there's something wrong either the codes
been<00:02:58.770> put<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.160> wrong<00:02:59.280> place<00:02:59.580> but<00:02:59.850> if<00:03:00.120> you
