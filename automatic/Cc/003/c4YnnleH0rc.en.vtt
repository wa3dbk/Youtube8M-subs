00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
was so bad that when i first installed

was so bad that when i first installed
the<00:01:14.850> new<00:01:15.000> patch<00:01:16.130> when<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> got<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.580> my<00:01:17.820> cabin

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the new patch when I got out of my cabin

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.030 
the new patch when I got out of my cabin
I<00:01:18.420> was<00:01:18.540> walking<00:01:18.869> across<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.229> ground<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.920> was

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
I was walking across the ground it was

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.660 
I was walking across the ground it was
just<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.400> walking<00:01:20.580> across<00:01:21.920> in<00:01:22.920> multiplayer

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
just like walking across in multiplayer

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.690 
just like walking across in multiplayer
I<00:01:23.850> would<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.330> pop<00:01:25.049> pop<00:01:25.439> pop<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.549> was

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
I would just pop pop pop and it was

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.690 
I would just pop pop pop and it was
really<00:01:27.090> really<00:01:27.630> bad<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:29.220> know<00:01:29.369> stutter

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
really really bad you know stutter

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.670 
really really bad you know stutter
stepping<00:01:30.060> across<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.659> ground<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.350> game<00:01:31.530> was

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
stepping across the ground the game was

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.670 
stepping across the ground the game was
almost<00:01:31.920> unplayable<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.990> solution<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
almost unplayable so the solution the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.770 
almost unplayable so the solution the
fix<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> go<00:01:35.759> back<00:01:35.939> into<00:01:36.240> my<00:01:36.509> game

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
fix to it was to go back into my game

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.219 
fix to it was to go back into my game
and<00:01:37.310> verify<00:01:38.310> my<00:01:38.520> cash<00:01:38.880> turned<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and verify my cash turned out that a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.770 
and verify my cash turned out that a
couple<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.680> files<00:01:40.920> didn't<00:01:41.460> download<00:01:41.780> properly

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
couple of files didn't download properly

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.560 
couple of files didn't download properly
