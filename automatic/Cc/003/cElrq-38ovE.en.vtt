00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hello my name is Anya and in this 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.950
 video I would like to make a review here we are 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.020
 such puzzles 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.460
 ever after high as you see here with us 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 invented novelties 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.590
 i certainly don't like raven characters but 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.719
 why is it of all the characters that have 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.720
 we are represented here 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.670
 see here copper and stick braer I chose 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.470
 for some reason, raven don't know why 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.330
 not true to me most just 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.980
 I liked Raven myself 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.349
 that here she is very beautiful here 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.140
 only 100 puzzles and i bought these 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.450
 puzzles to make them background 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.170
 for subsequent reviews for example on things 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.460
 or on a and let us open them 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.329
 open very easily here there 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.250
 such a valve and so this is taken out and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.809
 we don't have anything inside here anymore 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.520
 bag we have some more advertising 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.520
 but it is absolutely necessary 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.960
 need the fact open 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.780
 how to get out of the package sleep here 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.420
 these are paper chips 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.840
 here is this puzzle he put up a little everything 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.820
 here as you can see but I will glue it 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.970
 the rest seems to be in good condition 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.750
 only a little collected apparently them just 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.790
 boas are not fully attached and let's 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.920
 we will quickly gather here and I saw 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.580
 put these puzzles that we already had 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.710
 collected 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.180
 and here it is around the edges of me late 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.180
 which we have detached 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.070
 and very much so far I get 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.620
 as you can see puzzles compared to my 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.670
 hand and pretty small and first 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.670
 I thought that would not be more 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.780
 and that's what I did 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:02.280
 now we need to stick these puzzles on 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.280
 I took the cardboard 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.110
 we need to measure how much is here 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.990
 centimeters 21 and here from if too 20 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.730
 we take square day 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:21.640
 cardboard and measure out also 21 centimeters and with 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.290
 this side now we need 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.210
 glue stick can take absolutely 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.230
 any glue i will take a pencil because 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.230
 it dries faster than anyone 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.650
 and now dad sli or someone 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.120
 pieces we transfer here that is 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.120
 first i'm smearing 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:46.190
 world for example, well, I immediately took 2 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.190
 so we can do more 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.739
 and glue 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.020
 continue to catch 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.650
 uta glue and so do the remaining 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:11.989
 pause and leave to dry and that's what 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.510
 I got it I have a secret I have 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.160
 dried glue on the back country like this but 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.680
 the downside is absolutely not important 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.900
 because after all this I will 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.199
 use as background and when you will 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.330
 to glue 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.130
 but make sure you do not have different 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.229
 Here such returns to them 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.300
 need to get rid of not yet dried glue 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.009
 because all fingers manage especially 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.250
 you need to do well this first 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.560
 row when you align it already 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.870
 It will be much easier to glue the main 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.070
 look so that there are no big gaps well 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.050
 and that's all you wanted today 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.520
 tell if this video cheered up 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.800
 put likes subscribe to the channel 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.949
 go to the VKontakte group and it is given 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.949
