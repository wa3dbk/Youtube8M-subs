what you want to do is turn on the AC

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.300 
what you want to do is turn on the AC
right<00:02:21.840> now<00:02:21.930> they<00:02:22.080> seized<00:02:22.350> off<00:02:22.560> I'm<00:02:22.950> gonna<00:02:23.160> turn

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
right now they seized off I'm gonna turn

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.890 
right now they seized off I'm gonna turn
it<00:02:23.430> on<00:02:23.840> this<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:25.380> what<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.430> have<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.640> fan

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
it on this is on what you have to fan

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.250 
it on this is on what you have to fan
all<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.959> way<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.500> max<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.569> also<00:02:30.780> set

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
all the way to the max so and also set

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.280 
all the way to the max so and also set
it<00:02:31.350> for<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.709> mode<00:02:31.890> coming<00:02:32.550> out<00:02:32.670> from<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
it for so the mode coming out from the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.910 
it for so the mode coming out from the
the<00:02:34.290> center<00:02:34.800> events<00:02:35.459> here<00:02:35.610> all<00:02:36.600> right

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.690 

so<00:02:39.920> while<00:02:40.070> you<00:02:40.190> have<00:02:40.220> in<00:02:40.520> this<00:02:40.670> mode

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.250 

then<00:02:45.300> what<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.510> do<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.930> open<00:02:46.020> up

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
then what you do is that you open up

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.830 
then what you do is that you open up
your<00:02:46.470> hood<00:02:47.330> now<00:02:48.330> when<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.510> open<00:02:48.540> up<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.810> hood

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
your hood now when you open up the hood

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.470 
your hood now when you open up the hood
you'll<00:02:49.200> see<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:50.040> grille<00:02:50.580> similar<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:51.330> it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
you'll see a grille similar to this it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.540 
you'll see a grille similar to this it
could<00:02:51.569> be<00:02:51.629> on<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.810> side<00:02:52.170> also<00:02:52.400> that's<00:02:53.400> on

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
could be on that side also that's on

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.220 
could be on that side also that's on
your<00:02:53.640> side<00:02:53.849> basically<00:02:54.510> anytime<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.959> see<00:02:55.110> this

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
your side basically anytime you see this

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.170 
your side basically anytime you see this
type<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.470> grille<00:02:55.800> that's<00:02:56.519> for<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.730> air<00:02:56.849> intake

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
type of grille that's for the air intake

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.729 
type of grille that's for the air intake
you<00:02:57.420> want<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.690> shake<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.110> bottle<00:02:58.290> really<00:02:58.830> well

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
you want to shake the bottle really well

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:09.330 
you want to shake the bottle really well
and<00:03:01.739> spray<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.340> into<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.670> vents

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.360 

I'm<00:03:09.819> doing<00:03:10.090> for<00:03:10.239> about<00:03:10.300> 30<00:03:10.599> seconds<00:03:11.020> too

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.970 

all<00:03:14.819> right<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:15.720> after<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.200> spray<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.620> into

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
all right so after you spray it into

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:25.070 
all right so after you spray it into
there<00:03:22.760> we<00:03:23.760> wanted<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.180> switch<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.569> over<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.870> the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
there we wanted to switch it over to the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.009 
there we wanted to switch it over to the
heat<00:03:25.440> side<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.640> on<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.239> automatic<00:03:27.840> climate

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
heat side so on this automatic climate

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.390 
heat side so on this automatic climate
control<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.530> can<00:03:28.769> just<00:03:28.920> crank<00:03:29.069> up<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
control you can just crank up the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.940 
control you can just crank up the
temperature<00:03:29.599> until<00:03:30.599> you<00:03:30.660> get<00:03:30.810> heat<00:03:30.989> all<00:03:31.739> right

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
temperature until you get heat all right

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.030 
temperature until you get heat all right
and<00:03:32.489> repeat<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.970> same<00:03:33.120> procedure<00:03:33.950> where<00:03:34.950> you

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
and repeat the same procedure where you

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.970 
and repeat the same procedure where you
spray<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.660> intake<00:03:36.660> with<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> disinfectant

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
spray the intake with a disinfectant

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.259 
spray the intake with a disinfectant
after<00:03:40.980> you've<00:03:41.099> done<00:03:41.280> turn<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.640> off

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.270 

now<00:03:45.269> if<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.599> notice<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:46.080> after<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> few<00:03:47.160> weeks

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
now if you notice that after a few weeks

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.890 
now if you notice that after a few weeks
you<00:03:47.579> start<00:03:47.880> having<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.329> problem<00:03:48.660> with<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
you start having a problem with the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.809 
you start having a problem with the
smell<00:03:49.140> again<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:50.069> just<00:03:50.280> means<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.549> there's

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
smell again it just means that there's

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.309 
smell again it just means that there's
more<00:03:51.060> no<00:03:51.900> dude

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
more no dude

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.199 
more no dude
and<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.530> just<00:03:52.680> need<00:03:52.829> to<00:03:53.010> do<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.640> spray<00:03:53.910> again

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
and you just need to do that spray again

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.670 
and you just need to do that spray again
to<00:03:54.989> disinfect<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.849> okay<00:03:56.849> now<00:03:57.510> one<00:03:58.410> thing<00:03:58.560> I

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
to disinfect that okay now one thing I

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.770 
to disinfect that okay now one thing I
would<00:03:58.890> say<00:03:59.069> is<00:03:59.129> that<00:03:59.280> if<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.150> really<00:04:00.420> want<00:04:00.660> to

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
would say is that if you really want to

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.690 
would say is that if you really want to
avoid<00:04:01.140> having<00:04:01.319> this<00:04:01.620> type<00:04:01.799> of<00:04:01.829> problem<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.459> a

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
avoid having this type of problem is a

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.930 
avoid having this type of problem is a
one<00:04:03.299> is<00:04:03.510> if<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:04.200> know<00:04:04.349> that<00:04:04.560> your<00:04:04.829> car<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:05.579> cool

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
one is if you know that your car is cool

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.550 
one is if you know that your car is cool
enough<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.480> should<00:04:06.840> take<00:04:07.019> it<00:04:07.170> out<00:04:07.319> of<00:04:07.349> the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
enough you should take it out of the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.619 
enough you should take it out of the
recirculation<00:04:08.099> mode<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.030> get<00:04:09.209> fresh<00:04:09.450> air

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
recirculation mode so you get fresh air

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.330 
recirculation mode so you get fresh air
in<00:04:09.810> now<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.260> understand<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:10.799> in<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.010> very<00:04:11.190> hot

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
in now I understand that in a very hot

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.490 
in now I understand that in a very hot
climate<00:04:11.519> you<00:04:12.329> want<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.660> use<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.840> recirculation

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
climate you want to use a recirculation

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.770 
climate you want to use a recirculation
mode<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.459> make<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.849> air-conditioning

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
mode just to make the air-conditioning

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.080 
mode just to make the air-conditioning
much<00:04:15.930> cooler<00:04:16.260> but<00:04:16.949> again<00:04:17.220> once<00:04:17.489> your<00:04:17.639> car<00:04:18.000> is

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
much cooler but again once your car is

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.490 
much cooler but again once your car is
cool<00:04:18.299> enough<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:18.840> should<00:04:19.049> take<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.350> off<00:04:19.440> a

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
cool enough you should take it off a

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.430 
cool enough you should take it off a
recirc<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:21.660> other<00:04:21.810> thing<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:21.959> helps<00:04:22.139> a<00:04:22.289> lot

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
recirc the other thing that helps a lot

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.909 
recirc the other thing that helps a lot
if<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.740> do<00:04:22.860> garage<00:04:23.250> your<00:04:23.760> car<00:04:24.000> like<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.900> do<00:04:24.960> just
