00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
studio you will have a mirror on the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.650 
studio you will have a mirror on the
wall<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.550> don't<00:02:51.730> have<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.850> mirror<00:02:52.150> on<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.450> side

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
wall you don't have a mirror on the side

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.310 
wall you don't have a mirror on the side
of<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.840> road<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.850> really<00:02:55.090> have<00:02:55.240> to<00:02:55.360> get<00:02:56.200> in

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.199 
of the road so you really have to get in
an<00:02:56.440> idea<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.040> what<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.459> your<00:02:57.730> body's<00:02:58.030> doing

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
see what happens from there but the idea

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.200

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
is to run in place against the wall and

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.730 
is to run in place against the wall and
not<00:04:26.169> bang<00:04:26.889> your<00:04:27.250> knees<00:04:27.550> into<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.510> wall<00:04:28.740> and

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.350 
not bang your knees into the wall and
then<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.190> curious<00:04:30.639> result<00:04:30.940> will<00:04:31.060> come<00:04:31.090> out<00:04:31.300> of

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
then a curious result will come out of

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:52.800 
then a curious result will come out of
that<00:04:31.419> see<00:04:32.020> if<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:32.169> can<00:04:32.289> notice

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.590 

so<00:04:53.810> anyway<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:55.490> thing<00:04:55.759> I<00:04:55.850> hope<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.240> noticed

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
so anyway the thing I hope you noticed

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.670 
so anyway the thing I hope you noticed
is<00:04:56.780> that<00:04:57.229> when<00:04:58.069> you<00:04:58.430> are<00:04:58.460> running<00:04:59.030> against<00:04:59.840> the

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
is that when you are running against the

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:10.779 
is that when you are running against the
wall<00:05:02.139> and<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:05.050> are<00:05:07.509> jogging<00:05:08.509> in<00:05:08.780> place<00:05:09.789> you

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
wall and you are jogging in place you

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.570 
wall and you are jogging in place you
can't<00:05:11.030> lift<00:05:11.210> your<00:05:11.360> knees<00:05:11.509> and<00:05:12.250> she<00:05:13.250> running

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
can't lift your knees and she running

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.469 
can't lift your knees and she running
that's<00:05:13.759> one<00:05:13.880> of<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.000> things<00:05:14.150> you<00:05:14.240> try<00:05:14.419> to

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
that's one of the things you try to

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.409 
that's one of the things you try to
avoid<00:05:14.690> is<00:05:14.870> lifting<00:05:15.349> your<00:05:15.380> knees<00:05:16.300> so<00:05:17.300> when

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
avoid is lifting your knees so when

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:18.999 
avoid is lifting your knees so when
you're<00:05:17.509> running<00:05:17.720> in<00:05:17.810> place<00:05:17.960> and<00:05:18.620> you<00:05:18.770> can't

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
you're running in place and you can't

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.460 
you're running in place and you can't
look<00:05:19.130> at<00:05:19.310> me<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:20.300> first<00:05:20.330> thing<00:05:20.900> that<00:05:20.930> actually

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
look at me the first thing that actually

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.810 
look at me the first thing that actually
hits<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:22.539> ground<00:05:24.009> is<00:05:25.009> the<00:05:25.280> ball<00:05:25.400> of<00:05:25.520> your<00:05:25.639> foot

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
hits the ground is the ball of your foot

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.290 
hits the ground is the ball of your foot
not<00:05:26.259> your<00:05:27.259> heel<00:05:27.699> so<00:05:28.699> if<00:05:28.759> your<00:05:28.880> heel<00:05:29.090> is<00:05:29.270> not

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
not your heel so if your heel is not

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.230 
not your heel so if your heel is not
leading<00:05:29.750> you<00:05:30.020> can't<00:05:30.289> feel<00:05:30.530> strike<00:05:31.150> so<00:05:32.150> the

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
leading you can't feel strike so the

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.279 
leading you can't feel strike so the
idea<00:05:32.750> is<00:05:32.990> to<00:05:33.130> practice<00:05:34.130> that<00:05:34.400> you<00:05:35.300> know<00:05:35.449> five

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
idea is to practice that you know five

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.100 
idea is to practice that you know five
minutes<00:05:36.680> or<00:05:36.800> so<00:05:36.979> and<00:05:37.250> then<00:05:38.120> when<00:05:38.810> you<00:05:38.930> get

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
minutes or so and then when you get

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.570 
minutes or so and then when you get
ready<00:05:39.320> to<00:05:39.410> give<00:05:39.560> run<00:05:39.830> whether<00:05:40.160> it's<00:05:40.370> on<00:05:40.550> a

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
ready to give run whether it's on a

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.820 
ready to give run whether it's on a
track<00:05:41.120> on<00:05:41.479> a<00:05:41.570> road<00:05:41.960> or<00:05:42.139> a<00:05:42.169> trail<00:05:42.289> whatever

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
track on a road or a trail whatever

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.480 
track on a road or a trail whatever
start<00:05:43.370> out<00:05:43.750> doing<00:05:44.750> that<00:05:46.090> heel<00:05:47.090> lifting<00:05:48.490> or

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
start out doing that heel lifting or

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.390 
start out doing that heel lifting or
keeping<00:05:49.849> the<00:05:50.000> knees<00:05:50.300> in<00:05:50.720> one<00:05:51.650> position<00:05:51.889> and

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
keeping the knees in one position and

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.680 
keeping the knees in one position and
running<00:05:53.150> in<00:05:53.270> place<00:05:53.569> and<00:05:54.490> then<00:05:55.659> move<00:05:56.659> forward

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
running in place and then move forward

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.800 
running in place and then move forward
with<00:05:57.349> it<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:57.710> it<00:05:58.699> she<00:05:59.060> only<00:05:59.180> takes<00:05:59.479> a<00:05:59.599> while

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
with it and it she only takes a while

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.450 
with it and it she only takes a while
and<00:05:59.990> get<00:06:00.080> used<00:06:00.320> to<00:06:00.409> it's<00:06:01.070> not<00:06:01.159> something

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
and get used to it's not something
