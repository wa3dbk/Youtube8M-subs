00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.990 

so<00:00:03.710> the<00:00:03.800> first<00:00:04.040> thing<00:00:04.220> I<00:00:04.340> had<00:00:04.460> to<00:00:04.550> do<00:00:04.700> is<00:00:04.819> cut

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
so the first thing I had to do is cut

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.610 
so the first thing I had to do is cut
this<00:00:05.149> baffle<00:00:05.630> down<00:00:05.779> to<00:00:05.990> an<00:00:06.109> acceptable<00:00:06.559> size

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
this baffle down to an acceptable size

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.600 
this baffle down to an acceptable size
because<00:00:09.620> the<00:00:09.769> way<00:00:09.889> it<00:00:10.010> was<00:00:10.160> was<00:00:10.400> too<00:00:10.610> big<00:00:12.610> nice

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
because the way it was was too big nice

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.930 
because the way it was was too big nice
old<00:00:14.120> grill<00:00:14.480> cloth<00:00:17.740> and<00:00:18.740> you<00:00:18.980> here's<00:00:19.880> the

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
old grill cloth and you here's the

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.490 
old grill cloth and you here's the
beginning<00:00:20.180> of<00:00:20.539> my<00:00:20.690> box<00:00:22.660> just<00:00:23.660> look<00:00:23.990> from<00:00:24.230> the

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
beginning of my box just look from the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:35.290 
beginning of my box just look from the
inside<00:00:32.739> so<00:00:33.739> finally<00:00:34.100> got<00:00:34.250> nice<00:00:34.489> enough<00:00:34.850> that<00:00:35.269> I

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
inside so finally got nice enough that I

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.090 
inside so finally got nice enough that I
could<00:00:35.600> bring<00:00:35.960> this<00:00:36.170> outside<00:00:36.409> and<00:00:36.679> do<00:00:36.949> my

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
could bring this outside and do my

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.099 
could bring this outside and do my
routing<00:00:37.429> and<00:00:37.969> I<00:00:38.809> get<00:00:38.989> my<00:00:39.879> control<00:00:40.879> panel<00:00:41.109> cut

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
routing and I get my control panel cut

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.040 
routing and I get my control panel cut
out<00:00:42.550> in<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.699> top<00:00:43.940> here<00:00:44.210> I'll<00:00:44.359> have<00:00:44.510> handles<00:00:44.899> on

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
out in the top here I'll have handles on

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.599 
out in the top here I'll have handles on
the<00:00:45.170> side<00:00:49.359> anywho<00:00:51.159> some<00:00:52.159> more<00:00:52.280> stuff<00:00:52.579> here

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
the side anywho some more stuff here

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.129 
the side anywho some more stuff here
that<00:00:53.170> will<00:00:54.170> go<00:00:54.289> together<00:00:54.440> eventually<00:00:56.139> and

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:57.139 
that will go together eventually and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:08.870 
that will go together eventually and
here's<00:00:57.620> my<00:00:57.920> control<00:00:58.579> panel<00:00:59.799> here

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.170 

well<00:01:09.390> he<00:01:09.480> wasn't<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.930> fun<00:01:10.729> or<00:01:11.729> shirts<00:01:11.970> where

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
well he wasn't that fun or shirts where

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.850 
well he wasn't that fun or shirts where
my<00:01:12.330> reverb<00:01:12.720> keys<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.200> go<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.590> little

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
my reverb keys will go in that little

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.969 
my reverb keys will go in that little
slot<00:01:13.979> right<00:01:14.130> there<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.810> cut<00:01:16.380> my<00:01:16.680> holes

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
slot right there so I just cut my holes

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.140 
slot right there so I just cut my holes
in<00:01:17.370> for<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.140> handles<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.850> just<00:01:20.850> got<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
in for the handles I just got the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.270 
in for the handles I just got the
handles<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.050> could<00:01:22.560> actually<00:01:22.860> measure

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
handles in so I could actually measure

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.100 
handles in so I could actually measure
them<00:01:24.380> they<00:01:25.380> actually<00:01:25.530> worked<00:01:25.890> pretty<00:01:25.979> good

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
them they actually worked pretty good

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.600 
them they actually worked pretty good
this<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.619> top<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:30.830> you've<00:01:31.830> got<00:01:32.040> handles<00:01:32.460> on

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
this is the top so you've got handles on

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.180 
this is the top so you've got handles on
each<00:01:32.759> side<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:34.140> they're<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> get

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
each side and they're not going to get

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.260 
each side and they're not going to get
in<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.580> way<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:38.340> speakers<00:01:38.820> or<00:01:39.030> anything

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
in the way of the speakers or anything

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.389 
in the way of the speakers or anything
else<00:01:39.600> inside<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:42.210> got<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.920> rest<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
else inside and I got the rest of the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.100 
else inside and I got the rest of the
tabs<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.539> the<00:01:45.660> back<00:01:47.720> which<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
tabs on for the back which is going to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.880 
tabs on for the back which is going to
be<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> pegboard<00:01:50.060> type<00:01:51.060> thing<00:01:51.330> just<00:01:51.630> keep<00:01:52.259> dust
