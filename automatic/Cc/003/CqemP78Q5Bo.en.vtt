00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.570
 today we are in the company of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.570
 the last volvo life 40 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.989
 40 of 3,250 horses 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.879
 a 150 burgundy games engine that offers 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.600
 quite interesting performances 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.600
 the proof in pictures 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.079
 inside this v 40 a saddlery 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.399
 leather welcomes you the least that one 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.740
 can say that we are very good 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.420
 installed and there is even the setting for 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.789
 the lumbar certainly not practical 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.350
 access but it's still not there 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.310
 very simple so fresh with a few 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.259
 minutes of training we get there on 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.810
 the leather steering wheel we find a few 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.750
 commands especially for the phone or 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.950
 still the speed limiter 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.140
 the dashboard is meanwhile 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.110
 digital and propose quantity 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.149
 information including speed 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.610
 average consumption but also a 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.979
 right indicator to optimize your 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.030
 fuel consumption in you 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.420
 indicating when does it take 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.099
 change gear next to the button 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.170
 vehicle start especially a screen 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.480
 which is not tactile but is full 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.420
 still a lot of information 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.650
 especially my because you end up 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.230
 different options that can be 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.720
 disabled statistics course drive 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.250
 it is to optimize its behavior 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.569
 here you can also disable the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.730
 start stop is just below 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.130
 a lot of advice on driving 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.260
 ecologic enough funny elsewhere 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.160
 to have integrated this stuff on 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.160
 a model that is not hybrid 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.190
 also the settings there you can 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.710
 change and really personalize your 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.030
 vehicle to take part but of 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.780
 Parma and lighting vehicles 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.240
 the interior lighting you can 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.690
 edit back up a little bit here's here 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.420
 you have a purple wing 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:16.070
 you can put it for example in 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:20.340
 white in yellow or red 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.720
 he has like that 7 6 or 7 colors 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.440
 different with you can also 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.440
 adjust the intensity 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.160
 short a lot a lot of options say 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.010
 of two choices of people a lot of 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.570
 choice of customization 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:45.760
 you also have the phone 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.500
 so all that is not necessarily seen 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.400
 well to the days but the pommel of 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.400
 speed is backlit 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.810
 here at buttons maybe more classic 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.840
 the backup radar equipped otherwise 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.880
 a camera that can be activated even 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.680
 while stopped or while driving in 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.720
 forward but low pace around 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.370
 of 10 15 km maximum hour the bliss does 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.500
 also part of the options it's a 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.090
 dead angle detector that becomes 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.090
 orange when it detects an obstacle 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.770
 in the back we are just as good 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.840
 stay the case the front and you the 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.700
 see also there is room made 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.920
 that one of the big legs with also 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.020
 a central armrest and a small 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.130
 tab to open twelve slots 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:37.710
 drinks the backseat is time 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:42.690
 otherwise foldable 1/3 2/3 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:46.720
 the chest offers a floor up 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.910
 foldable below which you 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.880
 find a compartment that hides the 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:56.770
 wheel on this test model you 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:59.910
 find the wheels 18 inches but 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.910
 also the electric panoramic roof 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.939
 world premiere on this v 40 a 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.939
 pedestrian airbag 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.440
