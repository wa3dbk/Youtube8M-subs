00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 good afternoon youtube people in this 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.099
 opportunity I will talk to you about 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.349
 some applications that can 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.259
 download for the place everything for the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.490
 blakburn the first application that 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.740
 I'm going to show it's called maestri I calculated 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.020
 calculated 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.910
 practically what it allows us to do 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.800
 this application is to draw the 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:31.740
 operations and it will give us the result 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:35.930
 we can do division for example 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.750
 the result or even the root 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.020
 sports 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.830
 for example that the 4 by 6 24 there is 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.160
 an application is called darwin neon and what 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:52.420
 that allows us to be is to draw 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.660
 and we can save these drawings 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.460
 this is changing colors also by 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.730
 example of the blackboard 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.909
 There are about five black colors that 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.490
 it's practically black and it can 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.950
 serve as to erase as the background is 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.460
 Black also gives the option to save 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.760
 that drawing or open an image by 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.190
 example this rabbit 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.090
 up here and give it a shading 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.090
 how can you see 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.890
 and save this new image of 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.880
 applications here are practically 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.880
 for children at home we are allowed 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.220
 do also the same as the previous 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.340
 drawings but practically we already do it 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.290
 as if it were a brush because as 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.570
 can you see if I do it fast in lines 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.479
 straight or if I do it then of 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.790
 maturity or if I do well end a 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.230
 point 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.120
 gives us colors for example half lead 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.800
 it's practically like to give 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.590
 shaded as they can shading and 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.230
 a red color also that you can 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.230
 put a signature or your drawing 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.180
 this also has the same as interior 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.150
 or save share them in your networks 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.440
 for example here you can see from 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.080
 in front of facebook to drive or to hall 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.040
 medication and I know you 're going to like your 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.829
 name these challenges 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.939
 and it is practically what allows us 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.939
 make this application 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.920
 in a photo to delete an object 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.200
 disappear it like for example here 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.960
 we have I do not know if you can see this in 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.470
 a room and here in small there is a rabbit 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.330
 what we are going to do with this application is 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.540
 erase it and for that we have to shade 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.450
 well here that men a color 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.860
 red and here comes the image we sow 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.520
 in larger this will allow us 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.920
 that we want to erase as they see there is and 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.010
 the last thing you have to give him only finish 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.910
 the little triangle that says is and how they see 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.100
 it has disappeared 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.620
 it is the truth is a good application will 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.030
 I have tried many times as for example 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.770
 I have my picture of a beach and what I'm going 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:26.770
 to do is practically disappear 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:30.070
 As you can see I'm going to amaze everything 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.860
 and there it is once shaded we give it in 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.440
 the little triangle and we hope that the 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.520
 application to your magic as you can see 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.430
 there is what has disappeared 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.200
 would miss only is the shadow that this 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.960
 I think it would be easier for me 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.740
 disappeared a shadow will not take anything 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.860
 there it is and it was practically a beach 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.860
 without mythic obviously that already after 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:01.340
 edit we can save it 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:04.879
 hold on the album and we click here 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.590
 will not ask for the name we put a 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.640
 name and we give it is the fifth 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.430
 application this is a very good game it 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.530
 I recommend him his name is to destroy and 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.090
 a rcp 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:24.230
 here we are in the game menu by 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.290
 example if next mission is the mission that 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.330
 we are going to have to complete you by 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.820
 example that you are editing in the third 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.950
 you are going to start in the first 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.740
 this game is practically controlling 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.690
 this robot and kill the robots that already 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.010
 I 'm going to show you scoop is for the 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.500
 missions that we have already completed the 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.210
 we can play again so 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.520
 this one earn more points and those points we 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.900
 they are going to serve here to build 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.110
 add skills to the robot this as 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.310
 come here I have only put three but 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.430
 here I can click on the one that is 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.919
 empty and if they keep playing 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.750
 they're going to release more skills than you 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.750
 can add to your robot 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.240
 this and they keep playing when you playing 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.240
 they will also release what are the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.450
 other models this robot that comes 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.270
 here is the normal model there are two others 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:30.260
 models plus one half silver and the 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:34.330
 final model are very good and right now 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.330
 I will show you how to play 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.479
 the application and the last the game is 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:16.020
 call half a class of frames that we're going 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:18.509
 to be still not and good practically 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.490
 you are going to start on this little flag 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:25.289
 I'm going home already went to the third 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:27.420
 practically and I'll show you more or 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.960
 less how is this game 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:33.630
 you are going to start with these three 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.460
 towers and as they go when they go to 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.530
 release the following towers that 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.780
 they will help much , for example, 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.880
 game is very simple here are going to be the 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.730
 soldiers that are going to want to enter this 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.390
 castle what you have to do is 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:51.129
 put the towers to avoid that 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.849
 enter the 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:57.759
 the soldiers so that it does not harm 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:07:00.129
 Castilla can give you two if you 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:03.550
 he does not like to express much there goes 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:07.650
 increasing speed and so 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:10.580
 successively they can put more this 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:14.850
 towers and up can also raise 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:18.210
 You will make them stronger in exchange for 45 and 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:20.650
 I have there go now and down done first 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.350
 went down 5 down 8 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:26.139
 and I hope you liked the 6 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:28.389
 applications that I showed you is 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:29.919
 If there is any question or any question 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:32.229
 consultation can be left in the 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:38.379
 comments and do not forget to give a 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:40.659
 like the video and I'll upload another video with 

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:44.550
 other very good applications that 

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:44.550
 They will like you later bye
