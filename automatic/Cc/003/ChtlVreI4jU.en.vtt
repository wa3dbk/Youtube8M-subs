00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.319 
find a way around it which kind of sucks
but<00:01:34.710> they<00:01:35.070> fixed<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:35.970> guess

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
but they fixed that and then i guess

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.749 
but they fixed that and then i guess
whatever<00:01:36.570> other<00:01:36.900> glitches<00:01:37.290> or<00:01:37.619> ways<00:01:37.950> people

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
whatever other glitches or ways people

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.600 
whatever other glitches or ways people
found<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.780> these<00:01:40.320> money<00:01:40.680> lobbies<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.159> RP

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
found to do these money lobbies and RP

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.280 
found to do these money lobbies and RP
lobbies<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.000> stuff<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.930> that's

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
lobbies and stuff like that so that's

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.490 
lobbies and stuff like that so that's
good<00:01:43.560> now<00:01:44.070> i<00:01:44.340> think<00:01:44.549> they<00:01:44.970> did<00:01:45.240> say<00:01:45.509> i<00:01:45.840> think

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
good now i think they did say i think

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.710 
good now i think they did say i think
was<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.860> twitter<00:01:47.189> i<00:01:47.460> saw<00:01:48.000> somewhere<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
was on twitter i saw somewhere that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.399 
was on twitter i saw somewhere that
later<00:01:49.729> there<00:01:50.729> are<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:52.020> i<00:01:52.229> guess

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
later there are going to be like i guess

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.590 
later there are going to be like i guess
its<00:01:52.649> processing<00:01:53.460> all<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.850> information<00:01:54.420> all

be freaking mad and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.490 
be freaking mad and
that<00:02:09.720> ain't<00:02:09.869> going<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.049> be<00:02:10.110> good<00:02:10.200> for<00:02:10.379> rock

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
that ain't going to be good for rock

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.780 
that ain't going to be good for rock
star<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:10.860> they're<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.340> know<00:02:11.370> they're<00:02:11.459> trying

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
star so they're you know they're trying

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.319 
star so they're you know they're trying
to<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.970> careful<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:13.459> I'm<00:02:14.459> assuming<00:02:14.909> you<00:02:15.269> know

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
to be careful and I'm assuming you know

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.869 
to be careful and I'm assuming you know
they<00:02:15.450> have<00:02:15.599> people<00:02:16.140> or<00:02:16.319> whatever<00:02:16.879> going

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
they have people or whatever going

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.610 
they have people or whatever going
through<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.329> system<00:02:18.510> figuring<00:02:19.439> out<00:02:19.590> all

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
through the system figuring out all

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.319 
through the system figuring out all
right<00:02:19.920> look<00:02:20.250> here's<00:02:20.489> five<00:02:20.700> hundred<00:02:21.030> billion

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
right look here's five hundred billion

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.660 
right look here's five hundred billion
dollars<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:21.989> guy<00:02:22.170> was<00:02:22.349> given<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:23.549> know

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
dollars that this guy was given you know

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.539 
dollars that this guy was given you know
clearly<00:02:24.510> that's<00:02:24.750> not<00:02:24.900> real<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:26.099> then<00:02:26.250> they<00:02:26.370> can

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
clearly that's not real so then they can

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.190 
clearly that's not real so then they can
take<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.909> out<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.180> that's<00:02:27.840> what<00:02:28.079> they're

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
take that out and that's what they're

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.080 
take that out and that's what they're
probably<00:02:28.439> doing<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:29.099> don't<00:02:29.700> know<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:29.939> it's

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
probably doing I don't know if it's

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.789 
probably doing I don't know if it's
actually<00:02:30.420> going<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.629> be<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> patch<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.230> takes

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
actually going to be a patch that takes

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.410 
actually going to be a patch that takes
it<00:02:31.950> away<00:02:32.040> or<00:02:32.340> because<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:33.030> they<00:02:33.150> can't

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
it away or because because they can't

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.509 
it away or because because they can't
hotfix<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.049> game<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.470> they<00:02:34.950> probably<00:02:35.220> can

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
hotfix the game so they probably can

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.800 
hotfix the game so they probably can
just<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.000> know<00:02:36.090> hit<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.269> button<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.720> you

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
just like you know hit a button and you

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.399 
just like you know hit a button and you
wipe<00:02:37.379> them<00:02:37.560> all<00:02:37.709> out<00:02:37.790> but<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.170> pretty

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
wipe them all out but that is pretty

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.490 
wipe them all out but that is pretty
much<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.739> pageant<00:02:41.609> nothing<00:02:41.970> too<00:02:42.209> crazy

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
much the pageant nothing too crazy

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.839 
much the pageant nothing too crazy
hopefully<00:02:43.500> we<00:02:43.590> won't<00:02:43.680> be<00:02:43.889> seeing<00:02:44.099> DNS<00:02:44.519> servers

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
hopefully we won't be seeing DNS servers

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.330 
hopefully we won't be seeing DNS servers
again<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.450> while<00:02:45.659> like<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.319> said<00:02:46.379> his<00:02:47.129> those

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
again for a while like I said his those

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.059 
again for a while like I said his those

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
don't know when they're gonna do this

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.110 
don't know when they're gonna do this

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
but then one of the patches like wiped

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.750 
but then one of the patches like wiped
it<00:03:04.500> clean<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.769> then<00:03:05.069> people<00:03:05.489> were<00:03:05.579> mad
