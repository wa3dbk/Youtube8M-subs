have a fairly shallow depth of field or
area<00:00:50.879> focus<00:00:51.980> now<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.219> was<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.520> change<00:00:53.730> this

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
area focus now if I was to change this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.200 
area focus now if I was to change this
to<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> higher<00:00:54.989> aperture<00:00:55.699> such<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:58.100> f11

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.830 

we<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.390> see<00:01:03.630> that<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.410> area<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.190> focus<00:01:05.840> gets

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
we can see that this area of focus gets

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.770 
we can see that this area of focus gets
larger<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.640> that<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.760> an<00:01:08.880> example<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.510> depth

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
larger and that is an example of depth

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.640 
larger and that is an example of depth

maintain that filmic look that DSLRs are
famous<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.660> you<00:01:30.660> need<00:01:30.870> to<00:01:31.020> maintain<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:32.450> lower

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
