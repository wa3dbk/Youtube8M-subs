 point I knew that here to cancún for 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.970
 enter the team to see how they go and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.460
 miguel has seen the media has 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.080
 requested that the first matches be 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.610
 postpone because you have a lot 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.219
 National selected by regulation 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.570
 you are given that option what happens with the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.739
 america what will happen to the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.420
 renovations on all the people are 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.039
 waiting for it in fact benítez 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.719
 the process looks really we are 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:46.570
 waiting exactly in the institutes 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.239
 probably the decision comes that 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.479
 is going to take as it deactivates he has 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.269
 contract 500 years of contract and we 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.119
 we want is that I love him too but 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.440
 204 as Ricardo has also seen 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.149
 osorio that yes but is not happy and 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.979
 wants to leave, we'll just wait until 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.070
 I take the decision when it has 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:08.200
 a formal proposal that's why 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.789
 we are also in plan b so that 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.000
 we hold on and with one hand behind and 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.830
 another in front of breaking options but the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.569
 first option but some that chuchos 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.030
 continue within the group mónica has 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:21.700
 released some statements miguel 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.360
 about what a team can be a 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.130
 dynasty team a historical team 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.759
 you really consider it that way or it's nothing 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.300
 more the challenge itself than a technician when 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.000
 he is champion he has it in his head 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.150
 first I think the team is fine 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.960
 why Mexicans is difficult 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.580
 suddenly dynasties or 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.330
 situation as well as in those campaigns 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.400
 of the championísimo chivas with the 34 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.870
 titles of other america insurance because 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.110
 it's so even football is no longer 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.880
 so many to open be sorry in 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.130
 the equipment is difficult but good 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.560
 obviously we have a great 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.990
 campus a year and a half ago to know that 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.340
 the team is the best team in the tournament 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.930
 there is no doubt once are the numbers 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.840
 new to the level with the title already 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.330
 we just keep thinking that this is 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.770
 well and if we do not have it 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.990
 to reaffirm it we look for the bicampeonato 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.810
 some of us are going to try and 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.230
 we also try to get to look for 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.920
 Children find disqualifying the world 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.320
 like that is our idea is our 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.910
 thought and we will continue with 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.980
 those things I am that determination that 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.300
 since we arrived to look for the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.700
 team was out champion and today 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.220
 thankfully to three tournaments already 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.060
 we achieved that goal then we had 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.800
 that reaffirm what has been done, two will come 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.090
 competitions you do not do like the tuca 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.250
 ferretti that you have a garbage 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.890
 I imagine that the concachampions or the conca 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.660
 puddles or half puddles or how you 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.820
 let's call that tournament that is medium 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.980
 Bananas because the first round you have to 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.930
 quite comfortable levels there are and all 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.940
 arrange for you to reach a final with 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.980
 Mexican teams I do not think you throw it to 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.740
 the garbage if I put cars for them 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.720
 a tournament that maybe not named after 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.220
 all games do not have 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.850
 in many forces until it touches you 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.800
 play with the Mexican teams but the 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.510
 end of the tornado is very good really 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.280
 without luck the tournament of 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.220
 take you to the club world cup and it's where 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.320
 you really start something different or 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.750
 transcend in some way then with 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.490
 that idea we're not going to leave 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.650
 none of the tournaments are the 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.480
 visits are all down Miguel because 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.610
 is going to be to costa rica to play against 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.350
 coherence will you go to panama what against 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.970
 a team that I hope you can take a 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.340
 picture and me the hand of saint 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:47.350
 it's called sporting san miguelito si 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.900
 really that guys touch until 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.680
 the European and now good to think what 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.690
 in winning three games to 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.590
 pass it to the quarter round 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.600
 traditional 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.220
 Well, Miguel, I hope you do it for the 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.020
 good of Americanism that we are 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.330
 happy we keep celebrating and we continue 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.310
 every day drunk fat team liver 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.310
 has grown in a disproportionate way 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:16.660
 Miguel Hey, you and I have been together 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.430
 in transmissions where it is involved 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.810
 the Mexican team and I would like 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.590
 know your point of view of what you have 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.280
 seen from mexico what do you think of the 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.800
 Mexican soccer team 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.020
 I think if we missed seeing this for 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.490
 I wreak harsh environment I am 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.490
 is beginning with your prayers 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.449
 an array that we wanted and walter 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.159
 veltroni such already there are forms and forms of 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.589
 lose proposed a power we are 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:48.439
 all agree but site that 

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:49.779
 obviously mexico could have much more 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.919
 protagonism but good those 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:53.990
 technical circumstances have to say 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.460
 that is not the unconditional support 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.129
 there must be for you do not take back the 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.539
 Trust not 22 years and a year ago 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.059
 we did working well being doing 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.460
 very good things and we have forgotten 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:08.029
 it's just happening to us all because 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:12.610
 they have lost confidence and have not taken 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:15.529
 that confidence they had to win the 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.089
 gold medal with the kids for 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:19.490
 organize a good team that happened to 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:21.680
 hexagonal and that has made matches 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.589
 important because I'm sure it's 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.149
 important to support them and we are really 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:28.149
 all dismayed to play 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:38.569
 with the technician and the trusted technician 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:41.300
 for the hexagon I do not say in the group 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:44.240
 but of course 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.039
 Mexico puts trust for subscribers 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.659
 -miguel good afternoon greets you luis 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.030
 castle since you arrived at 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:52.669
 american you have never denied that desire 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.680
 legitimate of any coach in 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.960
 some time to manage the 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.139
 Mexican selection 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.120
 would you like we go in 6 that by such ethics 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.970
 Do not say it but you already mentioned 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.009
 name to direct for how it has gone to 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.599
 the selection in the hexagonal you 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.069
 would you dare to load that selection in the 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.259
 hexagonal when you are missing four 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.690
 matches 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:16.490
 first of all before as an addition 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.440
 very skeptical as I believe that today the 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.840
 today and I tell you sincerely 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.970
 as a fan of selection because the 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.380
 selection has no cons against 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.599
 all or all of you long are the 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.580
 elections like america the consul that 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:30.889
 Tigers take over who touches 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.320
 he has his team and he can hate another 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.360
 but here all the axico and I think 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.490
 as an amateur this is a time to 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.350
 finish your process watching the world 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:43.870
 let's hope it improves differently 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.700
 I do obviously feel like lifting 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.950
 my hand when I see the opportunity 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.650
 I believe that this maternal process 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.420
 would violate much taste because it started 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.520
 doing them all very well and you will have to 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.650
 resume their path and they like 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.080
 amateur I talk to you I'm trying to 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:02.010
 support it to the maximum because it is important 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.010
 for him requesting 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.249
 the process rush with brazil 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:13.929
 Like the morning check in miguel 

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:17.019
 if that is clear 

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:20.999
 I 've always felt ready to 

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:20.999
 take a selection process 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.720
 but I think that's important 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.780
 support the time to take back the 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.000
 trust and rate the court well 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:35.210
 build the world 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.190
 different world thank you very much miguel 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.170
 you see castilla is saying I'm going to 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.380
 see miguel herrera sitting on day 5 of 

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:44.090
 september in the eliminatory and jiménez 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.620
 this is beagle crazy we go 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.330
 to stop the american for god but 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.670
 Miguel could lead the Americas and the 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:53.939
 selection at the same time is drunk 

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.939
 [Music] 

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:59.060
 they're going to see what I'm going to be saying about 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:03.490
 television but I hope the process 

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.490
 next china championship 

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:17.360
 it cost us a lot of level 

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.690
 equally 1 rude and greetings thanks to 

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.690
