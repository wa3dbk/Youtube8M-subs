00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
at the Sol pro helios solar charger this

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.429 
at the Sol pro helios solar charger this
is<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.260> hair<00:00:22.619> under<00:00:22.859> 5<00:00:23.369> watts<00:00:24.230> it<00:00:25.230> has<00:00:25.410> a

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
is just a hair under 5 watts it has a

five thousand milliamp hour battery in

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.130 
five thousand milliamp hour battery in
it<00:00:28.760> so<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.849> sort<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.300> plastic<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.990> guess

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
it so it's sort of a plastic I guess

a<00:01:09.090> nice<00:01:09.240> touch<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.869> gosh<00:01:10.500> I've<00:01:10.740> lost<00:01:10.950> these

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189

a nice touch but gosh I've lost these
things<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.490> couple<00:01:11.640> times<00:01:12.000> already<00:01:12.780> but<00:01:13.229> I

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
things a couple times already but I

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.399 
things a couple times already but I
don't<00:01:14.850> know<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.360> they're<00:01:15.630> essential<00:01:16.229> but

don't know that they're essential but

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.690 
don't know that they're essential but
I'll<00:01:16.500> probably<00:01:16.650> make<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.070> last<00:01:17.250> longer<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
I'll probably make it last longer if you

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.480 
I'll probably make it last longer if you
keep<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> plugs<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:19.100> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> other<00:01:20.340> end

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
keep the plugs in it on the other end

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.600 
keep the plugs in it on the other end
you<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.259> basically<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> charge<00:01:23.100> there's
