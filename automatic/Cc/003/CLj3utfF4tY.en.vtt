00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.340 
this is because to me my stick looks
like<00:00:16.730> totally<00:00:17.730> none<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> colors<00:00:19.050> it's

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
like totally none of the colors it's

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.830

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
LCD - as you know I had three days of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.920 
LCD - as you know I had three days of
loading<00:00:56.579> which<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> kind<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.480> different<00:00:57.690> from

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
loading which is kind of different from

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.340 
loading which is kind of different from
the<00:00:58.050> normal<00:00:58.440> -<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.010> gained<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.059> total<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.600> 3.6

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the normal - I gained a total of 3.6

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.420 
the normal - I gained a total of 3.6
pounds<00:01:01.859> loading<00:01:02.730> um<00:01:03.439> and<00:01:04.610> that<00:01:05.610> was<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:06.540> gain<00:01:06.869> of

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
pounds loading um and that was a gain of

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.359 
pounds loading um and that was a gain of
1.6<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.670> first<00:01:08.939> day<00:01:09.270> point<00:01:10.200> 6<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.799> next<00:01:11.130> day

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
1.6 the first day point 6 the next day

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.950 
1.6 the first day point 6 the next day
and<00:01:11.900> then<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.530> point<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.240> third<00:01:15.509> day<00:01:15.750> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and then one point for the third day I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.890 
and then one point for the third day I
think<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:16.979> started<00:01:17.520> after<00:01:18.270> loading<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.750> one

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
think so I started after loading at one

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.609 
think so I started after loading at one
forty<00:01:19.290> nine<00:01:19.470> point<00:01:19.920> two<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.810> chose<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.590> a

forty nine point two I chose to do a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.789 
forty nine point two I chose to do a

fat fast but fast so I drank almost two

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.929 
fat fast but fast so I drank almost two
gallons<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.130> water<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> didn't<00:01:29.850> eat

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
gallons of water and I didn't eat

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.789 
gallons of water and I didn't eat
anything<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.829> honest<00:01:32.250> um<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:33.799> was

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
anything and to be honest um I was

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
anything and to be honest um I was
hardly<00:01:35.100> hungry<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.670> all<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.299> mean<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.840> not

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
hardly hungry at all I mean for not

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.170 
hardly hungry at all I mean for not
eating<00:01:37.259> anything<00:01:37.560> after<00:01:38.070> eating<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.670> much<00:01:38.880> for

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
eating anything after eating so much for

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.830 
eating anything after eating so much for
three<00:01:39.360> days

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
three days

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.460 
three days
um<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:41.369> HCG<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.210> me<00:01:42.360> really<00:01:42.810> works<00:01:43.170> with

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
um the HCG for me really works with

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.139 
um the HCG for me really works with
hunger<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.250> was<00:01:44.610> thinking<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:44.970> this

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
hunger and I was thinking that this

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.910 
hunger and I was thinking that this
might<00:01:45.329> help<00:01:45.570> me<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:45.869> over<00:01:46.079> those<00:01:46.409> first<00:01:46.680> few

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
might help me get over those first few

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.340 
might help me get over those first few
of<00:01:47.040> days<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.430> hunger<00:01:47.610> easier<00:01:48.180> by<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.600> fasting

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
of days of hunger easier by just fasting

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.130 
of days of hunger easier by just fasting
that<00:01:49.500> first<00:01:49.799> day<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:52.049> it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
that first day and and I think it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
that first day and and I think it
probably<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.860> good<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.610> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
probably will be good for that and I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.219 
probably will be good for that and I
really<00:01:54.180> didn't<00:01:54.390> feel<00:01:54.479> hardly<00:01:54.810> hungry<00:01:55.110> at<00:01:55.170> all

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
really didn't feel hardly hungry at all

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.219 
really didn't feel hardly hungry at all
and<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> drink<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.740> ton<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.950> water<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.020> bet

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
and I drink a ton of water so but I bet

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.780 
and I drink a ton of water so but I bet
you<00:01:58.350> don't<00:01:58.500> want<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> results<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.490> my

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
you don't want to know the results of my

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.030 
you don't want to know the results of my
fast<00:02:00.060> day<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.320> morning<00:02:01.799> I

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
fast day and that is that this morning I

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.950 
fast day and that is that this morning I
was<00:02:02.430> down<00:02:02.670> three<00:02:03.479> point<00:02:03.869> four<00:02:04.140> pounds<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:06.570> I'm

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
was down three point four pounds so I'm

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.990 
was down three point four pounds so I'm
one<00:02:07.200> forty<00:02:07.469> five<00:02:07.619> point<00:02:07.950> eight

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
one forty five point eight

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.330 
one forty five point eight
and<00:02:09.090> that's<00:02:09.420> super<00:02:10.170> exciting<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.950> me<00:02:11.070> I<00:02:11.100> think

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and that's super exciting to me I think

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.760 
and that's super exciting to me I think
that<00:02:11.580> was<00:02:11.700> really<00:02:11.910> successful<00:02:12.150> because<00:02:13.080> my

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that was really successful because my

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.420 
that was really successful because my
last<00:02:14.100> round<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.900> did<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> two-day<00:02:16.650> load<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.250> I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
last round I I did a two-day load and I

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.270 
last round I I did a two-day load and I
only<00:02:17.580> gained<00:02:17.850> 2.8<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.470> feel<00:02:19.740> like<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.040> tried

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
only gained 2.8 and I feel like I tried

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.100 
only gained 2.8 and I feel like I tried
to<00:02:20.430> load<00:02:20.580> well<00:02:20.850> but<00:02:21.090> maybe<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.480> didn't<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.080> know

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
to load well but maybe I didn't you know

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.190 
to load well but maybe I didn't you know
I<00:02:22.230> don't<00:02:22.560> know<00:02:22.710> but<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:22.980> only<00:02:23.130> gained<00:02:23.370> 2.8<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.200> I

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
I don't know but I only gained 2.8 and I

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.370 
I don't know but I only gained 2.8 and I
lost<00:02:25.590> 1.8<00:02:26.400> my<00:02:26.580> first<00:02:26.880> VLC<00:02:27.390> D<00:02:27.540> Day<00:02:27.750> my<00:02:28.110> last

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
lost 1.8 my first VLC D Day my last

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.910 
lost 1.8 my first VLC D Day my last
round<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.190> round<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.550> lost<00:02:29.790> almost<00:02:30.060> double

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
round so this round I lost almost double

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.890 
round so this round I lost almost double
I<00:02:31.920> gained<00:02:32.490> more<00:02:32.700> loading<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.270> lost<00:02:33.600> almost

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
I gained more loading I lost almost

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.590 
I gained more loading I lost almost
double<00:02:34.380> my<00:02:34.410> first<00:02:34.770> day<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.700> fasted<00:02:36.330> this

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
double my first day and I fasted this

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.280 
double my first day and I fasted this
time<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.170> those<00:02:37.530> were<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.740> three<00:02:38.010> differences

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
time so those were the three differences

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.510 
time so those were the three differences
so<00:02:40.290> I'm<00:02:40.620> very<00:02:40.800> happy<00:02:41.160> with<00:02:41.280> that

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
so I'm very happy with that

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.220 
so I'm very happy with that
especially<00:02:42.120> because<00:02:42.270> um<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:45.420> am<00:02:45.780> keeping

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
especially because um I I am keeping

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.260 
especially because um I I am keeping
track<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.500> my<00:02:46.650> body<00:02:46.950> fat<00:02:47.250> percent<00:02:47.760> uh<00:02:47.970> my

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
track of my body fat percent uh my

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.330 
track of my body fat percent uh my
husband<00:02:48.780> has<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.050> hand<00:02:49.350> held<00:02:49.560> thing<00:02:49.920> he<00:02:50.190> used

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
husband has this hand held thing he used

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.740 
husband has this hand held thing he used
to<00:02:50.430> use<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.730> what<00:02:50.880> used<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.180> be<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.360> personal

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
to use it what used to be a personal

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.470 
to use it what used to be a personal
trainer<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:53.220> know<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.489> another<00:02:53.580> life<00:02:53.970> and

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
trainer you know in another life and

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.990 
trainer you know in another life and
it's<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.440> hand<00:02:55.590> held<00:02:55.800> thing<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.640> does<00:02:56.850> your

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
it's this hand held thing that does your

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.240 
it's this hand held thing that does your
body<00:02:57.120> fat<00:02:57.420> it's<00:02:57.600> fairly<00:02:57.930> accurate<00:02:58.140> it's<00:02:59.040> not

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
body fat it's fairly accurate it's not

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.120 
body fat it's fairly accurate it's not
as<00:02:59.400> accurate<00:02:59.550> as<00:02:59.880> hydrostatic<00:03:00.320> but<00:03:01.320> it's<00:03:01.890> kind

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
as accurate as hydrostatic but it's kind

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.710 
as accurate as hydrostatic but it's kind
of<00:03:02.190> like<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.489> think<00:03:02.520> it's<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.970> third<00:03:03.239> one<00:03:03.420> down

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
of like I think it's the third one down

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.080 
of like I think it's the third one down
it's<00:03:03.989> like<00:03:04.220> hydrostatic<00:03:05.220> body<00:03:05.400> fat<00:03:05.610> testing

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
it's like hydrostatic body fat testing

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.050 
it's like hydrostatic body fat testing
and<00:03:06.989> like<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> bod<00:03:07.410> pod<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:08.010> then<00:03:08.160> um<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.850> in

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
and like the bod pod and then um and in

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.660 
and like the bod pod and then um and in
the<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.810> calipers<00:03:10.350> like<00:03:10.800> by<00:03:11.130> someone<00:03:11.489> who's

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
the the calipers like by someone who's

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.130 
the the calipers like by someone who's
trained<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.180> using<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.510> calipers<00:03:12.959> that

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
trained and using the calipers that

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.060 
trained and using the calipers that
would<00:03:13.260> be<00:03:13.350> like<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> next<00:03:14.000> most<00:03:16.040> accurate<00:03:17.040> and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
would be like the next most accurate and

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.860 
would be like the next most accurate and
then<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.430> think<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:17.940> handheld<00:03:18.390> one<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
then I think this handheld one is the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.600 
then I think this handheld one is the
next<00:03:19.110> jacket<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:19.680> more<00:03:19.799> accurate<00:03:20.130> than<00:03:20.459> the

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
next jacket it's more accurate than the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.410 
next jacket it's more accurate than the
scale<00:03:20.850> ones<00:03:21.150> for<00:03:21.390> sure<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:22.260> anyway<00:03:22.709> um<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.420> lost

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
scale ones for sure so anyway um I lost

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.030 
scale ones for sure so anyway um I lost
a<00:03:24.720> whole<00:03:24.930> pound<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.709> fat<00:03:25.950> from<00:03:26.730> yesterday<00:03:27.330> um

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
a whole pound of fat from yesterday um

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.680 
a whole pound of fat from yesterday um
which<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.250> me<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.489> good<00:03:29.790> because<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.390> had<00:03:30.660> only

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
which to me is good because I had only

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.520 
which to me is good because I had only
gained<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:32.269> had<00:03:33.269> only<00:03:33.420> gained<00:03:33.780> one<00:03:34.049> pound<00:03:34.080> of

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
gained I had only gained one pound of

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.100 
gained I had only gained one pound of
fat<00:03:34.709> overloading<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:36.420> what<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.660> means<00:03:36.930> is

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
fat overloading so what that means is

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.360 
fat overloading so what that means is
those<00:03:37.290> extra<00:03:37.500> pounds

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
those extra pounds

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.870 
those extra pounds
we're<00:03:39.030> just<00:03:39.239> water<00:03:39.530> so<00:03:40.530> if<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.519> makes<00:03:41.730> sense

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
we're just water so if that makes sense

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.509 
we're just water so if that makes sense
is<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.480> my<00:03:42.720> thing<00:03:42.989> said<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.440> had<00:03:43.680> 46<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.489> a
