00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
just about avoiding you crash into the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.680 
just about avoiding you crash into the
ground<00:02:30.430> but<00:02:30.519> if<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.790> have<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.060> thing<00:02:31.329> on

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
ground but if you have this thing on

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.650 
ground but if you have this thing on

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
you can keep dogfighting now let's

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.130 
you can keep dogfighting now let's
switch<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.280> stell<00:02:36.280> jet<00:02:36.549> well<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:37.900> main

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
switch to the stell jet well the main

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.960 
switch to the stell jet well the main
choice<00:02:38.410> for<00:02:38.769> me<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.280> 30<00:02:39.519> millimeter

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
choice for me is the 30 millimeter

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.030 
choice for me is the 30 millimeter
cannon<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.540> shoots<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.870> lot<00:02:41.019> slower<00:02:41.319> but<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.980> a

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
cannon it shoots a lot slower but is a

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.970 
cannon it shoots a lot slower but is a
lot<00:02:42.489> more<00:02:42.790> powerful<00:02:43.150> against<00:02:43.930> air<00:02:44.349> vehicles

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
lot more powerful against air vehicles

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.740 
lot more powerful against air vehicles
this<00:02:45.340> thing<00:02:45.549> is<00:02:45.879> unuseful

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
this thing is unuseful

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.160 
this thing is unuseful
against<00:02:47.500> infantry<00:02:48.329> against<00:02:49.329> ground<00:02:49.780> vehicles

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
against infantry against ground vehicles

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:57.089 
against infantry against ground vehicles
so<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:51.099> don't<00:02:51.730> try<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.000> use<00:02:52.389> that<00:02:56.099> the

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
so just don't try to use that the

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.129 
so just don't try to use that the
secondary<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:57.910> is<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.239> only<00:02:58.450> way<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.900> can

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
secondary that is the only way you can

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.960 
secondary that is the only way you can
attack<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.739> ground<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.280> my<00:03:00.340> opinion<00:03:00.730> whether

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
attack the ground in my opinion whether

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.690 
attack the ground in my opinion whether
this<00:03:01.150> tell<00:03:01.419> jet<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.840> laser<00:03:02.139> guided<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.859> is<00:03:03.639> a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
this tell jet is laser guided and is a

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.909 
this tell jet is laser guided and is a
must<00:03:04.090> if<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.810> want<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:05.139> Jack<00:03:05.349> any<00:03:05.620> ground

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
must if you want to Jack any ground

around<00:03:08.919> the<00:03:09.220> active<00:03:09.609> radar<00:03:09.880> but<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:10.739> personally

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
around the active radar but I personally

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.339 
around the active radar but I personally
think<00:03:11.919> that<00:03:12.190> if<00:03:12.489> I<00:03:12.579> need<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.819> take<00:03:13.060> out<00:03:13.299> an<00:03:14.200> air

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
think that if I need to take out an air

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.589 
think that if I need to take out an air
vehicle<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:14.799> use<00:03:15.040> my<00:03:15.220> main<00:03:15.430> weapon<00:03:15.639> and<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.299> have

a secondary weapon for ground targets

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.720 
a secondary weapon for ground targets
for<00:03:20.200> countermeasure<00:03:20.829> I<00:03:20.980> use<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.310> ECM<00:03:21.700> jammer

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
for countermeasure I use the ECM jammer

for countermeasure I use the ECM jammer
and<00:03:22.090> as<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.599> said<00:03:22.900> before<00:03:23.049> this<00:03:24.010> is<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.700> matter<00:03:25.000> of

flies a lot better I will change my
loadout<00:04:03.750> sometimes<00:04:04.750> for<00:04:05.110> example<00:04:05.140> if<00:04:05.500> I<00:04:05.620> play

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
loadout sometimes for example if I play

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.960 
loadout sometimes for example if I play
in<00:04:07.050> an<00:04:08.050> air<00:04:08.290> superiority<00:04:08.500> which<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.640> don't<00:04:09.760> do

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
in an air superiority which I don't do

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.480 
in an air superiority which I don't do
much<00:04:10.180> because<00:04:10.510> it's<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:11.170> find<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:11.890> really

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
much because it's I find it really

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.280 
much because it's I find it really
frustrating<00:04:12.640> because<00:04:13.210> a<00:04:13.330> lot<00:04:13.660> of<00:04:13.690> friendlies

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
frustrating because a lot of friendlies

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.800 
frustrating because a lot of friendlies
crashing<00:04:14.710> to<00:04:14.860> you<00:04:15.010> but<00:04:15.460> if<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:15.910> if<00:04:16.510> you<00:04:16.630> play

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
crashing to you but if you if you play

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.620 
crashing to you but if you if you play
air<00:04:16.989> superiority<00:04:17.170> proximity<00:04:18.100> scan<00:04:18.160> is<00:04:18.640> the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
air superiority proximity scan is the

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.400 
air superiority proximity scan is the
best<00:04:19.870> choice<00:04:20.170> for<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:21.430> simple<00:04:21.820> reason<00:04:22.000> that

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
best choice for a simple reason that

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.460 
best choice for a simple reason that
sometimes<00:04:23.410> for<00:04:23.800> some<00:04:24.190> reason<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:26.020> enemies

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
sometimes for some reason the enemies

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.510 
sometimes for some reason the enemies
will<00:04:27.280> not<00:04:27.310> be<00:04:27.810> showed<00:04:28.810> on<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:29.050> map<00:04:29.290> or<00:04:29.680> let's

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
will not be showed on the map or let's

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.850 
will not be showed on the map or let's
say<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:31.000> errata<00:04:31.630> itself<00:04:32.110> will<00:04:32.320> not<00:04:32.470> be<00:04:32.620> shown

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
say the errata itself will not be shown

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.670 
say the errata itself will not be shown
it's<00:04:33.130> something<00:04:33.790> like<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:33.970> glitch<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:35.080> if<00:04:35.590> you

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
it's something like a glitch and if you

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.350 
it's something like a glitch and if you
have<00:04:35.800> proximity<00:04:36.310> scan<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:36.640> can<00:04:36.760> still<00:04:37.090> see

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
have proximity scan you can still see

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.720 
have proximity scan you can still see
them<00:04:37.600> at<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.170> same<00:04:38.350> time<00:04:38.410> if<00:04:38.920> they<00:04:39.220> have<00:04:39.550> you

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
them at the same time if they have you

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.450 
them at the same time if they have you
ECM<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.320> way<00:04:41.500> and<00:04:41.770> they<00:04:41.860> become<00:04:42.160> invisible

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
ECM so the way and they become invisible

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.640 
ECM so the way and they become invisible
on<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:42.970> air<00:04:43.120> radar<00:04:43.510> you<00:04:43.840> can<00:04:43.870> still<00:04:44.200> see<00:04:44.470> them

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
on the air radar you can still see them

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.620 
on the air radar you can still see them
so<00:04:45.400> it's<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.610> good<00:04:45.730> choice<00:04:46.000> if<00:04:46.270> you're<00:04:46.390> playing

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
so it's a good choice if you're playing

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.870 
so it's a good choice if you're playing
air<00:04:46.840> superiority<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.500> I<00:04:47.890> will<00:04:48.250> suggest<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.700> to

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
air superiority and I will suggest it to

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.950 
air superiority and I will suggest it to
everyone

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
everyone
