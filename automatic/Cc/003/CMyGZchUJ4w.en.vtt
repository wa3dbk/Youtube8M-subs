refreshing<00:01:51.549> well<00:01:52.030> it's<00:01:52.180> a<00:01:52.270> refresher<00:01:52.659> after

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
refreshing well it's a refresher after

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.140 
refreshing well it's a refresher after
the<00:01:53.229> complexity<00:01:53.799> of<00:01:53.830> digital<00:01:54.670> number<00:01:54.939> over

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
the complexity of digital number over

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.420 
the complexity of digital number over
here<00:01:55.180> hmm<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:55.840> think<00:01:56.560> this<00:01:56.680> is<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.830> texture<00:01:57.280> that

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
here hmm I think this is a texture that

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.100 
here hmm I think this is a texture that
a<00:01:57.490> lot<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.700> Australians<00:01:58.150> will<00:01:58.299> find<00:01:58.570> foreign

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
a lot of Australians will find foreign

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.840 
a lot of Australians will find foreign
