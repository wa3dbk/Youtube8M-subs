Daredevils<00:01:25.830> origins<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:27.200> wasn't<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.380> huge<00:01:28.560> fan

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
Daredevils origins I wasn't a huge fan

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.350 
Daredevils origins I wasn't a huge fan
of<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.040> ending<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.610> think<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> ending<00:01:30.119> really

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
of the ending I think the ending really

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.640 
of the ending I think the ending really
kills<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.810> me<00:01:30.990> um<00:01:32.900> where<00:01:33.900> he<00:01:34.170> goes<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.610> the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
kills it for me um where he goes to the

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.350 
kills it for me um where he goes to the
old<00:01:37.650> man<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.130> he's<00:01:38.250> saved<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.850> finds<00:01:39.240> out

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
old man that he's saved and finds out

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.880 
old man that he's saved and finds out
what<00:01:39.570> an<00:01:39.659> evil<00:01:39.840> bastard<00:01:40.079> he<00:01:40.530> was<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
what an evil bastard he was and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.350 
what an evil bastard he was and
everything<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.150> seemed

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
everything and it just seemed

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.550 
everything and it just seemed
unnecessary<00:01:43.049> because<00:01:43.229> we'd<00:01:43.470> already

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
unnecessary because we'd already

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.920 
unnecessary because we'd already
established<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.399> before<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.509> didn't<00:01:45.780> need

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
established this before you didn't need

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.240 
established this before you didn't need
to<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.799> guy<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.560> seemed<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:50.070> of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to go to the guy it just seemed kind of

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.160 
to go to the guy it just seemed kind of
weird<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.149> wasn't<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> best<00:01:51.899> written

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
weird and it wasn't the best written

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.630 
weird and it wasn't the best written
especially<00:01:52.890> since<00:01:53.369> we'd<00:01:53.490> already

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
especially since we'd already

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.730 
especially since we'd already
established<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.720> emotionally<00:01:55.350> covered

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
established this and emotionally covered

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.810 
established this and emotionally covered
this<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.070> know<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> couple<00:01:56.399> pages<00:01:56.700> before<00:01:59.540> but

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
this you know a couple pages before but

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.649 
this you know a couple pages before but
it's<00:02:02.820> okay<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:04.259> sanitarians<00:02:05.159> are<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.430> this

67<00:04:01.799> issues<00:04:02.099> along<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.519> don't<00:04:02.910> know<00:04:03.019> maybe<00:04:04.019> it's

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
67 issues along I don't know maybe it's

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.039 
67 issues along I don't know maybe it's
just<00:04:04.319> thick<00:04:04.620> because<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.950> i<00:04:04.980> read<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.489> hardback

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
just thick because I i read the hardback

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.599 
just thick because I i read the hardback
so<00:04:07.049> it<00:04:07.169> just<00:04:07.379> seems<00:04:07.650> thick<00:04:08.010> but<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:09.980> I'd<00:04:10.980> say
