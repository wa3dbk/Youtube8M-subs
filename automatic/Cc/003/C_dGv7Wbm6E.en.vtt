i<00:00:38.520> think<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.030> i<00:00:39.059> think<00:00:39.469> there<00:00:40.469> was<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> last

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
i think so i think there was the last

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.130 
i think so i think there was the last
one<00:00:40.980> day<00:00:41.129> one<00:00:41.520> day<00:00:41.550> series<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.480> obviously<00:00:43.050> it

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
one day one day series and obviously it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.569 
one day one day series and obviously it
wasn't<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.559> was<00:00:43.680> pretty<00:00:43.920> disappointing<00:00:44.430> from

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
wasn't it was pretty disappointing from

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.190 
wasn't it was pretty disappointing from
our<00:00:44.670> point<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.910> view<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.300> we've<00:00:45.840> got<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.079> come

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
our point of view so we've got to come

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.209 
our point of view so we've got to come
back<00:00:46.230> from<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.680> we're<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> move

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
back from that and we're going to move

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.709 
back from that and we're going to move
forward<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.820> we<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.090> moved<00:00:48.300> forward<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
forward in and we have moved forward and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.660 
forward in and we have moved forward and
and<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> next<00:00:49.770> series<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.550> we're

and this is the next series and we're
looking<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.600> take<00:00:51.809> things<00:00:51.989> further<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
looking to to take things further and

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.880 
looking to to take things further and
the<00:00:53.640> form<00:00:53.910> look<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.600> should<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the form look like we should and do the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.740 
the form look like we should and do the
vista<00:00:56.160> weekend<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.699> hopefully<00:00:57.300> come<00:00:57.600> out

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
vista weekend and hopefully come out

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.229 
vista weekend and hopefully come out
with<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> series<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.379> jelly<00:00:58.680> oh<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.910> think<00:00:59.969> that

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
with a series of jelly oh I think that

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.209 
with a series of jelly oh I think that
there's<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> number<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> different<00:01:01.800> things

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
there's a number of different things

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.920 
there's a number of different things
that<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.850> always<00:01:03.149> look<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.359> improve<00:01:03.539> on

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that you can always look to improve on

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.450 
that you can always look to improve on
and<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.350> think<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.070> matter<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.309> us

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and I think it's just a matter of us

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.359 
and I think it's just a matter of us
touching<00:01:05.869> every<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> those<00:01:07.260> one<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.280> those

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
touching every one of those one of those

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.640 
touching every one of those one of those
options<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.450> trying<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.780> get<00:01:09.869> better<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
options up and trying to get better as a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.980 
options up and trying to get better as a
unit<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.510> individually<00:01:12.510> especially<00:01:12.930> in

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
unit and individually especially in

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.899 
unit and individually especially in
these<00:01:13.110> conditions<00:01:13.350> over<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.729> more

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
these conditions over here that the more

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:15.830 
these conditions over here that the more
that<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.119> play<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.360> these<00:01:15.570> conditions

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
that we play in these conditions

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.300 
that we play in these conditions
hopefully<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> better<00:01:16.799> we're<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> get

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
hopefully the better we're going to get

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.429 
hopefully the better we're going to get
and<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:18.240> obviously<00:01:18.869> building<00:01:19.229> up<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
and and it's obviously building up to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.380 
and and it's obviously building up to
that<00:01:19.470> world<00:01:19.770> cup<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.130> February<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.210> more

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that world cup in February the more

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.149 
that world cup in February the more
experienced<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.290> them<00:01:22.530> hopefully

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
experienced we can have them hopefully

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.830 
experienced we can have them hopefully
it<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.369> it'll<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.939> valuable<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.689> we

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it will it'll be valuable for when we

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.420 
it will it'll be valuable for when we
when<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.259> go<00:01:25.549> here<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.810> februari<00:01:28.070> just<00:01:29.070> just
