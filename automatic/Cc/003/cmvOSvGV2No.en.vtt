00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.750 
now if you look at the backs of the
cards<00:02:30.230> they<00:02:30.380> are<00:02:30.590> faded<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.340> really<00:02:31.579> like

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
cards they are faded and I really like

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.819 
cards they are faded and I really like
that<00:02:31.940> because<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.359> gives<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:33.170> guess

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
that because it gives it that I guess

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.970 
that because it gives it that I guess
you<00:02:33.980> could<00:02:34.010> say<00:02:34.280> like<00:02:34.519> mysterious<00:02:35.480> element

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
you could say like mysterious element

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.810 
you could say like mysterious element
that<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.010> kind<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.489> I<00:02:37.640> like<00:02:37.910> about<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:39.670> but<00:02:40.670> these

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
that I kind of I like about it but these

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.259 
that I kind of I like about it but these
carts<00:02:41.180> handle<00:02:41.600> very<00:02:41.959> well<00:02:42.700> if<00:02:43.700> fan<00:02:44.630> very<00:02:45.019> nice

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
carts handle very well if fan very nice

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.319 
carts handle very well if fan very nice
and<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:48.590> think<00:02:48.799> this<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.160> deck<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.609> have<00:02:49.820> so

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
and I think this is a deck to have so

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.050 
and I think this is a deck to have so
maybe<00:02:51.260> go<00:02:51.530> pick<00:02:51.769> yourself<00:02:52.130> up<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.340> deck<00:02:52.519> so

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
maybe go pick yourself up a deck so

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.810 
maybe go pick yourself up a deck so
