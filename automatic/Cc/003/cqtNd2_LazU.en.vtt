00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.990
 better you win phone point net who not 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.460
 he looked well into the myth of this 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.820
 video then the title is lost yes 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.590
 will ask but why andrea two notes 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.439
 the same thing on the table is early 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:26.760
 said veils lap one is there the other is 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:29.390
 standard then umts edge gprs 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.340
 I do this test because finally 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.200
 vodafone has also opened the lte to the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.969
 smartphone so call yourself normal with 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.590
 a plan by whom can safely 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.760
 change your sim with a sim 4g e 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.980
 access the 4g offer per hour 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.430
 then free of charge until March 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.649
 you will have to pay 10 euros a month more 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.590
 beyond your own plan 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.719
 unfortunately given the tariff data I said 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.180
 a sim 3 in my not and a vodafone in the 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.100
 not lte because I do not have two he fled with 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.110
 to do the simultaneous test on 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.210
 same network but let's say they are so 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.450
 so many the parameters that influence the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.799
 data connection quality that too 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.350
 check and compare with two 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.390
 There are several different operators there 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.439
 compare an order of magnitude between 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.030
 speed that can have a man and ts and a 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.530
 lt remember the tier ii can arrive 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.790
 at 100 megabits per second in theory 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.400
 download and 50 in upload 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.229
 we have immediately with the speed test notice 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.979
 we talk to start the test 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.210
 to both parties 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.549
 see the vodafone network 4g takes little 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.200
 here in the study where I am if I go out on the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.030
 balcony takes a lot more has one 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.530
 lower penetration capacity 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:54.570
 compared to hsp in this case more 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.509
 so at 41 megabits per second quarter is 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:03.960
 already as soon as the download is about a 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:05.840
 fourth in bts compared to lte which has 26 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:12.440
 megabits per second 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:14.660
 about a third 3 megabits per mps 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.390
 while we are even almost 10 megs 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.910
 for the 4g then pushes snes 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.030
 speedtest.net as you see award really 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.849
 very much also regarding the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.099
 pil and look 24 milliseconds against i 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.860
 78 what this means that all 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:37.690
 those applications you too think of 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.239
 skype thought i think of sip client 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.910
 they work much better on t and why 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.470
 they have less ping delay but to see 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.870
 classic navigation we open 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:55.610
 simultaneously the evening courier 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:57.799
 perfect here was not not set 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.730
 it was 70 but no problem because so much 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:04.099
 at the end of everything we cancel the 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.470
 vote the screen then as his 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:12.680
 part of it was a desktop mode 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:17.180
 let's do the test again then I can tell you 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.109
 that in the daily use the download 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.750
 of web pages 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:26.420
 they faster on the subject by using it 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.490
 for example to browse here on the site 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.760
 in the evening that is quite heavy 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.910
 difference is not so abysmal we say 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.330
 which is more phone rendering than 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.390
 slows down navigation compared to 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:45.320
 data rate where the data entry 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.790
 it is really very important instead 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.970
 fundamental when we go to download 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.580
 for example applications from dal 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.680
 marketplace store or when we do 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.750
 operations that need many 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.690
 given for example I often receive 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.500
 email heavy and honestly with 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:07.910
 I can really visualize it 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:12.650
 very much earlier and this is for me one 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:15.770
 very interesting thing we go to 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.419
 for the parts on the email I have here 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.880
 we open this email which are photos 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.700
 it should be quite heavy 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.090
 we enter the attachments let us save a 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.680
 all both sides and we look at the 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.370
 difference what he says first is 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.930
 really substantial look at me here 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.729
 I'm ready to open the images here 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.110
 instead they are still at 50 percent of 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.790
 wait a few more seconds 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.840
 the more the attachments become more heavy 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.800
 this difference becomes important 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.490
 in the use of everyday letters 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.580
 when we go to call he switches 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.770
 automatically in mts in 3g now 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.860
 you will see when the call is activated 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.290
 we will lose 4g connectivity and you have 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.180
 seen connectivity is activated 3g 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:04.729
 so dates in the background remain but 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:07.100
 slower we finish the time call 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:11.390
 a few seconds the 3g 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:17.510
 returns to peel on the fast 4g network 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:20.240
 puts us about flash with 23 seconds ho 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.180
 also tried to connect the phone 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.210
 lte with 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.840
 wifi tethering 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:32.650
 obviously android allows it remaining 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.169
 in their own data and people thresholds 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.180
 more or less comparable to navigation 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.490
 from smartphones little that the pci being 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.710
 faster page rendering 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.289
 amplifies the speed difference are 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.289
 managed to star in the rennes of 18 20 6 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.560
 megabits per second in download and 9 11 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.990
 in upload 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.610
 4g coverage and very limited hours 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.940
 to which in Milan if you enter the buildings 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.009
 it is hard to get the 4g out not 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.349
 there are problems but I saw that you are 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.310
 obviously very well spreading out 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.479
 Milan 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.250
 4g signals we forget it last 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:12.840
 little note regarding iphone 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:16.930
 my vodafone sim to date which is the 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.780
 January 23rd is not recognized on 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.970
 iphone didn't recognize 4g in 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.580
 in fashion conce said that they are 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.789
 updating the systems and updating the 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:32.220
 network to make even iphone go online 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:32.220
 5 even punto I put andrea galeazzi
