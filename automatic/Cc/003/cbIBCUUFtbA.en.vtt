00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.319 
deck analysis of deck that i think is
going<00:04:04.159> to<00:04:04.250> be<00:04:04.280> doing<00:04:04.459> pretty<00:04:04.609> well<00:04:04.940> in<00:04:05.090> the

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
going to be doing pretty well in the

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.990 
going to be doing pretty well in the
March<00:04:05.540> 2013<00:04:06.199> ban<00:04:06.440> list<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:07.609> let's<00:04:07.729> get<00:04:07.849> right

March 2013 ban list so let's get right

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.449 
March 2013 ban list so let's get right
to<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:09.769> deck<00:04:10.010> i'm<00:04:10.400> going<00:04:10.669> to<00:04:10.729> be<00:04:12.459> analyzing

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
to it the deck i'm going to be analyzing

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.080 
to it the deck i'm going to be analyzing
i<00:04:13.549> guess<00:04:13.729> is<00:04:14.060> hero<00:04:14.629> gate<00:04:15.519> pretty<00:04:16.519> much<00:04:16.669> how<00:04:17.060> it

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
i guess is hero gate pretty much how it

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.060 
i guess is hero gate pretty much how it
works<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:20.060> use<00:04:20.449> the<00:04:22.060> elemental<00:04:23.060> hero<00:04:23.270> engine

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
works you use the elemental hero engine

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.230 
works you use the elemental hero engine
with<00:04:25.720> Fusion<00:04:26.720> gate<00:04:27.639> basically<00:04:28.639> bring<00:04:28.940> up<00:04:29.090> the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
with Fusion gate basically bring up the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.940 
with Fusion gate basically bring up the
shining<00:04:29.690> or<00:04:29.840> any<00:04:29.930> of<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.139> other<00:04:30.260> fusion<00:04:30.620> bombs
