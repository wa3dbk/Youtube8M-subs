00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.419 
it's my hobby zone champ one of them I
installed<00:00:05.549> LED<00:00:06.060> lights<00:00:06.830> from<00:00:07.830> tiny<00:00:08.160> bright

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
installed LED lights from tiny bright

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.959 
installed LED lights from tiny bright
lights<00:00:09.290> they're<00:00:10.290> meant<00:00:10.590> for<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.340> ember<00:00:11.759> and

nice little rear stroke you fly at night
real<00:00:24.510> small<00:00:24.750> unit<00:00:25.939> doesn't<00:00:26.939> affect<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> CG<00:00:27.930> of

real small unit doesn't affect the CG of
the<00:00:28.170> plane<00:00:28.380> at<00:00:28.529> all

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
the plane at all

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.910 
the plane at all
see<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.480> from<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.810> back

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.540 

it's<00:00:36.429> wired<00:00:36.789> into<00:00:37.089> the<00:00:37.329> underbelly<00:00:38.260> I<00:00:38.589> did<00:00:39.519> a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
it's wired into the underbelly I did a

it's wired into the underbelly I did a
real<00:00:39.760> sloppy<00:00:40.030> job<00:00:40.390> on<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.690> wiring<00:00:41.460> I'm

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
real sloppy job on the wiring I'm

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.360 
real sloppy job on the wiring I'm
constantly<00:00:43.629> opening<00:00:44.379> this<00:00:44.500> plane<00:00:44.769> up<00:00:45.129> and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
constantly opening this plane up and

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.819 
constantly opening this plane up and
back<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.850> open<00:00:46.210> clothes<00:00:46.839> and<00:00:47.199> taping<00:00:47.559> it<00:00:47.679> in

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
back and open clothes and taping it in

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.750 
back and open clothes and taping it in
this<00:00:48.100> oh<00:00:49.379> yeah<00:00:50.379> from<00:00:50.649> going<00:00:50.979> real<00:00:51.190> nice<00:00:51.429> and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
this oh yeah from going real nice and

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.789 
this oh yeah from going real nice and
straight<00:00:52.570> on<00:00:52.719> the<00:00:52.809> wings<00:00:53.019> I<00:00:53.199> just<00:00:53.409> taped<00:00:53.589> them

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:53.799 
straight on the wings I just taped them

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.130 
straight on the wings I just taped them
on<00:00:53.949> that<00:00:54.489> doesn't<00:00:54.820> do<00:00:55.149> anything<00:00:55.420> to<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:55.839> plane

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
on that doesn't do anything to the plane

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.000 
on that doesn't do anything to the plane
so<00:00:57.210> that's<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.390> front<00:01:01.439> and<00:01:02.439> I'm<00:01:02.649> gonna<00:01:02.769> put

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
so that's the front and I'm gonna put

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.009 
so that's the front and I'm gonna put
the<00:01:03.070> camera<00:01:03.280> down<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:03.939> I'm<00:01:04.059> gonna<00:01:04.149> go<00:01:04.689> get<00:01:04.839> my

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
the camera down and I'm gonna go get my

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:16.109 
the camera down and I'm gonna go get my
other<00:01:05.379> one<00:01:05.649> and<00:01:06.009> show<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:06.310> that

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
getting from tiny bright lights they're

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.210 
getting from tiny bright lights they're
about<00:02:24.630> 25<00:02:25.170> bucks<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.810> set<00:02:28.110> that's<00:02:28.890> wired

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
about 25 bucks for the set that's wired

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.760 
about 25 bucks for the set that's wired
really<00:02:29.670> nice<00:02:29.880> real<00:02:30.420> durable<00:02:30.780> wiring<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.560> can

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
really nice real durable wiring you can

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.920 
really nice real durable wiring you can
constantly<00:02:32.280> bend<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.880> back<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.300> forth<00:02:33.600> and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
constantly bend it back and forth and

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.520 
constantly bend it back and forth and
twist<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.010> twirl<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:36.260> they<00:02:37.260> did<00:02:37.470> a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.530 
twist it and twirl it and they did a
real<00:02:37.740> nice<00:02:37.920> solder<00:02:38.250> job<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.760> LEDs<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.360> it's

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
real nice solder job in the LEDs so it's

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.880 
real nice solder job in the LEDs so it's
not<00:02:39.750> one<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.930> those<00:02:40.080> things<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.530> after<00:02:40.860> a

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
not one of those things that after a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.040 
not one of those things that after a
while<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.430> wear<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.670> tear<00:02:42.000> breaks<00:02:42.390> off<00:02:42.630> so

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
while the wear and tear breaks off so

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.560 
while the wear and tear breaks off so
it's<00:02:43.170> real<00:02:43.380> good<00:02:43.530> quality<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.190> they're<00:02:45.150> super

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
it's real good quality and they're super

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.790 
it's real good quality and they're super

bright at night and I put the light

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.850 
bright at night and I put the light
differently<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.490> this<00:02:50.640> one<00:02:51.200> but<00:02:52.200> yeah<00:02:52.440> that's

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.820 
my read champ painted it red to me a red
Italian<00:02:57.090> red<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.330> guess<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.490> did<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:01.790> and

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
Italian red I guess and I did that and

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.760 
Italian red I guess and I did that and
my<00:03:04.830> striping<00:03:06.440> in<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.650> wings<00:03:09.470> looks<00:03:10.470> really

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
my striping in the wings looks really

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.010 
my striping in the wings looks really
cool<00:03:10.980> again<00:03:11.280> at<00:03:11.430> night<00:03:11.640> there's<00:03:12.270> my<00:03:12.510> modified

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
cool again at night there's my modified

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.350 
cool again at night there's my modified
engine<00:03:15.260> cover<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.590> cut<00:03:17.430> out<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.580> section<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:18.120> fun

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
engine cover I cut out a section of fun

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.420 
engine cover I cut out a section of fun
so<00:03:19.050> this<00:03:19.170> plane<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:19.470> kind<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.739> louder<00:03:19.980> because

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
so this plane is kind of louder because

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.870 
so this plane is kind of louder because
of<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:21.630> vent<00:03:21.989> right<00:03:22.230> there<00:03:22.610> good<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:23.730> guess

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
of that vent right there good I guess

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.210 
of that vent right there good I guess
for<00:03:24.180> cooling

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
third throw on the on the horns I have

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.930 
third throw on the on the horns I have
them<00:03:36.090> on<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.270> third<00:03:37.760> whole<00:03:40.670> plane<00:03:41.670> turns

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
work because these are great planes and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.400 
work because these are great planes and
they're<00:03:57.180> worth<00:03:57.620> working<00:03:58.620> on<00:04:00.350> thinking<00:04:01.350> of

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
they're worth working on thinking of

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.640 
they're worth working on thinking of
getting<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.680> brushless<00:04:01.920> system<00:04:02.430> later<00:04:02.610> but<00:04:03.600> uh

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
getting a brushless system later but uh

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.990 
getting a brushless system later but uh
