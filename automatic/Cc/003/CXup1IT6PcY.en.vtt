00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.870 
charge they both are both are down to
three<00:02:18.840> notches<00:02:18.990> each<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.740> what<00:02:20.610> we're<00:02:20.760> gonna

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
three notches each and what we're gonna

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.810 
three notches each and what we're gonna
do<00:02:21.150> for<00:02:21.480> our<00:02:21.510> test<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.020> going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.710> show<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
do for our test is going to show you the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.840 
do for our test is going to show you the
distinct<00:02:24.240> differences<00:02:24.780> between<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.860> two<00:02:26.100> and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
distinct differences between the two and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.570 
distinct differences between the two and
there's<00:02:27.090> really<00:02:27.240> only<00:02:27.330> one<00:02:27.600> huge<00:02:28.350> difference

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
there's really only one huge difference

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.100 
there's really only one huge difference
they're<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.730> same<00:02:29.910> graphics<00:02:30.450> wise<00:02:30.660> they're

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
they're the same graphics wise they're

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.260 
they're the same graphics wise they're
the<00:02:31.230> same<00:02:32.780> music<00:02:33.780> wise<00:02:34.850> it's<00:02:35.850> more<00:02:36.150> or<00:02:36.240> less

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
the same music wise it's more or less

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:46.010 
the same music wise it's more or less
just<00:02:36.420> loading<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:44.100> again<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.420> one<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.810> black

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
just loading and again the one the black

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.620 
just loading and again the one the black
is<00:02:46.380> digital<00:02:47.160> one<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.670> white<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.150> physical<00:02:50.630> and

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
is digital one and white is physical and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.820 
is digital one and white is physical and
let's<00:02:52.620> skip<00:02:52.920> all<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:55.050> get<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.410> loading<00:02:55.620> a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
let's skip all this and get to loading a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:08.000 
let's skip all this and get to loading a
game<00:03:06.020> for<00:03:07.020> this<00:03:07.110> demonstration<00:03:07.350> to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
game for this demonstration to

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.330 
game for this demonstration to
demonstrate<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:10.020> difference<00:03:10.530> between<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
demonstrate the difference between the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.930 
demonstrate the difference between the
two<00:03:11.520> we're<00:03:12.180> going<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.600> save<00:03:12.920> now<00:03:13.920> you're<00:03:14.760> just

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
two we're going to save now you're just

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.310 
two we're going to save now you're just
going<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.300> without<00:03:15.540> doing<00:03:15.840> anything<00:03:16.050> you're

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
going to without doing anything you're

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.570 
going to without doing anything you're
insane<00:03:17.540> but<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.660> like<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.900> save<00:03:19.080> yes<00:03:19.470> here's<00:03:20.370> the

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
insane but I like to save yes here's the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.510 
insane but I like to save yes here's the
big<00:03:20.880> difference<00:03:21.150> between<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.840> two<00:03:22.070> note<00:03:23.070> this

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
big difference between the two note this

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:40.630 
big difference between the two note this
is<00:03:23.730> digital<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.630> physical

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.730 

again<00:03:41.640> for<00:03:41.940> those<00:03:42.090> wondering<00:03:45.290> now<00:03:46.290> inside<00:03:46.620> the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
again for those wondering now inside the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.760 
again for those wondering now inside the
sink<00:03:47.040> because<00:03:47.250> uh<00:03:47.490> well<00:03:48.320> it's<00:03:49.320> nicked<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
sink because uh well it's nicked to the

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.830 
sink because uh well it's nicked to the
wolf<00:03:49.980> it's<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.790> little<00:03:51.030> quicker<00:03:51.210> for<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.720> to

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
wolf it's a little quicker for it to

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.640 
wolf it's a little quicker for it to
stave<00:03:52.110> on<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.740> digital<00:03:53.360> just<00:03:54.360> tray<00:03:54.570> again

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:06.240 

yeah

yep
that's<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.200> main<00:04:09.470> difference<00:04:09.950> between<00:04:10.010> the

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
that's the main difference between the

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.980 
that's the main difference between the
two<00:04:10.490> it's<00:04:10.970> more<00:04:11.210> or<00:04:11.300> less<00:04:11.330> just<00:04:11.570> a<00:04:11.720> time

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
two it's more or less just a time

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.460 
two it's more or less just a time
investment<00:04:12.680> now<00:04:13.630> let's<00:04:14.630> actually<00:04:14.840> get<00:04:15.200> up<00:04:15.350> and

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
investment now let's actually get up and

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.490 
investment now let's actually get up and
leave<00:04:15.710> Oh<00:04:18.459> what<00:04:19.459> is<00:04:19.580> it<00:04:19.730> night<00:04:20.260> maybe<00:04:21.260> I<00:04:21.350> should

saving from the bowl and check out how
long<00:05:39.199> that<00:05:39.410> takes<00:05:41.050> yeah<00:05:44.169> let's<00:05:45.169> do<00:05:45.349> that<00:05:45.500> real

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
long that takes yeah let's do that real

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
again okay let's let's see that again in

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.140 
again okay let's let's see that again in
well<00:05:51.949> I<00:05:51.979> can't<00:05:52.280> slow<00:05:52.490> it<00:05:52.580> down<00:05:52.639> but<00:05:52.940> let's

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
well I can't slow it down but let's

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.740 
well I can't slow it down but let's
check<00:05:53.300> let's<00:05:53.569> test<00:05:53.750> it<00:05:53.900> again<00:05:54.110> let's<00:05:54.949> go

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
check let's test it again let's go

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.230 
check let's test it again let's go
save<00:05:57.190> save<00:05:58.659> done<00:06:00.340> yeah<00:06:01.340> that's<00:06:01.580> really<00:06:01.909> the
