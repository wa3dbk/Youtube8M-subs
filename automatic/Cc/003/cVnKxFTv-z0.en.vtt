just think that she's not as in all the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.630 
just think that she's not as in all the
doctor<00:01:08.500> which<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:08.890> think<00:01:09.070> we've<00:01:09.190> seen<00:01:09.340> quite<00:01:09.550> a

doctor which I think we've seen quite a

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.910 
doctor which I think we've seen quite a
lot<00:01:09.759> and<00:01:10.149> she<00:01:10.660> know<00:01:11.050> she<00:01:11.110> she<00:01:11.740> actually

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
lot and she know she she actually

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
questions him and she's skeptical and

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.190 
questions him and she's skeptical and
she<00:01:14.050> has<00:01:14.229> this<00:01:14.410> distrust<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:15.009> him<00:01:15.160> and<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
she has this distrust of him and and

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.870 
she has this distrust of him and and
they<00:01:17.319> have<00:01:17.470> an<00:01:17.560> incredibly<00:01:18.130> interesting

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
and they combust and it's just this

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.999 
and they combust and it's just this
really<00:01:30.640> interesting<00:01:30.910> dynamic<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.800> it<00:01:32.890> they

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
really interesting dynamic and it they

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.859 
really interesting dynamic and it they
bounce<00:01:33.280> off<00:01:33.490> each<00:01:33.550> other<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.390> they<00:01:34.569> kind<00:01:34.810> of

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
bounce off each other and they kind of

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.020 
bounce off each other and they kind of
out<00:01:35.080> with<00:01:35.349> each<00:01:35.470> other<00:01:35.649> quite<00:01:35.979> a<00:01:36.039> lot<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.580> it's

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
out with each other quite a lot and it's

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.580 
out with each other quite a lot and it's
kind<00:01:37.179> of<00:01:37.209> like<00:01:37.330> this<00:01:37.509> love-hate<00:01:37.990> relationship

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
kind of like this love-hate relationship

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.260 
kind of like this love-hate relationship
I<00:01:38.679> think<00:01:38.860> she<00:01:38.979> drives<00:01:39.220> him<00:01:39.399> up<00:01:39.489> the<00:01:39.640> wall<00:01:39.670> and

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
I think she drives him up the wall and

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.449 
I think she drives him up the wall and
but<00:01:41.050> they<00:01:41.170> both<00:01:41.349> have<00:01:41.560> this<00:01:41.709> really<00:01:42.069> deep

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
but they both have this really deep

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:53.590 
but they both have this really deep
connection<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.360> love<00:01:43.630> for<00:01:43.780> each<00:01:43.899> other

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.659 

you
