I think the plants uncovered for those

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.480 
I think the plants uncovered for those
so<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.690> middle<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.290> field<00:02:28.530> might<00:02:28.830> be<00:02:29.070> open

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
so the middle of the field might be open

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.730 
so the middle of the field might be open
I'm<00:02:30.150> making<00:02:30.540> with<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.690> precision<00:02:31.050> pass<00:02:31.410> and

I'm making with that precision pass and
Jordan<00:02:32.010> Cameron<00:02:32.130> might<00:02:32.430> snatch<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.940> we'll<00:02:33.480> see

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
Jordan Cameron might snatch it we'll see
