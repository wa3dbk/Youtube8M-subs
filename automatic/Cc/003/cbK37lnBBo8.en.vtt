00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.220 
the Train continued and when the train
sees<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.790> too<00:02:45.060> late<00:02:45.240> he's<00:02:45.990> going<00:02:46.170> to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
sees you it's too late he's going to

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.520 
sees you it's too late he's going to
move<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:48.000> locomotive<00:02:48.690> engineer<00:02:49.140> doesn't

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
move the locomotive engineer doesn't

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.740 
move the locomotive engineer doesn't
have<00:02:49.830> enough<00:02:50.130> track<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.790> stop<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.240> train

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
have enough track to stop the train

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.620 
have enough track to stop the train
it<00:02:51.810> takes<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.530> mile<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.940> know<00:02:54.060> you're<00:02:54.300> on<00:02:54.420> edge

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
it takes a mile you know you're on edge

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.980 
it takes a mile you know you're on edge
and<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.140> don't<00:02:55.170> know<00:02:55.380> what<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.620> do<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.990> just

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
and you don't know what to do and just

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.220 
and you don't know what to do and just
before<00:02:58.230> impact<00:02:58.560> just<00:02:59.370> like<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.850> this<00:03:00.000> PSA<00:03:00.630> the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
before impact just like in this PSA the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.680 
before impact just like in this PSA the
engineer<00:03:01.800> sees<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.490> expression<00:03:03.150> on<00:03:03.270> people's

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
engineer sees the expression on people's

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.290 
engineer sees the expression on people's
faces<00:03:03.930> he<00:03:04.800> has<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.250> live<00:03:05.490> with<00:03:06.060> their

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
faces he has to live with their

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:14.000 
faces he has to live with their
decisions

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.080 

people<00:03:15.010> must<00:03:15.160> make<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.520> assumption<00:03:16.060> that

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
people must make the assumption that

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.610 
people must make the assumption that
when<00:03:16.390> they<00:03:16.510> come<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> great<00:03:17.050> crossing<00:03:17.440> there

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
when they come to a great crossing there

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.040 
when they come to a great crossing there
could<00:03:17.830> be<00:03:17.860> a<00:03:18.040> train<00:03:18.340> coming<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:18.850> for<00:03:19.810> them<00:03:19.930> to

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
could be a train coming and for them to

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.360 
could be a train coming and for them to
think<00:03:20.170> that<00:03:20.290> there's<00:03:20.740> no<00:03:20.860> train<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.130> come<00:03:21.280> at

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
think that there's no train to come at

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.250 
think that there's no train to come at
this<00:03:21.460> hour<00:03:21.640> that's<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:22.000> very<00:03:22.180> deadly<00:03:22.420> premise

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
this hour that's a very deadly premise

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260 
this hour that's a very deadly premise
basically<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.530> railroad<00:03:27.520> crossing<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.150> an

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
basically a railroad crossing is an

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.370 
basically a railroad crossing is an
intersection<00:03:28.720> like<00:03:28.960> every<00:03:29.260> other

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
intersection like every other

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.440 
intersection like every other
intersection<00:03:30.040> in<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.220> country<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.850> can't

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
intersection in this country I can't

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.880 
intersection in this country I can't
imagine<00:03:31.510> someone<00:03:31.960> sitting<00:03:32.380> in<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.560> red<00:03:32.710> light

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
imagine someone sitting in a red light

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.560 
imagine someone sitting in a red light
seeing<00:03:33.280> an<00:03:33.340> 18-wheeler<00:03:33.970> coming<00:03:34.300> down<00:03:34.420> the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
seeing an 18-wheeler coming down the

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.570 
seeing an 18-wheeler coming down the
road<00:03:34.690> at<00:03:34.870> 50<00:03:35.290> miles<00:03:35.470> per<00:03:35.650> hour<00:03:35.860> and<00:03:36.220> then

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
road at 50 miles per hour and then

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.830 
road at 50 miles per hour and then
pulling<00:03:36.910> out<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:37.120> front<00:03:37.150> of<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.510> because<00:03:37.600> they

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
pulling out in front of it because they

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.420 
pulling out in front of it because they
want<00:03:38.020> to<00:03:38.080> try<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.290> beat<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.890> gain<00:03:39.400> a

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
want to try to beat that to gain a

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.310 
want to try to beat that to gain a
little<00:03:39.550> seconds<00:03:40.270> but<00:03:40.660> people<00:03:40.900> do<00:03:41.020> that<00:03:41.140> every

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
little seconds but people do that every

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.290 
little seconds but people do that every
day<00:03:41.440> with<00:03:41.590> trains<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.430> next<00:03:42.760> time<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:43.120> come

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
day with trains the next time you come

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.830 
day with trains the next time you come
to<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:43.510> railroad<00:03:43.840> crossing<00:03:44.250> think<00:03:45.250> about<00:03:45.670> this

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.210 

kind<00:03:49.840> of<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:50.020> simple<00:03:50.410> thing<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.710> we<00:03:50.950> see<00:03:51.100> when

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
kind of a simple thing that we see when

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.320 
kind of a simple thing that we see when
you<00:03:51.310> approach<00:03:51.490> a<00:03:51.610> highway<00:03:51.880> real<00:03:52.090> great

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
you approach a highway real great

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.630 
you approach a highway real great
crossings<00:03:52.900> look<00:03:53.490> listen<00:03:54.490> and<00:03:54.910> live
