because of how easy it is to use

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.310 
because of how easy it is to use
downfall<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.390> is<00:05:15.570> that<00:05:15.900> even<00:05:16.200> though<00:05:16.290> you

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
downfall of it is that even though you

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.080 
downfall of it is that even though you
click<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:16.770> on<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:17.190> doesn't<00:05:17.520> have<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:17.670> memory

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
click it on it doesn't have a memory

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.780 
click it on it doesn't have a memory
setting<00:05:18.480> so<00:05:18.840> no<00:05:19.800> matter<00:05:19.950> when<00:05:20.280> you<00:05:20.310> click<00:05:20.640> it

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
setting so no matter when you click it

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.900 
setting so no matter when you click it
off<00:05:20.940> it's<00:05:21.270> not<00:05:21.450> going<00:05:21.690> to<00:05:21.750> reset<00:05:22.710> to<00:05:22.980> the<00:05:23.430> last

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
off it's not going to reset to the last

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.290 
off it's not going to reset to the last
mode<00:05:24.420> so<00:05:25.110> if<00:05:25.200> you<00:05:25.290> started<00:05:25.620> off<00:05:25.800> at<00:05:26.130> high<00:05:26.400> and

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
mode so if you started off at high and

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.030 
mode so if you started off at high and
you<00:05:27.390> want<00:05:27.600> it<00:05:27.660> to<00:05:27.780> go<00:05:27.960> too<00:05:28.020> high<00:05:28.290> it's<00:05:28.920> not

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
you want it to go too high it's not

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.710 
you want it to go too high it's not
going<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.520> return<00:05:29.640> it<00:05:29.970> it'll<00:05:30.180> start<00:05:30.390> back<00:05:30.690> at

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
going to return it it'll start back at

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.960 
going to return it it'll start back at
low<00:05:31.250> so<00:05:32.250> it's<00:05:32.340> a<00:05:32.370> little<00:05:32.550> bit<00:05:32.640> of<00:05:32.700> a<00:05:32.760> downfall

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
low so it's a little bit of a downfall

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.480 
low so it's a little bit of a downfall
of<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.450> but<00:05:34.050> it's<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:34.650> easy<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:34.980> use<00:05:35.100> that

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
of it but it's so easy to use that

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.590 
of it but it's so easy to use that
shouldn't<00:05:35.790> be<00:05:35.850> an<00:05:35.970> issue<00:05:36.090> in<00:05:36.570> general<00:05:38.360> so<00:05:39.360> I'm

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
shouldn't be an issue in general so I'm

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.880 
shouldn't be an issue in general so I'm
going<00:05:39.720> to<00:05:39.750> take<00:05:39.900> it<00:05:39.990> outside<00:05:40.140> and<00:05:40.590> just<00:05:40.770> let

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
going to take it outside and just let

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.940 
going to take it outside and just let
you<00:05:40.980> see<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:41.280> beam<00:05:41.520> of<00:05:41.790> it<00:05:41.940> and<00:05:42.560> see<00:05:43.560> how<00:05:43.710> far

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
you see the beam of it and see how far

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.710 
you see the beam of it and see how far
it<00:05:44.010> throws<00:05:44.460> and<00:05:44.760> just<00:05:44.880> how<00:05:45.000> bright<00:05:45.330> it<00:05:45.540> is<00:05:45.660> and

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
it throws and just how bright it is and

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.350 
it throws and just how bright it is and
how<00:05:46.110> easy<00:05:46.380> it<00:05:46.800> is<00:05:46.830> for<00:05:46.980> me<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.340> switch<00:05:48.090> through

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
how easy it is for me to switch through

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.060 
how easy it is for me to switch through
the<00:05:48.480> modes<00:05:49.880> with<00:05:50.880> one<00:05:51.060> hand<00:05:51.830> so<00:05:52.830> I'll<00:05:52.890> see

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
the modes with one hand so I'll see

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.730 
the modes with one hand so I'll see
outside<00:05:55.880> so<00:05:56.880> I'm<00:05:57.000> outside<00:05:57.150> with<00:05:57.540> the<00:05:57.630> D<00:05:57.780> 25<00:05:58.230> LC

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
outside so I'm outside with the D 25 LC

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.970 
outside so I'm outside with the D 25 LC
to<00:05:58.980> attack<00:05:59.700> flashlight<00:06:00.300> and<00:06:00.740> I'm<00:06:01.740> gonna<00:06:01.890> have

to attack flashlight and I'm gonna have
it<00:06:02.100> on<00:06:02.190> its<00:06:02.340> high<00:06:02.520> setting<00:06:02.970> which<00:06:03.150> means<00:06:03.360> I

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
it on its high setting which means I

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.330 
it on its high setting which means I
have<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.900> head<00:06:04.140> on<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:04.590> flashlight

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
have the head on the flashlight

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.840 
have the head on the flashlight
screwed<00:06:06.060> on<00:06:06.210> all<00:06:06.570> the<00:06:06.720> way<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.610> as<00:06:08.610> you<00:06:08.760> can

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
see I've got some great distance on it a

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.930 
see I've got some great distance on it a
great<00:06:12.900> beam<00:06:13.140> a<00:06:13.170> nice<00:06:13.560> hot<00:06:13.860> spot<00:06:14.250> right<00:06:14.460> there

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
great beam a nice hot spot right there

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.550 
great beam a nice hot spot right there
where<00:06:15.060> the<00:06:15.150> weeds<00:06:15.390> are<00:06:15.630> and<00:06:15.870> then<00:06:16.290> a<00:06:16.320> nice

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
where the weeds are and then a nice

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.770 
where the weeds are and then a nice
dispersion<00:06:17.190> of<00:06:17.280> light<00:06:17.340> and<00:06:18.240> you<00:06:18.300> tilt<00:06:18.570> down

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
dispersion of light and you tilt down

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.780 
dispersion of light and you tilt down
and<00:06:19.680> what's<00:06:19.800> really<00:06:20.070> awesome<00:06:20.100> about<00:06:20.460> this

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
and what's really awesome about this

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.260 
and what's really awesome about this
light<00:06:21.000> is<00:06:21.240> that<00:06:21.660> it<00:06:21.780> has<00:06:21.900> a<00:06:21.930> nice<00:06:22.230> full<00:06:22.770> circle

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
light is that it has a nice full circle

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.150 
light is that it has a nice full circle
so<00:06:24.270> you're<00:06:24.420> gonna<00:06:24.510> maintain<00:06:24.780> some<00:06:25.500> good

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
so you're gonna maintain some good

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.360 
so you're gonna maintain some good
detail<00:06:26.670> even<00:06:27.120> as<00:06:27.540> you<00:06:27.840> lead<00:06:28.680> away<00:06:28.920> from<00:06:28.950> the

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
detail even as you lead away from the

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.810 
detail even as you lead away from the
hotspot<00:06:29.850> you<00:06:30.320> can<00:06:31.320> see<00:06:31.560> you<00:06:32.280> can<00:06:32.430> tell<00:06:32.640> there's

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
hotspot you can see you can tell there's

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.750 
hotspot you can see you can tell there's
a<00:06:32.910> fence<00:06:33.210> back<00:06:33.510> there<00:06:34.460> Museum<00:06:35.460> in<00:06:35.610> on<00:06:35.760> it

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
a fence back there Museum in on it

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.580 
a fence back there Museum in on it
bushes

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
bushes

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.190 
bushes
and<00:06:41.430> you're<00:06:41.580> getting<00:06:41.760> some<00:06:42.210> good<00:06:42.240> detail<00:06:42.930> just

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
and you're getting some good detail just

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.270 
and you're getting some good detail just
on<00:06:43.320> its<00:06:43.470> highest<00:06:43.620> setting

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
on its highest setting

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:51.409 
on its highest setting
let<00:06:44.850> me<00:06:44.940> just<00:06:45.120> show<00:06:45.360> you<00:06:45.419> the<00:06:48.560> flash<00:06:49.560> on<00:06:50.130> it<00:06:50.419> so

let me just show you the flash on it so
there's<00:06:51.570> a<00:06:51.660> stroke<00:06:52.020> and<00:06:52.530> then<00:06:52.590> I'm<00:06:52.740> going<00:06:52.830> to

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
there's a stroke and then I'm going to

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:56.120 
there's a stroke and then I'm going to
turn<00:06:53.100> it<00:06:53.280> down<00:06:53.630> turn<00:06:54.630> the<00:06:54.690> head<00:06:55.050> so<00:06:55.980> you<00:06:56.070> can

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130 
turn it down turn the head so you can

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:03.350 
turn it down turn the head so you can
see<00:06:56.400> the<00:06:56.550> other<00:06:56.940> modes<00:07:01.310> and<00:07:02.310> you<00:07:02.370> see<00:07:03.000> how<00:07:03.120> easy

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
see the other modes and you see how easy

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.300 
see the other modes and you see how easy
it<00:07:03.510> is<00:07:03.630> I'm<00:07:03.990> on<00:07:04.290> the<00:07:04.470> lowest<00:07:04.800> mode<00:07:04.950> right<00:07:05.130> now

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
it is I'm on the lowest mode right now

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.909 
it is I'm on the lowest mode right now
and<00:07:05.639> even<00:07:06.360> for<00:07:06.690> a<00:07:06.720> low<00:07:06.960> mode<00:07:07.230> we've<00:07:07.710> got<00:07:07.889> a

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 
and even for a low mode we've got a

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.520 
and even for a low mode we've got a
little<00:07:08.160> bit<00:07:08.250> of<00:07:08.510> detail<00:07:09.510> right<00:07:10.169> in<00:07:10.290> the<00:07:10.380> hot

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
little bit of detail right in the hot

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.280 
little bit of detail right in the hot
spot<00:07:10.800> and<00:07:11.430> just<00:07:11.940> barely<00:07:12.270> push<00:07:12.660> it<00:07:12.810> down<00:07:12.990> and

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
spot and just barely push it down and

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.070 
spot and just barely push it down and
now<00:07:13.530> I'm<00:07:13.650> at<00:07:13.770> the<00:07:13.889> medium<00:07:14.690> push<00:07:15.690> it<00:07:15.840> down<00:07:15.960> again
