00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
some ratchet straps straps to keep the

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.290 
some ratchet straps straps to keep the
door<00:01:22.870> you<00:01:23.830> go<00:01:23.980> anywhere<00:01:24.340> that's<00:01:24.550> glued<00:01:25.120> on

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
door you go anywhere that's glued on

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.060 
door you go anywhere that's glued on
there<00:01:25.510> lots<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:25.900> step<00:01:26.110> with<00:01:26.260> the<00:01:26.500> strap<00:01:26.770> around

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
there lots of step with the strap around

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.500 
there lots of step with the strap around
emmalin's<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.610> other<00:01:27.820> way<00:01:27.970> around<00:01:28.090> as<00:01:28.360> well

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
emmalin's the other way around as well

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.920 
emmalin's the other way around as well
so<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.810> can't<00:01:29.110> get<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.320> base<00:01:29.500> off<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.930> all

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
so you can't get the base off and all

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.660 
so you can't get the base off and all
works<00:01:32.200> perfectly<00:01:33.130> fine

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670
