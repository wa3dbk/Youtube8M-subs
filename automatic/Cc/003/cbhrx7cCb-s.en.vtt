00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.990 
everything that's going on here
specifically<00:01:59.440> because<00:01:59.770> it's<00:02:00.340> out<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.729> focus

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
specifically because it's out of focus

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.809 
specifically because it's out of focus
and<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:02.380> lighting<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:02.890> really<00:02:02.920> bad<00:02:03.459> I'm

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
and the lighting is really bad I'm

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.339 
and the lighting is really bad I'm
guessing<00:02:04.300> they<00:02:04.390> use<00:02:04.569> the<00:02:04.720> on-camera<00:02:05.170> flash

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:05.349 
guessing they use the on-camera flash

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.330 
guessing they use the on-camera flash
which<00:02:05.950> gives<00:02:06.250> us<00:02:06.399> some<00:02:06.690> reflection<00:02:07.690> there

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
which gives us some reflection there

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.650 
which gives us some reflection there
this<00:02:09.340> photograph<00:02:09.849> we're<00:02:10.119> not<00:02:10.209> really<00:02:10.360> seeing

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
this photograph we're not really seeing

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.809 
this photograph we're not really seeing
the<00:02:10.810> entire<00:02:11.230> guitar<00:02:11.800> here<00:02:12.099> we're<00:02:12.340> just<00:02:12.489> not<00:02:12.610> up

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
the entire guitar here we're just not up

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.260 
the entire guitar here we're just not up
close<00:02:12.849> enough<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:14.220> here<00:02:15.220> well<00:02:15.489> it's<00:02:16.090> out<00:02:16.239> of

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
close enough and here well it's out of

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.809 
close enough and here well it's out of
focus<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:17.050> think<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.770> watch<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.430> it's

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
focus I think it's a watch and it's

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.490 
focus I think it's a watch and it's
really<00:02:18.910> not<00:02:19.120> taking<00:02:19.629> up<00:02:19.720> enough<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.200> frame

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
really not taking up enough of the frame

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.660 
really not taking up enough of the frame
they<00:02:20.709> could<00:02:20.890> have<00:02:21.010> they<00:02:21.280> could<00:02:21.340> have<00:02:21.459> done<00:02:21.550> a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
they could have they could have done a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.130 
they could have they could have done a
lot<00:02:21.790> better<00:02:21.849> job<00:02:22.270> here<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:22.660> we<00:02:22.750> could<00:02:22.840> see

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
lot better job here so we could see

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.750 
lot better job here so we could see
everything<00:02:23.860> that's<00:02:24.069> going<00:02:24.370> on<00:02:24.459> with<00:02:24.670> this
