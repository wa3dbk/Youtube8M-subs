00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
so what it's not done its processing at

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.610 
so what it's not done its processing at
cinemagraph<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.260> can<00:02:32.380> see<00:02:32.500> it's

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
cinemagraph and you can see it's

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.020 
cinemagraph and you can see it's
highlighting<00:02:33.069> areas<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.520> thinks<00:02:33.940> are

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
highlighting areas it thinks are

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.800 
highlighting areas it thinks are
animated<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.890> for<00:02:36.040> tug<00:02:36.190> this<00:02:36.540> it's<00:02:37.540> catching

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
animated so for tug this it's catching

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.610 
animated so for tug this it's catching
my<00:02:38.050> feet<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.810> basically<00:02:41.140> creating<00:02:41.530> an

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
my feet and it's basically creating an

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.199 
my feet and it's basically creating an
animated<00:02:42.040> gif<00:02:42.069> that<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.520> can<00:02:42.670> control<00:02:43.030> the

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
animated gif that you can control the

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.000 
animated gif that you can control the
length<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.630> animation<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.230> which<00:02:44.470> air<00:02:44.709> is

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
length of the animation and which air is

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.610 
length of the animation and which air is
animated<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:46.599> brush<00:02:46.780> on<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:46.989> side<00:02:49.530> if<00:02:50.530> I

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
animated so this brush on the side if I

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.250 
animated so this brush on the side if I
paint<00:02:50.920> over<00:02:51.519> this<00:02:51.700> area<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.420> then<00:02:52.599> unanimity

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
paint over this area this then unanimity

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.979 
paint over this area this then unanimity
that<00:02:53.530> region<00:02:54.120> then<00:02:55.120> only<00:02:55.300> one<00:02:55.540> part<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.900> the
