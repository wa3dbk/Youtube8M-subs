surprise you believe it or not but it's
not<00:00:23.480> quite<00:00:23.869> as<00:00:23.990> bad<00:00:24.380> as<00:00:24.800> it's<00:00:25.160> been<00:00:25.220> made<00:00:25.670> out

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
not quite as bad as it's been made out

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.500 
not quite as bad as it's been made out
to<00:00:26.180> be<00:00:26.330> in<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:26.960> mainstream<00:00:27.470> media<00:00:28.390> so<00:00:29.390> there's

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
to be in the mainstream media so there's

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.759 
to be in the mainstream media so there's
a<00:00:29.630> couple<00:00:29.869> things<00:00:29.990> I<00:00:30.140> really<00:00:30.380> like<00:00:30.560> with<00:00:30.710> the

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
a couple things I really like with the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.560 
a couple things I really like with the
game<00:00:30.949> first<00:00:31.369> off<00:00:31.640> I<00:00:31.820> really<00:00:31.850> enjoyed<00:00:32.329> the

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
game first off I really enjoyed the

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.590 
game first off I really enjoyed the
simple<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:33.140> fun<00:00:33.410> elemental<00:00:34.190> system<00:00:34.760> it's

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
simple and fun elemental system it's

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.510 
simple and fun elemental system it's
super<00:00:36.170> super<00:00:36.500> easy<00:00:36.530> you'll<00:00:36.980> pick<00:00:37.130> it<00:00:37.160> up<00:00:37.340> in

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
super super easy you'll pick it up in

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.090 
super super easy you'll pick it up in
just<00:00:37.760> like<00:00:37.880> a<00:00:37.940> few<00:00:38.210> minutes<00:00:38.420> each<00:00:38.840> dragon<00:00:39.710> has

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
just like a few minutes each dragon has

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.830 
just like a few minutes each dragon has
one<00:00:40.460> of<00:00:40.579> three<00:00:40.610> different<00:00:41.210> elements<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.809> it

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
one of three different elements to it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.010 
one of three different elements to it
fire<00:00:42.350> light<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:43.070> win<00:00:43.430> a<00:00:43.730> fourth<00:00:44.420> option<00:00:44.630> is

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
fire light and win a fourth option is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.530 
fire light and win a fourth option is
void<00:00:45.500> which<00:00:46.250> technically<00:00:46.820> isn't<00:00:47.030> an<00:00:47.270> element

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
void which technically isn't an element

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.200 
void which technically isn't an element
anyways<00:00:48.290> fire<00:00:48.829> is<00:00:49.040> stronger<00:00:49.399> than<00:00:49.520> wind<00:00:49.820> wind

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
anyways fire is stronger than wind wind

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.880 
anyways fire is stronger than wind wind
stronger<00:00:50.660> than<00:00:50.809> light<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.020> light<00:00:51.440> stronger

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
stronger than light and light stronger

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.860 
stronger than light and light stronger
than<00:00:52.010> fire<00:00:52.250> void<00:00:52.789> is<00:00:53.000> neutral<00:00:53.420> to<00:00:53.570> all<00:00:53.660> other

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
than fire void is neutral to all other

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.049 
than fire void is neutral to all other
elements<00:00:54.350> it's<00:00:54.980> extremely<00:00:55.610> important<00:00:55.969> you

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
elements it's extremely important you

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.270 
elements it's extremely important you
pick<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.510> stronger<00:00:57.289> element<00:00:57.710> because<00:00:58.039> you're

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
pick the stronger element because you're

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.139 
pick the stronger element because you're
awarded<00:00:58.610> a<00:00:59.379> 25%<00:01:00.379> damage<00:01:00.860> increase<00:01:01.370> select<00:01:02.000> the

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
awarded a 25% damage increase select the

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.420 
awarded a 25% damage increase select the
wrong<00:01:02.420> one<00:01:02.750> though<00:01:03.020> and<00:01:03.260> your<00:01:03.530> enemies<00:01:04.100> get

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
wrong one though and your enemies get

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.639 
wrong one though and your enemies get
the<00:01:04.729> bonus<00:01:05.149> instead<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.049> I<00:01:06.079> like<00:01:06.529> the

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
the bonus instead so I like the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.179 
the bonus instead so I like the
diversity<00:01:07.069> that<00:01:07.719> it<00:01:08.719> offers<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.439> there's

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
diversity that it offers and there's

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.129 
diversity that it offers and there's
also<00:01:10.459> interesting<00:01:10.850> because<00:01:10.880> while<00:01:11.689> you're

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:12.139 
also interesting because while you're

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:14.859 
also interesting because while you're
sort<00:01:13.009> of<00:01:13.100> evolving<00:01:13.819> your<00:01:13.999> dragons<00:01:14.539> which<00:01:14.719> I'll

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
sort of evolving your dragons which I'll

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.410 
sort of evolving your dragons which I'll
touch<00:01:15.049> on<00:01:15.229> in<00:01:15.409> just<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.679> second<00:01:16.090> you're<00:01:17.090> allowed

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
touch on in just a second you're allowed

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.730 
touch on in just a second you're allowed
to<00:01:17.979> pick<00:01:18.979> a<00:01:19.009> secondary<00:01:19.609> weapon<00:01:20.029> or<00:01:20.740> basically

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
to pick a secondary weapon or basically

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.099 
to pick a secondary weapon or basically
a<00:01:21.770> elemental<00:01:22.579> attack<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:23.209> isn't<00:01:23.779> associated

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:24.109 
a elemental attack that isn't associated

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:26.830 
a elemental attack that isn't associated
with<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.709> same<00:01:24.889> element<00:01:25.399> as<00:01:25.549> your<00:01:26.060> dragon<00:01:26.689> so

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
with the same element as your dragon so

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.870 
with the same element as your dragon so
again<00:01:27.079> this<00:01:27.259> offers<00:01:27.709> just<00:01:28.429> a<00:01:28.490> little<00:01:28.670> bit<00:01:28.759> more

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
again this offers just a little bit more

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.179 
again this offers just a little bit more
variety<00:01:29.149> in<00:01:29.719> terms<00:01:29.959> of<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.560> dragons<00:01:31.069> that

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
variety in terms of the dragons that

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.459 
variety in terms of the dragons that
you're<00:01:31.429> allowed<00:01:31.639> to<00:01:31.749> sort<00:01:32.749> of<00:01:32.840> evolve<00:01:33.229> over

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
you're allowed to sort of evolve over

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.010 
you're allowed to sort of evolve over

chore because both the movement and

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.450 
chore because both the movement and
camera<00:04:37.200> controls<00:04:37.620> are<00:04:37.800> sort<00:04:37.979> of<00:04:38.070> mapped<00:04:38.310> to

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
the same analog stick and you still have

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.310 
the same analog stick and you still have
to<00:04:41.310> control<00:04:41.729> your<00:04:41.880> reticle<00:04:42.330> in<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.930> at<00:04:43.229> the

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
to control your reticle in the at the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.379 
to control your reticle in the at the
same<00:04:43.530> time<00:04:43.860> so<00:04:44.190> controlling<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:44.940> dragony

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
same time so controlling the dragony

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.409 
same time so controlling the dragony
stages<00:04:45.840> is<00:04:46.130> extremely<00:04:47.130> annoying<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:48.270> voice

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
stages is extremely annoying the voice

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.230 
stages is extremely annoying the voice
acting<00:04:48.960> isn't<00:04:49.229> cheesy<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:50.010> would<00:04:50.310> say<00:04:50.520> but<00:04:51.030> it's

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
acting isn't cheesy I would say but it's

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.540 
acting isn't cheesy I would say but it's
acted<00:04:51.600> without<00:04:51.750> any<00:04:52.139> emotion<00:04:52.650> at<00:04:52.770> all<00:04:53.130> and

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
acted without any emotion at all and

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.190 
acted without any emotion at all and
it's<00:04:54.000> odd<00:04:54.180> because<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.660> dialogue<00:04:55.020> is

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
it's odd because the dialogue is

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.050 
it's odd because the dialogue is
actually<00:04:55.590> pretty<00:04:55.919> good<00:04:56.250> but<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.669> comes<00:04:56.790> across

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
actually pretty good but it comes across

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.879 
actually pretty good but it comes across
like<00:04:57.389> the<00:04:57.510> voice<00:04:57.720> actors<00:04:58.110> just<00:04:58.350> didn't<00:04:58.680> give<00:04:58.830> a

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
like the voice actors just didn't give a

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.940 
like the voice actors just didn't give a
damn<00:04:59.270> something<00:05:00.270> else<00:05:00.450> is<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:01.320> Kinect<00:05:01.650> voice

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
damn something else is that Kinect voice

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.219 
damn something else is that Kinect voice
commands<00:05:02.400> they<00:05:02.790> worked<00:05:03.090> well<00:05:03.540> but<00:05:03.930> they<00:05:04.169> were

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
commands they worked well but they were

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.500 
commands they worked well but they were
simply<00:05:04.919> there<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.610> replace<00:05:05.850> a<00:05:05.970> button<00:05:06.360> press

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
simply there to replace a button press

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.420 
simply there to replace a button press
like<00:05:06.930> for<00:05:07.080> example<00:05:07.139> you<00:05:07.530> can<00:05:07.710> say<00:05:07.860> fall<00:05:08.190> back

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
like for example you can say fall back

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.300 
like for example you can say fall back
to<00:05:08.729> your<00:05:08.850> wingman<00:05:09.240> or<00:05:09.479> simply<00:05:10.380> press<00:05:10.530> down<00:05:10.860> on

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
to your wingman or simply press down on

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.580 
to your wingman or simply press down on
the<00:05:11.669> d-pad<00:05:11.790> and<00:05:12.210> it's<00:05:12.510> faster<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.020> just<00:05:13.350> hit

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
the d-pad and it's faster to just hit

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.310 
the d-pad and it's faster to just hit
down<00:05:13.919> on<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.280> d-pad<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:15.270> camera<00:05:15.690> angles<00:05:16.020> can

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
down on the d-pad the camera angles can

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.060 
down on the d-pad the camera angles can
also<00:05:16.470> be<00:05:16.770> really<00:05:17.750> really<00:05:18.750> bad<00:05:18.960> at<00:05:19.289> times<00:05:19.530> far

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
also be really really bad at times far

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.800 
also be really really bad at times far
too<00:05:20.190> often<00:05:20.490> I<00:05:20.580> found<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:20.880> camera<00:05:21.240> will<00:05:21.419> swoop

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
too often I found the camera will swoop

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.540 
too often I found the camera will swoop
and<00:05:22.020> turn<00:05:22.260> your<00:05:22.470> dragon<00:05:22.860> in<00:05:22.950> a<00:05:23.039> particular

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
and turn your dragon in a particular

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.340 
and turn your dragon in a particular
angle<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.060> that<00:05:24.210> you<00:05:24.300> don't<00:05:24.539> see<00:05:24.750> incoming

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
angle so that you don't see incoming

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.409 
angle so that you don't see incoming
projectiles<00:05:25.919> other<00:05:26.610> times<00:05:26.910> I'll<00:05:27.060> be<00:05:27.090> lining

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:28.909 
projectiles other times I'll be lining
up<00:05:27.600> your<00:05:27.780> shots<00:05:28.020> against<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.440> group<00:05:28.620> of<00:05:28.770> enemies

up your shots against a group of enemies

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.969 
up your shots against a group of enemies
when<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.580> camera<00:05:30.000> just<00:05:30.180> pulls<00:05:30.630> right<00:05:31.050> away<00:05:31.380> to

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
when the camera just pulls right away to

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.860 
when the camera just pulls right away to
the<00:05:32.130> next<00:05:32.280> group<00:05:32.520> of<00:05:32.700> enemies<00:05:33.090> that<00:05:33.450> are<00:05:33.690> were

decided<00:05:40.289> to<00:05:40.620> switch<00:05:40.950> it<00:05:41.130> for<00:05:41.340> for<00:05:42.150> this<00:05:42.270> one<00:05:42.479> so

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
decided to switch it for for this one so

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.200 
decided to switch it for for this one so
overall<00:05:43.830> a<00:05:43.860> Crimson<00:05:44.280> Dragon<00:05:44.639> has<00:05:44.880> its<00:05:45.090> fair

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
overall a Crimson Dragon has its fair

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.150 
overall a Crimson Dragon has its fair
share<00:05:45.270> of<00:05:45.479> problems<00:05:45.570> there's<00:05:46.320> no<00:05:46.680> question

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
share of problems there's no question

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.490 
share of problems there's no question
about<00:05:47.250> that<00:05:47.430> but<00:05:48.120> I<00:05:48.150> did<00:05:48.270> find<00:05:48.660> it<00:05:48.900> remained<00:05:49.289> a

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
about that but I did find it remained a

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.230 
about that but I did find it remained a
fun<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:49.919> engaging<00:05:50.070> experience<00:05:50.970> nonetheless

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
fun and engaging experience nonetheless

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.020 
fun and engaging experience nonetheless
and<00:05:51.900> once<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.740> co-op<00:05:53.070> patch<00:05:53.340> is<00:05:53.550> released<00:05:53.880> I

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
and once the co-op patch is released I

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.210 
and once the co-op patch is released I
really<00:05:54.560> believe<00:05:55.560> there's<00:05:55.800> gonna<00:05:55.919> be<00:05:56.039> some

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
really believe there's gonna be some

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.879 
really believe there's gonna be some
genuine<00:05:56.610> fun<00:05:57.150> to<00:05:57.419> be<00:05:57.539> had<00:05:57.750> here<00:05:58.229> because<00:05:58.710> the

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
genuine fun to be had here because the

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.040 
genuine fun to be had here because the
core<00:05:59.099> gameplay<00:05:59.430> is<00:05:59.669> tight<00:06:00.150> it's<00:06:00.720> just<00:06:00.930> that

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
core gameplay is tight it's just that

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.629 
core gameplay is tight it's just that
the<00:06:01.110> camera<00:06:01.560> system<00:06:01.770> leaves<00:06:02.220> a<00:06:02.310> lot<00:06:02.490> to<00:06:02.520> be

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
the camera system leaves a lot to be

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.240 
the camera system leaves a lot to be
desired<00:06:02.880> and<00:06:03.419> those<00:06:03.870> open<00:06:04.380> areas<00:06:04.860> should<00:06:05.160> have

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
desired and those open areas should have

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.930 
desired and those open areas should have
been<00:06:05.340> removed

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
been removed

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.080 
been removed
completely<00:06:06.420> because<00:06:06.780> they<00:06:06.960> suck<00:06:07.830> I'd<00:06:08.580> say<00:06:08.850> if

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090
