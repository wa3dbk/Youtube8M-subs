00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.680
 welcome to the last video of the room 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.569
 module throughout this module we have 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.770
 seen very important tools that 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.170
 they will help us implement and 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.870
 control all those strategies that 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.340
 we generate in modules 2 and 3 what 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.289
 comes next is a small 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.400
 practical example that brings together all 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.400
 concepts of this module 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.830
 let's base this example on the case of 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.260
 a real project although all the data 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.240
 will be invented this is a 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.710
 annual activity carried out by the club 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.410
 entrepreneurs of the universitat abat 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.390
 oliba ceu is called bcn thinking 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.970
 challenge 'and consists of a hackathon 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.400
 that brings together three concepts scope 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.980
 university entrepreneurship and action 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.690
 social during the silky 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.580
 participants are presented with a 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.070
 business case in which by groups of 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.540
 work must find a solution 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.610
 entrepreneur for some kind of 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.800
 disadvantaged collective 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.540
 the next day there is a gala in which 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.120
 Each group presents its proposal to the 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.970
 assistants and a jury determines which 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.800
 been the best proposal well in 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.720
 this section we are going to imagine how 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.830
 would fit the seen so far so that 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.590
 the guys from the entrepreneurs club 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.650
 can develop a new edition of the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.630
 bcn thinking charts 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.580
 the first thing that the boys should do 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.350
 the club would be a GANT chart 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.600
 listing each and every one of the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.210
 tasks that should be carried out for 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.700
 the execution of the project would have to 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.350
 do it as explained 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.840
 indicating the start date the duration 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.080
 to whom each task is assigned what tasks 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.220
 must be done before etc. it is evident 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.410
 that a project of this magnitude 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.690
 contains many tasks that must be 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.130
 executed so we will simplify it 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.130
 as can be seen in the graph 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.619
 How will you have to control the 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.840
 detail of the evolution of the project 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.509
 we will have to design a scorecard 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.679
 with a series of identifiers 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.020
 sorry indicators that will leave 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.659
 completing these indicators depend 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.640
 of each project in this case to the 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.069
 guys are very interested in knowing data 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.810
 about the impact on social networks the 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.689
 satisfaction of the participants 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.850
 assistance and so on at the end of 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.519
 project can be collected all 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.019
 total data in a box to be able 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.019
 appreciate the overall result 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.170
 and continuing with what we have seen in the 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.360
 module to be framed in a 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.180
 Continuous improvement methodology must be 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.820
 design a pdc model that allows us to 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.010
 avoid mistakes improve things 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.370
 positive and surpass us in the next 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.930
 edition for it we will follow all the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.910
 phases that were already explained 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.280
 taking into account that the box 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.960
 controls saves us the job of having 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.840
 than designing new indicators of 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.150
 control and that's how you can manage 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.190
 a project as complex as bcn 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.690
 thinking talents getting success 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.690
 what he gets in each edition
