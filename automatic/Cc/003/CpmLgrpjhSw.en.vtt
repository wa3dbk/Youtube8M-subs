00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 in the end we say work always pays 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.960
 and then then we are treated to that 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.790
 unfortunately they are a little bit more nervous 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.500
 in races then they make a little less ce 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.599
 others are on the contrary 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.089
 make the moments in full right 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.500
 whose adrenaline we say so pump to 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.900
 maximum and also called this is also 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.560
 the hour of Japanese watched a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.939
 double screwing but unfortunately we are 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.369
 speaking of boys junior athletes who 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.650
 they must find in these 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.660
 situations in these contexts must 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.190
 try these big difficulties that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.290
 they need to be assimilated 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.870
 so in these years they will bring us 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.640
 this athlete for example this 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.340
 just screwing I'm sure it 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.780
 will improve emiliana then we will find it 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.789
 let us also see that it does not happen 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.910
 nothing we will find as our own 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.920
 adversary to rio and maybe do double 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.870
 we have perfect twists 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.059
 helped with this race by giving 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.399
 the opportunity to test yourself in this 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.329
 context as you see the public you see 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.699
 are the televisions 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.799
 there is that context that gives the athlete 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.400
 that extra difficulty is there to be 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.530
 one 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.630
 her with the tool in front of everyone here 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.020
 you feel good jesolo because he is a 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.470
 appointment we say now become 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.930
 fixed in the international calendar e 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.640
 this is certainly due to the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.649
 I think that organizing society 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.479
 you already travel call 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.009
 intervention but I brought I want 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.570
 remember again why you have 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.759
 a meeting of this level in Italy 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.820
 We in four continents there is a 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.450
 what really really difficult 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.860
 you see looks good and you see that even i 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.659
 Japanese have four followed 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.520
 exactly what our strategy could do 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.140
 settle here not overturned late or 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.970
 because obviously we have also seen it 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.819
 in my mind it is only this 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.729
 overturned expected jump was very ready 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:56.330
 but it was certainly not worrying 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.400
 from the health point of view one is 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.790
 approved found 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.790
 I don't know who he is
