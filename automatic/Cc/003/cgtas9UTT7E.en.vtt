mine's pretty straightforward Jen's is a

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.009 
mine's pretty straightforward Jen's is a
subtler<00:03:35.310> thing<00:03:35.519> but<00:03:36.090> again<00:03:36.359> when<00:03:36.870> you're

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
subtler thing but again when you're

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
thinking about right III have to make

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.099 
thinking about right III have to make
sure<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.269> is<00:03:39.419> the<00:03:39.450> building<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:39.870> want<00:03:39.959> to

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
penny pincher and I mean no we've played

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.500 
penny pincher and I mean no we've played
a<00:04:03.930> couple<00:04:04.169> of<00:04:04.260> times<00:04:04.349> now<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.950> there<00:04:05.579> are<00:04:05.760> so

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
a couple of times now and there are so

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.750 
a couple of times now and there are so
many<00:04:06.690> all<00:04:06.959> these<00:04:07.410> cool<00:04:07.680> official<00:04:08.099> powers<00:04:08.459> are

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
many all these cool official powers are

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.550 
many all these cool official powers are
very<00:04:09.269> very<00:04:09.540> unique<00:04:09.690> very<00:04:10.109> very<00:04:10.290> different

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
very very unique very very different

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.839 
very very unique very very different
least<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.799> ones<00:04:10.949> we've<00:04:11.069> seen<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:11.489> far<00:04:11.519> and

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
least the ones we've seen so far and

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.849 
least the ones we've seen so far and
they<00:04:12.239> really<00:04:12.690> change<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.199> way<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.379> play<00:04:13.620> they

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
they really change the way you play they

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.289 
they really change the way you play they
really<00:04:14.220> give<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.370> different<00:04:14.819> strategies<00:04:15.269> to

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
really give you different strategies to

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.029 
really give you different strategies to
try<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.599> pursue<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.500> fact<00:04:16.709> that<00:04:16.799> there's

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
try to pursue and the fact that there's

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.490 
try to pursue and the fact that there's
twenty<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.820> them<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.180> there<00:04:18.570> are<00:04:18.690> so<00:04:19.289> many

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
twenty of them and there are so many

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.569 
twenty of them and there are so many
different<00:04:19.829> buildings<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.190> every<00:04:20.340> time<00:04:20.489> you

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
different buildings and every time you

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.830 
different buildings and every time you
play<00:04:20.729> you're<00:04:20.910> gonna<00:04:20.970> get<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.209> different<00:04:21.660> set<00:04:21.810> of

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
play you're gonna get a different set of

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.659 
play you're gonna get a different set of
buildings<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.650> only<00:04:22.800> way<00:04:22.919> we<00:04:23.070> played<00:04:23.280> one

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
buildings the only way we played one

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.779 
buildings the only way we played one
game<00:04:24.020> where<00:04:25.020> almost<00:04:25.740> all<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.070> buildings<00:04:26.400> were

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
game where almost all the buildings were

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:27.629 
game where almost all the buildings were
about<00:04:27.030> manipulate

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
about manipulate

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:28.709 
about manipulate
the<00:04:27.729> market<00:04:27.999> and<00:04:28.120> there<00:04:28.210> were<00:04:28.270> very<00:04:28.449> few

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:28.719 
the market and there were very few

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:30.059 
the market and there were very few
buildings<00:04:28.900> that<00:04:29.229> actually<00:04:29.590> would<00:04:29.740> generate

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 
buildings that actually would generate

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.189 
buildings that actually would generate
more<00:04:30.219> Goods<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:30.969> we<00:04:31.060> had<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.360> rely<00:04:31.569> on<00:04:31.599> our<00:04:31.990> own

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
more Goods so we had to rely on our own

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.800 
more Goods so we had to rely on our own
building<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:33.610> generate<00:04:34.090> goods<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.479> we

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
building to generate goods and we

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.059 
building to generate goods and we
actually<00:04:34.960> found<00:04:35.229> ourselves<00:04:35.620> going<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.949> our

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
actually found ourselves going to our

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.040 
actually found ourselves going to our
opponents<00:04:36.490> building<00:04:36.759> a<00:04:36.879> lot<00:04:37.150> more<00:04:37.360> often<00:04:37.659> and

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
opponents building a lot more often and

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.179 
opponents building a lot more often and
paying<00:04:38.259> them<00:04:38.409> resources<00:04:38.680> we<00:04:38.949> get<00:04:39.099> the

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:39.189 
paying them resources we get the

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.040 
paying them resources we get the
resource<00:04:39.490> we<00:04:39.610> need<00:04:39.789> but<00:04:40.389> that<00:04:40.569> market<00:04:40.930> was

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
resource we need but that market was

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.659 
resource we need but that market was
incredibly<00:04:41.650> volatile<00:04:41.979> but<00:04:42.099> it<00:04:42.189> created<00:04:42.520> a

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
incredibly volatile but it created a

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.029 
incredibly volatile but it created a
very<00:04:43.060> very<00:04:43.330> different<00:04:43.599> feel<00:04:44.080> than<00:04:44.349> you<00:04:44.949> know<00:04:45.009> a

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
very very different feel than you know a

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.409 
very very different feel than you know a
game<00:04:45.310> like<00:04:45.490> this<00:04:45.550> where<00:04:45.999> there<00:04:46.150> happened<00:04:46.389> to

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
game like this where there happened to

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.149 
game like this where there happened to
be<00:04:46.479> a<00:04:46.539> lot<00:04:46.749> of<00:04:46.810> goods<00:04:47.409> generating<00:04:47.770> resources

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
be a lot of goods generating resources

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.550 
be a lot of goods generating resources
so<00:04:48.279> there's<00:04:48.729> just<00:04:48.849> a<00:04:49.090> ton<00:04:49.449> of<00:04:49.509> variety<00:04:49.779> in<00:04:50.169> this

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
so there's just a ton of variety in this

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.659 
so there's just a ton of variety in this
box<00:04:51.029> and<00:04:52.029> it's<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:52.270> very<00:04:52.919> satisfying<00:04:53.919> game<00:04:54.460> but

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
box and it's a very satisfying game but

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.179 
box and it's a very satisfying game but
gives<00:04:54.819> you<00:04:54.939> quite<00:04:55.199> a<00:04:56.199> surprising<00:04:56.800> amount<00:04:57.009> of

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:57.189 
gives you quite a surprising amount of

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:58.379 
gives you quite a surprising amount of
depth<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:57.520> think<00:04:57.819> about<00:04:58.060> while<00:04:58.270> you're

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
depth to think about while you're

00:04:58.389 --> 00:04:59.580 
depth to think about while you're
playing<00:04:58.569> I'm<00:04:58.749> not<00:04:58.870> saying<00:04:59.199> this<00:04:59.289> is<00:04:59.409> gonna

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
playing I'm not saying this is gonna

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.080 
playing I'm not saying this is gonna
yell<00:04:59.770> explode<00:05:00.250> your<00:05:00.430> brain<00:05:00.669> or<00:05:00.789> anything<00:05:00.909> like

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
yell explode your brain or anything like

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.670 
yell explode your brain or anything like

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150
