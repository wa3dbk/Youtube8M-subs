have to be a high level i guess and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.660 
have to be a high level i guess and
people<00:01:16.650> leave<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.220> make<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.520> know<00:01:17.580> a

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
change other monsters too so that
they're<00:05:11.120> going<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:11.330> change<00:05:11.510> their<00:05:11.690> combat

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
they're going to change their combat

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.680 
they're going to change their combat
levels<00:05:12.520> but<00:05:13.520> you<00:05:13.670> don't<00:05:13.910> gain<00:05:14.090> XP<00:05:14.480> if<00:05:14.540> it's

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
levels but you don't gain XP if it's

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.440 
levels but you don't gain XP if it's
more<00:05:15.110> than<00:05:15.170> 30<00:05:15.620> levels<00:05:15.980> below<00:05:16.190> you<00:05:16.340> just<00:05:17.270> to

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
more than 30 levels below you just to

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.900 
more than 30 levels below you just to
make<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:18.080> fight<00:05:18.350> harder<00:05:18.770> stuff<00:05:19.010> so<00:05:19.760> that

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
make you fight harder stuff so that

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.100 
make you fight harder stuff so that
means<00:05:20.090> after<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.540> evolution<00:05:20.870> of<00:05:20.930> combat

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
means after the evolution of combat

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.640 
means after the evolution of combat
there<00:05:21.410> is<00:05:21.530> no<00:05:21.890> AFK<00:05:23.020> because<00:05:24.020> these<00:05:24.230> monsters

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
there is no AFK because these monsters

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.670 
there is no AFK because these monsters
are<00:05:24.830> you<00:05:25.190> know<00:05:25.280> relatively<00:05:25.730> low<00:05:26.530> there's<00:05:27.530> no

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
are you know relatively low there's no

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.590 
are you know relatively low there's no
AFK<00:05:28.100> you<00:05:28.160> have<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.430> fight<00:05:28.580> big<00:05:28.850> monsters<00:05:29.360> and

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
AFK you have to fight big monsters and

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.450 
AFK you have to fight big monsters and
you<00:05:29.660> have<00:05:29.810> to<00:05:29.960> it's<00:05:30.800> it's<00:05:31.100> just<00:05:31.280> kind<00:05:31.430> of
