arts<00:01:44.970> are<00:01:45.360> our<00:01:45.990> fundamentals<00:01:46.619> animation<00:01:47.220> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
arts are our fundamentals animation and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.130 
arts are our fundamentals animation and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
graphics and electronic game design

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.590 
graphics and electronic game design
electronic<00:01:50.070> game<00:01:50.280> which<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.579> electronic<00:01:51.450> game

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
electronic game which is electronic game

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.690 
electronic game which is electronic game
design<00:01:52.020> which<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> programming<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.310> then

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
design which is the programming and then

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.880 
design which is the programming and then
electronic<00:01:54.119> game<00:01:54.360> 3d<00:01:54.750> graphics<00:01:55.229> which<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
electronic game 3d graphics which is the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.850 
electronic game 3d graphics which is the
technical<00:01:56.280> art<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.750> fact<00:01:57.960> we're<00:01:58.259> one<00:01:58.770> of

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
technical art and in fact we're one of

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.350 
technical art and in fact we're one of
the<00:01:58.950> only<00:01:59.100> schools<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.610> North<00:01:59.790> America<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.329> I

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the only schools in North America that I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.109 
the only schools in North America that I
can<00:02:00.540> find<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.409> actually<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:02.009> both<00:02:02.369> 3d

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
can find that actually have both 3d

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.139 
can find that actually have both 3d
graphics<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.810> programmers<00:02:04.619> because<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
graphics and programmers because the the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.449 
graphics and programmers because the the
main<00:02:06.360> goal<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:07.320> our<00:02:07.469> animation<00:02:08.069> programs

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
main goal is in our animation programs

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.200 
main goal is in our animation programs
and<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
and in the

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.840 
and in the
in<00:02:09.270> design<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.900> that<00:02:10.620> we<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.070> mock<00:02:11.430> studio

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
in design is that we have mock studio

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.720 
in design is that we have mock studio
environments<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.840> they<00:02:12.990> actually<00:02:13.140> work<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:14.130> if

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
environments so they actually work is if

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.330 
environments so they actually work is if
they're<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.240> studio<00:02:15.540> environment<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.470> so

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
they're in a studio environment and so

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.860 
they're in a studio environment and so
the<00:02:17.490> programmers<00:02:18.060> get<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.420> work<00:02:18.570> with<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
the programmers get to work with the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.510 
the programmers get to work with the
artist<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.590> they<00:02:19.710> get<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.950> work<00:02:19.980> together<00:02:20.280> on

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
artist and they get to work together on

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.150 
artist and they get to work together on
prototypes<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.960> as<00:02:22.560> they<00:02:22.710> move<00:02:22.890> through<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
prototypes and as they move through the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.830 
prototypes and as they move through the
program<00:02:23.370> those<00:02:24.000> things<00:02:24.210> get<00:02:24.390> more<00:02:24.540> advanced

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
program those things get more advanced

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.450 
program those things get more advanced
well<00:02:25.350> Heather<00:02:25.470> maybe<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.070> can<00:02:26.160> tell<00:02:26.280> us<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.430> bit

course<00:03:01.650> Joe<00:03:01.860> we<00:03:02.580> do<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:03.240> lot<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.720> logic<00:03:04.400> how

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
course Joe we do a lot of logic how

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.180 
course Joe we do a lot of logic how
computers<00:03:05.880> think<00:03:06.150> how<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.740> make<00:03:07.740> them<00:03:07.950> think

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
computers think how to make them think

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.460 
computers think how to make them think
like<00:03:08.370> we<00:03:08.610> want<00:03:08.790> them<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.120> think<00:03:09.470> because

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
like we want them to think because

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.780 
like we want them to think because
they're<00:03:10.650> only<00:03:10.800> as<00:03:10.980> smart<00:03:11.070> as<00:03:11.280> we<00:03:11.400> tell<00:03:11.550> them<00:03:11.670> to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
they're only as smart as we tell them to

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.060 
they're only as smart as we tell them to
be<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.450> are<00:03:12.900> each<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.710> every<00:03:13.830> one<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:13.950> you

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
be so are each and every one of you

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.700 
be so are each and every one of you
working<00:03:15.000> on<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.120> game<00:03:16.110> or<00:03:16.290> I'll<00:03:16.440> work<00:03:16.560> on

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
working on a game or I'll work on

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.860 
working on a game or I'll work on
aspects<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.340> are<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.670> same<00:03:17.820> one<00:03:18.090> now<00:03:18.660> work

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
aspects that are the same one now work

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.720 
aspects that are the same one now work
right<00:03:19.140> now<00:03:19.170> we're<00:03:19.500> all<00:03:19.620> working<00:03:19.830> on<00:03:20.130> our<00:03:20.520> own

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
right now we're all working on our own

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.120 
right now we're all working on our own
we're<00:03:21.360> all<00:03:21.450> working<00:03:21.630> on<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.840> same<00:03:21.960> idea<00:03:22.710> like

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
we're all working on the same idea like

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.490 
we're all working on the same idea like
the<00:03:23.310> same<00:03:23.490> basic<00:03:23.820> idea<00:03:23.940> for<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.390> game<00:03:24.570> but<00:03:25.320> we're

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
the same basic idea for a game but we're

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.930 
the same basic idea for a game but we're
all<00:03:25.620> working<00:03:25.890> on<00:03:26.130> our<00:03:26.280> own<00:03:26.400> putting<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.790> code
