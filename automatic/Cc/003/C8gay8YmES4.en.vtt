controllers are particularly sensitive

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.900 
controllers are particularly sensitive
to<00:00:17.029> ground<00:00:18.199> when<00:00:19.199> your<00:00:19.350> wiring<00:00:19.560> them<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.920> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
to ground when your wiring them in and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.240 
to ground when your wiring them in and
so<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.779> see<00:00:22.020> here<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.769> one<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.189> I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
so if you see here this is one that I

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.990 
so if you see here this is one that I
fired<00:00:23.670> up<00:00:23.820> initially<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:25.230> was<00:00:25.320> just<00:00:25.470> so

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
fired up initially and it was just so

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.700 
fired up initially and it was just so
flaky<00:00:27.000> then<00:00:27.750> end<00:00:27.900> up<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.109> wiring<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.560> whole

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
flaky then end up just wiring a whole

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
flaky then end up just wiring a whole
new<00:00:28.859> one<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.160> mean<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.340> probably<00:00:29.490> could<00:00:29.640> have

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
new one I mean I probably could have

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.780 
new one I mean I probably could have
gotten<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.240> work<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.710> I<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:32.669> thought

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
gotten this to work but I just thought

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.090 
gotten this to work but I just thought
start<00:00:33.360> from<00:00:33.450> scratch<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
start from scratch on it so one of the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.920 
start from scratch on it so one of the
things<00:00:35.300> happens<00:00:36.300> here<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.570> see<00:00:36.600> there's

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
things happens here as you see there's

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.110 
things happens here as you see there's
black<00:00:37.290> material<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:37.950> that's<00:00:38.190> meant<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.059> be

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
black material here that's meant to be

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.880 
black material here that's meant to be
used<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.570> those<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> little<00:00:40.079> rubber<00:00:40.230> pad<00:00:40.530> from

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
used with those a little rubber pad from

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.279 
used with those a little rubber pad from
those<00:00:41.520> company<00:00:43.010> is<00:00:44.010> right<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.610> when

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
those company is right here and when

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.209 
those company is right here and when
these<00:00:46.289> are<00:00:46.469> underneath<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.710> buttons<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
these are underneath the buttons and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.130 
these are underneath the buttons and
when<00:00:47.309> these<00:00:47.430> get<00:00:47.879> pressed<00:00:48.239> they<00:00:48.450> raise<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.870> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
when these get pressed they raise up and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.619 
when these get pressed they raise up and
they<00:00:49.260> make<00:00:49.440> contact<00:00:50.329> with<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.360> black

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
they make contact with the black

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.110 
they make contact with the black
material<00:00:51.960> which<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.590> conductive<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.000> is

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
material which is conductive and so is

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.189 
material which is conductive and so is
the<00:00:54.239> lower<00:00:54.600> rubber<00:00:54.719> pad<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:56.960> when<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.079> go<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the lower rubber pad and when you go to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.750 
the lower rubber pad and when you go to
solder<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.980> scrape<00:00:59.219> scrape<00:00:59.460> that

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
solder you have to scrape scrape that

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.180 
solder you have to scrape scrape that
off<00:00:59.820> now<00:01:00.210> initially<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:01.649> scraped<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.100> off

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
off now initially I just scraped it off

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.429 
off now initially I just scraped it off
on<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.019> area<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> wanted<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
on the on the area that I wanted to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.460 
on the on the area that I wanted to
solder<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:06.150> tiny<00:01:06.659> bits<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.990> black<00:01:07.290> or

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
solder and the tiny bits of black or

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.840 
solder and the tiny bits of black or
whatever<00:01:07.680> must<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.950> making<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.640> know<00:01:08.700> just

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
whatever must be making you know just

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.120 
whatever must be making you know just
make<00:01:09.000> another<00:01:09.030> little<00:01:09.299> path<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:10.130> for

make another little path for for

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.399 
make another little path for for
conductivity<00:01:11.760> even<00:01:12.150> though<00:01:12.240> my<00:01:13.970> my<00:01:15.170> meter<00:01:16.170> was

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
conductivity even though my my meter was

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.450 
conductivity even though my my meter was
telling<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> there<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:16.950> no<00:01:17.100> connection

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460

clean it a few times and maybe I get its

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.899 
clean it a few times and maybe I get its
work<00:01:24.270> fine<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:25.140> someone<00:01:25.409> were<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.710> so

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
work fine if someone were just so

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.190 
work fine if someone were just so
difficult<00:01:26.909> particularly<00:01:27.540> those<00:01:27.810> two<00:01:28.049> right

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
difficult particularly those two right

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.609 
difficult particularly those two right
there<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.619> actually<00:01:29.009> ground<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:31.439> whole

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
there that I actually ground the whole

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.730 
there that I actually ground the whole

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
wheel on my dremel and it still didn't

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.149 
wheel on my dremel and it still didn't
seem<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> work<00:01:39.390> very<00:01:39.420> well<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.530> just

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
seem to work very well in this so I just

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.719 
seem to work very well in this so I just
went<00:01:41.310> from<00:01:41.670> scratch<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:43.829> first<00:01:44.159> matter

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
went from scratch and the first matter

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.569 
went from scratch and the first matter
of<00:01:44.790> fact<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.240> first<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:45.829> this<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.040> I

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
of fact this first one this is the I

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.990 
of fact this first one this is the I
think<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.630> second<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.170> did<00:01:49.380> here<00:01:50.000> let's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
think the second one I did here let's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.230 
think the second one I did here let's
see

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
see

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.090

came<00:01:59.340> out<00:01:59.460> really<00:01:59.610> good<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:01.140> didn't<00:02:01.530> really

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
came out really good I didn't really

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.820 
came out really good I didn't really
have<00:02:01.710> any<00:02:01.950> problems<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.460> tiny<00:02:03.149> bit<00:02:03.299> I

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
have any problems with a tiny bit I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.749 
have any problems with a tiny bit I
think<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:04.920> one<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.220> direction<00:02:05.520> is

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
think of one of the direction is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.089 
think of one of the direction is
actually<00:02:06.090> being<00:02:06.240> pressed<00:02:06.539> continuously<00:02:07.170> but

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
actually being pressed continuously but

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.630 
actually being pressed continuously but
it's<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.970> works<00:02:09.119> pretty<00:02:09.300> good<00:02:09.420> now<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
it's a it works pretty good now and I

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.370 
it's a it works pretty good now and I
wired<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.790> all<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.420> no<00:02:12.989> problems<00:02:13.319> with

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
wired it all in and it no problems with

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.780 
wired it all in and it no problems with
that<00:02:13.440> side<00:02:13.739> this<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.099> other<00:02:14.310> side<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
that side this is the other side that I

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.400 
that side this is the other side that I
had<00:02:14.910> problems<00:02:15.120> with<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.930> start<00:02:16.140> with<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.290> whole

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
had problems with and start with a whole

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.680 
had problems with and start with a whole
nother<00:02:16.590> controller<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.209> was<00:02:18.330> having<00:02:18.450> some

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
nother controller and I was having some

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.020 
nother controller and I was having some
of<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.780> same<00:02:18.959> issues<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.620> what<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.610> ended<00:02:20.910> up

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
of the same issues and what I ended up

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.430 
of the same issues and what I ended up
doing<00:02:21.090> if<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.080> can<00:02:22.230> see<00:02:22.500> right<00:02:23.060> here<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.260> on<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
doing if you can see right here I on the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.620 
doing if you can see right here I on the
ribbon<00:02:25.620> cable<00:02:26.010> connecting<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.670> second

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
ribbon cable connecting the second

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.890 
ribbon cable connecting the second
button<00:02:28.170> board<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.739> main<00:02:28.980> board<00:02:29.190> actually

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
button board to the main board actually

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.600 
button board to the main board actually
disconnected<00:02:30.900> ground<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.920> wired<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.400> right

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
disconnected ground and I wired it right

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.580 
disconnected ground and I wired it right
in<00:02:32.760> directly<00:02:33.120> you're<00:02:33.780> looking<00:02:34.080> on<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.319> board

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
in directly you're looking on this board

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.979 
in directly you're looking on this board
here<00:02:35.600> so<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.630> cut<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.410> last<00:02:37.680> pin<00:02:38.040> here<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.989> then

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
here so I cut the last pin here and then

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.809 
here so I cut the last pin here and then
I<00:02:40.110> wired<00:02:40.680> my<00:02:40.830> wire<00:02:41.660> in<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:45.290> see<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.380> from<00:02:46.440> here

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
I wired my wire in to see it from here

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.990 
I wired my wire in to see it from here
on<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.349> secondary<00:02:49.349> board<00:02:49.709> onto<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.489> ground

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
on the secondary board onto the ground

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.589 
on the secondary board onto the ground
wire<00:02:51.209> pin<00:02:51.750> right<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:53.120> what<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.209> did<00:02:54.360> is<00:02:54.390> it

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
wire pin right here and what I did is it

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.449 
wire pin right here and what I did is it
there's<00:02:55.019> no<00:02:55.230> ground<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.799> this<00:02:55.890> board<00:02:56.190> at<00:02:56.310> all

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
there's no ground on this board at all

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.810 
there's no ground on this board at all
and<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:58.170> completely<00:02:58.470> solved<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.130> problem<00:02:59.549> and

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
and it completely solved the problem and

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.640 
and it completely solved the problem and
I<00:02:59.970> didn't<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.239> any<00:03:00.359> problems<00:03:00.750> after<00:03:01.019> that<00:03:01.170> so

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
I didn't have any problems after that so

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.930 
I didn't have any problems after that so
I<00:03:01.709> could<00:03:01.859> probably<00:03:02.040> do<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.519> one<00:03:02.700> and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
I could probably do it to this one and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.310 
I could probably do it to this one and
get<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.019> work<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.810> one<00:03:07.019> is<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.230> the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
get it to work so this one is in the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.720 
get it to work so this one is in the
complete<00:03:07.620> waste<00:03:07.769> I'll<00:03:08.010> probably<00:03:08.220> use<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.609> in

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
complete waste I'll probably use it in

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.210 
complete waste I'll probably use it in
one<00:03:09.570> of<00:03:09.600> my<00:03:09.720> can<00:03:09.900> buy<00:03:10.380> arcade<00:03:10.829> sticks<00:03:11.070> I'm

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
one of my can buy arcade sticks I'm

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.949 
one of my can buy arcade sticks I'm
working<00:03:11.519> on<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:13.549> there<00:03:14.549> it<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.120> i'll<00:03:15.780> show

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
working on so there it is so i'll show

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:24.530 
working on so there it is so i'll show
you<00:03:16.019> a<00:03:16.140> little<00:03:16.230> bit<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.500> action<00:03:17.160> with<00:03:17.310> it

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:44.150 

step<00:03:25.540> set<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:25.870> up<00:03:25.990> here<00:03:33.690> all<00:03:34.690> right<00:03:34.960> here<00:03:35.110> we<00:03:35.140> go

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.910 

I<00:03:44.250> have<00:03:44.850> something<00:03:45.090> easier<00:03:45.360> setting<00:03:45.920> so

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
I have something easier setting so

00:03:46.920 --> 00:05:00.450 
I have something easier setting so
messing<00:03:47.730> around

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.560 

they<00:05:01.460> see<00:05:01.700> there's<00:05:02.090> some<00:05:02.270> action<00:05:03.200> with<00:05:03.380> it

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
they see there's some action with it

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.510 
they see there's some action with it
it's<00:05:05.570> pretty<00:05:05.750> good<00:05:05.840> control<00:05:06.470> panel<00:05:06.950> I<00:05:07.100> I

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
it's pretty good control panel I I

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.640 
it's pretty good control panel I I
prefer<00:05:08.120> more<00:05:08.390> of<00:05:08.450> a<00:05:08.510> half<00:05:08.720> style<00:05:09.020> stick<00:05:09.320> like

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
prefer more of a half style stick like

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.300 
prefer more of a half style stick like
you<00:05:09.800> see<00:05:10.070> on<00:05:10.100> like<00:05:10.430> my<00:05:11.440> whatever<00:05:12.440> my<00:05:13.600> neo<00:05:14.600> geo<00:05:14.870> I

you see on like my whatever my neo geo I

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.830 
you see on like my whatever my neo geo I
like<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.340> bad<00:05:16.610> sticks<00:05:16.970> I<00:05:17.180> like<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.510> smooth

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
like a bad sticks I like the smooth

I'm using this one here we completely

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.800 
I'm using this one here we completely
surgery<00:05:36.970> so<00:05:37.970> you<00:05:38.060> have<00:05:38.210> to<00:05:38.360> know<00:05:38.510> where<00:05:38.690> you
