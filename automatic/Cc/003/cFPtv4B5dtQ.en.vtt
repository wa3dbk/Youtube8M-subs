00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280

construction<00:00:15.199> update<00:00:17.930> within<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.200> last<00:00:19.380> few

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
construction update within the last few

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.790 
construction update within the last few
weeks<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:21.300> steel<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.110> the<00:00:22.230> building<00:00:22.650> has

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
weeks the steel on the building has

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.300 
weeks the steel on the building has
started<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.310> go<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:24.619> Museum<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.190> can

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
started to go up Museum in so you can

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.910 
started to go up Museum in so you can
get<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.490> better<00:00:26.670> look<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.930> can<00:00:31.199> see<00:00:31.500> it's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
get a better look so you can see it's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
get a better look so you can see it's
tri-level<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:34.710> right<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.220> lower<00:00:35.460> than<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
tri-level so the right is lower than the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.850 
tri-level so the right is lower than the
middle<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.810> middle<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.290> lower<00:00:37.530> than

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
middle and then the middle is lower than

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.030 
middle and then the middle is lower than
the<00:00:38.130> left<00:00:38.600> so<00:00:39.600> that'll<00:00:39.989> make<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.620> building

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the left so that'll make the building

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.490 
the left so that'll make the building
more<00:00:41.910> interesting<00:00:42.420> looking<00:00:42.809> from<00:00:43.200> Hershey

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
more interesting looking from Hershey

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.310 
more interesting looking from Hershey
Park<00:00:43.680> Drive<00:00:44.090> it's<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.450> visible<00:00:45.690> when<00:00:46.230> you

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
Park Drive it's so visible when you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.250 
Park Drive it's so visible when you
drive<00:00:46.559> by<00:00:46.880> versus<00:00:47.880> the<00:00:48.210> ride<00:00:48.750> buildings<00:00:49.170> at

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
drive by versus the ride buildings at

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.810 
drive by versus the ride buildings at
other<00:00:49.380> parks<00:00:49.770> where<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> big<00:00:50.550> boring

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
other parks where it's just a big boring

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.340 
other parks where it's just a big boring
box<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:53.989> with<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.110> being

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
box and that's it so with this being

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.470 
box and that's it so with this being
multi-level<00:00:56.040> I<00:00:56.160> think<00:00:56.399> it'll<00:00:56.579> look<00:00:57.300> more

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
multi-level I think it'll look more

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.790 
multi-level I think it'll look more
interesting<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.250> maybe<00:00:59.250> they'll<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.730> some

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
interesting and maybe they'll do some

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.219 
interesting and maybe they'll do some
interesting<00:01:01.800> decorations<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.940> both<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.989> park

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
interesting decorations on both the park

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.410 
interesting decorations on both the park
side<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:06.260> roadside<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.880> hopefully<00:01:09.060> they

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
side and the roadside so hopefully they

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.469 
side and the roadside so hopefully they
do<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:10.799> zoom<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.310> some<00:01:11.580> more<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.210> can

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
do that we zoom in some more so you can

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:31.110 
do that we zoom in some more so you can
get<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:13.220> better<00:01:14.220> look<00:01:16.430> there's<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> lower<00:01:17.970> roof

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:43.510 

the<00:01:32.120> metal<00:01:32.480> roof<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:42.380> also<00:01:42.980> I<00:01:43.010> want<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.280> show

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
the metal roof and also I want to show

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.190 
the metal roof and also I want to show
you<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:45.470> ferris<00:01:46.340> wheel<00:01:48.010> it's<00:01:49.010> not<00:01:49.160> there<00:01:50.200> they

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
you the ferris wheel it's not there they

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.620 
you the ferris wheel it's not there they
every<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:51.860> many<00:01:51.920> years<00:01:52.130> they<00:01:52.760> take<00:01:53.270> certain

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
every so many years they take certain

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.300 
every so many years they take certain
rides<00:01:53.810> down<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.470> completely<00:01:57.040> refurbish<00:01:58.040> them

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
rides down and completely refurbish them

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.580 
rides down and completely refurbish them
so<00:01:58.700> that's<00:01:58.970> what's<00:01:59.150> going<00:01:59.360> on<00:01:59.540> with<00:02:00.020> the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
so that's what's going on with the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.360 
so that's what's going on with the
ferris<00:02:00.950> wheel<00:02:02.080> it's<00:02:03.080> completely<00:02:03.710> gone<00:02:03.740> except

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
ferris wheel it's completely gone except

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.000 
ferris wheel it's completely gone except
for<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.610> supports<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:06.740> will<00:02:07.280> be<00:02:07.400> back<00:02:09.010> in

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
for the supports so that will be back in

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:16.670 
for the supports so that will be back in
the<00:02:10.490> spring<00:02:10.820> hopefully

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.199 

it's<00:02:17.310> gotta<00:02:17.579> look<00:02:17.849> here<00:02:18.209> at<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.540> ground<00:02:20.209> see

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
it's gotta look here at the ground see

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:50.880 
it's gotta look here at the ground see
if<00:02:21.269> there's<00:02:21.390> anything<00:02:21.750> interesting<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.590> see

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.089
