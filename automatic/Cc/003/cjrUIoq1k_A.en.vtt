00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
I got this really six now my xbox 360 is

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.490 
I got this really six now my xbox 360 is
plugged<00:03:04.060> into<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.420> now<00:03:05.170> you're<00:03:05.320> going<00:03:05.440> to

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
plugged into that now you're going to

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.730 
plugged into that now you're going to
take<00:03:05.770> in<00:03:06.010> your<00:03:06.450> extender<00:03:07.450> adapter<00:03:08.080> hold<00:03:08.590> on

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
take in your extender adapter hold on

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:21.290 
take in your extender adapter hold on
let<00:03:08.950> me<00:03:08.980> plug<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.430> in

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.670 

I'm<00:03:22.300> going<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.540> plug<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:22.960> in<00:03:23.020> like<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.440> and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
I'm going to plug it in like that and

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.080 
I'm going to plug it in like that and
the<00:03:24.100> reason<00:03:24.130> why<00:03:24.430> this<00:03:24.490> works<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:25.030> because

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
the reason why this works is because

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.440 
the reason why this works is because
it's<00:03:25.570> making<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.160> transmit<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.820> audio<00:03:27.850> in<00:03:28.330> the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
it's making it transmit the audio in the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.590 
it's making it transmit the audio in the
video<00:03:28.570> through<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:29.230> little<00:03:29.830> adapter<00:03:30.070> so<00:03:31.060> now

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
video through this little adapter so now

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.200
