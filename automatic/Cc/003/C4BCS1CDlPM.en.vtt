was<00:02:43.800> at<00:02:43.920> Microsoft<00:02:44.069> for<00:02:44.550> twelve<00:02:44.790> years<00:02:44.849> so<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
was at Microsoft for twelve years so the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.900 
was at Microsoft for twelve years so the
folks<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.230> Redmond<00:02:46.530> know<00:02:46.650> me<00:02:46.800> pretty<00:02:46.980> well<00:02:47.099> the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910

knew from day one that we wanted to

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.500 
knew from day one that we wanted to
create<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.709> product<00:04:07.159> with<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.699> best<00:04:07.969> internal
