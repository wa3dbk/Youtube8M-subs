but you know every long time and the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.150 
but you know every long time and the
problem<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:43.530> dries<00:00:43.860> out<00:00:44.100> I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
problem with this is that it dries out I

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.979 
problem with this is that it dries out I
mean<00:00:44.550> after<00:00:44.789> two<00:00:45.270> weeks<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.750> start

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
mean after two weeks you can start

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.170 
mean after two weeks you can start
seeing<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> drying<00:00:46.829> out<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.850> so

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
seeing it drying out and it's so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.299 
seeing it drying out and it's so
annoying<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.899> guess<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.469> my<00:00:49.559> third<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
annoying I guess is my third one that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.029 
annoying I guess is my third one that
I've<00:00:50.399> gone<00:00:50.579> through<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.800> that's<00:00:52.800> when<00:00:52.980> I

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
I've gone through and that's when I

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.290 
I've gone through and that's when I
decided<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.579> need<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.910> figure<00:00:54.059> out<00:00:54.180> something

decided I need to figure out something

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
decided I need to figure out something
to<00:00:54.870> make<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.590> stop<00:00:55.739> drawing<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.250> with
