human species is so unique that they
told<00:03:52.310> me<00:03:52.549> when<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:52.790> when<00:03:53.090> I<00:03:53.120> was<00:03:53.329> with<00:03:53.479> them<00:03:53.629> for

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
six weeks I was asking them question

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.210 
six weeks I was asking them question
after<00:03:56.479> question<00:03:56.510> after<00:03:56.989> question<00:03:57.139> I<00:03:57.709> found
