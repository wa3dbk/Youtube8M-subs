00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.280
 Congratulations on your new Isabella Opus 300. 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.740
 We would like to show you how you can build it up quickly and easily. 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.800
 To make the construction even easier and without problems, 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.820
 we recommend that you use our Aqua-Tex impregnation spray, 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.540
 and our Hercules Twin tent tensioner for easy and good tensioning of the frame. 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.100
 The easiest way is to assemble the awning together. 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.940
 First, a Ground Cover carpet (if available) is laid on the surface in front of the caravan. 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.440
 This is fixed at the corners with pegs. 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.520
 Then insert the draft strip into the rail at the bottom of the caravan. 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.760
 To set up the tent, the frame on the carpet is explained first, 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.480
 so that the parts are approximately where they will be needed. 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.560
 Take a good look at the assembly instructions. Some of the frame parts must first be mounted. 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.320
 To easily slide the awning through the caravan rail, 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.140
 you can spray the caravan rail with a thin layer of Aqua-Tex. 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.900
 Unfold the tent cloth as much as possible and choose the corner that first has to be pushed through the rail. 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.700
 This is easiest if a person moves the tent 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.700
 and insert it through the rail while the other passes through the tent. 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.020
 Check the distance to the ground. 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.540
 The Isaflex rubbers must be positioned in such a way that they come under tension when placing the pegs. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.620
 When the tent cloth has been pulled completely through the rail and the tent is well distributed over the caravan, 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.820
 you can start to build the frame. 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.300
 When assembling the frame, start with the middle poles. 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.720
 This causes the tent cloth to be raised, so that you can move well under the tent afterwards. 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.840
 Now mount all Fix-On screwless tent eyes on the tent. 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.820
 These are mounted directly on the extra Fix-On profile of the tent. 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.140
 You have a Fix-On block for every roof bar. 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.060
 The roof bar is rebounded in the Fix-On ball and then put in the center cross. 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.820
 The roof bar locks when it is turned 90 Â°. 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.790
 Now you can place the middle upright on the control cord and stretch it to the appropriate height. 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.680
 Now work towards the sides from the middle 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.620
 and also place and stretch the corner posts on the control cord. 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.440
 With an uneven surface, the height of the uprights on the left and right can be different. 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.740
 The Hercules Twin is used to stretch the frame. 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:31.319
 It is adjustable to be used with different frame diameters. 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.930
 By opening the delusions of the awning you can get more tension on the awning. 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.080
 To use the Hercules you must place the clamping bracket against the adjusting screw 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.520
 and then loosen the set screw. 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.660
 First, tension the front beams and then the roof beams. 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.100
 The lifting effect gives you an optimum tension on the frame. 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.660
 Pull a little bit on both sides of the tent roof 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.180
 so that any folds are kept to a minimum. 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.280
 Now the extra roof bars can be mounted for optimum support. 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.980
 Then install and tension the rods in the pet canopy. 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.980
 Your awning is now starting to take its final shape. 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.100
 Mount any additional uprights and place them in the control cables. 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.040
 Make sure that the protective flap is placed around the clamp. 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.321
 This prevents the frame from scratching against the canvas. 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.480
 When all poles are placed, the pegs must be placed. 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.000
 You must start at the rear corner on the caravan side and then the front corner. 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.840
 Repeat the same on the other side. 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.500
 The pegs can be placed through the Ground Cover without any problems. 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.780
 Now the connection area can be closed, first in the tent and then outside. 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.240
 The weather strips are attached in the awning. 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.820
 Then tension the side walls with pegs. 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.440
 Pay close attention to the correct tension of the fabric. 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.820
 The IsaFlex tent rubber can optionally be wrapped around the pegs for even better tension. 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.040
 The IsaFlex tent rubbers must be placed crosswise at the entrances to get the right tension. 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.940
 Even when the doors are open. 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.920
 Now the rest of the front parts can be tensioned. 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.780
 The inner draft strips can then be attached to further seal the tent. 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.160
 These straps are needed to roll them up. 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.680
 Now the curtains can be hung. 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.340
 These fixings are used for the curtain suspension. 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.120
 They are attached to the tape above the windows. These counter parts are clicked into the curtain eyes. 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.080
 You decide which side of the curtains you want inside or outside. 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.780
 The curtain straps and the curtain ties are now applied. 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.580
 Ground Cover is used for this construction, followed by a sail and then a Bolon awning carpet. 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.360
 The sail stops rising damp, 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.920
 while the awning carpet provides comfort. Sometimes the sail can also be omitted. 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.580
 The Bolon awning carpet is turned in the corners, 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.020
 so that it gets the right fit. Your awning is now assembled. 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.720
 The standard veranda bar supplied 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.220
 can be placed in the front between the center stand and the corner stand. 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.720
 When the front is rolled down, close the curtains so that the window does not lie directly on the veranda bar. 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.720
 Further tips and advice on maintenance and cleaning of the tent 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.440

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.780
 Have fun with your awning.
