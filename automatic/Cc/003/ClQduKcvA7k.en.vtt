hi<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.109> video<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:07.529> are<00:00:07.560> going<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.890> talking

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
hi in this video we are going to talking

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.070 
hi in this video we are going to talking
about<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.460> placement<00:00:08.700> node<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.660> placement

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
about the placement node the placement

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.410 
about the placement node the placement
node<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.349> very<00:00:10.559> simple<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:11.160> can<00:00:11.219> replaced<00:00:12.120> our

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
node is very simple it can replaced our

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.870 
node is very simple it can replaced our
origin<00:00:13.019> agent<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.460> agent<00:00:15.470> so<00:00:16.490> let's<00:00:17.490> place

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
origin agent to the agent so let's place

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.660 
origin agent to the agent so let's place
and<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.600> open<00:00:18.869> at<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.230> same<00:00:19.470> file<00:00:19.710> 005

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
and it's open at in the same file 005

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.420 
and it's open at in the same file 005
the<00:00:20.699> simulation<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> multi<00:00:21.810> agents<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.619> I

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
the simulation the multi agents and I

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.279 
the simulation the multi agents and I
mean<00:00:23.760> notice<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.210> there's<00:00:24.480> already<00:00:24.750> already

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
mean notice that there's already already

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.790 
mean notice that there's already already
placement<00:00:26.010> let's<00:00:26.340> delete<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.849> firstly<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
placement let's delete and firstly a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.019 
placement let's delete and firstly a
creative<00:00:28.800> placement<00:00:29.160> node<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.429> from<00:00:29.699> my<00:00:29.910> I'm

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
creative placement node is from my I'm

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.420 
creative placement node is from my I'm
here<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> placement<00:00:30.960> node<00:00:30.990> here<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.529> created

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
here the placement node here I created

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.520 
here the placement node here I created
place<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.790> note<00:00:32.969> when<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.480> create<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.050> you

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
place we note when you create that you

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.410 
place we note when you create that you
may<00:00:34.620> notice<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.100> there's<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.430> very<00:00:35.700> single<00:00:36.270> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
may notice that there's a very single a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.770 
may notice that there's a very single a
little<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:37.110> triangle<00:00:37.710> here<00:00:38.300> usually<00:00:39.300> we

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
little this triangle here usually we

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.750 
little this triangle here usually we
have<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:40.290> want<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.940> skill<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:43.340> to<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
have we want to the skill that to the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.660 
have we want to the skill that to the
similar<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.660> liquor<00:00:45.989> agent<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:49.670> they

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
similar like liquor agent and then they

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.830 
similar like liquor agent and then they
make<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.149> multiple<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.850> thence<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
make it and multiple and and thence the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.010 
make it and multiple and and thence the
change<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> distance<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:56.600> you<00:00:57.600> may<00:00:57.719> notice

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
change the distance here you may notice

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.590 
change the distance here you may notice
this<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:59.210> the<00:01:00.210> point<00:01:00.480> placement<00:01:03.830> and<00:01:05.390> if<00:01:06.390> we

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
this is on the point placement and if we

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.230 
this is on the point placement and if we
placed<00:01:07.229> our<00:01:07.380> agents<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> our<00:01:08.580> agents<00:01:08.939> will<00:01:09.119> be

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
placed our agents and our agents will be

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.899 
placed our agents and our agents will be
placed<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:11.100> want<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.430> change<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
placed it out if you want to change the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670 
placed it out if you want to change the
proportion<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.780> let's<00:01:13.350> talk<00:01:13.530> about

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
proportion of that let's talk about

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.149 
proportion of that let's talk about
later<00:01:14.479> let's<00:01:15.479> create<00:01:15.750> another<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
later let's create another one and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.050 
later let's create another one and
create<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:18.720> placement<00:01:19.680> node<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> moved

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
create the placement node here and moved

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.469 
create the placement node here and moved
in<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> outside<00:01:22.670> let's<00:01:23.670> switch<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
in the outside let's switch to the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.730 
in the outside let's switch to the
formation<00:01:24.810> here<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.500> changed<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.130> number<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
formation here it's changed a number and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.350 
formation here it's changed a number and
the<00:01:28.740> skill<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.740> distance

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.800 

and<00:01:35.660> then<00:01:36.230> there's<00:01:36.620> a<00:01:36.710> calm<00:01:37.490> here<00:01:38.740> change<00:01:39.740> that

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
and then there's a calm here change that

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.690 
and then there's a calm here change that
the<00:01:41.810> formation<00:01:42.380> placement<00:01:42.980> have<00:01:43.160> something

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
the formation placement have something

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.960 
the formation placement have something
the<00:01:44.000> variation<00:01:44.930> opposite<00:01:45.740> for<00:01:46.040> example<00:01:46.430> row

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
the variation opposite for example row

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
the variation opposite for example row
opposite<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:48.560> change<00:01:48.830> like<00:01:49.040> this<00:01:49.250> or<00:01:50.180> the

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
opposite and change like this or the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.200 
opposite and change like this or the
calm<00:01:51.920> opposite<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:54.680> row<00:01:54.860> noises<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.729> comm

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
calm opposite the row noises in the comm

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.300 
calm opposite the row noises in the comm
line<00:01:59.510> noise<00:02:01.930> very<00:02:02.930> useful<00:02:03.440> for<00:02:03.470> place<00:02:03.860> some<00:02:04.160> of

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
line noise very useful for place some of

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.090 
line noise very useful for place some of
these<00:02:04.430> stallions<00:02:05.260> studying<00:02:06.260> something<00:02:06.860> like

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
these stallions studying something like

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.240 
these stallions studying something like
that<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:08.209> you<00:02:09.050> can<00:02:09.259> make<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:10.040> bigger

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
that and you can make that the bigger

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.320 
that and you can make that the bigger
number<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:11.080> if<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.380> just<00:02:12.860> an<00:02:13.070> ear<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.489> if<00:02:14.120> you

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
number and if you just an ear and if you

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.320 
number and if you just an ear and if you
just<00:02:14.510> move<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.440> near<00:02:16.040> these<00:02:16.340> different<00:02:17.060> type

orientation<00:02:54.860> random<00:02:55.190> here<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:56.230> orientation

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
orientation random here and orientation

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.640 
orientation random here and orientation
I<00:02:59.890> close<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:02.450> arm<00:03:02.660> tation<00:03:03.019> random<00:03:03.440> and

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
I close that the arm tation random and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.590 
I close that the arm tation random and
the<00:03:04.070> full<00:03:04.250> deformation<00:03:04.880> here<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.269> can<00:03:05.390> also

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
the full deformation here you can also

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.740 
the full deformation here you can also
change<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.170> angle<00:03:06.709> here<00:03:06.860> just<00:03:07.100> like<00:03:07.220> this

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
change the angle here just like this

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.560 
change the angle here just like this
sample<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:10.519> orientation

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.030 

so<00:03:16.570> this<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:16.810> an<00:03:17.080> introduction<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.770> the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
so this is an introduction of the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.670 
so this is an introduction of the
placement<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.240> placement<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.080> point<00:03:20.380> and

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
placement the placement of the point and

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.540 
placement the placement of the point and
the<00:03:21.490> formation<00:03:21.880> control<00:03:23.340> thank<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.430> for

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
the formation control thank you for

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.510 
the formation control thank you for
watching<00:03:24.760> see<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.180> next<00:03:25.210> time
