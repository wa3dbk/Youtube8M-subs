00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
let's add one replica these are the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.130 
let's add one replica these are the
front<00:00:18.750> calipers<00:00:20.180> they're<00:00:21.180> also<00:00:21.330> where<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.779> go

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.300 

that's<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.199> left-hand<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:28.740> obviously

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.930 
that's the left-hand one obviously
that's<00:00:29.429> one<00:00:29.580> fitted<00:00:30.890> incidentally<00:00:31.940> this

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
that's one fitted incidentally this

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.479 
that's one fitted incidentally this
metal<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.390> potholes<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.290> haven't<00:00:35.160> got<00:00:35.280> these<00:00:35.460> at

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
metal of potholes I haven't got these at

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.040 
metal of potholes I haven't got these at
the<00:00:35.670> moment<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.120> there<00:00:36.270> are<00:00:36.360> more<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.840> route

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the moment but there are more on route

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.750 
the moment but there are more on route
so<00:00:37.290> they'll<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.620> getting<00:00:37.710> advertised<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.460> ebay

shortly then of course if you want to do
the<00:00:44.399> twin<00:00:44.789> brake<00:00:45.000> conversion<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:57.350> think<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the twin brake conversion I think the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
the twin brake conversion I think the
quality<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.859> them<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.570> excellent<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:02.359> have

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
quality on them is is excellent I have

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.149 
quality on them is is excellent I have
gotten<00:01:03.629> an<00:01:03.719> original<00:01:04.170> caliber<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.710> pieces<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
gotten an original caliber in pieces and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.070 
gotten an original caliber in pieces and
I<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.519> matched<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.840> be<00:01:06.930> perfectly

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
I have matched it up and to be perfectly

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.690 
I have matched it up and to be perfectly
honest<00:01:07.500> tea<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.189> can't<00:01:08.400> tell<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
honest tea you just can't tell the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.350 
honest tea you just can't tell the
difference<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.619> I<00:01:10.820> just<00:01:11.820> think<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.180> really

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
difference and I just think it's really

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090 
difference and I just think it's really
good<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:12.930> reproduce<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.619> these<00:01:13.770> parts

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
good that they reproduce all these parts

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.450 
good that they reproduce all these parts
for<00:01:14.159> these<00:01:14.310> old<00:01:14.490> motorcycles<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.920> makes<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.280> so

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
for these old motorcycles it makes it so

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.100 
for these old motorcycles it makes it so
much<00:01:17.490> easier<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.119> restore<00:01:18.509> them<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.869> front

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
much easier to restore them the front

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.810 
much easier to restore them the front
brake<00:01:22.259> pads<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.619> use<00:01:22.770> these<00:01:22.920> n<00:01:23.159> go<00:01:23.400> ones<00:01:23.640> as

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
brake pads to use these n go ones as

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.940 
brake pads to use these n go ones as
well<00:01:24.020> now<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.080> actually<00:01:25.409> calipers<00:01:25.799> come

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
well now the actually calipers come

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.330 
well now the actually calipers come
fitted<00:01:26.479> with<00:01:27.479> brake<00:01:27.689> pads<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:28.890> you've<00:01:29.040> got

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
fitted with brake pads but if you've got

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.499 
fitted with brake pads but if you've got
an<00:01:29.460> older<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.090> want<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> replace

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
an older one and you want to replace

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.940 
an older one and you want to replace
them<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:32.750> Advani's<00:01:33.750> brake<00:01:33.990> pads<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
them I can Advani's brake pads the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.039 
them I can Advani's brake pads the
commonality<00:01:35.430> squeal<00:01:35.670> shim<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.090> they<00:01:36.900> don't

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
commonality squeal shim and they don't

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.499 
commonality squeal shim and they don't
squeak<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:38.100> much<00:01:38.340> anything<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:39.090> as<00:01:39.329> much

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
squeak as much anything like as much

there's<00:01:40.259> other<00:01:40.409> brake<00:01:40.650> pads<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.920> I've

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
there's other brake pads that I've

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.789 
there's other brake pads that I've
fitted<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.570> actually<00:01:42.840> took<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.380> perfectly

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
fitted so I actually took out perfectly

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.249

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
actual quality of these again these are

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.960 
actual quality of these again these are
excellent<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.590> think<00:02:27.189> these<00:02:27.280> are<00:02:27.340> made<00:02:27.519> by<00:02:27.670> hi

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
original us-spec master cylinder I also

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.160 
original us-spec master cylinder I also
have<00:02:38.560> these<00:02:38.760> master<00:02:39.760> cylinder<00:02:40.090> caps<00:02:40.329> which

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
have these master cylinder caps which

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.759 
have these master cylinder caps which
are<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.409> us-spec<00:02:41.890> ones<00:02:42.129> but<00:02:42.310> they<00:02:42.459> don't<00:02:42.700> fit

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
are the us-spec ones but they don't fit

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.199 
are the us-spec ones but they don't fit
the<00:02:44.769> replica<00:02:45.280> they<00:02:45.519> will<00:02:45.670> only<00:02:45.700> fit<00:02:46.030> the

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
the replica they will only fit the

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.319 
the replica they will only fit the
original<00:02:46.629> so<00:02:47.620> don't<00:02:48.159> buy<00:02:48.340> one<00:02:48.519> of<00:02:48.549> these<00:02:48.730> to

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
original so don't buy one of these to

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.720 
original so don't buy one of these to
fit<00:02:49.510> on<00:02:49.659> one<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.900> these<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:51.370> threads<00:02:51.609> of

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
fit on one of these the threads of

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.910 
fit on one of these the threads of
different<00:02:52.060> diets<00:02:53.049> we<00:02:53.170> rounded<00:02:53.440> unmountable

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
this is that this is one of the problems

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
you do get across with reproduction
