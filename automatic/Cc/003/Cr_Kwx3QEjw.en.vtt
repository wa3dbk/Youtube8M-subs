how<00:00:00.240> big<00:00:00.510> could<00:00:00.719> this<00:00:00.870> be<00:00:01.170> could<00:00:01.860> be<00:00:01.890> really

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
how big could this be could be really

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.519 
how big could this be could be really
big<00:00:02.520> in<00:00:02.669> fact<00:00:02.909> in<00:00:03.389> some<00:00:03.570> ways<00:00:03.780> it<00:00:03.990> already<00:00:04.259> is

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
big in fact in some ways it already is

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:05.840 
big in fact in some ways it already is
but<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.799> think<00:00:04.830> we're<00:00:05.130> starting<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.520> see<00:00:05.549> as

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
but I think we're starting to see as

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.240 
but I think we're starting to see as
processing<00:00:06.750> power<00:00:07.080> goes<00:00:07.470> way<00:00:07.770> down<00:00:08.069> we're

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
processing power goes way down we're

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.669 
processing power goes way down we're
starting<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.670> see<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.660> security<00:00:10.260> concerns<00:00:10.380> go

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
starting to see and security concerns go

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.480 
starting to see and security concerns go
way<00:00:10.830> up<00:00:10.860> we're<00:00:11.010> start<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.219> see<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.340> lot<00:00:11.460> of

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
way up we're start to see a lot of

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.999 
way up we're start to see a lot of
people<00:00:12.150> look<00:00:12.809> at<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.080> as<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> way<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.500> solve<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
people look at this as a way to solve a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.340 
people look at this as a way to solve a
lot<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.219> problems<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.210> think<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.750> places

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
lot of problems and so I think in places

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.570 
lot of problems and so I think in places
where<00:00:16.470> we<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:16.770> seen<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.369> government

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
where we have seen it in government

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.429 
where we have seen it in government
security<00:00:18.390> they've<00:00:18.570> actually<00:00:18.900> uses<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.289> Las

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
security they've actually uses in Las

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.050 
security they've actually uses in Las
Vegas<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.070> years<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.520> look<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:20.789> people<00:00:20.970> that

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
Vegas for years to look for people that

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.240 
Vegas for years to look for people that
they<00:00:21.180> don't<00:00:21.359> want<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.840> casinos<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.980> being

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
they don't want in casinos that being

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.099 
they don't want in casinos that being
people<00:00:23.789> who<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.119> count<00:00:24.240> cards<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:24.810> my<00:00:24.930> buddy

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
people who can count cards like my buddy

Vegas<00:00:25.439> Pete<00:00:25.650> they've<00:00:26.400> had<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.699> state<00:00:26.880> on

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
Vegas Pete they've had the state on

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.250 
Vegas Pete they've had the state on
facial<00:00:27.240> recognition<00:00:27.359> technology<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:28.170> some

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
facial recognition technology for some

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.540 
facial recognition technology for some
time<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:28.560> now<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.800> seems<00:00:28.949> like<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.099> about<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
time but now it seems like it's about to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.870 
time but now it seems like it's about to
get<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.789> much<00:00:30.330> broader<00:00:30.720> distribution<00:00:31.880> let's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
get a much broader distribution let's

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.670 
get a much broader distribution let's
talk<00:00:33.090> about<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.420> technology<00:00:33.719> side<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.380> this

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
talk about the technology side of this

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.190 
talk about the technology side of this
how<00:00:35.219> exactly<00:00:35.820> does<00:00:36.000> facial<00:00:36.390> recognition<00:00:36.600> work

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
how exactly does facial recognition work

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.690 
how exactly does facial recognition work
are<00:00:37.440> there<00:00:37.559> different<00:00:37.890> kinds<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.370> facial

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
are there different kinds of facial

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.119 
are there different kinds of facial
recognition<00:00:39.230> technologies<00:00:40.230> well<00:00:40.710> certainly

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
recognition technologies well certainly

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.680 
recognition technologies well certainly
there<00:00:41.280> are<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.149> know<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> back

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
there are in and you know on the back

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.819 
there are in and you know on the back
end<00:00:42.930> right<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.260> all<00:00:43.350> imagine<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.800> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
end right we can all imagine is a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.560 
end right we can all imagine is a
database<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.520> compare<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
database you compare what you get to the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.029 
database you compare what you get to the
database<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.590> front<00:00:46.860> end

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
database but in the front end

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.619 
database but in the front end
essentially<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> image<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.239> someone's<00:00:48.480> face

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
essentially the image of someone's face

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.690 
essentially the image of someone's face
is<00:00:48.809> captured<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.410> then<00:00:49.770> algorithms<00:00:50.370> look<00:00:50.460> for

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
is captured and then algorithms look for

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.459 
is captured and then algorithms look for
kind<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.120> where<00:00:51.360> things<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.110> look<00:00:52.289> for

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
kind of where things are you look for

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.750 
kind of where things are you look for
the<00:00:52.559> eyes<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> nose<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.340> mouth<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the eyes and the nose in the mouth and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.340 
the eyes and the nose in the mouth and
then<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.180> start<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> find<00:00:54.719> sort<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:54.989> things

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
then you start to find sort of things

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.250 
then you start to find sort of things
that<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.829> would<00:00:56.309> those<00:00:56.489> anchor<00:00:56.910> points<00:00:57.260> make

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that that would those anchor points make

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.380 
that that would those anchor points make
the<00:00:58.469> face<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.859> particularly<00:00:59.670> unique<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.180> face

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the face of particularly unique a face

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.180 
the face of particularly unique a face
print<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> that's<00:01:01.949> when<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
print if you will and that's when you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.500 
print if you will and that's when you
compare<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> database<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.239> naturally

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
compare it to a database and naturally
