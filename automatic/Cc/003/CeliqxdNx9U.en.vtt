00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
species so they're the Canaries of the

species so they're the Canaries of the
sea<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:08.879> we<00:02:09.000> should<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.270> taken<00:02:09.450> note<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> long

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470

world's endangered species saving these
penguins<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.829> a<00:02:17.859> race<00:02:18.099> against<00:02:18.549> time<00:02:18.579> and

penguins is a race against time and

penguins is a race against time and
