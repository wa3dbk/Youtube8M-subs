how the behemoth moving bed filter is
it's<00:00:17.100> actually<00:00:17.340> doing<00:00:17.460> really<00:00:17.550> well<00:00:17.880> all<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
it's actually doing really well all the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.189 
it's actually doing really well all the
media<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.779> moving<00:00:19.109> real<00:00:19.289> well<00:00:20.900> so<00:00:21.900> afraid<00:00:22.140> I

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
media is moving real well so afraid I

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.990 
media is moving real well so afraid I
overstocked<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> little<00:00:23.189> bit<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> k1

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
overstocked it a little bit with the k1

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.290 
overstocked it a little bit with the k1
but<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.480> moving<00:00:25.109> fine<00:00:25.490> so<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.910> airflow

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
but it is moving fine so the airflow

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
said if you've built one of these you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.799 
said if you've built one of these you
know<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.829> takes<00:00:35.010> 24<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> 48<00:00:35.969> hours<00:00:36.120> usually<00:00:36.450> for

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
know it takes 24 to 48 hours usually for

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.450 
know it takes 24 to 48 hours usually for
everything<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> start<00:00:37.440> moving<00:00:37.800> especially

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
when there's a lot of k1 media in it I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.260 
when there's a lot of k1 media in it I
actually<00:00:40.920> had<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.219> remove<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.760> mangrove

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
with a little bit higher of a shield to

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.520 
with a little bit higher of a shield to
go<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:56.910> higher<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:58.020> way<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.260> kind<00:00:58.469> of

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
go up higher that way you can kind of

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.959 
go up higher that way you can kind of
build<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.859> shield<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> still<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.850> water

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
build a shield to still be in the water

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.869 
build a shield to still be in the water
enough<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:01.010> do<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.160> supposed<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:02.820> the
