00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello and welcome to shrek 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.870
 tab today we want to look like 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.420
 google nexus 6 in games 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.790
 Temple wrestled two of the trigger 2 and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.710
 modern combat 5 beats it's only that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.289
 second smartphone with the qualcomm 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.060
 snapdragon 805 that I test like this 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.340
 that could be quite true 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.810
 be interesting in advance the usual me 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.760
 have of course just rebooted 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.470
 we also have no running apps 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.820
 the games are not all 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.980
 pre-installed but you can 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.900
 course in place to download or 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.489
 Buy now and I will play the games 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.719
 Of course, always close 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.130
 before I start a new one 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.469
 that we really have the whole here 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.790
 Get hardware power now 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:47.219
 I wish you much fun 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:49.620
 watch go and start 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.449
 make temple ran two I always saxony 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.850
 Again, this is not a complicated game 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.070
 but strangely one of the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.449
 play the problems more often like 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.399
 Said we have one more here 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.609
 relative new processor clear 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.820
 meanwhile the lg flex 2 is with the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.689
 Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 announced but 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.600
 Nevertheless 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.510
 the usd 805 was not that common 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.119
 installed in any smartphones 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.909
 example here in galaxy note 4 or 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.799
 now in the nexus 6 and we have 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.130
 For example, even in need, he has known 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.049
 his 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.369
 then in a special version 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.979
 from 11 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.009
 but also from galaxy s companies so 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.400
 there is a lte plus version or 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.750
 The advanced version of the G3 is available 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.680
 not in germany but what i do 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.530
 want to say that 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.770
 yes, that's still relatively me 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.270
 just say unknown or unknown 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.799
 untested if we call them that 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.360
 He almost wants to get up again 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.640
 date is 37 again a new one 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.930
 Nevertheless, I believe you completely 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.060
 Well, the performance really can 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.850
 see everything very nice neat 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.810
 I also like the graphic very well 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.590
 have temperaments iwe colors 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.030
 I'll just say yes this will be 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.860
 of course not very special 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.050
 realistic but on the amoled display 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.790
 that's just great, that's it 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.130
 I really like it a lot 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.140
 there is no one at all 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.630
 formans problems i think need more 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.060
 we do not look at each other anymore and 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.470
 Let's go with the trigger two of one 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.630
 My favorite games I have to give you 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.610
 Now then again, something would happen 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.560
 quite interesting show the same 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.960
 I do not want to say problem now 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.640
 but we had the same phenomenon 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.470
 even with the galaxy note 4 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.910
 which has just the same processor 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.840
 I have just mentioned that show 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.090
 I'll take you straight to the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.550
 graphics settings still a few 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.840
 words to the front speakers like 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.550
 they are in front 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.200
 I criticize that often if that 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.140
 smartphones are not the case but here 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.060
 are they really super positioned and 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.800
 yes just when playing here 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.510
 it just super fun if the 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.280
 sound comes from the front also when looking 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.130
 videos and so on here so 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.790
 big praise to motorola and also to 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.860
 google 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.260
 I think google had it there 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.100
 design quite partly his 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.660
 finger in the game 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.340
 let's look at the performance I have 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.290
 the whole here on superscript 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.300
 but now tested before 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.570
 and he even knows on low so how 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.520
 at the galaxy note 4 that seems to be true 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.700
 that just is not the hardware yet 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.860
 really read out correctly by the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.150
 trigger 2 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.030
 Nonetheless, you will see, too 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.010
 if we put it all up here 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.960
 the nexus 6 has none at all 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.980
 performance problems and especially here 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.570
 I like the graphics really well so 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.160
 is probably just the big one 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.040
 display in conjunction with the high 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.959
 resolution but I like the graphics 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.340
 really very good that I have on 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.070
 Android not really better 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.720
 I'll just say it now 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.330
 maybe the galaxy note 4 was there 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.320
 similarly good but I like that already 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.800
 really good 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.470
 yes , that's just as there 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.820
 such things in games, for example, come 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.800
 the amoled displays just always 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.320
 I think that's pretty good over here 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.510
 even that of the nexus six because it is 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.090
 rather say something on the warmer side 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.280
 now something to the calibration 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.320
 but anyway I like everything here 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.820
 very good also the details i hope 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.160
 that comes through the camera reasonably 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.410
 over and as I said I hope you can 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.630
 it also hears the speakers please 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.979
 me really very good so that 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.330
 Socken is already doing a lot here 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.270
 Now we want to have fun too 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.889
 look at modern combat five 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.870
 also one of my favorite games too 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.550
 We are looking at a very nice graphic 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.750
 how it looks like but with the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.280
 Trigger 2 is definitely there 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.470
 no problems at all 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.389
 and last but not least now 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.699
 modern combat 5 and I have to do the whole thing 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.930
 make something quieter here now 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.909
 I have seen the now now 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.099
 not even half of it 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:46.720
 volume but the things were now 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.849
 just both so the speakers 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.949
 Both were apologetic two carrier two 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.120
 just as loud that I partially me 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.310
 not even understood so well 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.810
 so have as well as can 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.940
 convince also what the volume 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.919
 I have already explained that 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.080
 this will be interesting as well 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.240
 the heat development again at modern 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.220
 combat five now has the trigger 2 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.590
 you do not really notice what i say 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.770
 times in the area so the camera is 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.130
 really minimal a little tick 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.620
 warmer but that bothers at all 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.300
 not really worth talking about 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.069
 Now we wait a little while until that 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.719
 it's all loaded here now 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.190
 already happened and then we can 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.560
 start right now 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.150
 as I said from the graphic designer of mine 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.300
 opinion after one of the most beautiful games 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.710
 so for android let's see if so too 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.780
 can convince the performance 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.520
 but that looks like everything here 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.150
 I really like it pretty much 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.770
 really good but I think you see 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.069
 that's all very well here, too 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.360
 beautiful liquid there had already been the 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.639
 first turn to believe 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.539
 and now we'll do it here 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:54.880
 all that goes on, too 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.169
 very nice and fluid we have 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.449
 already seen differently, for example 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:02.469
 So I had recently that nvidia 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:04.750
 shield tablet here and there I have to completely 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:06.699
 honestly , the picture even looked there 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.710
 again a little tick better 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.029
 than here on the next six but good 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.949
 you can probably do both too 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:14.409
 just bad compare with each other 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:15.969
 because the shield tablet is the explicit 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:18.400
 I say for gaming now 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.759
 just while the nexus is six 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.630
 simply a flagship is so and a 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.909
 reference design I say now too 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.219
 just for android 5.0 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:29.889
 I digress we play of course 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:32.289
 continue to be very, very, really 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.509
 I really like good graphics 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.520
 I say that I have already 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:38.169
 often enough said in modern combat 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.569
 five that me here 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.669
 yes the location pretty much like it 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:44.560
 So here in venice that really works 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:47.650
 some we'll go fast again 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.120
 discovery there are still two so duzt the 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.919
 have to believe in it too 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.449
 but I think you really already have 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:52.840
 seen that all goes very well here 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.729
 beautiful 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.889
 I hope the graphics are also pretty good 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:58.689
 over and even though i have the speakers 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:00.279
 so on this volume here now 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:02.229
 there are no settings at all 

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:03.009
 problems so the sound can still be 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:04.599
 to convince 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:06.520
 I would probably be minimal now 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:08.830
 louder make but because I just the whole 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.490
 we do not want to comment on that yet 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.080
 exaggerate 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.939
 yes i think i have to do much more 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.319
 Do not even say that too 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:15.430
 the heat development has changed now 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:17.919
 not much done 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:20.050
 It was really around the cam 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:21.400
 a little warmer but nothing at all 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.719
 would somehow disturb 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.210
 Finally, you can only 

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:27.069
 say yes, that's the next six 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.719
 ideal for playing invites 

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:31.150
 Graphics is very very good performance 

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:33.129
 also and the huge display in 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.229
 connection with the front speakers that 

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:37.060
 then just do the rest of the people 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:39.310
 what of this short gaming video 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.020
 with google nexus 6 before you get it here 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.399
 very good I hope it has 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:46.020
 Thank you very much for watching 

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:46.020
 and until the next video
