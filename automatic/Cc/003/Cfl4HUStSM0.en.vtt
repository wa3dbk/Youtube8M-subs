good idea and you've got to watch out
for<00:04:00.050> that<00:04:01.000> it's<00:04:02.000> always<00:04:02.300> best<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.630> dodge<00:04:02.870> in

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
for that it's always best to dodge in

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.320 
for that it's always best to dodge in
the<00:04:03.470> direction<00:04:03.800> that<00:04:04.040> super<00:04:04.670> macho<00:04:04.850> man<00:04:05.120> is

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
the direction that super macho man is

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.490 
the direction that super macho man is
swinging<00:04:05.660> because<00:04:05.930> I<00:04:05.990> believe<00:04:06.230> that's<00:04:06.380> how

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
swinging because I believe that's how

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.170 
swinging because I believe that's how
you<00:04:06.620> get<00:04:06.800> your<00:04:06.920> star<00:04:07.160> punches<00:04:07.520> I<00:04:07.700> think<00:04:08.000> if<00:04:08.090> you

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
you get your star punches I think if you

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.550 
you get your star punches I think if you
dodge<00:04:08.390> in<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.660> opposite<00:04:09.050> direction<00:04:09.380> you

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
dodge in the opposite direction you

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.240 
dodge in the opposite direction you
