know<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.900> lot<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.440> ran<00:03:16.560> into<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.740> flaky<00:03:17.250> gold

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
know a lot of you ran into a flaky gold

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.100 
know a lot of you ran into a flaky gold
button<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.240> they've<00:03:18.360> now<00:03:18.480> just<00:03:18.660> replaced<00:03:18.990> it

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
button so they've now just replaced it

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.170 
button so they've now just replaced it
with<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.290> simple<00:03:19.650> blue<00:03:19.980> button<00:03:20.490> oh<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:21.060> if<00:03:21.120> I

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
with a simple blue button oh and if I

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.880 
with a simple blue button oh and if I
didn't<00:03:21.390> mention<00:03:21.690> that<00:03:21.720> already<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.560> color<00:03:22.800> is

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
didn't mention that already the color is

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.860 
didn't mention that already the color is
definitely<00:03:23.490> navy<00:03:23.730> blue<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.480> kind<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.690> hard

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
definitely navy blue it's kind of hard

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.360 
definitely navy blue it's kind of hard
to<00:03:24.900> tell<00:03:24.990> that<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:25.320> camera<00:03:25.590> but<00:03:25.860> we<00:03:25.980> got<00:03:26.100> black

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
to tell that on camera but we got black

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.810 
to tell that on camera but we got black
or<00:03:26.640> charcoal<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.930> got<00:03:28.050> navy<00:03:28.290> blue<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:28.830> it

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
or charcoal and you got navy blue so it

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.310 
or charcoal and you got navy blue so it
depends<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.270> if<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.510> really<00:03:30.750> want<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.990> shiny

depends on if you really want a shiny

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.440 
depends on if you really want a shiny

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
side there is your micro USB charging

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.040 
side there is your micro USB charging
port<00:03:42.900> no<00:03:43.650> HDMI<00:03:44.520> still<00:03:45.270> not<00:03:45.450> really<00:03:45.600> sure<00:03:45.720> why

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
port no HDMI still not really sure why

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.680 
port no HDMI still not really sure why
they<00:03:46.200> decided<00:03:46.350> not<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:47.010> include<00:03:47.130> hdmi<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.510> this

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
they decided not to include hdmi in this

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.560 
they decided not to include hdmi in this
phone<00:03:48.930> but<00:03:49.170> they<00:03:49.530> haven't<00:03:49.770> so<00:03:50.360> that<00:03:51.360> yeah

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
phone but they haven't so that yeah

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.660 
phone but they haven't so that yeah
that's<00:03:51.720> not<00:03:51.930> like<00:03:51.989> an<00:03:52.230> all-in-one<00:03:52.620> HDMI<00:03:53.340> micro

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
that's not like an all-in-one HDMI micro

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.850 
that's not like an all-in-one HDMI micro
USB<00:03:54.090> port<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.480> just<00:03:54.840> micro<00:03:55.110> USB<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.680> that's

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
USB port it's just micro USB so that's

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.680 
USB port it's just micro USB so that's
kind<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.040> unfortunate<00:03:56.340> but<00:03:56.790> up<00:03:56.940> anyway<00:03:57.630> so

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
kind of unfortunate but up anyway so

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.660 
kind of unfortunate but up anyway so
yeah<00:03:58.080> size<00:03:58.380> wise<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:59.040> phone<00:03:59.280> is<00:03:59.459> almost

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
yeah size wise the phone is almost

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.910 
yeah size wise the phone is almost
identical<00:03:59.940> with<00:04:00.540> some<00:04:00.720> minor<00:04:01.080> tweaks<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.890> it

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
identical with some minor tweaks to it

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.610 
identical with some minor tweaks to it
and<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:03.780> know<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.900> feels<00:04:04.170> pretty<00:04:04.320> good<00:04:04.470> i

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
and you know it feels pretty good i

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.500 
and you know it feels pretty good i
can't<00:04:04.920> really<00:04:05.280> compare<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:05.850> actual<00:04:06.239> weight

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
can't really compare it to actual weight

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.000 
can't really compare it to actual weight
because<00:04:06.810> this<00:04:06.959> dummy<00:04:07.200> model<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.680> definitely

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
because this dummy model is definitely

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.640 
because this dummy model is definitely
lighter<00:04:08.310> than<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.330> than<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.959> original<00:04:10.350> droid

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
lighter than the than the original droid

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.650 
lighter than the than the original droid
1<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:11.130> rightfully<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.910> is<00:04:12.060> not<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.270> real

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
1 and rightfully so this is not a real

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.199 
1 and rightfully so this is not a real
screen<00:04:13.020> this<00:04:13.170> is<00:04:13.230> plastic<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:14.760> weeds<00:04:14.970> not

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
screen this is plastic so the weeds not

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.130 
screen this is plastic so the weeds not
gonna<00:04:15.360> be<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.510> same<00:04:15.540> i<00:04:15.690> can't<00:04:15.870> really<00:04:16.020> give

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
gonna be the same i can't really give

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.580 
gonna be the same i can't really give
you<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.230> good<00:04:16.320> comparison<00:04:16.650> there

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
you a good comparison there

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.849 
you a good comparison there
we<00:04:18.459> have<00:04:18.609> seen<00:04:18.880> size<00:04:19.209> or<00:04:19.600> weight<00:04:19.959> measurements

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
we have seen size or weight measurements

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.250 
we have seen size or weight measurements
online<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.609> it<00:04:21.730> essentially<00:04:22.480> is<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.810> exact

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
online and it essentially is the exact

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.110 
online and it essentially is the exact
same<00:04:23.470> weight<00:04:23.740> as<00:04:23.949> the<00:04:24.100> droid<00:04:24.310> 1<00:04:24.520> so<00:04:24.669> expect<00:04:25.000> it

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
same weight as the droid 1 so expect it

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.000 
same weight as the droid 1 so expect it
to<00:04:25.240> be<00:04:25.360> sort<00:04:25.720> of<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:25.930> heavy<00:04:26.110> beast<00:04:26.440> just<00:04:26.800> like

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
to be sort of a heavy beast just like

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.640 
to be sort of a heavy beast just like
the<00:04:27.130> droid<00:04:27.310> one<00:04:27.550> was<00:04:27.790> if<00:04:28.660> we<00:04:28.840> open<00:04:29.050> it<00:04:29.320> up<00:04:29.470> this

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
the droid one was if we open it up this

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.930 
the droid one was if we open it up this
is<00:04:29.800> probably<00:04:29.979> what<00:04:30.160> you<00:04:30.250> all<00:04:30.370> really<00:04:30.669> care

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
is probably what you all really care

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.540 
is probably what you all really care
about<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.389> that<00:04:31.479> is<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.870> keyboard<00:04:32.500> we<00:04:33.430> all

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
about and that is the keyboard we all

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.580 
about and that is the keyboard we all
remember<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.060> droid<00:04:34.330> one's<00:04:34.630> flat<00:04:35.199> keyboard

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
remember the droid one's flat keyboard

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.920 
remember the droid one's flat keyboard
mine's<00:04:36.490> actually<00:04:36.639> not<00:04:36.940> super<00:04:37.300> flat<00:04:37.540> mine<00:04:37.750> has

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
mine's actually not super flat mine has

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
buttons are slightly raised I don't know

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
not no kind of tough on camera but they

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.290 
not no kind of tough on camera but they
are<00:05:14.380> definitely<00:05:14.560> slightly<00:05:15.220> raised<00:05:15.520> it<00:05:16.000> does

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
are definitely slightly raised it does

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.879 
are definitely slightly raised it does
feel<00:05:16.660> much<00:05:16.930> nicer<00:05:17.350> and<00:05:17.470> i'm<00:05:17.560> sure<00:05:17.740> this

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
feel much nicer and i'm sure this

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.950 
feel much nicer and i'm sure this
keyboard<00:05:18.190> is<00:05:18.280> gonna<00:05:18.430> be<00:05:18.520> pretty<00:05:18.729> close<00:05:19.120> to<00:05:19.419> the

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
keyboard is gonna be pretty close to the

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.540 
keyboard is gonna be pretty close to the
actual<00:05:20.260> model<00:05:20.800> so<00:05:21.180> um<00:05:22.180> buttons<00:05:22.600> feel<00:05:22.750> nicer

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
actual model so um buttons feel nicer

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.620 
actual model so um buttons feel nicer
still<00:05:24.550> not<00:05:24.700> as<00:05:24.789> nice<00:05:25.000> as<00:05:25.210> you<00:05:25.360> know<00:05:25.450> like<00:05:25.600> a

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
still not as nice as you know like a

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.779 
still not as nice as you know like a
BlackBerry's<00:05:26.229> keyboard<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.220> how<00:05:27.310> easy<00:05:27.550> those

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
BlackBerry's keyboard and how easy those

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.670 
BlackBerry's keyboard and how easy those
are<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.090> type<00:05:28.300> on<00:05:28.450> but<00:05:28.660> it'll<00:05:28.900> be<00:05:29.020> it'll<00:05:29.590> be

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
are to type on but it'll be it'll be

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.379 
are to type on but it'll be it'll be
much<00:05:29.950> easier<00:05:29.979> than<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:30.610> was<00:05:30.729> on<00:05:30.760> a<00:05:30.910> droid<00:05:31.090> once

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
much easier than it was on a droid once

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.370 
much easier than it was on a droid once
so<00:05:31.630> uh<00:05:31.979> anyway<00:05:32.979> this<00:05:33.820> is<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.090> droid<00:05:34.300> two<00:05:34.539> dummy

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
so uh anyway this is the droid two dummy

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.650 
so uh anyway this is the droid two dummy
phone<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:36.160> yes<00:05:36.550> we<00:05:36.729> actually<00:05:37.030> did<00:05:37.210> just<00:05:37.450> do<00:05:37.630> a

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
phone and yes we actually did just do a

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.719 
phone and yes we actually did just do a
walk-through<00:05:38.470> of<00:05:38.500> it<00:05:38.830> to<00:05:39.520> give<00:05:39.610> you<00:05:39.700> a

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
walk-through of it to give you a

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.170 
walk-through of it to give you a
comparison<00:05:40.150> to<00:05:40.630> the<00:05:40.750> incredible<00:05:41.700> here<00:05:42.700> is<00:05:42.940> the

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
comparison to the incredible here is the

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.930 
comparison to the incredible here is the
incredible<00:05:43.770> so<00:05:44.770> size-wise<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:45.639> know

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
incredible so size-wise you know

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.570 
incredible so size-wise you know
basically<00:05:46.780> the<00:05:46.990> same<00:05:47.260> incredible<00:05:48.010> will<00:05:48.400> be

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
basically the same incredible will be

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.830 
basically the same incredible will be
lighter<00:05:48.849> as<00:05:49.060> it's<00:05:49.240> one<00:05:49.360> of<00:05:49.450> the<00:05:49.510> lightest

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
lighter as it's one of the lightest

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.170 
lighter as it's one of the lightest
phones<00:05:50.110> on<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.560> planet<00:05:51.039> doesn't<00:05:51.880> have<00:05:52.060> that

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
phones on the planet doesn't have that

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.940 
phones on the planet doesn't have that
keyboard<00:05:52.419> so<00:05:52.810> it<00:05:52.960> doesn't<00:05:53.349> have<00:05:53.470> any<00:05:53.650> way<00:05:53.889> to

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
keyboard so it doesn't have any way to

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.129 
keyboard so it doesn't have any way to
it<00:05:54.250> so<00:05:54.430> there's<00:05:54.610> your<00:05:54.669> incredible<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:55.599> then

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
it so there's your incredible and then

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.210 
it so there's your incredible and then
the<00:05:56.289> real<00:05:56.470> one<00:05:56.710> you're<00:05:56.860> probably<00:05:57.010> all

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
the real one you're probably all

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.150 
the real one you're probably all
wondering<00:05:57.250> about<00:05:57.639> is<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.270> is<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:59.169> droid<00:05:59.590> x<00:05:59.740> so

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
wondering about is the is the droid x so

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.659 
wondering about is the is the droid x so
here<00:06:00.669> is<00:06:00.990> droid<00:06:01.990> x<00:06:02.169> in<00:06:02.470> comparison<00:06:03.310> to<00:06:03.520> the

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
here is droid x in comparison to the

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.300 
here is droid x in comparison to the
droid<00:06:04.060> two<00:06:04.570> okay<00:06:05.320> so<00:06:05.380> obviously<00:06:05.860> it's<00:06:06.039> a<00:06:06.099> ton

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
droid two okay so obviously it's a ton

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.029 
droid two okay so obviously it's a ton
bigger<00:06:06.520> it's<00:06:06.700> got<00:06:06.820> the<00:06:06.910> 4.3<00:06:07.360> inch<00:06:07.479> screen<00:06:08.039> it's

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
bigger it's got the 4.3 inch screen it's

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.029 
bigger it's got the 4.3 inch screen it's
gonna<00:06:09.280> be<00:06:09.460> thinner<00:06:09.820> because<00:06:10.770> it's<00:06:11.770> hard<00:06:11.950> to

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
gonna be thinner because it's hard to

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:12.990 
gonna be thinner because it's hard to
compare<00:06:12.280> that<00:06:12.340> it's<00:06:12.520> gonna<00:06:12.610> be<00:06:12.760> thinner

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
compare that it's gonna be thinner

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.370 
compare that it's gonna be thinner
because<00:06:13.180> doesn't<00:06:13.479> have<00:06:13.570> the<00:06:13.630> keyboard<00:06:13.990> all

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
because doesn't have the keyboard all

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.560 
because doesn't have the keyboard all
that<00:06:14.590> good<00:06:14.770> stuff<00:06:14.800> basically<00:06:15.789> same<00:06:16.000> internal

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
that good stuff basically same internal
