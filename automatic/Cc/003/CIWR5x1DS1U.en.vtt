00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.969 
up breaking and a week after i got it
and<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:20.909> wasn't<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.630> poles<00:01:21.869> fault<00:01:22.229> um

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
and it really wasn't the poles fault um

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.539 
and it really wasn't the poles fault um
I<00:01:24.290> push<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.500> was<00:01:25.619> walking<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.130> i<00:01:26.340> went<00:01:26.490> to

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
I push I was walking with it i went to

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.710 
I push I was walking with it i went to
put<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.790> my<00:01:26.850> car<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.270> caught<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> door

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
put it in my car and I caught the door

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.710 
put it in my car and I caught the door
and<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.979> bent<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.700> didn't<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.060> hardly<00:01:30.479> bend

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and it bent it didn't really hardly bend

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.870 
and it bent it didn't really hardly bend
at<00:01:30.869> all<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.380> bent<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.799> broke<00:01:32.010> but<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
at all but it's bent and broke but it

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.250 
at all but it's bent and broke but it
might<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.300> been<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.630> poles<00:01:33.810> fault<00:01:34.110> i

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
might have just been the poles fault i

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.180 
might have just been the poles fault i
don't<00:01:34.410> think<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.620> should<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.830> broke<00:01:34.980> under

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
don't think it should have broke under

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.160 
don't think it should have broke under
that<00:01:35.340> much<00:01:35.430> pressure<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:36.060> i<00:01:36.270> might<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.020> just

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that much pressure but i might have just

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.750 
that much pressure but i might have just
been<00:01:37.230> perfect<00:01:37.770> situation<00:01:37.950> where<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.580> bent

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
been perfect situation where it bent

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.080 
been perfect situation where it bent
just<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.390> anyway<00:01:39.720> uh<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:41.220> did<00:01:41.760> get<00:01:41.910> this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
just right but anyway uh I did get this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.420 
just right but anyway uh I did get this
one<00:01:42.330> for<00:01:42.660> free<00:01:42.830> technically<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:43.920> spent<00:01:44.310> money

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
one for free technically I spent money

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.890 
one for free technically I spent money
on<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> other<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:45.120> broke<00:01:45.300> i<00:01:45.450> got<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.750> one

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
on the other one it broke i got this one

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.650 
on the other one it broke i got this one
so<00:01:46.170> i<00:01:46.490> am<00:01:47.490> going<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> get<00:01:47.970> an<00:01:48.030> eye<00:01:48.150> rod<00:01:48.360> instead

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
so i am going to get an eye rod instead

so i am going to get an eye rod instead
and<00:01:48.960> i<00:01:48.990> figured<00:01:49.350> i<00:01:49.590> might<00:01:50.100> switch<00:01:50.520> online

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
six foot ten um heavy I think it's heavy

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.180 
six foot ten um heavy I think it's heavy
it<00:02:16.620> doesn't<00:02:16.890> say<00:02:17.069> but<00:02:17.310> uh<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:19.470> says<00:02:19.769> it's<00:02:19.920> heavy

it doesn't say but uh it says it's heavy
but<00:02:20.220> really<00:02:20.700> it's<00:02:20.849> more<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.180> medium<00:02:21.860> medium

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
but really it's more of a medium medium

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.990 
but really it's more of a medium medium
heavy<00:02:23.040> too<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:24.450> between<00:02:25.140> medium<00:02:25.920> heavy<00:02:26.099> too

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
heavy too in between medium heavy too

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.160 
heavy too in between medium heavy too
heavy<00:02:27.030> but<00:02:27.890> it's<00:02:28.890> not<00:02:29.129> real<00:02:29.370> tall<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.970> roll<00:02:30.900> long

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
heavy but it's not real tall a roll long

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.940 
heavy but it's not real tall a roll long
it's<00:02:31.950> only<00:02:32.129> 6<00:02:32.400> 10<00:02:32.659> but<00:02:33.659> it<00:02:34.319> kind<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.590> feels<00:02:34.739> like

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
it's only 6 10 but it kind of feels like

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.230 
it's only 6 10 but it kind of feels like
it<00:02:35.129> would<00:02:35.220> be<00:02:35.250> really<00:02:35.430> good<00:02:35.610> for<00:02:35.670> flipping<00:02:36.090> I

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
it would be really good for flipping I

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.910 
it would be really good for flipping I
would<00:02:36.870> use<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.290> more<00:02:37.440> than<00:02:37.470> flipping<00:02:37.740> i

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
would use it for more than flipping i

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.970 
would use it for more than flipping i
