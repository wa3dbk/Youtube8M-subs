hey continue our two-part series of

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.910 
hey continue our two-part series of
deconstructing<00:00:17.130> with<00:00:17.310> construction

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
deconstructing with construction

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.560 
deconstructing with construction
materials<00:00:19.920> or<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.160> not<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:21.150> have<00:00:21.359> some

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
materials or what not we have some

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.689 
materials or what not we have some
ceramic<00:00:21.960> tiles<00:00:22.320> which<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.400> been<00:00:23.519> told

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
ceramic tiles which I have been told

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.830 
ceramic tiles which I have been told
will<00:00:23.850> actually<00:00:24.210> stop<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> bullet<00:00:26.689> that's<00:00:27.689> what

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
will actually stop a bullet that's what

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.310 
will actually stop a bullet that's what
we<00:00:27.930> do<00:00:28.019> here<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.470> let's<00:00:28.619> find<00:00:28.769> out<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:31.050> things

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
we do here so let's find out the things

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
we do here so let's find out the things
are<00:00:31.470> bulletproof<00:00:31.769> they<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.160> will<00:00:32.399> be<00:00:32.489> usually

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
are bulletproof they do will be usually

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.740 
are bulletproof they do will be usually
one<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.030> two<00:00:33.270> things<00:00:33.480> they<00:00:33.780> either<00:00:35.480> absorb<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
one of two things they either absorb the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.270 
one of two things they either absorb the
impact<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.380> gets<00:00:37.530> trapped<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.070> that's

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
impact and it gets trapped in it that's

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.180 
impact and it gets trapped in it that's
your<00:00:38.399> bulletproof<00:00:38.910> vests<00:00:39.210> usually<00:00:39.770> or<00:00:40.770> they

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
your bulletproof vests usually or they

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.090 
your bulletproof vests usually or they
shatter<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.510> deflect<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.500> do<00:00:43.680> all<00:00:43.770> sorts<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
shatter and deflect and do all sorts of

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770 
shatter and deflect and do all sorts of
odd<00:00:44.430> things<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.000> are<00:00:45.090> dangerous<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.660> that's

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
odd things that are dangerous and that's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.319 
odd things that are dangerous and that's
probably<00:00:46.140> what's<00:00:46.289> gonna<00:00:46.410> happen<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:47.010> so

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
probably what's gonna happen here so

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.490 
probably what's gonna happen here so
this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.510> probably<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:48.960> our<00:00:49.140> safest

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
this is probably not our safest

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.619 
this is probably not our safest
experiment<00:00:50.070> we've<00:00:50.160> ever<00:00:50.250> done<00:00:51.469> but<00:00:53.629> science

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
experiment we've ever done but science

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.139 
experiment we've ever done but science
stops<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.170> no<00:00:55.199> man<00:00:57.590> I'll<00:00:58.590> see<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:58.859> happens

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
stops for no man I'll see what happens

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.959 
stops for no man I'll see what happens
now<00:01:00.410> ceramic<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.559> extremely<00:01:02.460> prone<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
now ceramic is extremely prone to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.039 
now ceramic is extremely prone to
shattering<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:05.420> let's<00:01:06.420> see<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.720> does<00:01:06.840> to

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
shattering so let's see what it does to

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:28.080 
shattering so let's see what it does to
a<00:01:07.490> 2222<00:01:08.490> does<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:41.650 

huh<00:01:29.710> well<00:01:33.910> interesting<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:38.260> stopped<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:40.660> well

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
huh well interesting it stopped it well

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.990 
huh well interesting it stopped it well
I<00:01:42.230> guess<00:01:43.130> we're<00:01:43.250> gonna<00:01:43.310> move<00:01:43.460> up<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.820> try

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
I guess we're gonna move up the try

00:01:44.000 --> 00:02:06.429 
I guess we're gonna move up the try
9-millimeter

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.150 

well<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.229> we<00:02:10.379> have<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> little<00:02:10.950> bit<00:02:11.099> of

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
well you can see we have a little bit of

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.400 
well you can see we have a little bit of
the<00:02:11.220> same<00:02:11.489> here<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.790> want<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.090> mess<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:13.170> this

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the same here I want a mess but this

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.699 
the same here I want a mess but this
time<00:02:14.780> come<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> little<00:02:15.959> closer<00:02:16.230> take<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> look<00:02:16.620> at

time come a little closer take a look at

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.670 
time come a little closer take a look at
this<00:02:17.450> yeah<00:02:18.450> look<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> inside<00:02:19.349> you'll<00:02:19.620> see

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
this yeah look on the inside you'll see

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.180 
this yeah look on the inside you'll see
we<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:21.920> bathroom<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:24.739> it<00:02:25.739> looks<00:02:25.950> like<00:02:26.040> it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
we have a bathroom so it looks like it

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.860 
we have a bathroom so it looks like it
did<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> bit<00:02:26.519> of<00:02:26.550> deflection<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.450> slowed<00:02:27.750> it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
did a bit of deflection and it slowed it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.580 
did a bit of deflection and it slowed it
down<00:02:27.900> quite<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> bit<00:02:28.530> but<00:02:29.489> didn't<00:02:30.480> stop<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.260> all

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
down quite a bit but didn't stop it all

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.839 
down quite a bit but didn't stop it all
the<00:02:31.799> way<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:33.410> well<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.769> don't<00:02:35.549> think<00:02:35.610> we're

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
the way so well I don't think we're

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.240 
the way so well I don't think we're
gonna<00:02:35.940> get<00:02:36.120> much<00:02:36.420> else<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:37.410> can<00:02:37.560> try<00:02:37.799> except

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
gonna get much else we can try except

00:02:38.250 --> 00:03:03.800 
gonna get much else we can try except
for<00:02:38.430> maybe<00:02:39.920> let's<00:02:40.920> try<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.220> ak-47<00:02:42.209> clone

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:12.720 

well<00:03:05.999> we<00:03:06.999> got<00:03:07.230> tile<00:03:08.230> everywhere<00:03:11.730> have

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
well we got tile everywhere have

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.030 
well we got tile everywhere have
milk-jug

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
milk-jug

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.360 
milk-jug
know<00:03:15.040> where<00:03:16.680> well<00:03:17.680> you<00:03:17.709> may<00:03:17.889> been<00:03:18.040> asking

yeah actually
but<00:03:25.930> three<00:03:26.109> layers<00:03:26.319> nine<00:03:26.709> millimeter<00:03:27.159> and

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
but three layers nine millimeter and

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.280 
but three layers nine millimeter and
higher<00:03:27.480> I'm<00:03:28.480> not<00:03:28.689> so<00:03:28.870> lucky

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
higher I'm not so lucky

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.330 
higher I'm not so lucky
and<00:03:30.250> it's<00:03:30.519> heavy<00:03:30.879> so<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.840> know<00:03:32.469> Curtis

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
and it's heavy so you know Curtis

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.559 
and it's heavy so you know Curtis
bathroom<00:03:33.730> tiles<00:03:33.939> so<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:34.299> not<00:03:34.389> really

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
bathroom tiles so it's not really

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.869 
bathroom tiles so it's not really
designed<00:03:34.810> for<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.139> well<00:03:36.069> thank<00:03:36.519> you<00:03:36.609> very<00:03:36.639> much
