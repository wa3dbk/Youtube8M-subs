00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 together and welcome to one 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.799
 more video from me today, there is that 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.050
 review of the tsc 440 including the podcast 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.120
 Change what the thing is good for me 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.559
 experience and much more is how 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.559
 always a lot of fun after the intro 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.440
 First of all, what you are listening to 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.030
 is taken with the micro but also 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.650
 reworked closer to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.430
 postprocessing you will learn so 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.470
 towards the end of the video the team osc 44 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.690
 is a usb condenser microphone 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.879
 You do not need an extra with gold 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.239
 or interface to use the thing 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.550
 can 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.710
 only one computer is required 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.720
 Here I have as I said the podcast 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.730
 bundle where some useful things 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.699
 more are included in the scope of delivery 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.129
 So we have a simple but 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.079
 Practical is PVC case made of plastic 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.980
 that you strap on two here 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.500
 can open 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.840
 By the way, this studio is inside 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.270
 upholstery fitted in here 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.990
 Anyway, who would have thought that 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.320
 Microphone itself a fitting two meters 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.210
 USB cable and the spider in the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.460
 theme and later attached to it 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.440
 Who this two meter USB cable 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.430
 However, it was not enough 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.750
 a 3 meter extension cable included 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.750
 is too big for the case 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.420
 However, the tripod of millennium with 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.050
 maximum adjustable height of about two 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.209
 meters 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.069
 the part really fulfills its purpose 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.899
 sturdy and you can rotate with several 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.539
 set screws as desired 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.840
 Last but not least, here is the t bone 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.789
 ms 180 poppeller ever before the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.899
 did not really convince me and 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.179
 that's why I have that through one 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.310
 exchanged higher quality 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.470
 which I know as well now that 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.270
 I will not tell you later 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.599
 Anyway, that's still forgotten at to 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.959
 the recording studio and a dvd with 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:05.429
 special audio software 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.990
 the latter but I have always gone 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.360
 the program is no longer compatible 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.520
 and that's why I can not do anything unfortunately 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.890
 but it is absolutely necessary to say that 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.020
 to build it all together here 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.610
 you do not need great technology 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.489
 sketch I'll make you still times 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.650
 the shape of the tripod ends quickly 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.110
 Spider screwed properly aligned 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.590
 and with the mother against in the end 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.720
 Matching position firmly turned 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.970
 by the way, you can not just use the microphone 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.950
 directed upwards but also over 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.450
 For example , I use my head 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.250
 that much more pleasant 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.170
 now only the kopfschutz the missing 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.640
 one simply with a clamp fixed 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.310
 can bring as he already said 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.379
 I use the supplied ms 180 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.959
 not a reason to see it here 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.390
 The clamp was one made of steel and has that 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.879
 tripod accordingly simulated a little 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.920
 besides, these references were not 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.290
 sewed clean and sticking to the sides 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.360
 the ends of the material out and 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.959
 somehow the thing did not really work 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.180
 stable 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.130
 well he has his sense of purpose 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.220
 just not that high quality and robust 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.230
 out april on whether filter anyway 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.540
 for those who are wondering what they are doing now 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.760
 stocking of the microphone at all 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.780
 especially in german there are many hard ones 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.030
 words, so to speak, for example 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.780
 parchment paper or wind resp 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.299
 Gentle breathing destroys the recording 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.329
 pretty he has just heard with 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:33.010
 top player sounds like that then 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:36.410
 parchment paper and so much better 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.450
 important is still that the team nsp 440 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.370
 as for a large- diaphragm microphone 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.500
 actually usual about one of their 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.720
 characteristic features in the 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.709
 plain text everything in front of the microphone 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.450
 completely recorded 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.239
 noises beside and behind the membrane 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.680
 in reduced terms have a small one 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.359
 insight into the microphones quality 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.489
 you should have gotten in the meantime 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.739
 But the quality is not from the beginning 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.840
 on so no I have already at the beginning 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.519
 I must then know what 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.870
 because if I do not do that 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:08.150
 it would sound like that and me 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.919
 would have heard directly on her the sound 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.349
 is flush left just because it is 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:14.750
 A mono microphone is one and sometimes one 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.579
 pretty high background noise like 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.810
 he could handle it all 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.669
 me now 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.010
 and first on the Lord of screen 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.840
 fled a screencast program for the mac 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.930
 I'll do it the same way 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.610
 I still like that with audi city me 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.380
 I'm just entering the loo 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.230
 cut program which i among others 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.030
 use and that had belonged to him and that 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.980
 Here's another clip that I'm for 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.220
 I have to choose then I go up here 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.660
 on audio or audio properties and 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.040
 really only has to tick three more 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.090
 set the first volume 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.370
 adjust 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.750
 in the second at input to monthly and 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.090
 Last but not least here with filter 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.350
 background noise can be removed here 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.600
 you all the a bit more then 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.450
 adjust manually as given before 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.110
 but it is actually okay 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.820
 Alternatively, I'll show you the whole 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.500
 now with the city you can 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.870
 Download for free on the internet 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.790
 and for that I just start now 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:10.040
 a recording in the first few seconds 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.180
 still this is crucial and 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.750
 I can actually do that now 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.729
 stop recording or cancel 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.340
 Now I select the first here 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.479
 area from where you can only hear the noise or 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:26.660
 no blabber hear here go to perfect 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:30.500
 to remove new rubles to German and 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.180
 Let's go on the latest case and will 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.960
 I make out the whole thing 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.390
 whole again the perfect 95 and 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.160
 Press and that's it already 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.960
 I have a low noise and almost 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.380
 perfect recording 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.990
 So much for the team and sc 44 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.150
 costs the goalie at 59 euros in 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.270
 podcast walk like I am here from 30 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.009
 euro more so 89 euros for this 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.690
 comparatively reasonably priced 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.520
 I can only use the condenser microphone 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.050
 do not recommend to sing or 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.509
 similar but for example 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.580
 youtube videos or simple screencast 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.800
 extends the quality totally need 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.120
 also looks cool and is good and 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.430
 high quality processed 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.380
 despite the low price outside 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.360
 the top seller but my statement to 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.800
 submit 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.930
 I do not think so too 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.669
 say link to it is understandable 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.620
 in the video but not only denies 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.599
 but also info around one 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.610
 you may find there channel 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:27.889
 then you between the boxing and 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.210
 decide my network again otherwise 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.520
 I would not have a rating 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.970
 Of course, very happy and up to the 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.970
 next time
