cool pretty complicated John McLaughlin
lick<00:00:54.649> this<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.829> played<00:00:56.100> over<00:00:56.340> two<00:00:56.820> dominant

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
lick this is played over two dominant

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.900 
lick this is played over two dominant
seventh<00:00:57.629> chords<00:00:57.899> basically<00:00:58.200> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.590> 25<00:00:59.340> but

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
seventh chords basically going to 25 but

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.700 
seventh chords basically going to 25 but
the<00:01:00.360> two<00:01:00.539> chord<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.930> functioning<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the two chord is functioning really as a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.560 
the two chord is functioning really as a
secondary<00:01:02.190> dominant<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> start<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.420> in

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
secondary dominant so I start here in

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.430 
secondary dominant so I start here in
seventh<00:01:04.140> position<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:05.369> I'm<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.330> from<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
seventh position and I'm going from the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.710 
seventh position and I'm going from the
tonic<00:01:07.860> down<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.789> seventh<00:01:10.039> and<00:01:11.270> then<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.509> go

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
tonic down to the seventh and then I go

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.260 
tonic down to the seventh and then I go
up<00:01:12.929> to<00:01:12.959> the<00:01:13.170> third<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:14.759> we<00:01:14.910> have<00:01:15.090> this

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
up to the third and then we have this

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.090 
up to the third and then we have this
nice<00:01:15.569> intervallic<00:01:16.080> skip

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.230 

forming<00:01:22.100> like<00:01:22.220> a<00:01:22.250> B<00:01:22.490> major<00:01:22.700> triad

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
forming like a B major triad

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
forming like a B major triad
then<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> jump<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.740> ninth<00:01:25.979> position

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
then I jump up here to ninth position

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:39.190 
then I jump up here to ninth position
and<00:01:26.729> play<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.060> sequence<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.750> then

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.960 

and<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.590> very<00:01:40.830> common<00:01:41.280> John<00:01:41.610> McLaughlin

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
and in this very common John McLaughlin

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.389 
and in this very common John McLaughlin
kind<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.020> lick<00:01:43.289> that<00:01:43.890> you're<00:01:44.039> also<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.340> with

a<00:01:44.520> lot<00:01:44.789> of<00:01:44.970> different<00:01:45.390> players<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.470> his

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
a lot of different players of his

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.919 
a lot of different players of his
generation<00:01:46.920> where<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.789> take<00:01:48.299> an<00:01:48.509> interval

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
generation where we take an interval

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.999 
generation where we take an interval
akai<00:01:49.200> dia<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> move<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.039> down<00:01:50.070> chromatically

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
akai dia and move it down chromatically

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.580 
akai dia and move it down chromatically
and<00:01:53.009> then<00:01:53.250> down<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.390> then<00:01:57.110> then<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.380> this

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and then down and then then we have this

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.960 
and then down and then then we have this
big<00:01:59.220> intervallic<00:01:59.670> skip<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.399> perfect<00:02:02.759> fifth

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
big intervallic skip of a perfect fifth

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.480 
big intervallic skip of a perfect fifth
on<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.630> root<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.319> fifth<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:04.830> e7<00:02:05.399> and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
on the root and the fifth of the e7 and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.469 
on the root and the fifth of the e7 and
then<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.850> move<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.119> here<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> 12th<00:02:06.720> position

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
then I move up here to 12th position

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.940 
then I move up here to 12th position
that<00:02:09.479> same<00:02:09.690> sort<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.049> major<00:02:10.229> triad<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:10.860> we

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
saw back with the B chord and then he

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.240 
saw back with the B chord and then he
goes<00:02:17.209> now<00:02:18.209> check<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.630> out<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:19.500> come<00:02:19.709> down<00:02:20.010> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
goes now check this out we come down to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.729 
goes now check this out we come down to
the<00:02:20.370> E<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.850> he<00:02:21.780> comes<00:02:22.019> up<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.849> f-sharp<00:02:24.739> to

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
the E and he comes up to the f-sharp to

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.090 
the E and he comes up to the f-sharp to
get<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.160> G<00:02:26.400> sharp<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.970> then<00:02:27.330> up<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.709> an<00:02:28.829> a

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
get to the G sharp and then up to an a

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.440 
get to the G sharp and then up to an a
sharp<00:02:29.489> over<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.109> F<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:32.190> then<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.239> G

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
sharp over to the F and then to the G

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.940 
sharp over to the F and then to the G
sharp<00:02:33.690> right<00:02:33.959> here<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:35.120> 16th<00:02:36.120> position<00:02:36.950> so

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
sharp right here in 16th position so

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.849 
sharp right here in 16th position so
that's<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.280> pretty<00:02:38.489> interesting<00:02:39.209> fingering

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:48.860 

and<00:02:45.019> then<00:02:46.019> he<00:02:46.200> ends<00:02:46.709> with<00:02:47.239> going<00:02:48.239> back<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.600> 12th

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
and then he ends with going back to 12th

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:57.920 
and then he ends with going back to 12th
position<00:02:49.019> playing<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:53.100> then<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:57.060> then<00:02:57.120> we

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
position playing and then and then we

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.300 
position playing and then and then we
come<00:02:58.319> down<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:59.459> C<00:02:59.970> sharp<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.390> be<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.980> 9th

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
come down to C sharp to be in 9th

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.930 
come down to C sharp to be in 9th
position

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940
