00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 good friends here we have this game of 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.509
 motorcycle is pretty good that 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.649
 flame sbk 15 an egg the truth that I 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.630
 He liked very much to know his 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.250
 different options the complete egg 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.139
 you have to buy it prove and says the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.240
 purchase option but there are different 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.430
 options that you can use for free as per 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.080
 example championship for the fast and this 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.470
 last option so we press here 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.029
 fast race to be able to compete let's 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.199
 to select any pilot we see 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.269
 that many pilots that you can choose 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.529
 so he's going to select the pilot that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.939
 it is by default we see that in some 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.759
 tracks can also be blocked 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.760
 so let's play with this test 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.289
 effective contribution if we have not started 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.450
 We hope to load the notch 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.600
 girl is very cute 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.950
 and well let's play this excellent 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.840
 game of competitions and motorcycles 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.950
 we wait for the load we see that the game 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.650
 it has pretty good graphics 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.840
 we see the competitors start it and 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.150
 let's start we see that in the part 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.740
 right is the speed button on the 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.210
 left part of the brake button in 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.160
 the top right is the button 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.660
 from the camera and in the center of Moscow 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.870
 I can press to look back 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.010
 so I start today for the we go for the 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.159
 road was coming out of the 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.229
 forgiveness road and 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.749
 let's try to take this curve without 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.179
 get out so we do not waste time 

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:20.890
 because if I hit the road you can 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.520
 see my competitors are not going to take 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.619
 advantage 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.700
 Donostia little by little as you approach there 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.700
 have to be very careful not to 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.799
 crash the no if you touch a with a 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.740
 competitor because obviously he's going to have a 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.469
 accident and that's going to slow you down 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.259
 today at position number 17 so 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.090
 let's move forward if we keep pushing 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.520
 the accelerator and well then you have 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.179
 a space to martÃ­ to advance here 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.649
 I managed to evade some rivals for 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.849
 control motorcycle just move the 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.560
 phone to the left for the 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.819
 right we can also lift the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.330
 motorcycle without the phone 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.730
 down 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.430
 well do not lean here because I was in 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.770
 a curve 9 I soon fall for flies and 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.870
 little by little go ahead of the rivals 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.070
 let's see if here you can launch the motorcycle 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.770
 it's not that there are many curves 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.340
 there is not a part that is totally 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.610
 straight to be able to lift the motorcycle not 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.980
 that team throwing it and not the curve 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.050
 grabbed I have to wait so no 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.980
 so much of the track such is the good track 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:27.180
 there are here I managed to move to several 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.349
 competitors and we are going here is this 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.110
 highway this track is full of 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.450
 curves and that I practically have to 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.410
 walk with great caution well let's go 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.470
 of fifths 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.030
 we go from missing fifth few came from 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.130
 happen to several I did not pass several 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.990
 Search competitors bit by bit 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.090
 let's get closer to others and let's see if 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.160
 You can throw the bike here like this and if you 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.320
 you tilt the phone down to 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.450
 know that he is going to lift the bike 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.660
 this way ay ay ay very prime control 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.450
 let's go back to normal no no 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.580
 you leave do not leave good I left 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.980
 that the others begin to pass me 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.959
 competitors 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.940
 well we see that graphically by sample 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.930
 very well we can highlight or rather 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.440
 we can look on the screen that 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.780
 highlights the ray of the sun 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.700
 and in others to live that we can spend 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.530
 we can occupy the first position 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.709
 well at least I'm on the top we 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.500
 let's go 3 so let's continue without 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.170
 despair here was here I think that 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.660
 I can go to these 2 here we have a 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.340
 little to get ahead in this curve that 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.880
 it's quite closed we can see that it can 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.920
 give now although the first position 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.840
 here in another curve 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.120
 and we're going to pass it with caution to 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.890
 to be able to keep going 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.900
 accelerate here that is a little straight 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.700
 we press the screen we see that there 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.610
 there good pressure and happiness is a 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.370
 mistake that I made and I went back to the second 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.049
 position 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.110
 so press the muscle screen 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.410
 in a flat way after only missing one 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.420
 what to do and ready 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.730
 here here in this web curve I get a 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.800
 little but I still have speed like that 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.280
 that this curve is a bit 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.790
 complicated let's see if I succeed 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.380
 overtake it they were overtaking me 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.940
 speed was overtaking me so 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.220
 since in the third position but I came back 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.210
 in passing, she was quite entertained 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.090
 quite exciting 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.560
 I recommend you download it and 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.090
 install on your phone we will go and 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.060
 I'm getting good if two arrive and 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.020
 the second one came in, it helps me even if it's 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.000
 pitifully can not pass the first 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.320
 but hey this is the game with 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 a pretty competition race 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.240
 good so download it install your 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.240
 android
