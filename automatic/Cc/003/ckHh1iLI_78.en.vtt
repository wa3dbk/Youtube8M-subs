00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.549
 systems our systems 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.530
 dry construction provide the 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.240
 tranquility and comfort that all 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.129
 we want in our home or in our 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.960
 workplace advantages 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.970
 our floors ceilings walls and 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.040
 Facades go beyond comfort 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.630
 you will also notice it in your savings 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.400
 energetic with the linings now you 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.680
 You can isolate your home from the changes 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.050
 weather conditions avoiding losses 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.329
 of energy and maintaining a temperature 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:40.929
 constant with the minimum expense in air 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:42.699
 conditioning and heating protect 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.980
 human lives should be a requirement 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.710
 non-negotiable when choosing our 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.690
 housing or workplace systems 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.789
 against the side fire brings a 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.550
 resistance up to 180 minutes 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.420
 additional ones thus earning a vital time 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.420
 to prevent its spread 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.620
 the acoustic ceilings now are 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.900
 developed to avoid annoying 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.240
 acoustic reverberations try with 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.500
 loud and discover a new definition in 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.500
 tranquility and comfort 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.430
 text systems now are made 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.290
 by screwed laminated plasterboard 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.030
 to a metal structure and that 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.580
 destined to the realization of false 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.390
 ceilings their different benefits are 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.520
 obtained by modifying the type and number of 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.020
 Gypsum boards used type and 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.270
 configuration wireframe 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.170
 as well as the incorporation of wool 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.170
 insulating mineral 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.080
 the acoustic ceilings of and on line 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.960
 surprised by its high- end design 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.060
 the nowtzki neo plates offer huge 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.740
 acoustic performance and a wide 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.600
 variety of designs plus a 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.820
 innovative technology before smells that 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.560
 renews the air of the room 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.510
 partitions for laminated gypsum boards no 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.160
 they are interior partitions not 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.470
 important ones composed of a 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.090
 lightweight galvanized steel structure 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.100
 on which are screwed on both sides 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.100
 one or several laminated gypsum boards 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.870
 those of vhf of the technical code of the 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.730
 building are the so - called systems 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.950
 as vertical interior partitions 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.200
 of the self-supporting framework once 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.330
 installed we can treat them with tapes 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.220
 and pasta joints so we get 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.760
 continuous paraments ready for 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.320
 final decoration the backs are the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.550
 coatings that are made by the 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.160
 inner face of an enclosing wall 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.830
 outside as well as the coating of 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.810
 one or both sides of an interior wall the 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.060
 installation of a sado junk will reinforce 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.220
 the thermal and acoustic performances of 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.140
 the support walls once treated 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.180
 your boards properly with ribbons and 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.520
 Joints pastes are obtained paramentos 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.739
 continuous finished and prepared for 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.050
 its final decoration its different 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.239
 benefits will depend on the type of 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.459
 trash 2 to 2 number and type of plates 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.800
 used as well as the materials 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.870
 insulators used in the chamber and 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.730
 dimensions of the metal structure in 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.290
 the case of self-supporting 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.460
 Nautical soil systems are the 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.010
 solution to the high demands 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.450
 acoustic and thermal conductivity 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.700
 are raised in the regulations of the 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.070
 current construction the installation of 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.080
 Soil systems is simple clean 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.790
 and quickly find all the 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.800
 guarantees a wide range of 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.140
 solutions for any requirement in 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.450
 each of our systems the floors 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.790
 continuous not cold recordable 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.280
 Calcium sulfate crusoe fibroyeso 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.140
 of the bid and flower the water resistance of 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.140
 water panel flower and a long etcetera 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.600
 the water panel facades are the 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.190
 ideal alternative to materials 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.190
 traditional for enclosures 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.070
 exterior facades and coverings by 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.230
 Be stable and resistant to water 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.900
 They are also resistant to fire 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.510
 erosion and inclement degradation 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.280
 of the extreme weather the process of 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.470
 water installation panel facades 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.870
 is similar to dry construction 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.210
 obtaining benefits in times of 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.940
 labor and construction times 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.920
 drying also provide a high 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.870
 energy saving systems 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.970
 facade water panel author are 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.460
 contemplated in the document or 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.070
 adequacy to use and have been tested and 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.009
 tested by recognized laboratories 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.559
 worldwide 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.360
 the use of the systems now allows 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.619
 a simpler installation because they are 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.749
 lighter than the systems 

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:41.270
 traditional and do not need time to 

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:42.830
 drying also allow a free 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.960
 distribution of the interior of the building 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.360
 independent of the structure and in addition 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.330
 the passage of electrical installations 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.949
 water and sanitary its correct execution 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.020
 will respond to the most 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.999
 stringent acoustic insulation and 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.979
 security against fire a 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:59.149
 feature of naut partition walls is 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.869
 that can support loads 

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:04.460
 extraordinary all these advantages are 

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:06.889
 Exclusive of plate systems 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.379
 plaster laminate now now that you already know 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.120
 everything you can not offer think about 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:14.529
 everything you can offer your 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.529
 clients working with us
