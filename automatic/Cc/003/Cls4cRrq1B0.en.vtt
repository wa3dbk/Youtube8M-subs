00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.180 
down the line may make you unhappy it's
a<00:03:25.959> definitely<00:03:26.410> strange<00:03:26.680> point<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.129> I<00:03:27.160> think

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
a definitely strange point and I think

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.360 
a definitely strange point and I think
the<00:03:28.470> they're<00:03:29.470> saying<00:03:29.769> that<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:30.099> only

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
the they're saying that the only

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.220 
the they're saying that the only
constant<00:03:30.849> in<00:03:31.000> life<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.239> change<00:03:31.510> definitely

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
constant in life is change definitely

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.199 
constant in life is change definitely
again<00:03:32.680> comes<00:03:32.949> in<00:03:33.099> here<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.669> seems<00:03:33.910> like<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
again comes in here it seems like the

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.059 
again comes in here it seems like the
only<00:03:34.329> way<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.660> consistently<00:03:35.410> keep<00:03:35.739> yourself

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
only way to consistently keep yourself

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.009 
only way to consistently keep yourself
happy<00:03:36.250> it's<00:03:36.699> by<00:03:37.299> consistently<00:03:37.750> and

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
happy it's by consistently and

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.470 
happy it's by consistently and
constantly<00:03:38.230> changing<00:03:39.129> things<00:03:39.699> around<00:03:39.940> you

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
constantly changing things around you

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.900 
constantly changing things around you
and<00:03:40.720> taking<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.349> risk<00:03:41.500> because<00:03:41.919> sometimes<00:03:42.340> when

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
and taking a risk because sometimes when

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.110 
and taking a risk because sometimes when
you<00:03:43.030> change<00:03:43.299> things<00:03:43.629> you<00:03:44.459> know<00:03:45.459> at<00:03:45.730> first<00:03:45.910> you

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
you change things you know at first you

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.930 
you change things you know at first you
may<00:03:46.269> not<00:03:46.419> enjoy<00:03:46.750> them<00:03:46.989> as<00:03:47.139> much<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.819> know

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
may not enjoy them as much and you know

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.240 
may not enjoy them as much and you know
it's<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.180> general<00:03:49.780> thing<00:03:49.959> we<00:03:50.260> fear<00:03:50.500> change<00:03:50.859> it

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
it's a general thing we fear change it

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.159 
it's a general thing we fear change it
has<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.239> be<00:03:52.329> said<00:03:52.480> but<00:03:52.690> it's<00:03:52.900> something

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
has to be said but it's something

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:54.990 
has to be said but it's something
there's<00:03:53.379> always<00:03:53.500> necessary<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.819> know

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
there's always necessary you know

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.640 
there's always necessary you know
there's<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.449> unknown<00:03:55.870> with<00:03:56.109> change<00:03:56.440> you

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
there's the unknown with change you

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.229 
there's the unknown with change you
don't<00:03:56.829> know<00:03:56.919> how<00:03:57.099> it's<00:03:57.129> going<00:03:57.340> to<00:03:57.430> outcome<00:03:57.819> but

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
don't know how it's going to outcome but

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.640 
don't know how it's going to outcome but
actually<00:03:58.599> I<00:03:58.629> think<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.049> majority<00:03:59.169> of<00:03:59.530> the

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
actually I think the majority of the

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.080 
actually I think the majority of the
time<00:03:59.799> if<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.099> change<00:04:00.400> something<00:04:00.609> it's<00:04:00.970> going

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
time if you change something it's going

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.539 
time if you change something it's going
to<00:04:01.150> end<00:04:01.269> up<00:04:01.480> for<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.650> better<00:04:02.889> you<00:04:03.190> know<00:04:03.310> within

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
to end up for the better you know within

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.020 
to end up for the better you know within
reason<00:04:04.090> further<00:04:05.340> not<00:04:06.340> something<00:04:06.699> I<00:04:06.790> thought<00:04:06.970> I

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
reason further not something I thought I

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.180 
reason further not something I thought I
just<00:04:07.329> kind<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.540> throw<00:04:07.870> out<00:04:08.019> I've<00:04:08.260> covered<00:04:09.010> a

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
just kind of throw out I've covered a

just kind of throw out I've covered a
lot<00:04:09.340> of<00:04:09.370> different<00:04:09.489> ideas<00:04:09.940> that<00:04:10.419> just<00:04:10.449> threw

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
lot of different ideas that just threw

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.080 
lot of different ideas that just threw
my<00:04:11.109> train<00:04:11.409> of<00:04:11.440> thought<00:04:11.620> actually<00:04:12.549> more<00:04:12.760> than<00:04:12.790> I
