in<00:00:00.179> this<00:00:00.420> video<00:00:00.750> we're<00:00:01.260> going<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.589> look<00:00:01.770> at

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
in this video we're going to look at

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.430 
in this video we're going to look at
securing<00:00:02.730> double<00:00:03.030> glazed<00:00:03.240> doors<00:00:03.720> even<00:00:04.200> though

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
securing double glazed doors even though

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.170 
securing double glazed doors even though
your<00:00:04.589> door<00:00:04.830> may<00:00:05.040> appear<00:00:05.339> shut<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.940> latched

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
your door may appear shut and latched

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.059 
your door may appear shut and latched
not<00:00:06.870> following<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.500> correct<00:00:07.680> locking

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
not following the correct locking

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.860 
not following the correct locking
procedure<00:00:08.429> will<00:00:08.670> make<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:08.970> much<00:00:09.150> easier<00:00:09.450> for<00:00:09.840> a

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
procedure will make it much easier for a

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.629 
procedure will make it much easier for a
burglar<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.410> get<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:10.800> with<00:00:11.070> some<00:00:11.219> very<00:00:11.429> simple

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
burglar to get in with some very simple

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.020 
burglar to get in with some very simple
tools<00:00:12.059> or<00:00:12.450> just<00:00:12.900> by<00:00:13.019> kicking<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.620> door<00:00:14.030> these

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
tools or just by kicking the door these

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.880 
tools or just by kicking the door these
techniques<00:00:15.570> aren't<00:00:15.870> always<00:00:16.049> explained<00:00:16.619> by

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
techniques aren't always explained by

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.010 
techniques aren't always explained by
the<00:00:16.949> installers<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:18.390> you've<00:00:18.539> purchased<00:00:18.750> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the installers and if you've purchased a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.240 
the installers and if you've purchased a
property<00:00:19.230> that's<00:00:19.560> already<00:00:19.770> had<00:00:19.980> double

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
property that's already had double

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.310 
property that's already had double
glazing<00:00:20.460> installed<00:00:21.029> then<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.539> may<00:00:21.840> well<00:00:22.080> not

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
glazing installed then you may well not

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.189 
glazing installed then you may well not
know<00:00:22.470> them<00:00:22.680> either<00:00:23.570> if<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.689> go<00:00:24.779> outside<00:00:24.990> our

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
know them either if we go outside our

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.420 
know them either if we go outside our
property<00:00:25.650> we'll<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> look<00:00:26.130> at<00:00:26.279> how<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
property we'll have a look at how the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.330 
property we'll have a look at how the
locking<00:00:26.820> mechanism<00:00:27.330> usually<00:00:27.750> works<00:00:28.130> if<00:00:29.130> you

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
locking mechanism usually works if you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.759 
locking mechanism usually works if you
shut<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> door<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.539> then<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.349> press<00:00:31.560> down<00:00:31.710> on

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
shut the door and then to press down on

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.700 
shut the door and then to press down on
the<00:00:31.920> handle<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.700> door<00:00:32.910> will<00:00:33.090> not<00:00:33.120> open<00:00:33.530> even<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the handle the door will not open even a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.500 
the handle the door will not open even a
little<00:00:34.890> firm<00:00:35.250> push<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:35.850> show<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> door

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
little firm push will show that the door

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.740 
little firm push will show that the door
is<00:00:36.540> shut<00:00:37.309> however<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.730> door<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.210> not<00:00:39.360> locked

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
is shut however the door is not locked

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.049 
is shut however the door is not locked
it<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.410> latched<00:00:40.739> if<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.520> open<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.879> door

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
it is just latched if we open the door

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.930 
it is just latched if we open the door
from<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> inside<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> door<00:00:43.770> will<00:00:43.980> open<00:00:44.010> no

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
from the inside the door will open no

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.940 
from the inside the door will open no
problem<00:00:45.450> at<00:00:45.570> all<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.890> see

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
problem at all and as we can see

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.920 
problem at all and as we can see
operating<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> handle<00:00:48.360> from<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> inside

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
operating the handle from the inside

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.799 
operating the handle from the inside
operates<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.649> latch<00:00:49.820> if<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:51.300> operate<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
operates the latch if we operate the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.689 
operates the latch if we operate the
handle<00:00:52.140> from<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> outside<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.430> latch

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
handle from the outside then the latch

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.939 
handle from the outside then the latch
doesn't<00:00:54.090> move<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.260> think<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.710> type

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
doesn't move we can think of this type

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.979 
doesn't move we can think of this type
of<00:00:55.980> locking<00:00:56.460> mechanism<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.149> being<00:00:57.600> roughly

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
of locking mechanism as being roughly

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.200 
of locking mechanism as being roughly
equivalent<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> old<00:00:58.920> yale<00:00:59.340> style<00:00:59.850> lock

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
equivalent to the old yale style lock

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.049 
equivalent to the old yale style lock
where<00:01:01.020> basically<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.250> could<00:01:02.399> only<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.820> from

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
where basically you could only get from

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
where basically you could only get from
the<00:01:03.120> outside<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.960> key<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the outside with the key and for the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.770 
the outside with the key and for the
inside<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.850> could<00:01:05.970> simply<00:01:06.330> rotate<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
inside you could simply rotate the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.990 
inside you could simply rotate the
thumbwheel<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:08.040> order<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.460> improve<00:01:08.760> security

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
thumbwheel in order to improve security

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.859 
thumbwheel in order to improve security
double<00:01:09.930> glazed<00:01:10.200> doors<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:11.310> extra<00:01:11.939> bolts<00:01:12.390> top

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
double glazed doors have extra bolts top

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.740 
double glazed doors have extra bolts top
and<00:01:13.140> bottom<00:01:13.760> sometimes<00:01:14.760> these<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.360> actually

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
and bottom sometimes these are actually

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.870 
and bottom sometimes these are actually
supplemented<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:16.740> hooks<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.340> well<00:01:17.549> which

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
supplemented with hooks as well which

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.170 
supplemented with hooks as well which
lock<00:01:18.299> into<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.689> door<00:01:18.960> frame<00:01:19.400> however<00:01:20.400> these

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
lock into the door frame however these

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.249 
lock into the door frame however these
do<00:01:21.450> not<00:01:21.479> work<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.200> with<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> turn<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.549> key

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
do not work just with the turn of a key

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.710 
do not work just with the turn of a key
instead<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.830> must<00:01:25.950> lift<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.700> door<00:01:26.850> handle<00:01:27.450> up

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
instead you must lift the door handle up

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.929 
instead you must lift the door handle up
first<00:01:28.500> turning<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> reverse

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
first turning it in the reverse

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
first turning it in the reverse
direction<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.810> normally<00:01:30.930> would<00:01:31.409> doing

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
direction that you normally would doing

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.679 
direction that you normally would doing
this<00:01:32.130> will<00:01:32.310> engage<00:01:32.640> all<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.880> locking<00:01:33.329> bolts

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
this will engage all the locking bolts

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.780 
this will engage all the locking bolts
in<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> door<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> make<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> door<00:01:35.040> much<00:01:35.520> much

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
in the door and make the door much much

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
in the door and make the door much much
stronger<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.509> enable<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.259> resist

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
stronger and enable it to resist

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740 
stronger and enable it to resist
attempts<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.520> force<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.970> open<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
attempts to force it open with the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.380 
attempts to force it open with the
handle<00:01:40.140> still<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> upright<00:01:40.920> position

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
handle still in the upright position

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.569 
handle still in the upright position
insert<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> key<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.020> lock<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.860> door<00:01:44.100> this

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
insert the key and lock the door this

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.149 
insert the key and lock the door this
then<00:01:44.790> causes<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.390> handle<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:46.530> locked<00:01:46.829> in

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
then causes the handle to be locked in

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.550
