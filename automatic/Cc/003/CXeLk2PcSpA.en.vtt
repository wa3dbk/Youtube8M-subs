00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
what they know let's find out the story

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.259 
what they know let's find out the story
the<00:00:52.840> main<00:00:53.079> story<00:00:53.500> itself<00:00:53.949> I<00:00:54.280> won't<00:00:54.640> lie

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
the main story itself I won't lie

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.650 
the main story itself I won't lie
sounds<00:00:55.719> a<00:00:55.809> bit<00:00:55.840> familiar<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:57.070> by<00:00:57.760> that<00:00:58.000> I<00:00:58.239> mean

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
sounds a bit familiar and by that I mean

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.900 
sounds a bit familiar and by that I mean
it<00:00:58.840> shares<00:00:59.109> some<00:00:59.230> similarities<00:00:59.410> to<00:01:00.160> something

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
it shares some similarities to something

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.200 
it shares some similarities to something
like<00:01:01.090> Fern<00:01:01.510> Gully<00:01:01.780> or<00:01:02.230> avatar<00:01:03.100> you<00:01:03.789> have<00:01:03.969> this

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
this case shrunken down to a bug to save

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.100 
this case shrunken down to a bug to save
an<00:01:09.369> enchanted<00:01:09.850> forest<00:01:09.880> that's<00:01:10.539> filled<00:01:10.899> with

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
an enchanted forest that's filled with

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.650 
an enchanted forest that's filled with
tiny<00:01:11.350> forest<00:01:11.890> people<00:01:12.100> where<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.090> animals<00:01:13.479> are

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
tiny forest people where the animals are

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.960 
tiny forest people where the animals are
either<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:13.959> mode<00:01:14.229> of<00:01:14.319> transportation<00:01:14.770> or<00:01:15.399> a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
either a mode of transportation or a

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.080 
either a mode of transportation or a
giant<00:01:16.360> threat<00:01:16.690> it's<00:01:17.619> been<00:01:17.979> done<00:01:18.220> before<00:01:18.399> yes

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
giant threat it's been done before yes

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.270 
giant threat it's been done before yes
but<00:01:19.810> I<00:01:19.840> will<00:01:20.080> say<00:01:20.349> that<00:01:20.590> they<00:01:20.740> did<00:01:20.950> it<00:01:21.069> better

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
but I will say that they did it better

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.029 
but I will say that they did it better
than<00:01:21.429> the<00:01:21.729> movies<00:01:22.030> I<00:01:22.149> previously<00:01:22.569> mentioned

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
than the movies I previously mentioned

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.249 
than the movies I previously mentioned
what<00:01:24.039> epic<00:01:24.459> did<00:01:24.759> is<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.509> instead<00:01:25.959> of<00:01:26.020> having

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
what epic did is that instead of having

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.589 
what epic did is that instead of having
a<00:01:26.470> really<00:01:26.830> preachy<00:01:27.190> environmental<00:01:28.119> message

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:28.599 
a really preachy environmental message

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:30.719 
a really preachy environmental message
they<00:01:29.200> replaced<00:01:29.649> it<00:01:29.890> with<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:30.069> lot<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.429> cool

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
they replaced it with a lot of cool

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.609 
they replaced it with a lot of cool
action<00:01:31.390> scenes<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.929> it<00:01:32.080> has<00:01:32.259> a<00:01:32.289> more

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
action scenes and it has a more

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.880 
action scenes and it has a more
fairytale<00:01:33.429> feeling<00:01:33.940> to<00:01:34.179> it<00:01:34.360> I<00:01:34.569> gotta<00:01:35.530> say

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
fairytale feeling to it I gotta say

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.219 
fairytale feeling to it I gotta say
that's<00:01:36.429> a<00:01:36.610> major<00:01:36.819> step<00:01:37.030> up<00:01:37.509> and<00:01:37.720> it<00:01:37.840> makes<00:01:38.050> the

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
that's a major step up and it makes the

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.830 
that's a major step up and it makes the
story<00:01:38.440> pretty<00:01:39.009> solid<00:01:39.550> and<00:01:39.670> often<00:01:40.030> engaging<00:01:40.509> on

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
story pretty solid and often engaging on

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
pointless events that happen I'm

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.180 
pointless events that happen I'm
saying<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.120> story<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.720> bad<00:02:18.019> but<00:02:18.860> there's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
saying that the story is bad but there's

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.970 
saying that the story is bad but there's
a<00:02:19.280> lot<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.970> room<00:02:20.239> for<00:02:20.269> improvement<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
a lot of room for improvement the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.210 
a lot of room for improvement the
animation<00:02:25.730> now<00:02:26.470> here's<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.709> part<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.040> we

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
animation now here's the part that we

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.809 
animation now here's the part that we
make<00:02:28.400> everybody<00:02:28.849> go<00:02:29.269> wait<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.890> movie<00:02:31.400> was

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
make everybody go wait this movie was

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.380 
make everybody go wait this movie was
made<00:02:31.849> by<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.300> people<00:02:32.720> who<00:02:32.900> made<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.379> movie

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
made by the people who made that movie

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.570 
made by the people who made that movie
this<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.660> far<00:02:36.110> different<00:02:36.410> than<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:36.980> cartoony

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
this is far different than the cartoony

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.670 
this is far different than the cartoony
style<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:38.150> blue<00:02:38.390> sky<00:02:38.599> would<00:02:38.930> normally<00:02:39.500> make

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
style that blue sky would normally make

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.729 
style that blue sky would normally make
in<00:02:40.040> many<00:02:40.760> ways<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.750> animation<00:02:42.349> makes<00:02:42.560> me

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
in many ways the animation makes me

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.289 
in many ways the animation makes me
think<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.160> DreamWorks<00:02:43.610> rise<00:02:43.940> of<00:02:44.209> the

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
think of DreamWorks rise of the

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.270 
think of DreamWorks rise of the
Guardians<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.080> I'm<00:02:45.470> not<00:02:45.680> just<00:02:45.950> saying<00:02:46.220> that

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
Guardians and I'm not just saying that

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.309 
Guardians and I'm not just saying that

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.650 
because of William Joyce's involvement
with<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.620> movie<00:02:48.950> but<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.849> shares<00:02:50.090> similar

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
with the movie but it shares similar

with the movie but it shares similar

very creative as it is beautiful to look
at<00:03:13.040> even<00:03:14.030> in<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.299> Boggan<00:03:14.720> side<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.290> captures

at even in the Boggan side it captures

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.520 
at even in the Boggan side it captures
that<00:03:15.829> dark<00:03:16.459> creepy<00:03:16.970> decaying<00:03:17.569> area<00:03:18.200> of<00:03:18.379> the

that dark creepy decaying area of the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
forest but one thing that this movie

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.009 
forest but one thing that this movie
really<00:03:21.650> nailed<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.850> detail<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.750> the

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
really nailed is the detail of the

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.740 
really nailed is the detail of the
designs<00:03:24.530> from<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.489> bark<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.060> trees<00:03:26.420> to

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
designs from the bark of the trees to

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.690 
designs from the bark of the trees to
the<00:03:26.900> skin<00:03:27.230> of<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.470> people<00:03:27.889> to<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.220> fur<00:03:28.489> of<00:03:28.519> the

the skin of the people to the fur of the

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.330 
the skin of the people to the fur of the
animals<00:03:29.359> since<00:03:30.139> our<00:03:30.350> characters<00:03:30.829> are<00:03:31.010> mostly

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
animals since our characters are mostly

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.420 
animals since our characters are mostly
small<00:03:31.930> everything<00:03:32.930> has<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.380> be<00:03:33.530> way<00:03:33.920> larger

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
small everything has to be way larger

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.360 
small everything has to be way larger
than<00:03:34.459> life<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.180> they<00:03:35.720> can<00:03:35.750> get<00:03:36.170> up<00:03:36.349> close<00:03:36.440> and

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
than life and they can get up close and

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.550 
than life and they can get up close and
it's<00:03:37.579> like<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:37.880> can<00:03:38.060> practically<00:03:38.599> feel<00:03:39.230> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
it's like you can practically feel the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.400 
it's like you can practically feel the
textures<00:03:40.190> of<00:03:40.220> whatever's<00:03:40.819> on<00:03:41.000> screen<00:03:41.420> what

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
textures of whatever's on screen what

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.319 
textures of whatever's on screen what
I'm<00:03:42.530> really<00:03:42.739> impressed<00:03:43.160> with<00:03:43.370> though<00:03:43.700> is<00:03:43.910> the

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
I'm really impressed with though is the

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.259 
I'm really impressed with though is the
use<00:03:44.599> of<00:03:44.630> character<00:03:45.470> animation<00:03:46.310> there<00:03:47.090> are

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
use of character animation there are

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.879 
use of character animation there are
some<00:03:47.569> characters<00:03:48.079> that<00:03:48.319> move<00:03:48.560> more

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
some characters that move more

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.830 
some characters that move more
realistically<00:03:49.669> and<00:03:50.060> others<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.690> are<00:03:50.750> more

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
realistically and others that are more

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.500 
realistically and others that are more
cartoon<00:03:51.590> like<00:03:51.859> but<00:03:52.609> they<00:03:52.819> managed<00:03:53.150> to<00:03:53.180> work

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
cartoon like but they managed to work

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.629 
cartoon like but they managed to work
together<00:03:53.690> pretty<00:03:54.200> well<00:03:54.349> and<00:03:54.859> one<00:03:55.370> doesn't

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
together pretty well and one doesn't

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.140 
together pretty well and one doesn't
overshadow<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.690> other<00:03:56.840> also<00:03:57.709> they<00:03:58.669> mention<00:03:59.060> a

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
overshadow the other also they mention a

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.909 
overshadow the other also they mention a
theory<00:03:59.540> that<00:03:59.569> when<00:04:00.019> you're<00:04:00.169> the<00:04:00.200> size<00:04:00.560> of<00:04:00.829> a

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
theory that when you're the size of a

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.309 
theory that when you're the size of a
bug<00:04:01.220> everything<00:04:02.120> that's<00:04:02.329> larger<00:04:02.900> than<00:04:02.930> them

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
bug everything that's larger than them

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.979 
bug everything that's larger than them
like<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.859> average<00:04:04.160> person<00:04:04.819> would<00:04:05.329> move<00:04:05.630> a<00:04:05.780> lot

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
like the average person would move a lot

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.440 
like the average person would move a lot
slower<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:07.370> result<00:04:07.760> is<00:04:07.910> that<00:04:07.940> they<00:04:08.239> have<00:04:08.419> a

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
slower the result is that they have a

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.990 
slower the result is that they have a
really<00:04:08.810> clever<00:04:09.260> use<00:04:09.650> of<00:04:09.680> characters<00:04:10.459> going<00:04:10.760> in

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
really clever use of characters going in

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.050 
really clever use of characters going in
slow<00:04:11.150> motion<00:04:11.870> with<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.859> animation<00:04:13.430> this<00:04:13.700> fun
