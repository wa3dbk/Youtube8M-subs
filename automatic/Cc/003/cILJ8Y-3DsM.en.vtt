00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
lipstick and that is what I have on my

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.510 
lipstick and that is what I have on my
lips<00:01:45.570> right<00:01:45.720> now<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.350> think<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:47.070> looks<00:01:47.340> really

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
lips right now I think that looks really

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.910 
lips right now I think that looks really
good<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.090> definitely<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> fallish<00:01:49.170> color<00:01:49.470> so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
good it's definitely a fallish color so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
good it's definitely a fallish color so
maybe<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:51.000> summer<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.450> wouldn't<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> best

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
maybe for summer it wouldn't be the best

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.139 
maybe for summer it wouldn't be the best
but<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.040> something<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.549> like<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.850> wear

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
but it is something that I like to wear

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.359 
but it is something that I like to wear
I<00:01:54.479> would<00:01:54.899> definitely<00:01:55.290> recommend<00:01:55.439> trying<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
I would definitely recommend trying to

I would definitely recommend trying to
use<00:01:56.520> an<00:01:56.729> eyeshadow<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.450> don't<00:01:57.780> use<00:01:58.049> as<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
use an eyeshadow that you don't use as a
