makes it so great and it's so easy to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.740 
makes it so great and it's so easy to
build<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.610> very<00:01:50.850> compact<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.540> can

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
build and it's very compact so you can

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.600 
build and it's very compact so you can
have<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> ton<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.200> these<00:01:52.380> guys<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.460> have

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
have a ton of these guys so you can have

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.850 
have a ton of these guys so you can have
a<00:01:53.640> ton<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.030> gold<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.570> way<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.899> well<00:01:55.259> alright

a ton of gold that way as well alright

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.319 
a ton of gold that way as well alright
so<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.460> what<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> redstone<00:01:57.000> looks<00:01:57.180> like

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
so this is what the redstone looks like

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
so this is what the redstone looks like
it<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.509> has<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> redstone<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.619> then<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it just has the redstone and then the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.920 
it just has the redstone and then the
Pistons<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> tripwire<00:02:00.180> hooks<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.540> it's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
Pistons and the tripwire hooks and it's

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
Pistons and the tripwire hooks and it's
so<00:02:01.140> easy<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.619> make<00:02:01.770> guys<00:02:01.950> honestly<00:02:02.460> and

tutorial in the description below on how
you<00:03:11.140> can<00:03:11.380> break<00:03:11.530> blocks<00:03:11.830> pretty<00:03:12.130> fast<00:03:12.400> as<00:03:12.580> well

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
you can break blocks pretty fast as well

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.979

I'll leave that there that that's the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.140 
I'll leave that there that that's the
only<00:03:20.380> downside<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:20.829> this<00:03:21.040> farm<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.820> will<00:03:21.850> need

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
only downside to this farm you will need

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.170 
only downside to this farm you will need
to<00:03:22.329> destroy<00:03:22.750> either<00:03:23.019> 450<00:03:23.950> blocks<00:03:24.220> around<00:03:24.579> this

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
to destroy either 450 blocks around this

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.819 
to destroy either 450 blocks around this
farm<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.690> get<00:03:25.900> this<00:03:26.079> working<00:03:26.350> fully

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
farm to get this working fully

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.500 
farm to get this working fully
efficiently<00:03:27.549> because<00:03:27.820> when<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.090> guys<00:03:28.239> stand

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
efficiently because when you guys stand

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.750 
efficiently because when you guys stand
around<00:03:28.780> this<00:03:28.900> farm<00:03:29.109> 150<00:03:30.040> blocks<00:03:30.280> around<00:03:30.459> you

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
around this farm 150 blocks around you

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.120 
around this farm 150 blocks around you
will<00:03:31.180> be<00:03:31.209> loaded<00:03:31.720> so<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.470> way<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.680> won't<00:03:32.920> be

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
will be loaded so that way you won't be

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.009 
will be loaded so that way you won't be
getting<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.519> best<00:03:33.760> bond<00:03:34.090> rates<00:03:34.299> ever<00:03:34.540> so<00:03:34.900> you

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
getting the best bond rates ever so you

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.780 
getting the best bond rates ever so you
guys<00:03:35.140> want<00:03:35.380> this<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.709> work<00:03:35.859> fully<00:03:36.130> efficiently

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
guys want this to work fully efficiently

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.340 
guys want this to work fully efficiently
you<00:03:37.090> will<00:03:37.120> have<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.510> destroy<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.019> hundred<00:03:38.320> and

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
you will have to destroy the hundred and

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.020 
you will have to destroy the hundred and
fifty<00:03:38.620> blocks<00:03:38.859> around<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.310> farm<00:03:39.519> or<00:03:39.820> either

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
fifty blocks around the farm or either

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.640 
fifty blocks around the farm or either
half<00:03:40.269> slab<00:03:40.570> but<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.750> would<00:03:40.840> recommend<00:03:40.959> just

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
half slab but I would recommend just

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.050 
half slab but I would recommend just
destroying<00:03:42.070> it<00:03:42.250> because<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.549> will<00:03:42.670> be<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.820> lot

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
destroying it because it will be a lot

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.910 
destroying it because it will be a lot
faster<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.780> easier<00:03:43.959> than<00:03:44.140> half<00:03:44.440> slobbing<00:03:44.829> the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
faster and easier than half slobbing the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.440 
faster and easier than half slobbing the
whole<00:03:45.040> nether<00:03:45.220> but<00:03:45.700> if<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:45.850> guys<00:03:45.970> are<00:03:46.120> into

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
whole nether but if you guys are into

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.699 
whole nether but if you guys are into
the<00:03:46.570> whole<00:03:46.720> half<00:03:46.930> slobbing<00:03:47.380> thing<00:03:47.530> and

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
the whole half slobbing thing and

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.220 
the whole half slobbing thing and
conserving<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.790> nether<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.630> can<00:03:49.810> do<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.049> as

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
conserving the nether you can do that as

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.840 
conserving the nether you can do that as
well<00:03:50.260> but<00:03:50.859> that's<00:03:50.980> possibly<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.549> only

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
well but that's possibly the only

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.789 
well but that's possibly the only
downside<00:03:52.299> to<00:03:52.329> this<00:03:52.480> farm<00:03:52.750> overall<00:03:53.320> guys<00:03:53.560> this

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
downside to this farm overall guys this

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.259 
downside to this farm overall guys this
is<00:03:53.920> a<00:03:53.980> great<00:03:54.370> farm<00:03:54.640> for<00:03:54.850> what<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.090> guys<00:03:55.209> are

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
putting into this farm the outcome is

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.039
