 who shot down a malaysian point over 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.359
 Donbas but most importantly like a rocket 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.000
 ground-to-air 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.100
 or a liner shot military aircraft 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.980
 these disputes have not subsided for more than a year 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.300
 there is no consensus version which 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.800
 told life news 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.680
 federal information expert 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.310
 analytics and security center Sergey 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.850
 falcons 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.090
 at first glance it seems at all 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.949
 fantastic i'm pretty sure that 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.210
 the plane was blown up from the inside and it was 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.640
 special operation this interview had all 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.470
 the chances of remaining unpublished 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.630
 who has any assumptions 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.660
 some blame the liner crash 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.250
 aliens but need proof 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.930
 however, in confirmation of his words, sergei 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.320
 falcons provided a record of the negotiations 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.040
 Su-27 10c combat aircraft pilot 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.040
 control point 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:10.390
 have a feature of their military communication 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.700
 The pilots helped us to understand Ivan 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.750
 Ivanov behind his shoulders hundreds of martial and 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.180
 training missions 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.450
 but sometimes in some situations when 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.180
 the goal is not characteristic they are not military 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.370
 purpose sometimes used words like 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.770
 big for example according to this entry 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.229
 the pilot is told the coordinates of another 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.660
 aircraft from the ground in a few minutes 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.300
 the pilot reports visual contact 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.479
 with passenger liner and gets 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.479
 instructions 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.320
 but 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:34.810
 after another 2 minutes the pilot himself goes 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:37.060
 on the link he is very excited this 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.860
 sensational recording fell into the hands of Sergei 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.760
 Falcon last year in 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.310
 in electronic format 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.130
 publish and and then it was impossible we 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.840
 understood that if we will have 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.819
 doing there with a city tribunal or 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.349
 funny mouth bracelets will need 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.239
 direct source that is that 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.720
 thing that is taken for examination 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.269
 which can objectively be considered and 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.470
 must be considered material evidence you therefore we 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.660
 bought from the staff of the SSU 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.000
 directly bobbin with cork on 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.420
 who recorded these conversations reel 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.250
 cost research center 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.680
 250,000 dollars Sergey Falcons says 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.139
 they decided to give that kind of money and only 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.870
 when fully convinced that the source 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:22.810
 trustworthy and the record is authentic 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.459
 we spent money and we would 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.739
 of course you would like to compensate for your 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.959
 stress or private record organization 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.239
 subjected to rigorous check gluing 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.970
 mounting and imposing additional 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.680
 the experts did not find any sound 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.840
 negotiation features used 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.630
 terms lead time 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.090
 teams analyzed military pilots 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.180
 I like an expert what I am 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.069
 flew by my own experience yes I listened 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.260
 somewhat enter q but i believe that 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.169
 yes on the background does not correspond to that moment 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.169
 which is about which events this 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:58.450
 event about which does not tell 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.730
 the version that the Malaysian Boeing was 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.130
 destroyed by an explosion from the inside adheres 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.650
 and independent technical expert Yuri 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.340
 antipov immediately after the tragedy he subjected 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.920
 criticized 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.100
 options for hitting a liner with a rocket or 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.350
 military aircraft 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.900
 when we released black box data 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.520
 he was even more convinced of his version 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.700
 completely zeroing in one temporary 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.800
 the point of all appliances ie black boxes 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.930
 instantly lost touch with everyone 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.420
 devices and sensors like someone 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.580
 cut all the wires as it shows 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.250
 practice after hitting the plane 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.800
 rockets and projectile recorders some more 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.230
 seconds or even minutes fix 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.930
 pilot negotiation pressure settings 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.460
 speeds and other flight data matter in 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.920
 the fact that the wires are black boxes 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.290
 duplicated three times and damage them all 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.600
 all the more fragmental 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.060
 projectile impossible but even more 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.300
 indicative of Yuri Antipov is 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.810
 the location of the wreckage of the liner on the scheme 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.280
 the dispersal of debris on earth can be seen from 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.200
 the last point where the plane is still 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.180
 there was unharmed part of the wreckage 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.060
 part of the wreckage was much to the left 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.250
 what is most important behind the plane was going with 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.950
 speed of about 900 kilometers per hour 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.620
 according to the laws of physics, inertia must 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.200
 was dragging forward all the wreckage but 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.320
 this did not happen to any external 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.220
 blast flying over the rocket 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.710
 the more shelling the plane wreckage is not 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.810
 no one can be thrown back 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.180
 did not pay attention Dutch experts 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.760
 Generally made a number of gross errors 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.470
 during the investigation the mass of debris is still 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.040
 then remained at the site of the tragedy and 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.570
 take them no one will not 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.930
 international standards, all who leave for 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.370
 plane crash required to take the bang 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.030
 technical expertise on the subject 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.560
 possible destruction of the aircraft from the inside 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.050
 Perhaps this is the unity of expertise which 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.540
 It was not made until all argued about from 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.330
 what weapons shot boeing nose 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.220
 Yuri Antipov has carefully studied the trim 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.800
 liner in his opinion even on 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.780
 photos you can see the handwriting of the bomb 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.610
 blown up inside and here it is 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.430
 squeezing is characteristic around 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.990
 porthole and this porthole 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.030
 naturally passenger compartment 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.560
 that is , in the cabin itself was 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.129
 short term high pressure 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.229
 It was 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.789
 squeeze the trim now when 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:22.129
 own investigation completed 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.959
 sergey sokolov is ready to provide everything 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:26.179
 collected materials and evidence 

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:27.979
 an international group of researchers but 

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:29.899
 bye European officials 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:33.439
 experts are more interested in the possibility 

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:35.899
 creating a freon tribunal than fix 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:38.979
