00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.649
 hello people the other day got this 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.330
 here it is five, twenty five 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.950
 inches 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.900
 reobas front panel to control 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.850
 fan speeds plus this thing 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:25.430
 has a card reader for his own 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.810
 took ordered this thing and so 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:34.440
 actually a brief description of it 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:38.250
 touch screen panel which allows 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.800
 control four fans 3 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:48.300
 speeds low medium high choice 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.950

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.629

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.579
 backlight support up to 20 watts per channel 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:01.020
 you can turn off the speed completely what 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.320
 also by the way is very interesting to show 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.420
 celsius fahrenheit temperature 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.180
 switch usb port and 30 but how 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.119
 card reader that already mentioned with the house 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:22.890
 Sith and so finally open the box 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:27.890
 let's see what's inside did not hide 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.890
 I hope the film will not find a brick 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:48.720
 only can this side in the box 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:52.710
 find the instructions for connecting to 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:02:01.520
 Basically nothing special 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:03.530
 mounting screws and nothing else 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.259
 dummy 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:11.370
 on the box, too, everything is beautiful here 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:17.600
 painted painted this thing bought 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:22.100
 for your media center in different languages 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:29.930
 everything is standard so yes understood 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:29.930
 so that the foil is still stuck 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:43.030
 here is a bunch of wires here usb3 0 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:47.020
 connection is we have a card reader 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:54.440
 connecting something there already crunched 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:03:01.120
 I hope it is not lethal sb20 rather 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:04.640
 total FSB 30 is we are connecting 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.060
 for expert connection some kind of usb 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.600
 winchester flash drive or something else but your 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:18.470
 sb20 is our motherboard reader 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:21.650
 hangs themselves the wires themselves for 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.370
 connect coolers see big 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.680
 variety of molexes 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:36.769
 standard for connection coolers 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:39.880
 power supply of all here for this 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:48.200
 as the germans say lettuce from the wires 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:52.730
 I will not need much continuation 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:57.799
 I will show you how I install into a computer and 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.019
 how does it work in general plus especially not 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.850
 interested in 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.609
 card reader to recognize cards 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.430
 large format 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:09.430
 3264 128 gigabytes 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.500
 such a thing
