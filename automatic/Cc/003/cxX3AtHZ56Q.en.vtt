the<00:00:22.340> power<00:00:22.490> plant<00:00:22.700> I<00:00:22.850> say<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.180> edge<00:00:23.330> of<00:00:23.360> it<00:00:23.570> was

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
the power plant I say the edge of it was

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.760 
the power plant I say the edge of it was
right<00:00:23.869> here<00:00:23.900> then<00:00:24.230> you<00:00:24.290> want<00:00:24.440> to<00:00:24.500> be<00:00:24.560> able<00:00:24.650> to

right<00:00:32.509> here<00:00:32.570> right<00:00:34.540> so<00:00:35.540> I<00:00:35.570> thought<00:00:35.780> I'd<00:00:35.960> get

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
right here right so I thought I'd get

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.840 
right here right so I thought I'd get
the<00:00:36.440> crates<00:00:36.770> on<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.010> hella<00:00:37.190> whenever<00:00:37.550> and

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
the crates on the hella whenever and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.980 
the crates on the hella whenever and
then<00:00:37.940> you<00:00:38.030> got<00:00:38.180> to<00:00:38.210> make<00:00:38.360> a<00:00:38.420> bunch<00:00:38.630> of<00:00:38.720> cleaning

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
then you got to make a bunch of cleaning

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.500 
then you got to make a bunch of cleaning
fighters<00:00:39.350> she's<00:00:39.890> a<00:00:40.010> tree<00:00:40.280> I<00:00:40.670> should<00:00:41.240> be<00:00:41.329> making

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
fighters she's a tree I should be making

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.540 
fighters she's a tree I should be making
this<00:00:41.750> I'm<00:00:41.960> just<00:00:42.110> kind<00:00:42.290> of<00:00:42.320> like<00:00:42.380> collagen<00:00:42.829> and

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
this I'm just kind of like collagen and

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.979 
this I'm just kind of like collagen and
then<00:00:43.760> usually<00:00:44.210> I<00:00:44.239> make<00:00:44.420> another<00:00:44.690> minor

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
then usually I make another minor

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.820 
then usually I make another minor
because<00:00:45.290> like<00:00:45.650> it's<00:00:45.829> pointless<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.700> make<00:00:47.000> arms

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
because like it's pointless to make arms

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.080 
because like it's pointless to make arms
