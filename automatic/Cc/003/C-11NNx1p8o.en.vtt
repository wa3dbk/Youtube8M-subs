 detection of all the files that are 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.390
 find in the room it took us 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.940
 rights administrators so I'm going 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.940
 cochet here to these for all 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.370
 current elements and continue and that's it 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.910
 we start a blank and the file 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.120
 temporary 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.269

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:56.269
 of that we're waiting for the end ok he's getting 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.120
 may only some files can 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.459
 to be deleted because they are in 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.480
 course of use so I'm going to pick 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.910
 green these have ignored and they are going 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:16.040
 sign here we are so I'm not so 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:18.859
 practically that to jig to arrive is 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.440
 an egg and so have me if we want 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:24.790
 continue one can try in varin 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:32.030

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:38.890
 we can not delete who he 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.890
 do not want so I'll try this 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.150
 what really remains is files 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.430
 who are when they are going 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.230
 of use therefore can not be 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.270
 deleted but that was all for 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.110
