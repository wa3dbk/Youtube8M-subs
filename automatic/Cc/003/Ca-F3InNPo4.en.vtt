00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
actually get some photo detail of them

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:43.740 
actually get some photo detail of them
hopefully<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.899> gonna<00:01:31.110> pick<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.470> some<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.740> them

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.720 

believe<00:01:44.440> me<00:01:44.560> in<00:01:44.680> real<00:01:44.860> life<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:45.250> can<00:01:45.400> actually

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
believe me in real life you can actually

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.150 
believe me in real life you can actually
read<00:01:45.970> accelerate<00:01:46.540> what<00:01:46.720> they<00:01:46.930> are<00:01:47.160> because

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
read accelerate what they are because

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.220 
read accelerate what they are because
there's<00:01:48.400> detail<00:01:49.060> enough<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.630> can't<00:01:49.840> see

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
there's detail enough that you can't see

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.950 
there's detail enough that you can't see
them<00:01:53.700> see<00:01:54.700> but<00:01:54.850> some<00:01:55.060> of<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.270> card<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.840> was

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
them see but some of the card it was

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.340 
them see but some of the card it was
actually<00:01:56.350> never<00:01:56.560> used<00:01:56.650> in<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.250> show<00:01:57.970> so<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
actually never used in the show so it

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.960 
actually never used in the show so it
makes<00:01:59.560> me<00:01:59.710> wonder<00:01:59.860> what<00:02:00.100> they<00:02:00.460> are

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
makes me wonder what they are

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.870 
makes me wonder what they are
oh<00:02:04.170> well<00:02:05.170> cut<00:02:05.620> doesn't<00:02:06.220> really<00:02:06.370> want<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:06.670> focus

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
oh well cut doesn't really want to focus

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.340 
oh well cut doesn't really want to focus
on<00:02:07.180> it<00:02:07.300> anyway<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:09.660> none<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.899> less<00:02:11.110> is

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
on it anyway but none of the less is

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.330 
on it anyway but none of the less is
really<00:02:11.410> beautiful

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
really beautiful

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.590 
really beautiful
so<00:02:13.090> diecast<00:02:13.600> content<00:02:14.580> its<00:02:15.580> basic<00:02:16.120> got<00:02:16.390> none

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
so diecast content its basic got none

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.120 
so diecast content its basic got none
the<00:02:17.470> buckle<00:02:17.910> remains<00:02:18.910> here<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:20.130> me

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
the buckle remains here and the to me

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.870 
the buckle remains here and the to me
card<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.700> still<00:02:22.000> inside<00:02:22.420> there<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.400> those<00:02:24.700> are

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
card is still inside there so those are

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.910 
card is still inside there so those are
the<00:02:24.940> only<00:02:24.970> die-cut<00:02:25.570> titles<00:02:26.320> content<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.790> it

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
the only die-cut titles content but it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.320 
the only die-cut titles content but it
still<00:02:29.920> feel<00:02:30.700> as<00:02:30.910> heavy<00:02:31.150> as<00:02:31.390> before<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:33.330> yeah

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
still feel as heavy as before and yeah

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.740 
still feel as heavy as before and yeah
it's<00:02:35.110> wait<00:02:35.350> years<00:02:35.590> before<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:37.240> doesn't<00:02:37.570> feel

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
it's wait years before it doesn't feel

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.660 
it's wait years before it doesn't feel
like<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.080> because<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.710> the<00:02:38.890> like<00:02:39.070> die-cuts

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
like that because of the like die-cuts

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.800 
like that because of the like die-cuts
become<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.000> real<00:02:40.270> light<00:02:40.570> figure<00:02:42.480> invest<00:02:43.480> I

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
become a real light figure invest I

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.980 
become a real light figure invest I
think<00:02:44.380> is<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.770> will<00:02:44.980> be<00:02:45.160> heavier<00:02:45.550> because

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
think is that it will be heavier because

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.710 
think is that it will be heavier because
although<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.560> King<00:02:48.130> router<00:02:48.400> now<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:49.000> not

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
although the the King router now is not

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.110 
although the the King router now is not
actually<00:02:50.080> diecast<00:02:50.500> at<00:02:50.680> all<00:02:50.920> it's<00:02:51.610> also<00:02:51.820> got<00:02:52.090> a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
actually diecast at all it's also got a

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.270 
actually diecast at all it's also got a
lot<00:02:52.360> more<00:02:52.420> plastic<00:02:53.080> on<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.800> has<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:54.040> become

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
lot more plastic on it so has it become

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.140 
lot more plastic on it so has it become
even<00:02:54.670> heavier<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:56.250> they<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.310> can't<00:02:57.730> really

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
even heavier and they it can't really

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.470 
even heavier and they it can't really
hold<00:02:58.570> it<00:02:58.840> properly<00:02:59.020> because<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.680> the<00:03:00.480> the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
hold it properly because of the the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.530 
hold it properly because of the the
joint<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.980> elbow<00:03:03.010> joint<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.640> quite<00:03:04.000> weak<00:03:04.239> on

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
joint the elbow joint is quite weak on

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.120 
joint the elbow joint is quite weak on
the<00:03:04.810> si<00:03:05.050> si<00:03:05.260> figure<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.530> does<00:03:08.739> actually

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
the si si figure but it does actually

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.890 
the si si figure but it does actually
holds<00:03:12.130> pretty<00:03:12.250> well<00:03:12.400> in<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:13.000> when<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.540> can

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
holds pretty well in it when you can

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.940 
holds pretty well in it when you can
kill<00:03:14.200> him<00:03:14.350> into<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.709> pose<00:03:19.170> by<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.230> way<00:03:20.440> there<00:03:20.680> is

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
kill him into a pose by the way there is

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.990 
kill him into a pose by the way there is
only<00:03:21.940> one<00:03:22.269> gimmick<00:03:22.660> left<00:03:22.959> now<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:24.820> is

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
only one gimmick left now and that is

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.790 
only one gimmick left now and that is
that<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.540> king<00:03:25.720> router<00:03:25.959> can<00:03:26.350> actually<00:03:26.709> be

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
that the king router can actually be

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.840 
that the king router can actually be
mounted<00:03:27.280> onto<00:03:27.519> his<00:03:28.000> back<00:03:28.709> with<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.739> peg<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.730> you

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
mounted onto his back with a peg so you

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.650 
mounted onto his back with a peg so you
steal<00:03:34.150> money<00:03:34.300> on<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.660> on<00:03:34.900> his<00:03:35.080> back<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:36.660> I

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
steal money on the on his back and I

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.440 
steal money on the on his back and I
think<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:38.680> didn't<00:03:39.489> see<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:40.060> in<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.140> show<00:03:41.350> but

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
think you didn't see it in the show but

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.479 
think you didn't see it in the show but
according<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.720> came<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.950> think<00:03:45.160> some<00:03:45.370> of

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
according to it came and I think some of

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.449 
according to it came and I think some of
the<00:03:45.670> footage<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:47.769> can<00:03:48.100> actually<00:03:48.760> give<00:03:49.000> him

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
the footage you can actually give him

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.150 
the footage you can actually give him
one<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.489> his<00:03:51.819> car<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.300> vodka<00:03:52.930> at<00:03:53.140> hat<00:03:53.380> is<00:03:53.680> coal

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
one of his car that vodka at hat is coal

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.949 
one of his car that vodka at hat is coal
actually<00:03:57.160> we<00:03:57.280> require<00:03:57.550> him<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:57.910> use<00:03:58.390> both<00:03:58.690> so

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
actually we require him to use both so

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.830 
actually we require him to use both so
at<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.200> same<00:03:59.350> time<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.150> course<00:04:01.330> again<00:04:01.600> swap

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
at the same time so of course again swap

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.870 
at the same time so of course again swap
out<00:04:02.080> is<00:04:02.319> a<00:04:02.350> left-handed<00:04:03.069> shake<00:04:03.459> so<00:04:03.640> they<00:04:03.730> get

out is a left-handed shake so they get

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.960 
out is a left-handed shake so they get

pulsating pattern for instill courage is

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.219 
pulsating pattern for instill courage is

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
finding say where to capture it it's

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.490 
finding say where to capture it it's
extremely<00:04:50.830> annoying<00:04:51.040> with<00:04:51.280> this<00:04:51.400> camera<00:04:52.500> and

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
extremely annoying with this camera and

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.159 
extremely annoying with this camera and
now<00:04:53.889> the<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:56.190> absorber<00:04:57.190> is<00:04:57.310> now<00:04:57.490> using<00:04:58.169> the

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
now the the absorber is now using the

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.409 
now the the absorber is now using the
king<00:04:59.410> plate<00:05:00.010> on<00:05:00.250> this<00:05:00.370> on<00:05:00.669> the<00:05:01.060> surface

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
king plate on this on the surface

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.219 
king plate on this on the surface
instead<00:05:01.690> of<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.320> jack<00:05:02.560> plate<00:05:03.870> again<00:05:04.870> very

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
instead of the jack plate again very

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.560 
instead of the jack plate again very
nicely<00:05:05.500> sculpted<00:05:05.800> on<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:06.880> front<00:05:07.120> and<00:05:07.300> on<00:05:07.510> the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
nicely sculpted on the front and on the

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.150 
nicely sculpted on the front and on the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
back and the King rouser itself of

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.130 
back and the King rouser itself of
course<00:05:12.910> is<00:05:13.120> really<00:05:13.510> detail<00:05:15.150> because<00:05:16.150> this<00:05:16.870> one

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
course is really detail because this one

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.380 
course is really detail because this one
is<00:05:17.610> mostly<00:05:18.610> plastic<00:05:19.860> so<00:05:20.860> almost<00:05:21.280> a<00:05:21.490> whole<00:05:21.760> all

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
is mostly plastic so almost a whole all

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.570 
is mostly plastic so almost a whole all
the<00:05:22.450> armor<00:05:23.020> pieces<00:05:23.169> are<00:05:23.560> actually<00:05:24.010> painted<00:05:24.370> in

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
the armor pieces are actually painted in

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.300 
the armor pieces are actually painted in
so<00:05:25.479> I<00:05:25.510> think<00:05:25.660> that<00:05:26.020> you<00:05:26.169> end<00:05:26.380> up<00:05:26.530> making<00:05:26.740> even

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
so I think that you end up making even

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.080 
so I think that you end up making even
more<00:05:27.550> detail<00:05:28.030> than<00:05:28.450> a<00:05:29.820> standard<00:05:30.820> plate

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
more detail than a standard plate

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.810 
more detail than a standard plate
version<00:05:31.690> I<00:05:31.870> think<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.590> only<00:05:35.580> complaint<00:05:36.580> I

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
version I think the only complaint I

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.250 
version I think the only complaint I
have<00:05:37.120> against<00:05:37.740> si<00:05:38.740> si<00:05:39.660> version<00:05:40.660> of<00:05:40.810> off<00:05:41.229> the
