00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.160
 the specialty of sports coach 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.960
 is to standardize the level of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.849
 each soldier it also consists of 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.380
 perfect each staff when we 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.480
 has reached this basic level so we 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.369
 in fact draws the best coach 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.470
 sportsman is first of all a pedagogue and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.929
 he is then an athlete and coach 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.180
 sportsman must be multidisciplinary 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.010
 much more than specialist I practice 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.870
 a sport with three professionals the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.150

 track in the summer it can lead me to perform 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.850
 10 to 11 weekly workout I 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.960
 I was already training a lot before 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.640
 get into the army ben the taste of 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.130
 the effort I had already I brought to the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.570
 she retransmits every day because 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.070
 anyway it's one of the nerves 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.330
 of our profession when we have 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.890
 thirty seven pounds on the back and we 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.480
 walk 10 hours on patrol in 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.540
 afghanistan but the taste of the effort he 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.070
 better be educated to be 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.140
 fighters foremost and coaches 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.760
 sportsmen after the military there is a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.110
 great part of adaptation and that's 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.759
 true when we get to the job we 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.440
 can see it quickly we sent for 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.490
 our first mission maybe as 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.290
 sports coach 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.370
 and then my second mission ambages them 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.050
 made as a bodyguard and 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.010
 when one keeps them from the body is there 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.050
 I can tell you that we are widely 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.610
 fighters first and foremost it is important 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.110
 for a soldier to leave they 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.659
 train they train here all 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.400
 the year he has ants in the legs 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.229
 and he wants to go there he wants 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.710
 to leave and show to show this 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.560
 he knows how to do 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.700
 the risk we all have we all have one 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.920
 little bit in the corner of our head 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.960
 but hey, it's an integral part 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.700
 of the craft if the enemy is clearly 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.080
 identified I will not hesitate because I 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.470
 train for that and it's my job to 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.659
 seven cases my job the sports coach 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.580
 and is multicard makes pass enormously 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.350
 test to these soldiers it dispenses 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.690
 internships for children 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.729
 he's doing sports for families of 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.110
 military it is impossible to coach 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.820
 civilians like 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.350
 military people there are values 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.000
 we have in the army 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.590
 rigor cohesion and others 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.390
 values ​​that are clearly distinct 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.770
 more diluted in the civil we can be 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.330
 brought to pass state patents in 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.950
 at the same time as we do our job 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.150
 that's why sports coach 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.440
 still offers some panel of 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.330
 in the eure in terms of re de 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.450
 reconversion or even evolution of 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.740
 career I actually aspire to 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.240
 educate our future coaches 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.750
 at the National Sports Center 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.210
 of the defense 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.320
 the coaching specialty 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.000
 really gives the feeling of being 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.410
 to be helpful and then to teach 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.580
 useful things to people because the 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.920
 guys who are not physical who can 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.850
 not contribute to their mission 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.870
 the chief sergeant mayor of guise is 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.530
 someone who is good and in his 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.530
 resentment looks good
