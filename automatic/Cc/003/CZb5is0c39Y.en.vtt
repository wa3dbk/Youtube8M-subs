this<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.030> also<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.600> your<00:00:45.839> alley<00:00:46.129> there's<00:00:47.129> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
this is also up your alley there's a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.329 
this is also up your alley there's a
theory<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.119> the<00:00:48.780> movie<00:00:49.170> Pacific<00:00:49.799> Rim<00:00:49.979> comes

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
theory that the movie Pacific Rim comes

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.869 
theory that the movie Pacific Rim comes
from<00:00:51.080> monsterpocalypse<00:00:52.080> a<00:00:52.640> miniatures<00:00:53.640> game

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
from monsterpocalypse a miniatures game

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.149 
from monsterpocalypse a miniatures game
that<00:00:54.210> was<00:00:54.360> opted<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:55.080> a<00:00:55.140> movie<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.830> kind<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
that was opted for a movie and kind of

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.719 
that was opted for a movie and kind of
went<00:00:56.309> through<00:00:56.369> a<00:00:56.580> developmental<00:00:57.510> process<00:00:58.049> and

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
went through a developmental process and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.969 
went through a developmental process and
basically<00:00:59.729> the<00:01:00.239> game<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.570> about<00:01:00.979> giant

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
basically the game is about giant

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.719 
basically the game is about giant
fighting<00:01:02.220> monsters<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.199> other<00:01:04.430> robots<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
fighting monsters and other robots and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.330 
fighting monsters and other robots and
stuff<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.230> there's<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> theory<00:01:08.250> on

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
stuff like that so there's a theory on

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.550 
stuff like that so there's a theory on
that<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.780> think<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.080> been<00:01:10.200> confirmed

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
that I don't think it's been confirmed

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
that I don't think it's been confirmed
or<00:01:10.800> anything<00:01:10.980> like<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.660> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
or anything like that is that if you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.270 
or anything like that is that if you
like<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> movie<00:01:13.440> how<00:01:13.590> boy<00:01:13.800> you<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.160> the
