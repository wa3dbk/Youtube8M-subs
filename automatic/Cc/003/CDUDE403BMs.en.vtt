00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.049
 what's up, youtube, how are you guys? 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.660
 I hope you are very very well I bring you 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.300
 today the review of a super mode 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.009
 super epic and from super things 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.380
 advanced that I believe are made 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.029
 here in minecraft and in mods because the 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.039
 I truly believe that this already generates a 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.830
 very very important change and very 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.869
 amazing in line craft I bring you the 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.250
 nautilus mode some will know it 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.460
 because they may have seen it 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.530
 in other reviews of version 0.10 as 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.670
 or something like that because there is old or what 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.309
 better also have seen it online 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.750
 pc clap but good they ask for 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.220
 why do not I go into why I did not go into a 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.710
 world since I started recording is for 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.040
 that's because since we entered the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.580
 you can already see the change of the 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.860
 map so well let's go in okay 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.320
 bars prepare look nothing else these 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.369
 guys like martÃ­nez certain books from 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.040
 done when I created the map it appeared like 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.900
 down the earth and I think that also if 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.790
 believe it in survival appears below 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.409
 from the earth which is something strange and 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.600
 it's going to be half fire because you're going to 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.429
 can quell then good you're going to 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.159
 die and already take after you're fine what 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.799
 good 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.469
 but it is good to know how you see 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.710
 basically what they mean out then not 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.810
 cubes as you can see is super father 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.709
 unfortunately right now it is in a phase 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.350
 very very very very alpha I do not know if it's alpha 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.630
 beta or what alpha gamma beta type I do not know 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.539
 what Greek letter is but the joke is 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.099
 which is very early and right now 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.250
 just have certain changes what 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:45.469
 basic and what is let's say what 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.000
 principal or the first thing we see when 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.390
 we create a map like the mountains 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.340
 the pastures the earth the snow and the gravel 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.009
 and all that eating, guys, as you see 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.209
 as they see twice I said it works 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.789
 pretty good indeed here in the 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.200
 caves looks very weird looks super epic 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.780
 although good as I say it has certain 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.360
 books and then waited for it to go well 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.129
 soon and in fact some things not so 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.150
 They do not look good because I tell them or 

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:12.680
 missing a bit of coding but 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.299
 apart I think it is for the same reason that 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.730
 the block launcher still does not support 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.200
 this some things is to say that what 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.000
 better when the lawndale look of this to 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.010
 all to give is to say already for good to know or 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.930
 point already good for steel point 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.700
 we will be able to see all the 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.250
 blocks well and not just the grass and 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.920
 this above what else is it and the guys 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.079
 good or here I have gravel snow 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.760
 and the earth and in fact it also appears 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.069
 the grass is about these four things that 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.170
 appear there appear in this way as 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.599
 that have appeared in the image here 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.480
 appears all the full picture well of the del 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.720
 block and they are blocks that does not support 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.129
 to be seen in that effect in 3-d and 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.569
 Well, as you can see, it's pretty good 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.700
 guys the truth is that I like 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.129
 quite you can see there that they are 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.019
 the the four blocks that we can 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.400
 find then are the main ones what 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.440
 that we are in the biomes 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.989
 obviously good I do not know if these 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.000
 work, I think I do not compose these 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.470
 they still do not have a support but they 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.629
 I say guys it's a matter of waiting a bit 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.090
 of salt to 0.11 well the block launcher 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.470
 well also in its complete form because 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.299
 I tell you this is still a test 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.879
 from wroclaw ntx which already supports some 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.220
 mods and nothing guys here I leave them the 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.200
 true a very very father but good of 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.569
 but see in fact when we walk already 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.010
 no longer could not do not make us the car yum 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.900
 sharon that minecraft and we have the 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.860
 characteristic that we keep moving forward 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.500
 Well, it jumps alone 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.700
 but here with these blocks we are missing 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.710
 solid then we have to jump 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.720
 we 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.420
 when when we want to climb the mountain 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.980
 that is set but you can also see 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.260
 that grass blocks no longer have the 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.840
 land down here or my land in 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.390
 this part below or well up 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.730
 be and pasture but going down should not 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.140
 have but good is pretty good and 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.120
 well here I show you that the car yum 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.250
 works well with normal blocks 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.020
 obviously but then in these blocks there 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.810
 I know why it does not work I do not know if it's 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.120
 part of the mod or if it's an error but 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.280
 Well, I'll tell you, we'll see, I'll leave you 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.960
 in the description the download of the mod 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.940
 if you want to install it does not require 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.310
 texture does not require anything simply a 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.960
 js put it and to make it work 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.430
 they have to create obviously a new 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.650
 world for me I think if it's a world already 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.720
 created will not work so 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.150
 nothing guys I love you so much and see you 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.150
 in a next video bye bye 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.319
 two
