00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.549
 hello and welcome we had them 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.920
 discovered to music but this 2013 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.610
 whose 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.260
 the jtm custom offs is so a whole 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.480
 small 1 watt amp based so there is 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.510
 one of his 83 years preamplification 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.490
 a cc 81.2 in power so we can 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.040
 play in one watt and you'll see that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.780
 a watt is already not bad and in addition we 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.010
 behind I will show you everything to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.120
 time a little push button that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.040
 allows to go into 0.1 watt and then there 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.470
 you can squarely played in your 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.269
 living room while the children are watching 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.000
 TV is you who would be embarrassed 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.670
 not and you will see that despite everything 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.720
 we get to have a super are even at 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.580
 very small volumes 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.699
 so the look is fabulous so it's 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.440
 to draw old series jtm we have a 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.500
 small metal plate 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.520
 here are tweeds 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.560
 very very very pretty a vinyl very well 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 to finally ask really stopped it's nickel 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.740
 and so we have a small cabinet with a 10 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.460
 inch selections inside and here 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.060
 we have a tone a volume is no 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.690
 stand by 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.610
 it's direct, it's going on and we're going 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.229
 listen to what it already gives in his 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.820
 clear 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.820
 so there we are in a box 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.400
 and even 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.510
 you saw that we are already in the process of 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.200
 gently puncture so we push it 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.200
 still a little bit 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.870
 and 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.340
 I spent on the micro grams and then 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.260
 we're going to see the town up to 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.670
 present was at zero there was already at 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.670
 zero is quite exploitable 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.840
 here it is about half 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.900
 now he is thoroughly 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.650
 I pass on the microphone acute it again 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.650
 more talking 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.780
 so that this tone actually it is 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.640
 really to consider as a way to 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.620
 adapt it to the guitar or if you 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.330
 put an effect pedal to adjust the 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.670
 rendering of the pedal to the amp since 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.760
 it allows a lot of variation then 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.250
 we will still push the volume and then 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.500
 we'll see while I'm going to play a 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.349
 little and then then I'll add a 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.300
 distortion pedal over there you go 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.300
 see that he supports them very well 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.560
 but 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.610
 and 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.610
 the caps 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.470
 but 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.880
 so obviously the most 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.740
 extraordinary on this amp is that 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.690
 already the area was boxed and we're going 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.650
 divide the power by 10 then in 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.650
 watts that gives that 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:24.580
 and I push the little button behind I 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.580
 find me in 0.1 watt and it gives that 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.200
 m 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.250
 2 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:30.229
 that's it if you want grays but that 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.879
 you are at home and you do not 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:34.669
 can not make noise to your 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:37.309
 neighbors and ben voila the perfect amp there 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.349
 is beautiful so already we will not ask you 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:43.129
 to remove it from the salon because some 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:46.249
 it will perfectly decorate your 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:48.199
 piece and in addition he has the power 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:51.649
 adequate to allow you to 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:54.289
 to send the ball and not to interfere 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:56.629
 around you here is a great little 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.549
 amp really with a very very beautiful 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:59.799
 his I think I'm going to take him in 

00:06:58.549 --> 00:07:03.939
 vacation 

00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:03.939
 on that I greet you well
