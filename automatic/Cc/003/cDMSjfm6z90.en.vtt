00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.330
 I am the running I live in 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.930
 salzburg and study right now and 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.940
 winter will be 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.740
 I like to drive vintage cars 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.160
 Youngtimer I was from time to time 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.590
 nice weather and was very happy 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.720
 classic car rallies as often as it gets 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.310
 bring me a lot of fun what I do 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.739
 especially appreciate or at a camera 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.899
 I need a good zoom with it 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.940
 objects can pick themselves nearer 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.180
 I mainly photograph vintage cars 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.800
 otherwise very happy vacation where is 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.980
 then often no typical holiday pictures 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.510
 But I try the pictures 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.239
 to shoot so that it does not look 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.710
 like I'm on vacation what I am 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.030
 Photobooks are always glad to do that 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.769
 I take some nice pictures of you 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.789
 put together like in the past the photo 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:01.010
 old now digital as photo books as 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.629
 the very happy photo exhibitions there 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.790
 always discover new things 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.120
 be it new photographers always not before 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.550
 knew or new working techniques all 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.740
 photography especially appeals to me 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.510
 beauty in the picture that's all possible 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.690
 situations can be recorded 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.640
 for the eternity and also the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.840
 beauty of things made visible 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.520
 maybe they'll be over otherwise 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.900
 would not see if you are not in the picture 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.900
 would have been detained 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.020
 My last race was the Gaisberg 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.480
 race and that's all about 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.960
 From Salzburg I always have many 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.970
 Pictures taken because there are the whole 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.590
 oldtimerclubs put down their cars and 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.190
 then there are many motives one 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.190
 can hold 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.790
 we are here on monday 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.740
 already in Upper Austria and me 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.810
 find it one of the most beautiful spots in 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.620
 near salzburg, first, the mountains 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.510
 the directly on the lake are the great clear 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.160
 water here for swimming and you can 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.580
 Just relax here because 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.680
 it is very quiet and very nice 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.090
 if it fits, then I often go 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.630
 the uni still here and enjoy the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.630
 last sunbeams
