00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello dear, today it's time 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.590
 again about what you get from the c4 resp 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.110
 can do anything with such a tuber 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.990
 and I have a t 4 today 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.760
 mascarpone for you and how to get it 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:29.279
 I want to prepare that for you now 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:34.760
 then show it to the mascarpone as well 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.000
 I'll have mascarpone here 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.340
 recognized 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.940
 milk cream and t4 you look beautiful 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.000
 creamy that has become that must now 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.910
 first of all, through a sieve completely 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.379
 normal as the preparation goes 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.980
 here too is very important too 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.409
 Everything from plastic nothing 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.810
 use another 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.810
 and then you give it by a sieve 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.110
 so that the g4 culture again 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.110
 can be fished out 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.880
 so i have the time now 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:02:18.550
 gathered for you because that's one 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:02:22.780
 boring story of this cream 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.850
 mascarpone is quite delicious you can 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.770
 do everything possible with it for example 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.940
 tiramisu and how that works 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.100
 we show you in one of the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.140
 In any case , the next videos must 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.510
 this mass now when sieved through 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:47.620
 then the mascarpone is not yet 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:56.950
 finished but it is still a 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:59.739
 a little further and that is what we have now 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.360
 Here is a creamy creamy mass 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:06.700
 Here I have the fe for culture that must 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.600
 to start with milk again 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:14.680
 so she does not break and for the 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.489
 mascarpone you take a bigger one now 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.920
 sie and that too can be grosser that 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.280
 does not matter 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:28.720
 I now have a cotton cloth here the 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:33.940
 is a cotton this will be wonderful 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.540
 suitable and there you are now 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.540
 everything in 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:50.989
 and let it covered again good for 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.580
 You can stand one day now 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.099
 but you should do it in the fridge 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.099
 even that means I always do it 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.140
 plate and over it with that too 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.409
 really to be and nothing then 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.709
 come in and that's important and so 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:13.760
 put that in the fridge and let it go 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:16.130
 for twelve hours if it still is 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.160
 not quite fixed is 24 hours 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.900
 and then the mascarpone is done that way 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.220
 as I showed you at the beginning 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:30.280
 Of course I forgot that but I 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:33.949
 forget that almost every time you have to 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:39.580
 about 1 teaspoon salt to it 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:39.580
 give mascarpone that's important 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.159
 Now we do not need plastic 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.009
 spoon more 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:52.650
 but I still have to lie here 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.409
 stir the salt that is also 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.919
 in the whole mascarpone mass 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:03.000
 is located and then cover again and 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:06.919
 leave it for about twelve to 24 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.960
 Hours are best in the refrigerator 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.979
 yes thanks again for seeing me 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.610
 hope you liked the video 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:22.289
 we will do a lot more soon 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:24.750
 Videos with and around the g4 because I think 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.669
 that pine is such a great drink 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.590
 that just has to be lashed forward 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:33.330
 so you can have so many great 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:36.330
 do things with it and let yourself go 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.129
 surprise what else is coming and 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.990
