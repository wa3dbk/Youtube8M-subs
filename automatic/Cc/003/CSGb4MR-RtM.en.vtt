00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.739
 perhaps 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:11.269
 another recent tour 8 change 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.089
 finally it was a concern 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.089
 I do not have study 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.019
 fifteen minutes after study pass 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.019
 with 30 minutes of this total 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.140
 the suspect has not yet been determined p / op / p 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.469
 the European Commission and the Council of Ministers after questioning 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.870
 up to where his first years of imprisonment for double homicide qualified 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.949
 according to company technicians 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.260
 the 4 to 0 cruise 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.100
 I do not agree with you 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.510
 all in the title 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.790
 the problem is that i will have my orkut and in msn windowslive and bing 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 but we've lived to keep on top of the worst 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.400
 dr 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.930
 the last place 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.270
 The sand neither do I intend 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.200
 I left it to my profile 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.890
 with the collaboration of the goalkeeper 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.400
 with him 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.400
 or tried to flee but was disarmed 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.240
 of g1 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.659
 but people really do not know if this is a true majority of the time 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:26.980
 or more per month 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.980
 for something so positive 2009 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.719
 igor statements we need lots of vehicles 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.990
 I'm going to buy 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.170
 brunetta 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.290
 I take care 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.350
 bodily injury 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.250
 to attack 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.240
 at the end of the season 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.290
 we have to take it easy
