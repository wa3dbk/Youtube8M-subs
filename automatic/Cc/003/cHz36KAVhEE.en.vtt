the draft coming in and it's also got an
interior<00:01:42.210> buffle<00:01:42.630> which<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:43.770> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
interior buffle which is that one that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.420 
interior buffle which is that one that
stops<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> heat<00:01:44.880> getting<00:01:45.119> out<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:46.430> these

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
stops the heat getting out as these

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.090 
stops the heat getting out as these
little<00:01:47.729> ways<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.119> which<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.659> stitched<00:01:49.140> all

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
little ways here which is stitched all

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.770 
little ways here which is stitched all
the<00:01:50.280> way<00:01:50.369> throughout<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.880> bag<00:01:51.060> what<00:01:51.630> that

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the way throughout the bag what that

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.620 
the way throughout the bag what that
enables<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.439> do<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.189> segment<00:01:54.030> stays

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
enables it to do is the segment stays

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.230 
enables it to do is the segment stays
within<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.229> sticks<00:01:56.189> layer<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.969> doesn't

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
within that sticks layer it doesn't

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.240 
within that sticks layer it doesn't
always<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> filling<00:01:58.740> inside<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
always like the filling inside it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.340 
always like the filling inside it
doesn't<00:01:59.490> trouble<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.060> down<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.360> bag<00:02:00.540> so

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
doesn't trouble up and down the bag so

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.950 
doesn't trouble up and down the bag so
it<00:02:01.500> keeps<00:02:01.770> obviously<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> way<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.960> insulated

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
it keeps obviously the way is insulated

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.550 
it keeps obviously the way is insulated
all<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> time<00:02:05.150> on<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.210> retention<00:02:06.659> side<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
all the time on the retention side of it

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.460 
all the time on the retention side of it
so<00:02:08.100> obviously<00:02:08.340> got<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.490> top<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.940> bottom<00:02:09.470> two

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
so obviously got the top and bottom two

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.110 
so obviously got the top and bottom two
more<00:02:10.619> runs<00:02:10.800> around<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.190> natural<00:02:11.730> bed<00:02:11.880> chair

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
more runs around the natural bed chair

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.809 
more runs around the natural bed chair
itself<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.720> elasticated<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:14.340> that

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
itself this is elasticated so that

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.640 
itself this is elasticated so that
basically<00:02:15.000> stops<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.660> big<00:02:15.840> through<00:02:16.110> from

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
basically stops that big through from

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.680 
basically stops that big through from
underneath<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:18.030> know<00:02:18.120> underneath<00:02:18.360> and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
underneath you know underneath and

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.240 
underneath you know underneath and
touching<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.110> floor<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.500> soaking<00:02:19.920> water<00:02:20.040> off

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
touching the floor and soaking water off

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.930 
touching the floor and soaking water off
like<00:02:20.400> such<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.610> till<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.060> keeps<00:02:21.239> nice<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.690> soft

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
like such a till it keeps nice and soft

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.260 
like such a till it keeps nice and soft
it's<00:02:23.940> also<00:02:24.090> got<00:02:25.459> retention<00:02:26.459> clips<00:02:26.730> so

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
it's also got retention clips so

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.059 
it's also got retention clips so
whatever<00:02:27.989> side<00:02:28.260> you're<00:02:28.500> not<00:02:28.620> getting<00:02:28.920> out<00:02:29.040> of

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
whatever side you're not getting out of

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.460 
whatever side you're not getting out of
you<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.090> flip<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.720> stops<00:02:30.959> as<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.290> from

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
you can flip it and it stops as it from

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.110 
you can flip it and it stops as it from
