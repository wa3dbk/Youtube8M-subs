00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
can design carpet a realistic carpet

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.410 
can design carpet a realistic carpet
with<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.820> fur<00:00:09.030> material<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.719> 3ds<00:00:10.019> max<00:00:10.969> so<00:00:11.969> I

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
with the fur material in 3ds max so I

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.169 
with the fur material in 3ds max so I
hope<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.990> have<00:00:13.019> watched<00:00:13.380> all<00:00:13.710> my<00:00:13.740> previous

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
previous tutorial i have shown you how

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.640 
previous tutorial i have shown you how
you<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.189> apply<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.550> material<00:00:26.840> by<00:00:27.840> clicking

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
you can apply the material by clicking

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.650 
you can apply the material by clicking
on<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> M<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.269> material

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
on the M you can see that the material

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.580 
on the M you can see that the material
is<00:00:30.750> already<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.230> already<00:00:31.880> created<00:00:33.020> now<00:00:34.020> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
is already have already created now and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220 
is already have already created now and
in<00:00:34.980> my<00:00:35.010> previous<00:00:35.399> tutorial<00:00:35.910> i<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.390> i<00:00:36.780> haven't

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
in my previous tutorial i have i haven't

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.630 
in my previous tutorial i have i haven't
mentioned<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.860> need<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.219> apply<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
mentioned that you need to apply the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.430 
mentioned that you need to apply the
material<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.600> beginners<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
material so for the beginners it is a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.910 
material so for the beginners it is a
little<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:41.010> difficult<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:42.180> maybe<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.920> assume

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
little bit difficult so maybe I assume

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.709 
little bit difficult so maybe I assume
that<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.700> people<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.840> beginners<00:00:46.200> might<00:00:46.800> have

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
that the people the beginners might have

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.779 
that the people the beginners might have
might<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.050> applied<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:50.039> material<00:00:50.520> to

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
might have it applied the material to

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.729 
might have it applied the material to
the<00:00:50.879> selection<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.510> they<00:00:51.660> might<00:00:51.809> have<00:00:51.930> done

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the selection and they might have done

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.720 
the selection and they might have done
the<00:00:52.920> rendering<00:00:53.280> straightaway<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:55.710> people<00:00:56.670> who

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the rendering straightaway so people who

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.090 
the rendering straightaway so people who
have<00:00:56.910> already<00:00:57.120> applied<00:00:57.809> our<00:00:58.199> assigned<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
have already applied our assigned the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.660 
have already applied our assigned the
selection<00:00:59.640> they<00:01:00.420> need<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:01.340> they<00:01:02.340> need<00:01:02.520> not

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
selection they need not they need not

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.789 
selection they need not they need not
watch<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.239> tutorial<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.199> they<00:01:04.619> haven't

watch this tutorial and if they haven't
got<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> right<00:01:05.309> result<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.720> watch<00:01:07.200> this

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
got the right result you can watch this

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.130 
got the right result you can watch this
tutorial<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.100> complete<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> design<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.780> I

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
tutorial and complete the design so I

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620 
tutorial and complete the design so I
have<00:01:10.290> selected<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.630> assigning

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
have selected this here and assigning

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.690 
have selected this here and assigning
these<00:01:13.049> assigning<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> material<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
these assigning the material to the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.060 
these assigning the material to the
selection<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.330> let<00:01:15.990> me<00:01:16.080> close<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.500> over<00:01:16.830> here

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
selection and let me close it over here

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.670 
selection and let me close it over here
and<00:01:17.900> do<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> rendering

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
and do the rendering

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.160 
and do the rendering
now<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:21.740> can<00:01:21.979> see<00:01:22.479> you<00:01:23.479> doesn't<00:01:23.840> get<00:01:23.990> this

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
now you can see you doesn't get this

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.590 
now you can see you doesn't get this
creamy<00:01:24.829> patch<00:01:25.130> here<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:25.850> get<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.149> proper

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
creamy patch here and you get the proper

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
creamy patch here and you get the proper
material<00:01:27.580> render

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.220 

so<00:01:36.220> this<00:01:36.490> is<00:01:36.610> how<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:36.870> rendering<00:01:37.870> output

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
so this is how the rendering output

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.490 
so this is how the rendering output
should<00:01:38.380> be<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.790> hope<00:01:40.210> this<00:01:40.750> tutorial<00:01:40.870> is

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
should be and I hope this tutorial is

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.890 
should be and I hope this tutorial is
this<00:01:42.310> tutorial<00:01:42.730> series<00:01:42.940> going<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.390> help<00:01:43.540> help

know if you didn't know how to create

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.720 
know if you didn't know how to create
first<00:01:58.720> so<00:01:59.590> thank<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.160> so<00:02:00.310> much<00:02:00.460> for<00:02:00.640> watching

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
let me show you how the final output is

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.750 
let me show you how the final output is
going<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.650> be<00:02:02.740> even<00:02:02.830> though<00:02:03.100> I've<00:02:03.280> shown<00:02:03.520> my

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
going to be even though I've shown my

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.000 
going to be even though I've shown my
previous<00:02:04.210> tutorial<00:02:04.630> so<00:02:05.380> this<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:05.590> how<00:02:05.680> it's

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
previous tutorial so this is how it's

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.790 
previous tutorial so this is how it's
going<00:02:06.160> to<00:02:06.250> be<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.730> final<00:02:07.450> output<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.990> here

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
going to be in the final output and here
