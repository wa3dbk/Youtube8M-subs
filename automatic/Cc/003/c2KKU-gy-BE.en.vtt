00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
in trouble anyways destructible rocks

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.839 
in trouble anyways destructible rocks
and<00:00:28.230> getting<00:00:28.439> destroyed<00:00:28.830> over<00:00:29.130> here<00:00:29.340> i<00:00:29.550> am

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
and getting destroyed over here i am

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.250 
and getting destroyed over here i am
trying<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.240> move<00:00:30.449> out<00:00:30.599> trying<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> figure<00:00:31.140> out

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
trying to move out trying to figure out

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.080 
trying to move out trying to figure out
what<00:00:31.439> exactly<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.890> position<00:00:32.279> i<00:00:32.579> want<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> i

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
what exactly the position i want to i

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.180 
what exactly the position i want to i
want<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.899> i<00:00:34.020> move<00:00:34.290> these<00:00:34.469> units<00:00:34.950> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
want to do and i move these units and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.030 
want to do and i move these units and
out<00:00:35.670> over<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:36.210> not<00:00:36.930> quite<00:00:37.290> sure<00:00:37.320> why<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.980> I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
out over here not quite sure why and I

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.170 
out over here not quite sure why and I
think<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.399> was<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.059> think

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
think that was going to be I think

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.150 
think that was going to be I think
that's<00:00:39.450> my<00:00:39.570> problem<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:40.110> moved<00:00:40.649> these<00:00:40.770> units

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
that's my problem I moved these units

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.400 
that's my problem I moved these units
over<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.610> into<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.030> position<00:00:42.260> instead<00:00:43.260> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
over and into this position instead of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.650 
over and into this position instead of
leaving<00:00:43.620> them<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:45.000> choke<00:00:45.300> point<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
leaving them on on this choke point and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.020 
leaving them on on this choke point and
I<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:45.930> these<00:00:46.289> units<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.770> simply<00:00:47.219> walk<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.820> my

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
I think these units to simply walk up my

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.910 
I think these units to simply walk up my
ramp<00:00:48.300> oh<00:00:48.480> my<00:00:48.629> gosh<00:00:48.870> yeah<00:00:49.200> these<00:00:49.559> units<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
ramp oh my gosh yeah these units to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.619 
ramp oh my gosh yeah these units to
simply<00:00:50.250> walk<00:00:50.280> up<00:00:50.610> my<00:00:50.730> ramp<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.090> opposed<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
simply walk up my ramp as opposed to

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.510 
simply walk up my ramp as opposed to
using<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> real<00:00:52.500> choke<00:00:52.770> point<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> really

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
using the real choke point that I really

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.189 
using the real choke point that I really
have<00:00:53.670> designed<00:00:54.000> here<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.719> these<00:00:54.870> units

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
have designed here so all these units

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.840 
have designed here so all these units
just<00:00:55.289> walking<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.800> he<00:00:55.890> has<00:00:55.980> an<00:00:56.100> 80<00:00:56.250> /<00:00:56.489> 90<00:00:56.760> s

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
just walking in he has an 80 / 90 s

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.840 
just walking in he has an 80 / 90 s
sitting<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.090> my<00:00:57.149> 57<00:00:57.600> /<00:00:57.840> 74<00:00:58.500> trying<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.460> more

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
sitting on my 57 / 74 trying to get more

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.849 
sitting on my 57 / 74 trying to get more
these<00:01:00.030> robotics<00:01:00.449> facilities<00:01:00.870> since<00:01:01.469> he's<00:01:01.680> not

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
these robotics facilities since he's not

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.799 
these robotics facilities since he's not
attacking<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.520> don't<00:01:02.760> hear<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.570> base<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
attacking I don't hear that my base is

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.329 
attacking I don't hear that my base is
under<00:01:04.080> attack<00:01:04.229> until<00:01:04.619> he's<00:01:04.739> finally<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.220> my

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
under attack until he's finally in my

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.179 
under attack until he's finally in my
face<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.960> this<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.200> completely<00:01:07.590> devastates

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
face and this just completely devastates

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.310 
face and this just completely devastates
me<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:09.119> really<00:01:09.390> ready<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:09.869> this

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
me as I was not really ready for this

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.500 
me as I was not really ready for this
type<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> an<00:01:11.310> offensive<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.060> sitting<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.420> my

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
type of an offensive for sitting in my

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.870 
type of an offensive for sitting in my
basement<00:01:12.890> trying<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.040> use<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.280> colossi<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
basement trying to use this colossi to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.670 
basement trying to use this colossi to
try<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> take<00:01:15.299> down<00:01:15.330> some<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.720> these<00:01:15.900> stalkers

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
try to take down some of these stalkers

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.679 
try to take down some of these stalkers
but<00:01:16.979> that's<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.280> too<00:01:17.520> little<00:01:17.670> too<00:01:17.970> much<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
but that's just too little too much if I

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.730 
but that's just too little too much if I
left<00:01:18.869> these<00:01:19.049> units<00:01:19.409> sitting<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.650> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
left these units sitting in that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.440 
left these units sitting in that
position<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.369> think<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.970> would<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.210> been<00:01:21.330> able

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
position I think I would have been able

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.359 
position I think I would have been able
to<00:01:21.659> at<00:01:21.869> least<00:01:21.960> survival<00:01:22.560> much<00:01:22.770> much<00:01:23.009> longer

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
to at least survival much much longer

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.820 
to at least survival much much longer
and<00:01:23.670> yeah<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.780> leaving<00:01:25.080> my<00:01:25.170> units<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.680> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
and yeah just leaving my units out of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.770 
and yeah just leaving my units out of
position<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.700> guarding<00:01:27.090> my<00:01:27.180> front<00:01:27.450> door<00:01:27.600> that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
position not guarding my front door that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.060 
position not guarding my front door that
colossi<00:01:28.170> could<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.439> come<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.680> from<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> back

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
colossi could have come in from the back

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.680
