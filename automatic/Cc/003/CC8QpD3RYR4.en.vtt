from<00:00:41.110> the<00:00:41.290> shadows<00:00:41.620> we<00:00:42.460> want<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:42.730> make<00:00:42.850> sure

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
from the shadows we want to make sure

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.130 
from the shadows we want to make sure
that<00:00:43.150> players<00:00:43.269> were<00:00:43.540> able<00:00:43.720> to<00:00:43.780> work<00:00:43.930> together

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
that players were able to work together

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.110 
that players were able to work together
to<00:00:44.410> experience<00:00:44.800> that<00:00:45.160> as<00:00:45.280> well<00:00:45.519> and<00:00:46.059> that's

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
to experience that as well and that's

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.670 
to experience that as well and that's
why<00:00:46.360> we<00:00:46.390> arrived<00:00:46.809> pretty<00:00:47.140> quickly<00:00:47.409> at<00:00:47.650> the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
why we arrived pretty quickly at the

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.140 
why we arrived pretty quickly at the
idea<00:00:48.010> that<00:00:48.070> it<00:00:48.280> should<00:00:48.400> be<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.519> cooperative

idea that it should be a cooperative
game<00:00:49.330> that<00:00:49.570> should<00:00:49.750> be<00:00:49.809> two<00:00:49.989> players<00:00:50.260> working

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
game that should be two players working

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.100 
game that should be two players working
together<00:00:50.970> kind<00:00:51.970> of<00:00:52.000> in<00:00:52.180> tandem<00:00:52.600> as<00:00:52.750> these<00:00:52.930> two

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
together kind of in tandem as these two
