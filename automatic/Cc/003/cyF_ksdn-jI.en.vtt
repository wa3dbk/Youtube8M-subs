dad got me a little cut down ski the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.010 
dad got me a little cut down ski the
foil<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:23.850> half<00:01:24.090> his<00:01:24.299> size<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.750> the

foil was like half his size is the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.490 
foil was like half his size is the
normal<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> board<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.430> then

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
normal one and so is the board and then

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.530 
normal one and so is the board and then
it<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.650> moved<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.100> since<00:01:29.430> their<00:01:29.700> way

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
it just moved up since their way

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.390 
it just moved up since their way
different<00:01:30.990> than<00:01:31.020> any<00:01:31.229> other<00:01:31.290> sport<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.220> get

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
different than any other sport you get

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.340 
different than any other sport you get
to<00:01:32.520> progress<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.180> twice<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:33.689> fast<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
to progress like twice as fast on it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.870 
to progress like twice as fast on it
when<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.590> want<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.189> wake<00:01:35.340> forward<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.790> have

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
when you want to wake forward you have

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.420 
when you want to wake forward you have
to<00:01:36.030> go<00:01:36.329> slow<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:36.930> flips<00:01:37.290> are<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.680> so

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
to go slow and then flips are just so

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.249 
to go slow and then flips are just so
hard<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.630> write<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.049> for

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
hard to do and on this you write it for

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.080 
hard to do and on this you write it for
a<00:01:40.290> year<00:01:40.500> with<00:01:40.710> all<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> advanced<00:01:41.369> riders<00:01:41.909> you

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
a year with all the advanced riders you

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.630 
a year with all the advanced riders you
can<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> flip<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.079> year<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.430> way

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
can get a flip in a year and it's way

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.410 
can get a flip in a year and it's way
easier<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.930> US<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.500> che<00:01:46.920> Nationals<00:01:47.549> was<00:01:48.000> last

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
easier the US a che Nationals was last

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.389 
easier the US a che Nationals was last
weekend<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.110> was<00:01:49.200> probably<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.070> was<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.250> our

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
weekend it was probably it was like our
