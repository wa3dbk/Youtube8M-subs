00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.180
 sometimes it seems like a big meeting is coming up 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:14.009
 where the polar bear met the ones on the books 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.990
 the British manufacturer in all respects and void Gallen 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.390
 according to statements of Zeuthen switched 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.779

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.550
 Bush with would be highway 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.770
 Drove down the snow 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.770
 and how promptly 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.230
 ee 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.380
 I 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.550
 suddenly there was a strong wind for a long time 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.680
 his heart beat 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.900
 never met a final to the Champions League 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.210
 the judges in Lausanne is the and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.430
 I live here in the area 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.460
 to 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.510
 it really stays no to me 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.590
 Do not say human flesh twice 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.930
 it is unclear whether his finally a good day 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.930
 a comparison of the digital world anymore 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.060
 first, very close to Kiel 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.380
 and nods her how good it is to them 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.490
 once was since the launch 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.159
 I think you're really bad because Oksana said the animal ever 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.680
 and that Dawson could not survive 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
 had charming 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.540
 the Schmack Schaar printed 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.540
 and was already gone 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.840
 we can also train 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 the explorers 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.430
 and disappeared 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.430
 after shoemaker I sit down first 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.619
 Percent demands 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.090
 he failed shot 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.090
 Amazon is art 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.869
 the Lakers were 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.869
 the night after, he created the top 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.569
 early in the morning made their way to his girlfriend 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.899
 his mom wondered and called 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.899
 These are not articles is a boy 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:36.879
 by Lars Winter no more 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.879
 to be the hearts of Hamburg 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.609
 I was not afraid 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:51.009
 the Munich had not right at the beginning 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.009
 From now on, they were saving seven days 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.589
 we have to meet votes 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.039
 what drift from the north wind through the sea 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.039
 sometimes laughs SPOX have stories 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.079
 so short 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.749
 so welcomed 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.749
 February 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.759
 Do people really serve each other 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:23.679
 one day played 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:27.269
 when Lars once again came to an agreed place 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.319
 to be found in the council chamber 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.089
 he waited in vain 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:36.529
 Guggenberger won by polar bears prevails a great unrest 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.569
 the shops were running 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.649
 as a hardliner Sam 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:44.379
 he continues to tell 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.919
 the camera is a huge step markers 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.719
 though took off 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.759
 also the area from that was better 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.429
 for his future 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.829
 but you are 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.319
 white house 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.259
 No 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:22.119
 then a lot of fear a very nice Porsche and Piech 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.300
 everyone will 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.979
 in fact, the column sat down again, there is Billen in motion 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.479
 then a piece next to it and ran into simple 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.479
 like I'll never see you again 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.969

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.969
 8th

 I
