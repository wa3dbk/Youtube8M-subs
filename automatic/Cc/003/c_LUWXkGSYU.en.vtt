00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.919
 learn how to do for two years 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.420
 who so a front flip if you do not know 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.370
 not what it is it is a salto before 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.440
 right now you will see that it is 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.760
 a figure that would be difficult as 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.990
 all the scales and try to do it 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.539
 in an airbag 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:30.920
 if your station does a place where it 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:34.320
 there is good is indeed a helmet 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.670
 and maybe some protections if you 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.640
 have announced a fund of girls already so 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.800
 you are not an airbag will have to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.469
 take a bump that we see enough you 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.809
 here's trying to take a bump that 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.640
 do not see too much sharp karl flick 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.890
 it is well ahead and I remind you 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.260
 that a bump sends backward one 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.120
 can do a backflip a little bump 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.719
 that's enough but a leaky background 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.070
 it takes more height on the bump and 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.590
 confers the bottom of flight 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:12.119
 there are two ways already what starts 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:16.740
 that is to say, put yourself like that and you 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.390
 have the front flip stretched ie 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.390
 that you leave like this 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:02:02.090
 right well for parallel skis 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:06.020
 here on each side and if not for the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.819
 first free fr it happened well 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.549
 summery in parallel because if you 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.680
 go badly jumped and do not make the fund 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.540
 fip start making your front flip 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.299
 that if you have all the good 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.590
 conditions and then you will do 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.150
 as if you want to go take 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.890
 grove with your hands 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.720
 except that you will try to go 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.890
 take it like that and then you go 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.620
 put you in a ball 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.630
 Here you may have come a little hollow in 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.329
 dedicated stick is not your go you 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.709
 even well the top is here and then you 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.359
 will put you in your mouth and you 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.220
 see what is it worth to you 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.799
 help for the type fund is then 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.480
 gone when you're upside down in my 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.950
 young girl you will laugh with your 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.329
 feet to finish and you will see alone 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.920
 stocky and hop 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.260
 then as soon as you get to the end 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.609
 you recover yourself revive your 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.010
 here is 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.770
 and you think well forward because 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.960
 hurt us and you attract cp 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.850
 the slope like that flat and you read 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.580
 you finish the bank and you have 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.310
 finished that's for sure it sounds 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.840
 easy to explain but it's a figure 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.520
 which is quite difficult to do so 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.530
 practice how these 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:15.280
 last waves the bottom otherwise if you 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.910
 need to do does not do it 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.910
 see you soon
