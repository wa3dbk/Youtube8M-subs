00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.440
 today we prepare homemade blocks a 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.509
 recipe super easy and is delicious 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.040
 ideal for children and adults and that also 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.680
 We can accompany them with almost any 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.230
 salsa the first thing we have to do 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.730
 is cooking 500 grams of potatoes 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.949
 I am going to use potatoes of the variety 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.919
 Kennebec directly from my garden 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.619
 neighbor we put a pot with abundant 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.390
 water and threw it unpeeled potatoes 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.099
 ideal is that the potatoes are not very 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.460
 large and more or less all of it 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.110
 total size should cook about 20 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.810
 minutes but before putting out the fire 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.760
 click on them to see if they are tender if 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.270
 you find them hard you leave them 10 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.270
 more minutes 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.870
 we let them cool down a bit 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.870
 too much and we peel them 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.720
 We cut the potatoes into segments so that 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.300
 fit better in the masher 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.490
 it is important very important that we do 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.050
 mine with still hot potato 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.740
 because otherwise the mass will not have the 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.740
 adequate consistency 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.670
 we pepper and incorporate a yolk 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.670
 egg 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.670
 we take 50 grams of wheat flour and 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.670
 we mix 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.010
 on a clean surface we sprinkle 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.080
 maizena type sand or rice flour 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.080
 so that our new keys do not stick 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.500
 we make a kind of curl with the dough 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.159
 and we are cutting small portions to 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.159
 make the new keys 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.090
 see what texture we have left 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.090
 perfect the dough 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.920
 we make a trickle of the thickness that 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.800
 we want them to have our new keys 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.900
 we start in 2 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.770
 we put them together and cut the 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.770
 as much as we want 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.050
 we could let them give them shape 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.270
 round mark it simply with a 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.800
 fork or from a ball give them the 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.010
 classic form which is the one that we are going to 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.010
 do 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.659
 crush against the fork we bend 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.370
 the two ends to take off from 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.780
 fork and ready 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.819
 you see 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.650
 It is important to use the fork of 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.220
 cornstarch and hands so that the dough does not 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.220
 stick 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.590
 before cooking we are going to prepare 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.750
 the sauce this time we will do two 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.760
 sauces a Genovese pesto and a weight 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.950
 Sicilian two essential basics 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.959
 very useful to accompany pasta 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.540
 salads vegetables and even meats and 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.880
 fish we go first with the red pesto 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.920
 Sicilian we put in the glass of the 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.099
 blender 40 grams of raw pine nuts 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.790
 medium-low basil leaves about 30 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:43.160
 40 50 grams of Parmesan cheese 60 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.320
 grams of dried tomato in oil 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.420
 We crush and we are throwing the oil 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.130
 extra virgin olive 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.930
 I have thrown 70 milliliters but the 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.360
 amount will depend on if you want it more 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.040
 thick or less so I recommend that you 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.140
 you go incorporating it little by little until 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.180
 get the desired texture some 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.860
 lemon droplets and crushed a little 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.260
 plus 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.640
 For me that's perfect , we throw it in 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.640
 a bowl and wait for the nikis 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.380
 and now let's prepare the Genoese 40 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.690
 grams of raw pine nuts 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.120
 medium low although you can throw more or 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.889
 less according to your taste 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.889
 30-40 leaves of fresh basil 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.000
 50 grams of Parmesan cheese 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.130
 and 50 milliliters of olive oil 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.690
 extra virgin just like before the 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.110
 oil will depend on how you are from 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.110
 espresso 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.430
 like sauces that are served cold or 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.270
 we can do room temperature 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.270
 in advance 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.889
 see what show we are going to give him cane 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.169
 to our children 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.469
 we put a pot on the fire with enough 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.469
 Water 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.539
 just when the water breaks to boil 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.400
 we throw the yucca we do not have to throw 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.960
 many so that they do not clump together and we have 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.960
 to distribute them throughout the pot 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:18.659
 first is a will say to the bottom 

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:18.659
 will be ready when they float in the water 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.750
 this is like going fishing out there go up 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.750
 a couple more 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.530
 we are throwing batches of 6 or 8 x and the 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.530
 let's cook over a high heat 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.740
 we drain them well and leave them on 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.740
 a large plate 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.300
 I will use the presentation with the two sauces 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.710
 we put several x on a plate and sautÃ© 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.630
 with the Genoese weight 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.500
 and the other dish we salse with the 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.500
 pesto cecilia no 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.880
 in this we decorate with a twig of 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.020
 basil and in the other with a piece of 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.020
 dry tomato in oil 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.210
 and now it's best to try it 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:17.699
 there is little left for the holidays 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.699
 you lose the last recipes a little kiss
