now the game mode that you can see me

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.819 
now the game mode that you can see me

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
playing here is called crush sign it's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.020 
playing here is called crush sign it's
very<00:00:50.010> similar<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.430> capture<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.000> hold

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
very similar to capture and hold

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.970 
very similar to capture and hold
randomly<00:00:51.870> different<00:00:52.199> locations<00:00:52.680> around<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
randomly different locations around the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.770 
randomly different locations around the
map<00:00:53.190> alien<00:00:53.670> pods<00:00:53.910> will<00:00:54.090> crash<00:00:54.360> during<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
map alien pods will crash during the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.700 
map alien pods will crash during the
game<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.350> get<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.620> those

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
game and you have to get to those

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.410 
game and you have to get to those
locations<00:00:55.860> before<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.610> enemy<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.030> capture

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
locations before the enemy and capture

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.000 
locations before the enemy and capture
them<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.230> do<00:00:58.350> capture<00:00:58.620> them<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.890> have

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
them and if you do capture them you have

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.590 
them and if you do capture them you have
to<00:00:59.039> hold<00:00:59.219> them<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.090> enemy<00:01:00.300> capture

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
to hold them and if the enemy capture

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.060 
to hold them and if the enemy capture
them<00:01:00.719> first<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.289> destroy<00:01:01.739> them<00:01:01.949> so

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
them first you have to destroy them so

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.410 
them first you have to destroy them so
it's<00:01:02.190> very<00:01:02.370> similar<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.820> capture<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.390> hold

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it's very similar to a capture and hold

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.960 
it's very similar to a capture and hold
game<00:01:03.870> mode<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.650> similar<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.070> crisis<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
game mode now similar to crisis to the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120 
game mode now similar to crisis to the
two<00:01:06.119> opposing<00:01:06.689> sides<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> cell<00:01:07.590> unit<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
two opposing sides are the cell unit and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.160 
two opposing sides are the cell unit and
the<00:01:08.220> US<00:01:08.580> Marine<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.390> hasn't<00:01:09.689> change<00:01:09.900> from

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the US Marine so that hasn't change from

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.140 
the US Marine so that hasn't change from
crisis<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.460> beginning<00:01:11.790> weapons<00:01:12.090> that

noticed already that I do struggle

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.700 
noticed already that I do struggle
actually<00:02:48.690> at<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.840> moment<00:02:49.110> with<00:02:49.200> aiming<00:02:49.590> down

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.620 
actually at the moment with aiming down
the<00:02:49.890> scope<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.400> weapon<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.060> dead<00:02:51.270> zoning

the scope of the weapon the dead zoning

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.540 
the scope of the weapon the dead zoning
seemed<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.930> little<00:02:52.140> bit<00:02:52.410> too<00:02:52.890> sensitive<00:02:53.340> at<00:02:53.490> the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.720 
moment it could do with slowing down a
little<00:02:55.230> bit<00:02:55.500> now<00:02:55.770> as<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:55.950> begin<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> game<00:02:56.400> the

of<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> key<00:03:01.800> problems<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.310> i<00:03:02.340> think<00:03:02.460> has

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
of the key problems that i think has

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.520 
of the key problems that i think has
stayed<00:03:03.360> from<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.630> Alpha<00:03:03.990> is<00:03:04.020> I<00:03:04.260> think<00:03:04.440> there

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
stayed from the Alpha is I think there

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.530 
stayed from the Alpha is I think there
are<00:03:04.560> some<00:03:04.800> serious<00:03:05.220> weapon<00:03:05.670> balance<00:03:06.060> issues<00:03:06.360> I

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
are some serious weapon balance issues I

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.540 
are some serious weapon balance issues I
say<00:03:06.990> serious<00:03:07.500> balance<00:03:07.770> issues<00:03:08.040> about<00:03:08.340> as

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
say serious balance issues about as

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.670

balanced as a fat girl on a seesaw at
the<00:03:10.740> moment<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.100> do<00:03:11.160> think<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:11.550> shotguns<00:03:11.970> in

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
the moment I do think the shotguns in

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.640 
the moment I do think the shotguns in
the<00:03:12.180> sniper<00:03:12.420> rifles<00:03:12.840> even<00:03:13.200> with<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.500> body

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
the sniper rifles even with the body

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.800 
the sniper rifles even with the body
armor<00:03:13.950> turned<00:03:14.190> on<00:03:14.400> do<00:03:15.060> seem<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.360> little<00:03:15.540> bit

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
armor turned on do seem a little bit

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.690 
armor turned on do seem a little bit
overpowered<00:03:16.650> compared<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.459> assault

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
overpowered compared to the assault

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.070

rifles<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.270> can<00:03:18.390> see<00:03:18.510> me<00:03:18.630> using<00:03:18.750> here

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
rifles that you can see me using here

we're<00:03:19.320> pretty<00:03:19.709> much<00:03:19.890> takes<00:03:20.190> an<00:03:20.280> entire

we're pretty much takes an entire
magazine<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:21.090> kill<00:03:21.270> someone<00:03:21.450> at<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.110> moment<00:03:22.410> I

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
magazine to kill someone at the moment I

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.230 
magazine to kill someone at the moment I
haven't<00:03:23.070> had<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.280> situation<00:03:23.520> won't<00:03:23.910> be<00:03:24.060> able<00:03:24.150> to

haven't had a situation won't be able to

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.910 
haven't had a situation won't be able to
kill<00:03:24.420> two<00:03:24.450> people<00:03:24.630> without<00:03:25.230> having<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.560> reload

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
kill two people without having to reload

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.830 
kill two people without having to reload
a<00:03:25.950> magazine<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:27.270> does<00:03:27.420> have<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.660> take<00:03:27.810> a

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
a magazine so it does have to take a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.660 
a magazine so it does have to take a
form<00:03:28.290> mag<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.740> burn<00:03:28.920> someone<00:03:29.220> down<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.580> I<00:03:29.610> do

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
form mag to burn someone down so I do

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.610 
form mag to burn someone down so I do
think<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.000> assault<00:03:30.270> rifles<00:03:30.660> could<00:03:31.170> do<00:03:31.410> with

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
think the assault rifles could do with

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.080 
think the assault rifles could do with
increasing<00:03:32.160> in<00:03:32.250> power<00:03:32.490> a<00:03:32.550> little<00:03:32.790> bit<00:03:32.940> or

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
increasing in power a little bit or

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.850 
increasing in power a little bit or
maybe<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.540> sniper<00:03:33.840> rifles<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.470> shotguns

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
maybe the sniper rifles and the shotguns

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.520 
maybe the sniper rifles and the shotguns
need<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.490> be<00:03:35.580> nerfed<00:03:35.820> just<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.840> tap<00:03:37.050> because<00:03:37.380> the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
need to be nerfed just a tap because the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.260 
need to be nerfed just a tap because the
air<00:03:37.709> there<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:37.950> some<00:03:38.220> balance<00:03:38.550> issues<00:03:38.820> I<00:03:38.970> found

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
air there is some balance issues I found

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.180 
air there is some balance issues I found
with<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.570> weapons<00:03:39.930> now<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.650> just<00:03:40.770> be<00:03:41.010> my

in-depth<00:03:55.320> review<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.770> what<00:03:55.980> i<00:03:56.040> think<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.459> the

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
in-depth review of what i think of the

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
beta and as i said so far I'm not the

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.770 
beta and as i said so far I'm not the
greatest<00:03:59.280> player<00:03:59.610> at<00:03:59.700> this<00:03:59.820> game<00:04:00.030> as<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.690> can
