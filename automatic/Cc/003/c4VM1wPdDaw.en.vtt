00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
I think was a lot easier had it been

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.830 
I think was a lot easier had it been
just<00:01:11.010> mine<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.610> my<00:01:11.640> own<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.150> had<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> know<00:01:12.540> in

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the decision I was going to make the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.980 
the decision I was going to make the
time<00:01:14.430> probably<00:01:15.240> Paris<00:01:15.570> would<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.840> been<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
time probably Paris would have been a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
time probably Paris would have been a
lot<00:01:16.080> harder<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.619> me<00:01:16.860> yeah<00:01:17.250> we'll<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.180> that

oh it's definitely I think especially as
you<00:01:36.210> know<00:01:36.329> with<00:01:36.840> there's<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.350> much<00:01:37.500> choice<00:01:37.829> in

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
you know with there's so much choice in

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.530 
you know with there's so much choice in
it<00:01:38.280> with<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> lot<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.700> endorsements<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
it with a lot of endorsements and

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.660 
it with a lot of endorsements and
sponsorships<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:41.040> harder<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.400> harder

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
sponsorships and it's harder and harder

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
sponsorships and it's harder and harder
I<00:01:41.820> guess<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.329> dresses<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.899> people<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.439> so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
I guess to get dresses on people and so

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.469 
I guess to get dresses on people and so
you<00:01:44.130> know<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.280> feel<00:01:44.460> very<00:01:44.670> proud<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.390> know

deliver such a great product that people

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.600 
deliver such a great product that people
actually<00:01:49.380> make<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> choice<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.220> dress

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
actually make the choice to dress

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.420 
actually make the choice to dress
themselves<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.500> because<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.590> are<00:01:52.710> still<00:01:53.130> at

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430

the top of your game design wise I think

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.319 
the top of your game design wise I think
everyone<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.399> surprised<00:01:56.909> when<00:01:57.180> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
everyone was really surprised when you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.300 
everyone was really surprised when you
made<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.719> announcement<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.219> were

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
made that announcement that you were

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.660

going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.640> step<00:02:00.180> away<00:02:00.329> from<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:01.259> catwalk<00:02:01.799> how

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
going to step away from the catwalk how

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.160 
going to step away from the catwalk how
difficult<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.479> make<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.869> decision

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
difficult was it to make that decision

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.679 
difficult was it to make that decision
and<00:02:04.469> why<00:02:04.680> did<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:04.979> um<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.850> was<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.360> really

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689

difficult<00:02:06.960> actually<00:02:07.409> because<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.979> think

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
difficult actually because I think
