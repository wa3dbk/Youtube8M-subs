and<00:04:39.500> remember<00:04:40.500> in<00:04:40.710> this<00:04:40.830> 3950<00:04:41.730> floor<00:04:41.970> plan<00:04:42.270> we

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
and remember in this 3950 floor plan we

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.480 
and remember in this 3950 floor plan we
talked<00:04:42.990> about<00:04:43.140> it<00:04:43.410> earlier<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.920> nine<00:04:44.100> cubic

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
talked about it earlier the nine cubic

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.100 
talked about it earlier the nine cubic
foot<00:04:44.700> refrigerator<00:04:44.730> freezer<00:04:45.600> that<00:04:45.930> we<00:04:46.020> are

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
foot refrigerator freezer that we are

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.930 
foot refrigerator freezer that we are
the<00:04:46.230> industry<00:04:46.590> first<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:47.460> put<00:04:47.640> in<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.820> garage

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
the industry first to put in the garage

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.040 
the industry first to put in the garage
so<00:04:48.360> now<00:04:48.570> remember<00:04:49.130> 3950<00:04:50.130> has<00:04:50.490> 17<00:04:51.180> cubic<00:04:51.630> foot

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
so now remember 3950 has 17 cubic foot

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.810 
so now remember 3950 has 17 cubic foot

space let's talk about electronics for a
second<00:04:58.920> once<00:04:59.670> again<00:04:59.850> you<00:05:00.750> have<00:05:00.870> your<00:05:01.050> power

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
second once again you have your power

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.040 
second once again you have your power
amplifier<00:05:01.890> here<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:03.030> have<00:05:03.240> your<00:05:03.270> sub<00:05:03.690> woofer

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
amplifier here you have your sub woofer

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.850 
amplifier here you have your sub woofer
here<00:05:06.530> your<00:05:07.530> head<00:05:07.770> unit<00:05:08.160> so<00:05:08.580> you<00:05:08.640> have<00:05:08.850> CD<00:05:09.860> DVD
