when<00:03:37.349> creating<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.920> because<00:03:38.819> their<00:03:39.269> store<00:03:39.659> was

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
when creating it because their store was

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.050 
when creating it because their store was
so<00:03:40.079> much<00:03:40.290> better<00:03:40.560> on<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.980> ps3<00:03:41.249> the<00:03:41.609> European

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
so much better on the ps3 the European

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.809 
so much better on the ps3 the European
store<00:03:42.389> sucks<00:03:42.989> compared<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.069> US<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.639> the

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
store sucks compared to the US on the

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.020 
store sucks compared to the US on the
ps3<00:03:45.170> but<00:03:46.170> now<00:03:46.349> on<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.799> Vita<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.400> tables<00:03:47.879> have

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
ps3 but now on the Vita the tables have

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.520 
ps3 but now on the Vita the tables have
turned<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.719> you<00:03:49.530> European<00:03:50.459> store<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.200> even<00:03:52.200> a

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
turned and you European store and even a

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.080 
turned and you European store and even a
Japanese<00:03:53.189> of<00:03:53.370> course<00:03:53.420> is<00:03:54.420> better<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:56.819> reason

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
Japanese of course is better the reason

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.970 
Japanese of course is better the reason
why<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:57.269> didn't<00:03:57.599> make<00:03:57.689> a<00:03:57.749> Japanese<00:03:58.049> account<00:03:58.709> is

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
why I didn't make a Japanese account is

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.910 
why I didn't make a Japanese account is
because<00:03:59.639> some<00:03:59.879> games<00:04:00.120> like<00:04:00.359> Spyro<00:04:00.719> 3<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.409> the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
because some games like Spyro 3 and the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.449 
because some games like Spyro 3 and the
gex<00:04:02.310> games<00:04:02.700> are<00:04:03.060> not<00:04:03.269> available<00:04:03.510> there<00:04:03.989> and

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
gex games are not available there and

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.089 
gex games are not available there and
