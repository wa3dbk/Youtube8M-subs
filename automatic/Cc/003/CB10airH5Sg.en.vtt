today<00:00:00.299> ZM<00:00:00.659> and<00:00:00.840> five<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.140> going<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.350> be<00:00:01.469> on

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
today ZM and five is going to be on

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.070 
today ZM and five is going to be on
inhalational<00:00:02.580> injuries<00:00:03.179> mostly<00:00:03.810> in<00:00:04.020> the

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
inhalational injuries mostly in the

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.680 
inhalational injuries mostly in the
context<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.740> fire<00:00:05.279> like<00:00:05.640> exposure<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.450> house

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
context of fire like exposure to a house

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.900 
context of fire like exposure to a house
fire<00:00:07.020> it's<00:00:07.859> really<00:00:08.309> important<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.849> think

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
fire it's really important to think

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.790 
fire it's really important to think
about<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.690> inhalational<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.469> various

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
about the inhalational in various

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.520 
about the inhalational in various
patients<00:00:11.010> can<00:00:11.550> sustain<00:00:12.240> when<00:00:12.960> exposed<00:00:13.320> to

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
patients can sustain when exposed to

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.620 
patients can sustain when exposed to
smoke<00:00:13.889> or<00:00:14.219> when<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> house<00:00:15.120> fire<00:00:15.389> when

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
smoke or when in a house fire when

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.330 
smoke or when in a house fire when
brought<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.500> could<00:00:16.710> be<00:00:16.770> they<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.130> no

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
brought in it could be they have no

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.950 
brought in it could be they have no
burns<00:00:17.609> whatsoever<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.539> if<00:00:18.630> they've<00:00:18.779> been

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
burns whatsoever but if they've been

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.750 
burns whatsoever but if they've been
exposed<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> room<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.130> lot<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.490> smoke

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
exposed to a room with a lot of smoke

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.519 
exposed to a room with a lot of smoke
they<00:00:21.390> could<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:21.750> some<00:00:21.900> significant

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
they could have some significant

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.560 
they could have some significant
injuries<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.760> reason<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.150> think<00:00:24.300> about<00:00:24.449> this

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
injuries the reason to think about this

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.450 
injuries the reason to think about this
is<00:00:24.750> because<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.109> has<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.289> very<00:00:25.740> very<00:00:26.070> high

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
is because it has a very very high

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.120 
is because it has a very very high
mortality<00:00:26.810> about<00:00:27.810> half<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.380> fire<00:00:28.650> related

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
mortality about half of all fire related

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.679 
mortality about half of all fire related
deaths<00:00:29.460> are<00:00:29.760> actually<00:00:30.210> from<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
deaths are actually from the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.590 
deaths are actually from the
inhalational<00:00:31.470> injuries<00:00:31.890> themselves<00:00:32.640> there

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
inhalational injuries themselves there

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.270 
inhalational injuries themselves there
are<00:00:33.630> two<00:00:34.020> risk<00:00:34.200> factors<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.800> kind<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.010> think

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
are two risk factors you kind of think

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.130 
are two risk factors you kind of think
of<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.940> increase<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.660> risk<00:00:36.870> for

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
of that increase the risk for

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
of that increase the risk for
inhalational<00:00:37.860> injuries<00:00:38.340> that's<00:00:38.850> close

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
inhalational injuries that's close

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.840 
inhalational injuries that's close
spaces<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.020> altered<00:00:40.829> Mental<00:00:41.129> Status<00:00:41.160> these

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
spaces and altered Mental Status these

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.330 
spaces and altered Mental Status these
risk<00:00:42.090> factors<00:00:42.629> mean<00:00:43.110> higher<00:00:43.410> concentrations

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
risk factors mean higher concentrations

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.430 
risk factors mean higher concentrations
of<00:00:44.550> smoke<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> longer<00:00:45.660> periods<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.079> exposure

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
of smoke and longer periods of exposure

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.139 
of smoke and longer periods of exposure
so<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.219> example<00:00:47.579> looking<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:47.850> these<00:00:47.940> two

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
so for example looking at these two

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.420 
so for example looking at these two
pictures<00:00:48.329> which<00:00:48.870> situation<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.039> person

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
pictures which situation is the person

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.459 
pictures which situation is the person
exposed<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.870> higher<00:00:52.110> risk<00:00:52.320> of

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
exposed going to have a higher risk of

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.200 
exposed going to have a higher risk of
inhalational<00:00:53.039> injury<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.940> would<00:00:54.030> definitely

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
inhalational injury it would definitely

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.389 
inhalational injury it would definitely
be<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.840> one<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> left<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.800> closed

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
be this one on the left it's a closed

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.119 
be this one on the left it's a closed
room<00:00:56.789> much<00:00:57.719> higher<00:00:58.170> concentration<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.980> smoke

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
room much higher concentration of smoke

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.160 
room much higher concentration of smoke
in<00:00:59.609> thinking<00:01:00.059> about<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.359> injury<00:01:00.660> sustained

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
in thinking about the injury sustained

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.720 
in thinking about the injury sustained
you<00:01:01.410> want<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> divide<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.039> into<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.430> upper

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
you want to divide it up into the upper

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.000 
you want to divide it up into the upper
airway<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.359> lower<00:01:03.570> airway<00:01:04.049> starting<00:01:04.920> with

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
airway and lower airway starting with

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.410 
airway and lower airway starting with
the<00:01:05.100> upper<00:01:05.129> airway<00:01:05.729> that's<00:01:06.090> where<00:01:06.330> you're

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the upper airway that's where you're

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.060 
the upper airway that's where you're
going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> direct<00:01:07.260> thermal<00:01:07.830> burns

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
going to have the direct thermal burns

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
going to have the direct thermal burns
that's<00:01:08.670> gonna<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> lot<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.210> fast<00:01:09.659> edema<00:01:10.290> that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that's gonna be a lot of fast edema that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.200 
that's gonna be a lot of fast edema that
happens<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> ER<00:01:12.000> while

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
happens right there in the ER while

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.670 
happens right there in the ER while
you're<00:01:12.330> watching<00:01:12.510> them<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.409> some

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
you're watching them there can be some

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.710 
you're watching them there can be some
particulate<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.340> toxin<00:01:14.909> injury<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.270> well<00:01:15.330> but

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
particulate and toxin injury as well but

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.940 
particulate and toxin injury as well but
the<00:01:15.810> main<00:01:15.990> thing<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> direct<00:01:16.770> thermal

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the main thing is the direct thermal

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.859 
the main thing is the direct thermal
bring<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> upper<00:01:17.850> airway<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.689> lower

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
bring to the upper airway in the lower

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.230 
bring to the upper airway in the lower
airway<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:19.979> more<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.490> particulate

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
airway you have more of the particulate

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.350 
airway you have more of the particulate
and<00:01:21.479> toxin<00:01:22.409> effects<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.729> very<00:01:24.030> very

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and toxin effects this is very very

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
and toxin effects this is very very
irritating<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.170> lower<00:01:25.409> airway<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.890> does

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
irritating to the lower airway and does

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.100 
irritating to the lower airway and does
cause<00:01:26.549> edema<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.299> much<00:01:27.509> more<00:01:27.720> delayed

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
cause edema but it's much more delayed

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
cause edema but it's much more delayed
within<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> next<00:01:29.040> 24<00:01:29.520> hours<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.450> be

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
within the next 24 hours there can be

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.380 
within the next 24 hours there can be
some<00:01:30.960> direct<00:01:31.650> thermal<00:01:32.250> burns<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.790> lower<00:01:32.970> area

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
some direct thermal burns to lower area

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.450 
some direct thermal burns to lower area
but<00:01:33.540> that's<00:01:33.689> more<00:01:33.960> with<00:01:34.170> steam<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.799> juries<00:01:35.100> so

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
but that's more with steam and juries so

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.069 
but that's more with steam and juries so
a<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:35.670> bit<00:01:35.880> less<00:01:36.030> common<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.600> house<00:01:36.750> fires

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
a little bit less common in house fires

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.560 
a little bit less common in house fires
now<00:01:37.650> what<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.070> particulate<00:01:38.909> injury<00:01:39.420> that

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
now what is this particulate injury that

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
now what is this particulate injury that
we're<00:01:39.689> talking<00:01:39.810> about<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> lower

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
we're talking about with the lower

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
we're talking about with the lower
airway<00:01:40.979> well<00:01:41.430> that's<00:01:41.610> mostly<00:01:41.909> what<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.180> call

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
airway well that's mostly what we call

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.569 
airway well that's mostly what we call
micro<00:01:42.720> particles<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> smoke

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
micro particles you can see in the smoke

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
micro particles you can see in the smoke
there's<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.210> tons<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.659> debris<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.110> that's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
there's just tons of debris and that's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.170 
there's just tons of debris and that's
caused<00:01:46.770> from<00:01:47.009> an<00:01:47.130> incomplete<00:01:47.729> combustion

during<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.079> fire<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.770> micro<00:01:50.009> particles<00:01:50.490> are

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
during the fire the micro particles are

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.810 
during the fire the micro particles are
defined<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.210> less<00:01:51.390> than<00:01:51.659> 0.5<00:01:52.790> micrometers<00:01:53.790> so

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
defined as less than 0.5 micrometers so

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.330 
defined as less than 0.5 micrometers so
very<00:01:54.329> small<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.259> gets<00:01:55.470> way<00:01:55.680> down<00:01:55.920> into<00:01:56.130> the
