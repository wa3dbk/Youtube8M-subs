 This is a small tutorial of the steps 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.080
 prior to the installation of da vinci 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.809
 tax service program 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.759
 national that generates the file for 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.280
 corresponding correspondence by the office 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.140
 virtual 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:24.380
 well initially we turn to the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.450
 start tab will be displayed a 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.770
 list with several options and 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:33.559
 we select control panel 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:37.309
 we select the option accounts of 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:41.830
 user and child protection within 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:45.129
 we select user accounts 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:48.170
 then we select the option 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.030
 change control settings 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.020

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.020
 Y 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.640
 now a window opens where we should 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.950
 to move the fence to zero level ie 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.220
 we slide down to the level 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.220
 minimum 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.010
 we accept and then restart the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.280
 computer 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:32.810
 once the computer restarted we 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:37.850
 we go back to the control panel 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.300
 this time we select clock language and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.300
 region 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.160
 a new window appears where 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.960
 we must perform the following 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.280
 changes 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.100
 we click on the second box 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.330
 which bears the name of publication and 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.330
 we choose bolivia 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:33.540
 then we select the first box 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:37.709
 format and we chose bolivia inside that 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:42.330
 option in a short date format 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:45.810
 we choose day month and year 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.910
 Then we click on the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.200
 last box down that says 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.020
 additional configuration 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.450
 a new window appears where we should 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.660
 to change in the symbol box of your 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.540
 hand instead of how it should be together 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.850
 we start with the point and we 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.030
 we go to the box symbol of 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.560
 separation of thousands and we replace the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.560
 point usually 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:27.880
 then in the list separator box 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:32.080
 we must place a pit lane 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:36.520
 that you get with the combination at 4 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:39.220
 it is a naval horizontal character 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.860
 then we went to the box 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:47.680
 currency where we make the same 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:52.240

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.620

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.260

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.810
 and we started a computer again for 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.709
 then start installing doping 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.709
