00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.330
I'm Joe Kunches, I'm with NOAA's Space
Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.419
Space weather got really interesting
yesterday. On Thursday, a

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:12.529
strong solar flare errupted
from the middle of the solar disk

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.170
right around the middle of the day our
time yesterday.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.520
That was interesting because the flare
effects impacted high-frequency radio

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.170
communications on the day side of the
Earth, probably for an hour

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.189
or two after the the maximum of the flare.

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.279
The forecast at this point is for a
geomagnetic disturbance to begin on

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.070
Saturday about 7 a.m. local time
here in Boulder.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.660
We're not anticipating that this
particular space weather event will have

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.309
significant impacts

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.970
on Earth and on systems we depend on. 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.760
Minor to maybe some periods of moderate
geomagnetic storm activity are expected. 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.190
Systems that are affected by geomagnetic
activity like power grids and satellite

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.480
operations and things that if that use
GPS (global positioning systems) for precise 
surveying...

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.960
We don't think any of those systems are
going to be adversely affected by this one.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.030
The process of making the
forecast for the strength of say a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.100
magnetic storm liked we're expecting
tomorrow

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.190
involves a number of things. It involves
taking an analysis of the eruption

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.070
back at the sun, that starts the whole
thing. 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.340
How energetic was the eruption, 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.159
how did it register in terms of its
radio output, which is a proxy for how what's

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.180
going on through the corona. Where on the
sun did it occur, 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.640
because that's very critical in terms of
the trajectory of a coronal mass ejection 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.960
that might come by the Earth, but
then forget about the sun and move out

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.550
into the coronosphere to the inner heliosphere. 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.110
What's the condition of the solar wind, are there structures

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.729
between the sun and the Earth that are going to affect 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.630
either the the velocity

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.370
or the direction of this of this coronal mass ejection? 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.619
And then step ahead and forget about the
solar wind,

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.750
at the Earth, what's the condition of the
Earth's magnetic field? Is it in a state where 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.419
it can take in some additional energy
and not be terribly disturbed, or

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:08.250
isn't already somewhat disturbed

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.220
and therefore will it be more likely to go
into a storm phase

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.190
with another little jolt to it?

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.459
A very common question is will the auroras be visible from where I live?

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.000
Well, it depends on where you live for and and if
you live near the U.S.-Canada border

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
perhaps on Saturday night or maybe even
into Sunday night if the effects linger

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.270
you might see some enhanced aurora

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.370
just because we expect the storm to be
of a severity  that would cause and drive

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.349
the auroral that for south.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.510
If you live south of there, probably
not.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.270
NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is
the Nation's official source of alerts

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.720
of space weather

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.290
events and and information that would go
to customers for their use,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.019
to help them understand the current
conditions and what we expect to occur.
