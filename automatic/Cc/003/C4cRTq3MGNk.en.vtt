00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
the flip side it back i'm pretty sure it

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.659 
the flip side it back i'm pretty sure it
asks<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:12.360> about<00:05:12.500> if<00:05:13.500> you<00:05:13.650> have<00:05:13.740> a<00:05:13.770> DPF<00:05:14.340> or<00:05:14.520> not
