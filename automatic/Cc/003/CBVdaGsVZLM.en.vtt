first that one talk to you about the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.700 
first that one talk to you about the
faders<00:00:17.090> themselves<00:00:17.630> this<00:00:18.200> is<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:18.410> original

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
faders themselves this is the original

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.310 
faders themselves this is the original
by<00:00:19.520> up<00:00:19.760> method<00:00:20.119> fader<00:00:20.360> it's<00:00:20.660> called<00:00:20.869> by<00:00:21.050> up

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
by up method fader it's called by up

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.930 
by up method fader it's called by up
because<00:00:21.650> one<00:00:21.860> of<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.039> fins<00:00:22.280> is<00:00:22.430> made<00:00:22.610> of<00:00:22.760> lead

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:22.940 
because one of the fins is made of lead

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.720 
because one of the fins is made of lead
so<00:00:23.510> it<00:00:23.570> will<00:00:23.720> always<00:00:23.869> fall<00:00:24.350> one<00:00:24.590> way<00:00:24.640> even<00:00:25.640> if

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
so it will always fall one way even if

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.010 
so it will always fall one way even if
there's<00:00:25.910> bait<00:00:26.060> around<00:00:26.270> it<00:00:26.570> it<00:00:26.630> will<00:00:26.720> always

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
there's bait around it it will always

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.750 
there's bait around it it will always
fall<00:00:27.590> that<00:00:27.770> way<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:28.010> if<00:00:28.250> you've<00:00:28.369> got<00:00:28.490> your<00:00:28.609> hook

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
fall that way so if you've got your hook

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.150 
fall that way so if you've got your hook
Bight<00:00:29.029> folded<00:00:29.779> in<00:00:29.930> to<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:30.500> top<00:00:30.710> of<00:00:30.830> it<00:00:30.949> there

Bight folded in to the top of it there

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160 
Bight folded in to the top of it there
the<00:00:31.640> hook<00:00:31.850> bite<00:00:32.059> will<00:00:32.210> always<00:00:32.480> be<00:00:32.689> exposed

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
the hook bite will always be exposed

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
and just a higher bid hook link but

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.960 
and just a higher bid hook link but
that'll<00:01:06.950> become<00:01:07.039> clear<00:01:07.430> I<00:01:07.460> would<00:01:07.729> do<00:01:07.820> that

try it in and try it out and right evers
working<00:03:50.490> on<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.700> day<00:03:50.880> use<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.600> method<00:03:52.020> right

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
working on the day use that method right

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.170 
working on the day use that method right
okay<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.070> then<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.340> one's<00:03:53.580> obviously

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
okay and then that one's obviously

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.670 
okay and then that one's obviously
completely<00:03:54.750> different<00:03:55.110> that<00:03:55.230> looks<00:03:55.260> more

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
completely different that looks more

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.040 
completely different that looks more
like<00:03:55.740> what<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.190> would<00:03:56.430> put<00:03:56.610> in<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.760> PVA<00:03:57.120> bag<00:03:57.480> or<00:03:57.840> I

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
like what I would put in a PVA bag or I

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.770 
like what I would put in a PVA bag or I
would<00:03:58.410> spot<00:03:58.680> out<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.190> what's<00:03:59.850> in<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.090> one<00:04:00.420> and

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
would spot out so what's in that one and

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.270 
would spot out so what's in that one and
why<00:04:00.990> is<00:04:01.050> it<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:01.440> different<00:04:01.680> from<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:02.100> one

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
why is it so different from that one

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.980 
why is it so different from that one
okay<00:04:02.730> well<00:04:02.880> this<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.180> something<00:04:03.390> we're<00:04:03.750> more

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
okay well this is something we're more

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.840 
okay well this is something we're more
likely<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.350> use<00:04:04.590> as<00:04:04.740> big<00:04:04.950> fish<00:04:05.160> anglers<00:04:05.550> okay

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
likely to use as big fish anglers okay

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.300 
likely to use as big fish anglers okay
eat<00:04:06.120> it's<00:04:06.510> based<00:04:06.810> around<00:04:07.140> much<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.740> much

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
eat it's based around much a much

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.940 
eat it's based around much a much
coarser<00:04:08.640> mix<00:04:09.450> full<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.900> lot<00:04:10.050> more<00:04:10.260> feed<00:04:10.560> okay

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
coarser mix full of a lot more feed okay

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.250 
coarser mix full of a lot more feed okay
so<00:04:11.010> right<00:04:11.460> that<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:11.820> can<00:04:12.060> withstand<00:04:12.900> the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
so right that it can withstand the

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.960 
so right that it can withstand the
attention<00:04:13.710> a<00:04:13.770> small<00:04:14.040> fish<00:04:14.310> yeah<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:14.850> when

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
attention a small fish yeah so when

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.330 
attention a small fish yeah so when
you're<00:04:15.090> casting<00:04:15.270> out<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:15.960> might<00:04:16.140> take<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.739> night

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
you're casting out it might take a night

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.310 
you're casting out it might take a night
for<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.820> fish<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.150> get<00:04:18.270> on<00:04:18.420> it<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.930> want<00:04:19.140> some
