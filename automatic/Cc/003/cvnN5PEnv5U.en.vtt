00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.150
 So it starts with the snap fireball 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.580
 that his fireball is philipp 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.100
 has come up with a simple idea 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.720
 the intention is to hook these single hooks 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.130
 you want to use that means you 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.099
 So the hook completely on the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.540
 used bait adapt so on 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.340
 At the beginning you just cut yourself in 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.310
 piece in front of the material should be like that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.050
 be about 70 80 94 cm 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.670
 With this reproach material one offers 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.520
 namely the stinger so the part 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.370
 between fireball and additional drilling 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.079
 and at the same time , this forms part 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.329
 the foreword material then continue until 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.190
 the main story often for a normal 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.719
 fireball assembly with midsize 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.359
 you need a 1 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.090
 lay and also all trilling philipp 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.469
 Now, first of all, unpack the inserts 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.820
 In this time you can only briefly 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.500
 few words about the incident material 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.210
 you should not lose too fat 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.040
 fish because the thicker the pre-material 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.990
 the bigger is the swelling 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.330
 under water all the more flow that 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.160
 waters has more impact 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.960
 that of course then lead to that 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.360
 installation still on conspicuousness 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.740
 So I would say something like that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.540
 1 millimeter diameter is one 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.400
 correct and that binds too 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.049
 I would be relatively easy 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.650
 always too braided in front of the material 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.170
 to tend 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.790
 the second hook of the drilling many 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.990
 already laid down this part 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.649
 should of course be on the bait yourself 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.290
 to adjust 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.880
 so and now the assembly follows 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.009
 many different types of 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.930
 fireballs we have with philipp 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.460
 the snap fireball is the one designed 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.110
 special lock possesses with the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.969
 the details for a very good 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.259
 can exchange the details 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.329
 but also very well fixed 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.280
 so that the whole thing works 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.130
 one piece cube one piece of silicone 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.310
 You can read here on the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.649
 customize and you have everything 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.020
 what you need for the montage of the fireball 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.000
 Of course you need the weight 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.829
 of the fireball on the waters on the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.360
 adjusting the flow that should be natural 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.340
 to be completely clear of the rule 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.850
 weights between 50 and 300 grams to 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.540
 commitment 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.630
 and if all this lies before you 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.000
 one on and indeed comes first 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.340
 the drilling on the front of philipp 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.930
 used for this is the paloma knot 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.989
 a very simple knot as you can see 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.970
 just make a knot flabby 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.440
 then go through the training and then 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.060
 to pull this loop 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.800
 Of course you can also do them wonderfully 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.370
 Googling on the internet because you can see it completely 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.140
 exactly 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.210
 but here you can see it is going very well 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.340
 fast and the advantage of the paloma 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.140
 knotens is that you do not have to hook 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.060
 Thigh mister must be wrapped that is 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.950
 If you use smaller hooks you do so 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.960
 Do not reduce the hook thigh 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.720
 above the knot over the hook 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.700
 is positioned 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.950
 as a mode then comes the single hook 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.410
 directly to the celebration ball from behind 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.580
 just pulling through is just that 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.890
 to fix whole 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.820
 you move now the piece youtube over 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.710
 the details 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.680
 it works best when you use it 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.530
 previously feared further on the snap 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.550
 on it and then the whole thing is done and 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.080
 Here you can already see the advantage 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.430
 you can really do any one then 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.810
 use details 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.000
 depending on whether you for example a 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.860
 big cage used or a smaller one 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.690
 fish and you are not the problem 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.450
 that maybe only a very small one 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.830
 domprediger circle local but man 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.380
 can there a neat hook on it 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.460
 make the fia also clean of 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.800
 material there you just go now 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.840
 twice through the eyelet forward through so 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.550
 also only the length adapt the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.140
 distance between 1 sheet and trilling 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.780
 respectively distance between snap 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.220
 fireball and rilling and philipp fixed 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.380
 the whole thing now with another piece 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.760
 tube that he has cut one 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.600
 piece of tube is already in the scope of delivery 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.670
 contain 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.340
 then you can get another piece 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.770
 to cut yourself is a montage the 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.540
 now almost not completely fixed 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.220
 but mobile that means you can 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.170
 very nice the distance also during the 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.330
 others simply vary the piece 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.489
 number then remove the distance again 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.140
 adjust and pull over it and thereby 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.180
 that really pressure from the front 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.800
 On top of that you do not need any 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.900
 to be afraid that somewhere the whole 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.150
 system slips but it really holds 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.620
 Of course you can only do enough here 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.330
 The distance is simply shortened 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.519
 a few times around the single hagen the whole 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.480
 drum wraps and you have also 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.480
 even a piece more safety
