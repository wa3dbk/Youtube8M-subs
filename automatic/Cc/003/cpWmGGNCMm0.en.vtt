the<00:03:32.890> 66<00:03:33.890> 917<00:03:34.760> just<00:03:35.450> basically<00:03:35.930> because<00:03:36.409> I<00:03:36.890> mean

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
the 66 917 just basically because I mean

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.569 
the 66 917 just basically because I mean
for<00:03:38.870> seventy<00:03:39.230> dollars<00:03:39.530> more<00:03:39.769> you're<00:03:40.430> only

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
for seventy dollars more you're only

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.000 
for seventy dollars more you're only
getting<00:03:40.930> annoyed<00:03:41.930> for<00:03:42.079> three<00:03:42.379> to<00:03:42.500> four<00:03:42.709> more

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
getting annoyed for three to four more

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.150 
getting annoyed for three to four more
frames<00:03:43.310> per<00:03:43.519> second<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:45.530> probably<00:03:45.769> couldn't

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
frames per second you probably couldn't

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.949 
frames per second you probably couldn't
hear<00:03:46.310> me<00:03:46.459> at<00:03:46.519> all<00:03:46.670> there<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.599> explosions<00:03:49.959> but

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
already know how to do that but just

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.900 
already know how to do that but just
look<00:05:06.110> up<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:06.260> charts<00:05:06.740> it's<00:05:07.250> not<00:05:07.430> much<00:05:07.639> of<00:05:07.669> an

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
look up the charts it's not much of an

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.610 
look up the charts it's not much of an
increase<00:05:08.210> between<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:09.199> 6<00:05:09.410> 9<00:05:09.620> 15<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:10.370> 69<00:05:10.880> 70

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.370 
increase between the 6 9 15 and 69 70
but<00:05:12.620> I<00:05:12.650> did<00:05:13.370> flash<00:05:13.699> the<00:05:13.940> BIOS<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:14.570> I<00:05:15.139> did

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
but I did flash the BIOS and I did

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.700 
but I did flash the BIOS and I did
unlock<00:05:15.860> it<00:05:15.889> fully<00:05:16.660> not<00:05:17.660> just<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.050> shaders<00:05:18.470> and

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
unlock it fully not just the shaders and

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.290 
unlock it fully not just the shaders and
it<00:05:19.490> just<00:05:20.020> there's<00:05:21.020> a<00:05:21.139> chance<00:05:21.500> of<00:05:21.940> your<00:05:22.940> memory

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
it just there's a chance of your memory

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.580 
it just there's a chance of your memory
going<00:05:23.630> bad

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
going bad

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.140 
going bad
and<00:05:25.330> overheating<00:05:26.560> issues<00:05:27.560> with<00:05:28.160> unlocking<00:05:28.760> it

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
and overheating issues with unlocking it

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:41.230 
and overheating issues with unlocking it
and<00:05:33.550> with<00:05:34.550> unlocking<00:05:35.000> it<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:35.630> uh<00:05:40.240> unlocking

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
and with unlocking it and uh unlocking

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.170 
and with unlocking it and uh unlocking
the<00:05:41.330> shaders<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:41.780> stuff<00:05:42.400> so<00:05:43.400> it's<00:05:43.700> not<00:05:43.850> really

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
the shaders and stuff so it's not really

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.440 
the shaders and stuff so it's not really
worth<00:05:44.420> the<00:05:44.720> risk<00:05:44.990> in<00:05:45.350> my<00:05:45.650> opinion<00:05:45.950> I<00:05:46.430> mean<00:05:46.820> you

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
worth the risk in my opinion I mean you

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.300 
worth the risk in my opinion I mean you
don't<00:05:47.630> want<00:05:47.840> three<00:05:48.560> hundred<00:05:48.830> bucks<00:05:48.980> to<00:05:49.190> go

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
don't want three hundred bucks to go

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.970 
don't want three hundred bucks to go
down<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.670> drain<00:05:49.850> or<00:05:50.600> how<00:05:51.320> much<00:05:51.500> ever<00:05:51.680> you<00:05:51.770> pay

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
down the drain or how much ever you pay

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.840 
down the drain or how much ever you pay
for<00:05:52.310> it<00:05:52.490> I<00:05:52.670> mean<00:05:53.630> it<00:05:54.320> might<00:05:54.650> not<00:05:54.860> happen<00:05:55.130> but<00:05:55.730> it

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
for it I mean it might not happen but it

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.240 
for it I mean it might not happen but it
could<00:05:56.090> happen<00:05:56.300> also<00:05:56.690> so<00:05:57.440> I<00:05:58.540> would<00:05:59.540> just<00:05:59.720> really

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
could happen also so I would just really

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.900 
could happen also so I would just really
just<00:06:01.450> stick<00:06:02.450> with<00:06:02.600> the<00:06:02.630> 69<00:06:03.110> 50<00:06:03.530> and<00:06:03.860> there's<00:06:04.640> no

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
just stick with the 69 50 and there's no

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.540 
just stick with the 69 50 and there's no
not<00:06:05.480> really<00:06:05.720> any<00:06:06.020> point<00:06:06.260> unlocking<00:06:07.100> it<00:06:07.250> for

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
not really any point unlocking it for

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.260 
not really any point unlocking it for
four<00:06:08.390> to<00:06:08.510> five<00:06:08.540> frames<00:06:09.500> more<00:06:10.070> maybe<00:06:10.520> three<00:06:10.820> in

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
four to five frames more maybe three in

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.230 
four to five frames more maybe three in
some<00:06:11.570> games<00:06:11.780> and<00:06:13.930> but<00:06:14.930> um<00:06:15.170> I<00:06:15.500> actually<00:06:16.310> have

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
getting it in in a couple of days and i

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.550 
getting it in in a couple of days and i
will<00:06:24.680> be<00:06:24.950> doing<00:06:25.130> another<00:06:25.520> benchmark<00:06:26.710> with<00:06:27.710> uh

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
will be doing another benchmark with uh

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.020 
will be doing another benchmark with uh
i'm<00:06:30.560> probably<00:06:30.800> pissing<00:06:31.160> everyone<00:06:31.460> off<00:06:31.520> just

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
i'm probably pissing everyone off just

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.650 
i'm probably pissing everyone off just
running<00:06:32.420> around<00:06:32.480> here<00:06:32.750> not<00:06:32.930> killing<00:06:33.350> anyone

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
running around here not killing anyone

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:43.840 
running around here not killing anyone
there's<00:06:35.660> a<00:06:35.780> guy<00:06:35.990> up<00:06:36.020> there<00:06:42.160> wow<00:06:43.160> I<00:06:43.460> was<00:06:43.640> the

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
there's a guy up there wow I was the

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.330 
there's a guy up there wow I was the
final<00:06:44.240> kill<00:06:44.450> that's<00:06:45.290> pretty<00:06:45.710> embarrassing

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
final kill that's pretty embarrassing

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.380 
final kill that's pretty embarrassing
but<00:06:46.970> um<00:06:47.150> I<00:06:47.560> do<00:06:48.560> have<00:06:49.010> another<00:06:49.040> 650<00:06:49.970> coming<00:06:50.240> in

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
but um I do have another 650 coming in

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.790 
but um I do have another 650 coming in
so<00:06:50.870> i<00:06:51.260> will<00:06:51.500> be<00:06:51.530> doing<00:06:51.860> a<00:06:52.280> crossfire<00:06:52.880> benchmark

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
so i will be doing a crossfire benchmark

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.220 
so i will be doing a crossfire benchmark
with<00:06:54.800> crosses<00:06:55.310> two<00:06:55.490> of<00:06:55.820> course<00:06:56.210> because<00:06:56.930> I

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.230 
with crosses two of course because I

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.290 
with crosses two of course because I
mean<00:06:57.500> it's<00:06:58.010> the<00:06:58.160> most<00:06:58.430> graphically<00:06:58.970> demanding

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
mean it's the most graphically demanding

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.290 
mean it's the most graphically demanding
game<00:06:59.810> out<00:07:00.020> right<00:07:00.230> now<00:07:00.640> so<00:07:02.050> well<00:07:03.050> I<00:07:04.180> don't<00:07:05.180> know

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
game out right now so well I don't know

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.600 
game out right now so well I don't know
maybe<00:07:05.540> crisis<00:07:06.230> is<00:07:06.440> more<00:07:07.010> graphically

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
maybe crisis is more graphically

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.450 
maybe crisis is more graphically
demanding<00:07:07.760> because<00:07:08.300> of<00:07:08.600> the<00:07:09.020> way<00:07:09.170> it<00:07:09.230> was<00:07:11.200> made

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
demanding because of the way it was made

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.990 
demanding because of the way it was made
this<00:07:13.460> game<00:07:13.730> is<00:07:13.910> made<00:07:14.120> a<00:07:14.420> little<00:07:14.840> bit<00:07:14.960> better

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 
this game is made a little bit better

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.690 
this game is made a little bit better
but<00:07:17.000> um<00:07:17.320> I'll<00:07:18.320> have<00:07:18.770> another<00:07:19.010> benchmark<00:07:19.370> can

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:19.700 
but um I'll have another benchmark can

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.680 
but um I'll have another benchmark can
come<00:07:19.820> out<00:07:19.940> with<00:07:20.090> a<00:07:20.120> crossfire<00:07:20.780> so<00:07:21.440> just<00:07:22.190> saw

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 
come out with a crossfire so just saw

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.230 
come out with a crossfire so just saw
stay<00:07:23.690> tuned<00:07:23.960> guys<00:07:24.170> and<00:07:24.700> look<00:07:25.700> out<00:07:25.850> for<00:07:25.910> another
