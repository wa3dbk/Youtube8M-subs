00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.070
 which is nice for me baking 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.170
 is that I am always very happy 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.639
 performs 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.920
 in addition, relaxation is also natural 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.320
 so I put nice music and hope 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.300
 just think about enjoying 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.050
 also make it very nice to bake 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.699
 and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.529
 really something tasty to bring to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.000
 other people that you are the other people too 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.240
 very happy with it 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.219
 so it's fun to be happy 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.219
 coincidence heard and relax 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.010
 I also try special ingredients 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.300
 to put together 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.390
 so for the rest I am sometimes a bit 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.730
 chaotic but now more for the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.350
 competition now I already exercise every day should 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.270
 well say i also like you 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.190
 multiple exercises by l do that whole 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.410
 It is important to be well organized and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.949
 to be cleaned up so that is already one 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.949
 bit of this 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.309
 I graduated in international 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.580
 fashion management 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.729
 and unfortunately there is also some time not whole 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.680
 a lot of work really in fashion management 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.770
 to be found and therefore I am actually 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.500
 continued my blog anyway 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.940
 extend and let that goes there runs 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.759
 actually very nice at the moment 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.330
 also busy setting up a webshop 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.560
 and there I go my own first 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.899
 collection a part of own collection 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.300
 sell and then see if it runs and 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.330
 if that runs then I really go things 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.890
 shopping and it is a very exciting tick 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.890
 I am very curious how that will work out 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.979
 and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.259
 very well I have lived on it 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.509
 moments back with my parents I have in 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.210
 studied Amsterdam and there for a long time 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.580
 in rooms but I am now again 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.200
 back to my parents' house in your 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.770
 home in Belgium 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.890
 they did not have the big flight mine 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.550
 parents who always enjoy very much 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.679
 very much from my baking to the sliders 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.530
 regularity was also on to other people 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.910
 so most of all I make something like me 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.830
 for example, a cake makes for 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.860
 at least 8 people because immediately 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.200
 always on so if it is for dessert or 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.080
 sometimes even as breakfast secretly 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.390
 so yes you really create some sort of 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.900
 piece of art and that is something I really like 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.319
 cool 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.500
 so then of course i am not too 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.690
 compare with room where I feel 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.129
 so that such a growth process every time 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.099
 Now try something else 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.110
 And yes that is very nice that you too 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.540
 comes one step closer every time and 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.790
 who knows that I will soon have that wedding cake 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.050
 may make in that china 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.739
 I would like it if here too 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.500
 Raspberries were in yes then you get yes 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.739
 then coco nuts' interesting things 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.739
 Yes
