is<00:01:46.759> going<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.149> eventually<00:01:47.479> look<00:01:47.929> like<00:01:48.140> this<00:01:48.470> is

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
is going to eventually look like this is

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.800 
is going to eventually look like this is
not<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.979> final<00:01:49.340> product<00:01:50.090> keep<00:01:50.420> this<00:01:50.599> in<00:01:50.780> mind

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
did its job regardless so that is what I

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.290 
did its job regardless so that is what I
kind<00:03:40.010> of<00:03:40.040> see<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.580> seems<00:03:40.880> like<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.030> useless

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
kind of see that it seems like a useless

them and that's what happens so is that
number<00:04:46.180> really<00:04:46.690> you<00:04:46.960> know<00:04:47.110> crucial<00:04:47.710> not

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
number really you know crucial not

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.460 
number really you know crucial not
really<00:04:48.790> it<00:04:48.970> is<00:04:49.330> just<00:04:49.390> bragging<00:04:50.200> rights<00:04:50.380> the

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
really it is just bragging rights the

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.320 
really it is just bragging rights the
algorithm<00:04:51.130> is<00:04:51.250> going<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.730> do<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:52.060> job

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
algorithm is going to do the job

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330 
algorithm is going to do the job
regardless<00:04:52.540> if<00:04:53.140> that<00:04:53.290> number<00:04:53.590> is<00:04:53.620> visibly

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
regardless if that number is visibly

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.850 
regardless if that number is visibly
represented<00:04:55.080> represented<00:04:56.080> in<00:04:56.170> front<00:04:56.680> of<00:04:56.770> you

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
represented represented in front of you

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.850 
represented represented in front of you
or<00:04:57.070> not<00:04:57.310> if<00:04:57.760> you<00:04:57.880> really<00:04:58.390> want<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:59.350> go<00:04:59.470> find<00:04:59.770> out

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
or not if you really want to go find out

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.260 
or not if you really want to go find out
that<00:04:59.980> number<00:05:00.220> you<00:05:00.460> would<00:05:00.550> go<00:05:00.670> take<00:05:00.880> that<00:05:00.910> extra

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
that number you would go take that extra

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.060 
that number you would go take that extra
effort<00:05:01.480> and<00:05:01.900> therefore<00:05:02.380> that<00:05:02.590> will<00:05:02.860> reduce

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
effort and therefore that will reduce

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.830 
effort and therefore that will reduce
the<00:05:03.490> amount<00:05:03.640> of<00:05:03.790> abusers<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.300> cheaters

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
the amount of abusers and cheaters

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.360 
the amount of abusers and cheaters
because<00:05:04.990> eventually<00:05:05.440> that's<00:05:05.920> all<00:05:06.220> people

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
because eventually that's all people

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.190 
because eventually that's all people
really<00:05:06.820> kind<00:05:07.000> of<00:05:07.090> did<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.450> end<00:05:07.630> stages<00:05:07.870> of

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
really kind of did the end stages of

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.710 
really kind of did the end stages of
halo<00:05:08.380> 3's<00:05:08.710> lifespan<00:05:09.220> all<00:05:09.490> it<00:05:09.970> did<00:05:10.150> was<00:05:10.210> like<00:05:10.570> oh

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
halo 3's lifespan all it did was like oh

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.110 
halo 3's lifespan all it did was like oh

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
skill is going to work it's just going

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.659 
skill is going to work it's just going
to<00:05:47.380> be<00:05:47.440> in<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.620> background<00:05:48.010> if<00:05:48.100> you<00:05:48.220> really

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
to be in the background if you really

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.340 
to be in the background if you really
care<00:05:48.940> about<00:05:48.970> seeing<00:05:49.330> that<00:05:49.480> number<00:05:49.750> you<00:05:50.110> can

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
care about seeing that number you can

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.990 
care about seeing that number you can
take<00:05:50.530> the<00:05:50.680> extra<00:05:50.919> step<00:05:51.010> to<00:05:51.400> go<00:05:51.550> find<00:05:51.820> it

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
take the extra step to go find it

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.730 
take the extra step to go find it
through<00:05:52.419> your<00:05:52.510> mobile<00:05:52.660> apps<00:05:53.020> or<00:05:53.260> on<00:05:53.620> your

through your mobile apps or on your
computer<00:05:53.850> now<00:05:54.850> I'm<00:05:55.180> gonna<00:05:55.330> dismiss<00:05:55.840> the

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
computer now I'm gonna dismiss the

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.930 
computer now I'm gonna dismiss the
follow-up<00:05:56.710> question<00:05:57.130> that<00:05:57.250> probably<00:05:57.550> a<00:05:57.640> lot

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
follow-up question that probably a lot

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.860 
follow-up question that probably a lot
of<00:05:58.090> people<00:05:58.180> are<00:05:58.300> going<00:05:58.390> to<00:05:58.479> be<00:05:58.540> talking<00:05:58.660> about

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
of people are going to be talking about

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.080 
of people are going to be talking about
is<00:05:59.110> why<00:05:59.710> is<00:05:59.770> it<00:05:59.950> taking<00:06:00.070> them<00:06:00.340> so<00:06:00.550> long<00:06:00.580> well

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
is why is it taking them so long well

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.880 
is why is it taking them so long well
you<00:06:01.360> have<00:06:01.450> to<00:06:01.570> think<00:06:01.720> halo<00:06:01.990> fours<00:06:02.350> multiplayer

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
you have to think halo fours multiplayer

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.120 
you have to think halo fours multiplayer
experience<00:06:03.490> is<00:06:04.050> quite<00:06:05.050> different<00:06:05.470> compared

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
experience is quite different compared

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.520 
experience is quite different compared
to<00:06:06.280> previous<00:06:06.700> halo<00:06:07.030> games<00:06:07.270> they<00:06:07.510> have<00:06:07.750> not<00:06:07.990> had

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
to previous halo games they have not had

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.190 
to previous halo games they have not had
a<00:06:08.860> accurate<00:06:09.400> unit<00:06:09.850> of<00:06:10.000> measure<00:06:10.270> to<00:06:10.810> base<00:06:11.020> your

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
a accurate unit of measure to base your

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.540 
a accurate unit of measure to base your
true<00:06:11.440> skill<00:06:11.770> they<00:06:12.070> could<00:06:12.280> have<00:06:12.370> matched

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
true skill they could have matched

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.640 
true skill they could have matched
something<00:06:12.880> similar<00:06:13.210> to<00:06:13.240> halo<00:06:13.479> 3<00:06:13.930> but<00:06:14.380> it<00:06:14.470> would

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
something similar to halo 3 but it would

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.690 
something similar to halo 3 but it would
have<00:06:14.740> been<00:06:14.800> different<00:06:15.070> because<00:06:15.280> there's<00:06:15.580> so

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
have been different because there's so

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.950 
have been different because there's so
many<00:06:15.790> new<00:06:16.030> features<00:06:16.240> in<00:06:16.570> Halo<00:06:16.750> 4's

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
many new features in Halo 4's

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.659 
many new features in Halo 4's
multiplayer<00:06:17.470> so<00:06:17.650> what<00:06:17.800> they<00:06:17.950> decided<00:06:18.070> to<00:06:18.460> do

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
multiplayer so what they decided to do

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.020 
multiplayer so what they decided to do
was<00:06:19.600> analyzed<00:06:20.560> data<00:06:20.860> for<00:06:21.250> months<00:06:21.550> after<00:06:21.910> the

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
was analyzed data for months after the
