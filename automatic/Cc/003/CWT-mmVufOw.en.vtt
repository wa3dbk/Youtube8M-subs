hey guys so today I want to check out

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.949 
hey guys so today I want to check out
the<00:00:02.040> battery<00:00:02.490> here<00:00:02.730> for<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.060> galaxy<00:00:03.510> note<00:00:03.540> 2

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
the battery here for the galaxy note 2

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.780 
the battery here for the galaxy note 2
that<00:00:04.350> they<00:00:04.589> say<00:00:04.859> extend<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.310> battery<00:00:05.609> from

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
that they say extend the battery from

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.169 
that they say extend the battery from
Cyril<00:00:06.359> lemon<00:00:06.750> it<00:00:07.440> comes<00:00:07.710> with<00:00:08.130> nine<00:00:08.490> thousand

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
Cyril lemon it comes with nine thousand

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.230 
Cyril lemon it comes with nine thousand
three<00:00:09.780> hundred<00:00:10.050> milliamps<00:00:10.940> which<00:00:11.940> basically

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
three hundred milliamps which basically

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.030 
three hundred milliamps which basically
means<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.110> normal<00:00:13.320> battery<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:14.009> you

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
means that the normal battery that you

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.279 
means that the normal battery that you
would<00:00:14.370> get<00:00:15.199> inside<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.510> galaxy<00:00:19.080> note

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
would get inside of the the galaxy note

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.939 
would get inside of the the galaxy note
2<00:00:19.939> is<00:00:20.939> at<00:00:21.449> around<00:00:23.210> 3100<00:00:24.210> million<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.289> suppose

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
2 is at around 3100 million so I suppose

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.429 
2 is at around 3100 million so I suppose
that<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.250> means<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:27.000> should<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.570> three

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
that that means that it should be three

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.339 
that that means that it should be three
times<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:29.070> much<00:00:29.300> in<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.019> can<00:00:31.170> see

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
times as much in this one you can see

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.389 
times as much in this one you can see
how<00:00:31.560> big<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.890> is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
how big it is

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.540 
how big it is

case<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.670> such<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> huge

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
case so is because this is such a huge

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.569 
case so is because this is such a huge
battery<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.079> really<00:00:46.770> need<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.100> replace<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
battery you really need to replace the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.000 
battery you really need to replace the
whole<00:00:47.610> back<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.140> matte<00:00:49.590> feeling

whole back with this like matte feeling

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.540 
whole back with this like matte feeling
TPU<00:00:50.910> case<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.860> cut<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.219> up

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
TPU case and you can see I cut out up

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.840 
TPU case and you can see I cut out up
here<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.680> cutouts<00:00:55.680> down<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:56.460> well<00:00:56.640> for

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
here and cutouts down here as well for

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
here and cutouts down here as well for
the<00:00:56.940> pen<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.480> such<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.710> should<00:00:58.890> be

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the pen and such so that should be

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.569 
the pen and such so that should be
pretty<00:00:59.219> sweet

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
pretty sweet

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.410 
pretty sweet
so<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.809> them<00:01:01.160> and<00:01:02.160> maybe<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.090> should<00:01:03.270> turn

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
so this is them and maybe we should turn

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:13.600 
so this is them and maybe we should turn
it<00:01:03.480> off

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.360 

so<00:01:14.610> let's<00:01:15.240> remove<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:16.440> normal<00:01:16.860> battery<00:01:17.040> that

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
so let's remove the normal battery that

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.120 
so let's remove the normal battery that
you<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:17.640> first<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:22.200> see<00:01:22.440> this<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you get first you see this is the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:36.010 
you get first you see this is the
battery<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:25.970> let's<00:01:26.970> see<00:01:27.210> does<00:01:27.510> it<00:01:27.660> say<00:01:29.510> no

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.990 

such<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.050> huge<00:01:37.560> battery<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.490> align<00:01:38.790> it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
such a huge battery so you just align it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.090 
such a huge battery so you just align it
first<00:01:41.270> there<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.390> go

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
first there you go

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.690 
first there you go
let's<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.430> how<00:01:44.700> much<00:01:44.970> bigger<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:46.280> it's<00:01:47.280> it's

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
let's see how much bigger and it's it's

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.780 
let's see how much bigger and it's it's
getting<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.660> then<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.890> pretty

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
getting and then we have this pretty

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.560 
getting and then we have this pretty
cool<00:01:52.040> case<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.700> surrounding<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> size

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
cool case that is surrounding the size

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.990 
cool case that is surrounding the size
of<00:01:54.840> your<00:01:54.960> phone<00:01:55.170> as<00:01:55.320> well<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.580> you<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:56.880> see

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
of your phone as well and so you can see

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.109 
of your phone as well and so you can see
how<00:01:57.090> easy<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.720> is<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.080> put<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.350> here<00:01:59.060> see<00:02:03.950> ok<00:02:04.950> so

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
how easy it is to put on here see ok so

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.760 
how easy it is to put on here see ok so
you<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.180> see<00:02:06.300> how<00:02:06.450> much<00:02:06.660> extra<00:02:08.330> extra<00:02:09.360> it

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
you can see how much extra extra it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.190 
you can see how much extra extra it
makes<00:02:10.770> your<00:02:10.920> device<00:02:11.220> look<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.840> really

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
makes your device look like it really

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.130 
makes your device look like it really
looks<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:14.010> lot<00:02:14.459> bigger<00:02:14.790> right<00:02:15.060> now<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.750> has<00:02:15.959> this

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
looks a lot bigger right now it has this

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.540 
looks a lot bigger right now it has this
pretty<00:02:16.560> cool<00:02:16.920> kind<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.700> weight<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:19.550> when

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
pretty cool kind of weight to it when

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.420 
pretty cool kind of weight to it when
device's<00:02:21.000> gets<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.570> little<00:02:22.019> bit<00:02:22.170> bigger<00:02:22.430> and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
device's gets a little bit bigger and

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.310 
device's gets a little bit bigger and
heavier<00:02:23.760> usually<00:02:24.660> they<00:02:24.810> get<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.140> kind<00:02:25.290> of

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
heavier usually they get that kind of

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.729 
heavier usually they get that kind of
nice

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
nice

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:33.460 
nice
iPhone<00:02:26.070> feeling<00:02:26.690> see<00:02:27.690> if<00:02:27.780> we<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:28.019> turn<00:02:28.170> on

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.960 

there<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.530> go<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.250> something<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.610> notice

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
there you go so something that notice

also is with the buttons you have to

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.430 
also is with the buttons you have to
push<00:02:38.549> them<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.030> look<00:02:39.269> it's<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:40.049> little<00:02:40.320> bit

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.600 
push them in a look it's a little bit
you<00:02:41.400> have<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.640> push<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.880> little<00:02:42.000> bit<00:02:42.239> harder<00:02:42.299> to

nice here
kind<00:03:24.159> of<00:03:24.190> like<00:03:24.340> what<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:24.580> like<00:03:24.670> about<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.510> one

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
kind of like what I like about this one

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.140 
kind of like what I like about this one
is<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:25.870> this<00:03:26.409> one<00:03:26.620> is<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:27.310> only<00:03:27.489> one<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:27.970> it

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
is that this one is the only one that it

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.970 
is that this one is the only one that it
kind<00:03:28.330> of<00:03:28.360> runs<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.900> whole<00:03:29.140> phone<00:03:29.470> here<00:03:29.830> on

kind of runs the whole phone here on
sides<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.700> I<00:03:30.940> think<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.450> makes<00:03:31.930> your<00:03:32.170> device

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
sides and I think it makes your device

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.670 
sides and I think it makes your device
stand<00:03:32.860> out<00:03:33.069> a<00:03:33.099> lot<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:35.200> actually<00:03:35.379> feels

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
stand out a lot and it actually feels

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.390 
stand out a lot and it actually feels
very<00:03:36.010> very<00:03:36.099> good<00:03:36.450> it's<00:03:37.450> very<00:03:37.959> very<00:03:38.739> nice<00:03:38.980> side

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
very very good it's very very nice side

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.420 
very very good it's very very nice side
here<00:03:39.760> that<00:03:39.819> feels<00:03:40.180> good<00:03:40.450> in<00:03:40.629> the<00:03:40.660> hand<00:03:41.430> the

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
here that feels good in the hand the

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.610 
here that feels good in the hand the
only<00:03:42.580> main<00:03:43.360> thing<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:43.870> they<00:03:44.110> can<00:03:44.319> probably

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
only main thing that they can probably

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.770 
only main thing that they can probably
improve<00:03:44.920> in<00:03:45.340> future<00:03:45.370> versions<00:03:45.910> is<00:03:46.420> that<00:03:46.660> the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
improve in future versions is that the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.710 
improve in future versions is that the
buttons<00:03:47.140> are<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:48.040> little<00:03:48.430> bit<00:03:48.610> easier<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.120> push

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.869 
buttons are a little bit easier to push
in<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.560> can<00:03:50.709> see<00:03:50.860> here<00:03:51.069> that<00:03:51.160> when<00:03:51.549> I<00:03:51.670> used<00:03:51.819> to

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
in you can see here that when I used to

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.789 
in you can see here that when I used to
normal<00:03:52.269> push<00:03:52.450> like<00:03:52.629> this<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.200> nothing

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
normal push like this and nothing

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.619 
normal push like this and nothing
happens<00:03:54.190> but<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.640> have<00:03:54.909> to<00:03:55.030> push<00:03:55.209> a<00:03:55.239> little<00:03:55.329> bit
