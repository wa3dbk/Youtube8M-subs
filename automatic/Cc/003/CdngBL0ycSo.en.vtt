00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
3 years there's some new ones that I

3 years there's some new ones that I
bought<00:00:20.550> last<00:00:20.760> fall<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.570> even<00:00:22.140> some<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.350> those

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
bought last fall and even some of those

have fruits in our 5 way pear tree has

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.220 
have fruits in our 5 way pear tree has
some<00:00:25.680> tiny<00:00:26.130> fruits<00:00:26.519> which<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.180> hope<00:00:27.420> they<00:00:27.900> stay

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
some tiny fruits which I hope they stay

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.620 
some tiny fruits which I hope they stay
but<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.220> never<00:00:29.400> know<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:29.820> only<00:00:29.970> our<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.210> think

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
but you never know it's only our I think

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.420 
but you never know it's only our I think
2nd<00:00:31.349> year<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.529> think<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.890> only<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.279> tree

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
2nd year I think we only have the tree

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.729 
2nd year I think we only have the tree
for<00:00:32.579> about<00:00:32.759> 18<00:00:33.420> months<00:00:33.570> usually<00:00:34.350> takes<00:00:34.649> about

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
for about 18 months usually takes about

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.400 
for about 18 months usually takes about
2<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.010> 3<00:00:35.250> years<00:00:35.489> till<00:00:35.850> your<00:00:36.450> fruit<00:00:37.230> tree

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
2 to 3 years till your fruit tree

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.350 
2 to 3 years till your fruit tree
matures<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.460> they're<00:00:38.879> able<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.149> bear

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
matures and so they're able to bear

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.389 
matures and so they're able to bear
fruit<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.500> let's<00:00:40.649> take<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> walk<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.190> we'll<00:00:41.280> see

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
fruit so let's take a walk and we'll see

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.850 
fruit so let's take a walk and we'll see
what<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.059> here's<00:00:42.809> our<00:00:42.960> mini<00:00:43.290> orchard

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
from afar so we're going on this row

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.490 
from afar so we're going on this row
here<00:00:46.260> these<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:47.039> our<00:00:47.070> blueberry<00:00:47.820> shrubs

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
here these are our blueberry shrubs

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.990 
here these are our blueberry shrubs
there<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> few<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.280> are<00:00:50.309> stone<00:00:50.670> pots

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
there are a few that are stone pots

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.119 
there are a few that are stone pots
these<00:00:51.930> are<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> ones<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.379> purchased<00:00:52.949> last

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
these are the ones that purchased last

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.939 
these are the ones that purchased last
fall<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.050> need<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.350> get<00:00:55.469> them<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> ground

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
fall so I need to get them in the ground

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.069 
fall so I need to get them in the ground
when<00:00:56.610> they<00:00:57.270> go<00:00:57.390> back<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.570> their<00:00:57.719> dormant

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
when they go back to their dormant

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.139 
when they go back to their dormant
dormancy<00:00:58.770> stage<00:00:59.160> which<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.579> gonna<00:00:59.850> be<00:01:00.030> this

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
dormancy stage which is gonna be this

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.080 
dormancy stage which is gonna be this
fall<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.530> top-hat<00:01:02.010> blueberry<00:01:02.520> so

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
fall when it's a top-hat blueberry so

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.250 
fall when it's a top-hat blueberry so
this<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> smaller<00:01:03.840> variety<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.990> one

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
this is a smaller variety and this one

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.719 
this is a smaller variety and this one
here<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> believe<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.310> blue<00:01:08.520> Jade

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
here I believe it's a blue Jade

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.060 
here I believe it's a blue Jade
blueberry<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:10.409> if<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.770> for

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
blueberry I think if you have this for

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.020 
blueberry I think if you have this for
almost<00:01:11.430> 3<00:01:11.880> years<00:01:12.860> there's<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.130> few<00:01:14.460> flowers<00:01:14.880> in

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
almost 3 years there's a few flowers in

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.370 
almost 3 years there's a few flowers in
there<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:17.670> 3<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> half<00:01:18.900> feet<00:01:19.049> tall

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
there it's about 3 and a half feet tall

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.609 
there it's about 3 and a half feet tall
now<00:01:20.750> there's<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:21.869> flowers<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:22.500> as

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
now there's more flowers in there as

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.609 
now there's more flowers in there as
well<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.580> Blue<00:01:23.850> Jay<00:01:24.090> blueberry<00:01:24.479> bush<00:01:25.229> I

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
well this Blue Jay blueberry bush I

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.859 
well this Blue Jay blueberry bush I
think<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.070> later<00:01:26.280> variety<00:01:26.880> synthesis<00:01:27.720> now

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
think it's a later variety synthesis now

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.810 
think it's a later variety synthesis now
getting<00:01:28.200> flowers<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:29.070> are<00:01:29.100> some<00:01:29.430> here<00:01:29.670> that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
getting flowers there are some here that

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.450 
getting flowers there are some here that
already<00:01:30.210> has<00:01:30.420> some<00:01:30.450> fruits<00:01:31.040> like<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.280> one

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
already has some fruits like this one

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.030 
already has some fruits like this one
here<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.030> blugold<00:01:33.509> variety<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.979> you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
here it is this blugold variety so you

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.499 
here it is this blugold variety so you
can<00:01:35.159> see<00:01:35.369> we've<00:01:35.610> got<00:01:35.640> some<00:01:35.759> fruits<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.360> there

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
can see we've got some fruits in there

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.740 
can see we've got some fruits in there
already

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
already

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.219 
already
there's<00:01:39.750> more<00:01:40.229> inside<00:01:40.710> there<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.780> we've<00:01:42.960> got

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
there's more inside there and we've got

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.219 
there's more inside there and we've got
let's<00:01:43.799> see<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.930> Chippewa

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
let's see this is Chippewa

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.160 
let's see this is Chippewa
I<00:01:46.259> think<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.619> pronounced<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.750> think

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170

this<00:03:03.890> plant<00:03:04.190> for<00:03:04.460> about<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:05.090> year<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.900> half

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
this plant for about a year and a half

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.400 
this plant for about a year and a half
we'll<00:03:07.730> see<00:03:07.970> they've<00:03:08.390> had<00:03:08.600> flowers<00:03:08.810> last<00:03:09.200> year

but<00:03:09.560> they<00:03:09.650> fell<00:03:09.860> off<00:03:10.100> so<00:03:10.640> we'll<00:03:10.820> see<00:03:11.030> if<00:03:11.150> they

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
but they fell off so we'll see if they

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.110 
but they fell off so we'll see if they
stay<00:03:11.600> this<00:03:11.840> year<00:03:12.220> four<00:03:13.220> more<00:03:13.400> here<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:13.640> believe

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
stay this year four more here I believe

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.870

that well as as well as this one here
and<00:03:33.080> we<00:03:34.010> planted<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:34.730> about<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.090> same<00:03:35.360> time

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
would have these two dwarf apple trees

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.460 
would have these two dwarf apple trees
now<00:03:55.130> over<00:03:55.430> here<00:03:55.790> this<00:03:56.090> is<00:03:56.150> our<00:03:56.480> five<00:03:56.900> way<00:03:57.170> pear

way<00:04:32.520> is<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:32.940> plum<00:04:33.419> tree<00:04:33.450> we've<00:04:34.139> had<00:04:34.320> this<00:04:34.610> tree

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
way is a plum tree we've had this tree

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.330 
way is a plum tree we've had this tree
here<00:04:35.940> we<00:04:36.450> move<00:04:36.720> them<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:36.990> house<00:04:37.169> so<00:04:37.560> this

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
here we move them to the house so this

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.400 
here we move them to the house so this
has<00:04:38.490> been<00:04:38.639> here<00:04:38.700> up<00:04:39.360> for<00:04:39.570> I'm<00:04:39.960> not<00:04:40.080> sure<00:04:40.139> how

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
has been here up for I'm not sure how

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.610 
has been here up for I'm not sure how
long<00:04:40.880> but<00:04:41.880> some<00:04:42.060> mature<00:04:42.360> tree<00:04:42.690> there's<00:04:43.260> lots

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
long but some mature tree there's lots

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.610 
long but some mature tree there's lots
of<00:04:43.919> tiny<00:04:44.639> green<00:04:45.030> fruits<00:04:46.130> as<00:04:47.130> you<00:04:47.250> can<00:04:47.430> see<00:04:48.620> so

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
of tiny green fruits as you can see so

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.590 
of tiny green fruits as you can see so
now<00:04:50.250> not<00:04:50.460> all<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.610> them<00:04:50.850> stay<00:04:51.090> in<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.300> tree

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
now not all of them stay in the tree

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.690 
now not all of them stay in the tree
when<00:04:52.169> we<00:04:52.320> have<00:04:52.620> rainstorms<00:04:53.400> during<00:04:53.639> the

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
when we have rainstorms during the

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.690 
when we have rainstorms during the
springtime<00:04:53.970> they<00:04:54.270> get<00:04:55.050> blown<00:04:55.230> off<00:04:55.520> but<00:04:56.520> when<00:04:56.669> a

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
springtime they get blown off but when a

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.940 
springtime they get blown off but when a
lot<00:04:56.910> of<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.180> plums<00:04:57.630> mature<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.620> squirrels

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
lot of the plums mature the squirrels

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.770 
lot of the plums mature the squirrels
get<00:04:59.190> to<00:04:59.280> them<00:04:59.430> first<00:04:59.610> before<00:04:59.850> we<00:05:00.030> do<00:05:00.330> some<00:05:00.750> of

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
get to them first before we do some of

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.780 
get to them first before we do some of
them<00:05:01.020> are<00:05:01.500> all<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.980> way<00:05:02.070> in<00:05:02.160> top<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.520> trees

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
them are all the way in top of the trees

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.060 
them are all the way in top of the trees
so<00:05:02.880> it's<00:05:03.030> hard<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.240> get<00:05:03.450> to<00:05:03.690> so<00:05:04.560> once<00:05:04.740> we<00:05:04.860> see<00:05:05.040> a

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
so it's hard to get to so once we see a

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.580 
so it's hard to get to so once we see a
few<00:05:05.310> plums<00:05:05.550> plums<00:05:06.180> in<00:05:06.419> there<00:05:06.630> we<00:05:07.140> try<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.380> grab

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
few plums plums in there we try to grab

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.800 
few plums plums in there we try to grab
them<00:05:07.710> as<00:05:07.830> fast<00:05:08.010> as<00:05:08.130> we<00:05:08.250> can<00:05:08.600> took<00:05:09.600> a<00:05:09.690> walk

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810

the dwarf trees and over that way we

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.270 
the dwarf trees and over that way we
have<00:05:14.610> two<00:05:14.729> plum<00:05:15.000> tree<00:05:15.620> now<00:05:16.620> we're<00:05:16.800> over<00:05:16.979> on
