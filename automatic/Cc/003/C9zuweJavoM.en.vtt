thing's use what we've discovered in
this<00:04:00.340> video<00:04:00.670> is<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.600> new<00:04:01.750> darts<00:04:02.080> are

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
this video is that the new darts are

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.750 
this video is that the new darts are
better<00:04:02.380> despite<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:03.010> fact<00:04:03.160> they<00:04:03.280> Jam<00:04:03.550> more

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
better despite the fact they Jam more

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.490 
better despite the fact they Jam more
they're<00:04:04.540> better<00:04:04.780> because<00:04:05.050> they<00:04:05.140> have<00:04:05.320> your

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
they're better because they have your

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.240 
they're better because they have your
only<00:04:05.650> travel<00:04:05.980> further<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:08.830> has<00:04:09.010> been<00:04:09.040> a

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
only travel further so this has been a

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.430 
only travel further so this has been a
very<00:04:09.490> weirdly<00:04:10.060> mainly<00:04:10.750> because<00:04:10.870> you<00:04:11.170> haven't

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
very weirdly mainly because you haven't

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.660 
very weirdly mainly because you haven't
achieved<00:04:11.500> what<00:04:11.890> we've<00:04:12.010> been<00:04:12.130> looking<00:04:12.310> to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
achieved what we've been looking to

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.900 
achieved what we've been looking to
achieve<00:04:16.470> something<00:04:17.470> very<00:04:17.920> more<00:04:18.100> in<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.580> lot

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
achieve something very more in a lot

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.200 
achieve something very more in a lot
probably<00:04:19.269> more<00:04:19.690> interesting<00:04:20.350> because

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
probably more interesting because

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
probably more interesting because
there's<00:04:22.210> probably<00:04:22.450> going<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.630> be<00:04:22.690> about<00:04:22.780> 500

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
there's probably going to be about 500

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.860 
there's probably going to be about 500
