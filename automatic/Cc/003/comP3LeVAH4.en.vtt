00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.440
 a small amaranth processing plant has become the sustenance 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.980
 of a community 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.030
 It is the dream of a doctor who as a child traveled with his father through marginalized sites 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.260
 around the world and that as a young man he dared to believe that it was possible to achieve 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.240
 a sustainable development project that transforms reality is and of course 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.630
 will bring profit 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.550
 he started the download 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.880
 a typical foral community in Hidalgo 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.109
 today the company san miguel has contracts with food companies 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.109
 international and if this text advances 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.590
 it's lunch time at the san miguel plant of agricultural projects 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.120
 as every day at 11 in the morning the relatives of the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.120
 First shift workers come down from the village when food arrives 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.790
 the employees were born as they live from the town of Huesca until 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.440
 an Otomí rural population in the municipality of Huichapan Hidalgo 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.220
 where an amaranth-producing plant became the fundamental axis of the 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.620
 community life 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.160
 The Smurfs have been calling them for 25 years when Dr. Benito Manrique 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.290
 de lara came to town to start the project 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.840
 in this environment 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.100
 but is that on the one hand people will want to lose 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.770
 the orchard 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.369
 eight or ten agents 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.400
 disguised Antilleans cyrus 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.400
 where you pepe pon regions of the south 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.470
 it's the uniform and everyone uses it equally 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.410
 including the president of the company siec that prohibits its workers 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.700
 call it pattern 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.970
 and the child god this Monday Chinese office 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.000
 they dressed her in uniform 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.790
 at all times to occur both 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.180
 the images from which egypt third shift 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.140
 in February 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.710
 the first filter 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.550
 good soil prior to psoe 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.980
 the record was relayed 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.850
 hamilton who is also the village doctor 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.080
 he likes to think of the company as if it were a ship 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.560
 I told him this is a clint dempsey project to solve 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.300
 according to the specific day 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.999
 that links the business cycle 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:13.999
 with the social fabric and that maximizes the formation of human capital 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.759
 He stressed that the company 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:22.419
 I'm just for a while the captain of this ship with all the 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:26.619
 view from scratch that other crewmen took enders 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.659
 the oldest crewman that simon 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.999
 He is almost 80 years old when he started as a watchman his booth was made of cardboard and 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:41.019
 village was another there were no light roads nor drinking water and among the children there was 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.229
 an index of malnutrition 67% 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:45.519
 number two 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.529
 Frank 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.529
 according to his age as there was not even everything 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:51.439
 no one 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.249
 nothing of movements more freedom to the people its bet 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:58.709
 from everything to starvation 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.939
 most squats 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.689
 for a pact not 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.979
 a touching as a home 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:09.249
 changed for him north pole like stingrays every round 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.579
 of home 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.839
 we have very few houses are land 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:19.089
 with municipal resources of the company and community labor have been made 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:23.979
 works like the plaza the auditorium the telesecundaria the soccer field and the 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.769
 computer center recently transformed into the community center of 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.009
 learning is taught with internet and online studies 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:35.970
 and I'm studying this wine so there are no problems in the web pages 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.260
 and this is an inspection platform for many 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.129
 malnutrition is rooted 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.120
 once a month the population receives a pantry of amaranth products to 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.159
 children 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.510
 this is one more step but only to those who give the children 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.530
 farfán also thanks to the external help 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.669
 did not clarify anything similar and 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.289
 the Basque group with the French brand panama the armed forces after 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:03.769
 one week arrives 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.769
 let's make things better 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:09.380
 sandra and apolinar 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.429
 they are two of the 60 inhabitants of huesca until they work in san miguel 

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:16.479
 they met inti then they formed a family 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.819
 she is one of the first two operators that the company had 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.819
 know by heart the amaranth production process 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.270
 the organism that is the technological heart of san miguel in rates of 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.229
 stress 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.490
 the machine more 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.520
 most important affiliate on this machine is in vain 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:38.309
 let's fly the raw amaranth grain 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.539
 apolinar has been in the maintenance area for 17 years 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.469
 now as a supervisor 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:45.800
 between your orders 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.759
 is the development of machinery like the one that is now being designed by a prototype 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.759
 gas amaranth burners for communities without electricity 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.539
 as most of the men of the village apollinate and their companions 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.699
 have been migrants however they conceive that little by little the phenomenon 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:03.809
 has been reducing 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:06.879
 and it has even begun to present in reverse 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.959
 People know that if they return they will have a job and a quiet life 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:11.930
 when I arrived at 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.300
 or when they return 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.809
 United States 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:16.009
 this 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.650
 immediately they are integrated to the company san miguel then this one 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.240
 yes they do not lose the rhythm of working 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.819
 the state 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.370
 forming the company 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.999
 where they are showing us that we have to make this car sustainable 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.939
 which will value or revalue 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:37.520
 labor work from the field 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.949
 this and that he 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.489
 here all of us can do something else 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.919
 So that's what has adjusted the city people to say 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.919
 something different is breathed in this town the league soccer champion 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:55.949
 municipal 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:56.750
 that also 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.639
 he has managed to remain armored to the crime 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:02.830
 the equaled and we do not have as well as for example 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.870
 from the bottom for the population 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.080
 there was an optimal time for girls who are there 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.339
 no teenagers take German streets 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:14.339
 I do not consider myself a ball on the court two weeks 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:18.479
 like theater other places vandingenen 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.479
 I went into an uncomfortable and communications cicomra 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.019
 at 22 years old, she has been 17 linked to the company 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.710
 was part of the second generation of the small crisis 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.440
 an organization made up of boys and girls of the town who do work 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.430
 community and play to work in san miguel producing water flavoring 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:43.819
 taking your blind ornament box or with your own accounting 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:48.770
 jiang only the friendly ones he had clear he wanted to be part of 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.120
 a 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.719
 solution the world that wants to live 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:52.630
 uscanga 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.560
 I am not marginalized and it is 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.360
 an agent that belongs to economic cycles from our 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.840
 productive activity such as amaranth
