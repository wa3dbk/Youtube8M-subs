00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the body we're left with I think we

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.260 
the body we're left with I think we
should<00:00:43.620> cover<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.309> bases<00:00:44.700> if<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:44.969> want<00:00:45.210> to

should cover all the bases if we want to
DK<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> win<00:00:46.110> then<00:00:46.860> why<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.340> each<00:00:47.579> take

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
DK to win then why don't we each take

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.590 
DK to win then why don't we each take
category<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.690> help<00:00:48.870> coach<00:00:49.110> detail<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:52.440> take
