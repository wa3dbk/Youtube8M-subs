00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.380 

the<00:00:06.680> inspiration<00:00:06.920> of<00:00:07.190> the<00:00:07.340> design<00:00:07.610> of<00:00:07.760> TRC

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:08.390 
the inspiration of the design of TRC

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.410 
the inspiration of the design of TRC
started<00:00:09.050> from<00:00:09.290> our<00:00:09.500> package<00:00:09.860> concept<00:00:10.820> that

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
started from our package concept that

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.190 
started from our package concept that
this<00:00:11.570> was<00:00:11.750> a<00:00:11.780> basement<00:00:12.500> platform<00:00:13.780> very<00:00:14.780> safety

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
this was a basement platform very safety

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.670 
this was a basement platform very safety
and<00:00:15.430> protective<00:00:16.779> this<00:00:17.779> vehicle<00:00:18.110> I<00:00:18.230> considered

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
and protective this vehicle I considered

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.400 
and protective this vehicle I considered
this<00:00:18.770> vehicle<00:00:19.189> as<00:00:19.310> a<00:00:19.340> car<00:00:19.840> in<00:00:20.840> order<00:00:21.170> to

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
this vehicle as a car in order to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.490 
this vehicle as a car in order to
provide<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.850> the<00:00:23.510> current<00:00:23.869> diffuse<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:24.320> car

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
provide the the current diffuse the car

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.310 
provide the the current diffuse the car
usage<00:00:24.890> in<00:00:25.100> the<00:00:25.160> future<00:00:25.670> a<00:00:25.880> solution<00:00:26.630> for<00:00:27.170> the

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
usage in the future a solution for the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.930 
usage in the future a solution for the
bad<00:00:27.470> water<00:00:27.710> condition<00:00:28.220> and<00:00:28.430> the<00:00:28.550> traffic

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
bad water condition and the traffic

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.979 
bad water condition and the traffic
condition<00:00:29.480> in<00:00:29.810> a<00:00:29.869> city<00:00:30.619> as<00:00:30.890> mallanna<00:00:31.250> is<00:00:31.989> now

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
condition in a city as mallanna is now

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.020 
condition in a city as mallanna is now
in<00:00:33.199> this<00:00:33.620> moment<00:00:33.830> there<00:00:34.190> are<00:00:34.280> too<00:00:34.550> many<00:00:34.699> cars

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
in this moment there are too many cars

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.080 
in this moment there are too many cars
in<00:00:35.269> this<00:00:35.660> in<00:00:35.960> this<00:00:36.110> in<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.410> cities<00:00:36.940> and<00:00:37.940> this

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
in this in this in the cities and this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.690 
in this in this in the cities and this
is<00:00:38.210> so<00:00:38.329> difficult<00:00:38.570> to<00:00:38.960> find<00:00:39.559> parking<00:00:40.399> places

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
is so difficult to find parking places

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.400 
is so difficult to find parking places
to<00:00:41.480> find<00:00:41.860> to<00:00:42.860> go<00:00:43.520> also<00:00:43.700> to<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:44.450> to<00:00:45.140> drive

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
to find to go also to to to drive

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.979 
to find to go also to to to drive
industry<00:00:45.950> in<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.760> street<00:00:47.030> that's<00:00:47.570> why<00:00:47.780> I

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
industry in the street that's why I

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.770 
industry in the street that's why I
think<00:00:48.140> this<00:00:48.710> could<00:00:48.950> be<00:00:49.010> considered<00:00:49.340> as<00:00:49.730> a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
think this could be considered as a

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.229 
think this could be considered as a
substitution<00:00:50.780> of<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.170> car<00:00:51.379> or<00:00:51.590> some<00:00:52.399> kind<00:00:53.149> of

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
substitution of a car or some kind of

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.260 
substitution of a car or some kind of
mix<00:00:53.510> between<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:54.290> car<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:54.590> a<00:00:55.090> scooter<00:00:56.090> or<00:00:56.120> a

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
mix between a car and a scooter or a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.569 
mix between a car and a scooter or a
bike<00:00:56.510> as<00:00:57.200> you<00:00:57.350> want<00:00:57.559> because<00:00:58.100> there's<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.430> very

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
bike as you want because there's a very

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.220 
bike as you want because there's a very
good<00:00:58.879> point<00:00:59.420> of<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.750> car

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
good point of a car

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.590 
good point of a car
there's<00:01:00.590> as<00:01:00.890> a<00:01:00.920> safety<00:01:01.399> as<00:01:01.579> a<00:01:02.980> stability<00:01:04.600> and

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
there's as a safety as a stability and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.800 
there's as a safety as a stability and
there's<00:01:06.080> all<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.619> good<00:01:06.860> points<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:07.509> bike<00:01:08.509> or

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
there's all the good points that bike or

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.800 
there's all the good points that bike or
scooter<00:01:09.050> has<00:01:09.440> so<00:01:09.979> that<00:01:10.160> means<00:01:10.369> is<00:01:10.940> not<00:01:11.209> so<00:01:11.479> so

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
scooter has so that means is not so so

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.100 
scooter has so that means is not so so
big<00:01:12.050> so<00:01:12.380> small<00:01:13.039> and<00:01:13.280> it's<00:01:13.789> protective<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:14.539> is

big so small and it's protective and is

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.730 
big so small and it's protective and is
fun<00:01:15.440> to<00:01:15.590> drive<00:01:15.709> as<00:01:16.009> a<00:01:16.039> bike

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.460 

when<00:01:19.700> I<00:01:19.730> see<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.060> sitting<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:21.050> first<00:01:21.290> time

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
when I see the sitting the first time

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.830 
when I see the sitting the first time
inside<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:21.920> waiter<00:01:22.220> it<00:01:22.550> was<00:01:22.760> it<00:01:23.240> was<00:01:23.390> amazing

the driver inside

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.760 
the driver inside
the<00:02:03.399> unique<00:02:03.640> part<00:02:03.969> of<00:02:04.090> this<00:02:04.299> concept<00:02:04.810> is<00:02:05.020> the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
the unique part of this concept is the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.270 
the unique part of this concept is the
system<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.399> opening<00:02:06.850> I<00:02:07.090> mean<00:02:07.890> when<00:02:08.890> it's<00:02:09.039> park

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
system of opening I mean when it's park

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.300 
system of opening I mean when it's park
it<00:02:09.459> it's<00:02:10.000> closed<00:02:10.390> as<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.200> shelter<00:02:11.560> but<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:11.950> really

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
it it's closed as a shelter but I really

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.729 
it it's closed as a shelter but I really
like<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.760> system<00:02:13.269> when<00:02:13.480> out<00:02:13.750> open<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.500> how<00:02:14.680> to

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
like the system when out open and how to

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.580 
like the system when out open and how to
close<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.280> because<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:17.050> think<00:02:17.290> it's

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
close it because it's a I think it's

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.229 
close it because it's a I think it's
really<00:02:17.769> intimate<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.310> idea<00:02:18.550> it's<00:02:18.849> a<00:02:18.970> really

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
really intimate of idea it's a really

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.780 
really intimate of idea it's a really
new<00:02:19.390> idea<00:02:19.660> that's<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.260> it's<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.769> kind<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.099> new

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
new idea that's so it's a kind of new

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.360 
new idea that's so it's a kind of new
