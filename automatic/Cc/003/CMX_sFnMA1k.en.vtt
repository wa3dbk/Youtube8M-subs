custom printing or anything like that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
custom printing or anything like that
these<00:01:09.479> are<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.720> parts<00:01:10.140> from<00:01:10.350> other

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
these are all parts from other

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.149 
these are all parts from other
minifigures<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:12.080> there's<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> back<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
minifigures and there's the back and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.460 
minifigures and there's the back and
he's<00:01:14.369> got<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.790> green<00:01:15.509> files<00:01:15.810> which<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.290> thought

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
he's got all green files which I thought

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.760 
he's got all green files which I thought
worked<00:01:16.710> perfectly<00:01:17.390> with<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> green<00:01:19.229> syringe

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
worked perfectly with the green syringe

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.520 
worked perfectly with the green syringe
there<00:01:20.119> because<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.840> whole<00:01:21.990> point<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.500> that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
there because the whole point is that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.830 
there because the whole point is that
he's<00:01:22.979> been<00:01:23.220> doing<00:01:23.460> testing<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.210> bats<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
he's been doing testing with bats and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.810 
he's been doing testing with bats and
that's<00:01:25.770> how<00:01:25.920> he<00:01:25.979> becomes<00:01:26.460> man-bat<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:28.310> I<00:01:29.310> did

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
that's how he becomes man-bat and I did

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.819 
that's how he becomes man-bat and I did
not<00:01:29.970> include<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.390> second<00:01:30.659> face<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:31.049> him<00:01:31.259> by<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
not include a second face on him by the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:32.030 
not include a second face on him by the
way

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
way

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.390 
way
and<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:32.820> you've<00:01:33.479> got<00:01:33.509> man-bat<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:34.590> which<00:01:35.130> I

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and then you've got man-bat here which I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.219 
and then you've got man-bat here which I
don't<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.970> changed<00:01:36.180> at<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.630> I'm<00:01:36.990> almost

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
don't think I changed at all I'm almost

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870 
don't think I changed at all I'm almost
positive<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.070> exact<00:01:38.369> same<00:01:38.520> figure

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
positive this is the exact same figure

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.160 
positive this is the exact same figure
that<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.150> included<00:01:39.619> when<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.650> first<00:01:40.950> did<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:42.170> so

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
that I included when I first did it so

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.230 
that I included when I first did it so
you<00:01:43.619> guys<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:44.009> what<00:01:44.250> man-bat<00:01:44.790> looks<00:01:45.060> like

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you guys know what man-bat looks like

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.289 
you guys know what man-bat looks like
now<00:01:45.530> now<00:01:46.530> Lego<00:01:47.220> has<00:01:47.369> never<00:01:47.579> made<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> man<00:01:48.090> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
now now Lego has never made a man that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.760 
now now Lego has never made a man that
they<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.840> made<00:01:50.780> figures<00:01:51.780> very<00:01:52.200> similar<00:01:52.619> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
they have made figures very similar to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.440 
they have made figures very similar to
that<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.340> monster<00:01:53.729> fighter<00:01:53.909> sets<00:01:54.240> but

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
that in the monster fighter sets but

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.959 
that in the monster fighter sets but
that's<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.930> then<00:01:55.770> we've<00:01:55.920> got<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.520> old

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
that's it and then we've got the old

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.359 
that's it and then we've got the old
black<00:01:57.600> Batman<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:59.369> the<00:02:00.090> new<00:02:00.270> cowl<00:02:00.600> I

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
black Batman here with the new cowl I

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.770 
black Batman here with the new cowl I
really<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> old<00:02:02.820> Batman<00:02:03.299> because<00:02:03.600> it's

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
really like the old Batman because it's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.660 
really like the old Batman because it's
the<00:02:03.990> black<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.619> got<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> gold<00:02:05.130> accent

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the black and it's got the gold accent

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.240 
the black and it's got the gold accent
with<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.570> also<00:02:06.689> did<00:02:07.259> give<00:02:07.439> him<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.829> Batarang

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
with it and also did give him a Batarang

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.150 
with it and also did give him a Batarang
right<00:02:08.670> here<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.679> thought<00:02:10.679> about<00:02:10.800> including

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
right here I thought about including

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.070 
right here I thought about including
more<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.879> older<00:02:12.239> weapons<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.780> decided

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
more of the older weapons but I decided

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.559 
more of the older weapons but I decided
to

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
to

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.229 
to
go<00:02:13.659> with<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:14.439> the<00:02:14.530> Batarang<00:02:15.249> you've<00:02:15.909> got<00:02:16.060> no

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
go with just the Batarang you've got no

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.280 
go with just the Batarang you've got no
back<00:02:16.450> printing<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:19.239> just<00:02:19.810> wanted<00:02:19.989> to<00:02:20.109> share

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
back printing but I just wanted to share

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.379 
back printing but I just wanted to share
that<00:02:20.349> with<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.739> guys<00:02:20.969> those<00:02:21.969> are<00:02:21.999> the<00:02:22.239> figures

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:22.389 
that with you guys those are the figures

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.500 
that with you guys those are the figures
that<00:02:22.599> I<00:02:22.810> chose<00:02:23.109> to<00:02:23.799> include<00:02:24.340> with<00:02:24.579> this<00:02:24.700> set<00:02:24.909> so

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
that I chose to include with this set so

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.289 
that I chose to include with this set so
let's<00:02:25.689> look<00:02:25.870> at<00:02:26.019> this<00:02:26.170> updated<00:02:26.889> lab<00:02:27.299> alright

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
let's look at this updated lab alright

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.720 
let's look at this updated lab alright
so<00:02:28.510> here's<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.079> lab<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:30.280> first<00:02:30.489> thing<00:02:30.670> I

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
so here's the lab and the first thing I

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.059 
so here's the lab and the first thing I
want<00:02:30.909> to<00:02:30.969> point<00:02:31.299> out<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.719> that<00:02:31.769> you<00:02:32.769> can<00:02:32.920> see

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
want to point out is that you can see

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.509 
want to point out is that you can see
how<00:02:33.219> man-bat<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.939> hanging<00:02:34.359> right<00:02:34.540> there<00:02:34.599> and

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
how man-bat is hanging right there and

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.550 
how man-bat is hanging right there and
he's<00:02:36.519> just<00:02:36.549> attached<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.420> one<00:02:38.109> little<00:02:38.260> piece

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
he's just attached to one little piece

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.780 
he's just attached to one little piece
right<00:02:38.739> there<00:02:38.889> I<00:02:41.489> see<00:02:42.489> that<00:02:43.859> and<00:02:44.859> that's<00:02:45.489> one

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
right there I see that and that's one

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.179 
right there I see that and that's one
thing<00:02:45.969> that<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.510> did<00:02:46.870> keep<00:02:47.169> from<00:02:47.530> my<00:02:47.709> original

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
thing that I did keep from my original

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.050 
thing that I did keep from my original
design<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.849> I<00:02:49.840> did<00:02:50.439> actually<00:02:50.799> have<00:02:51.280> two<00:02:51.609> spots

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
design and I did actually have two spots

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.000 
design and I did actually have two spots
for<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:52.419> in<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.689> original<00:02:52.989> one<00:02:53.169> but<00:02:53.980> I

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
for that in the original one but I

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.140 
for that in the original one but I
thought<00:02:54.280> as<00:02:54.430> long<00:02:54.549> as<00:02:54.699> they<00:02:54.790> were<00:02:54.849> still

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
thought as long as they were still

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.179 
thought as long as they were still
wanted<00:02:55.540> be<00:02:55.659> good<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.469> I<00:02:56.739> want<00:02:56.919> to<00:02:57.010> kind<00:02:57.159> of

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
wanted be good and I want to kind of

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.979 
wanted be good and I want to kind of
give<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.370> like<00:02:57.849> a<00:02:57.879> little<00:02:58.120> overview<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
give you like a little overview of the

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.789 
give you like a little overview of the
set<00:02:59.260> and<00:03:00.159> let<00:03:00.609> you<00:03:00.730> see<00:03:01.000> from<00:03:01.959> all<00:03:02.139> angles<00:03:02.409> what

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
set and let you see from all angles what

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.099 
set and let you see from all angles what
it<00:03:02.889> looks<00:03:03.069> like<00:03:03.299> including<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.389> back<00:03:04.569> because

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
it looks like including the back because

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.720 
it looks like including the back because
I<00:03:05.199> did<00:03:05.349> add<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.650> little<00:03:05.949> bit<00:03:06.129> more<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.549> back

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
I did add a little bit more to the back

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.300 
I did add a little bit more to the back
also<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.870> have<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.139> windows<00:03:08.530> back<00:03:08.799> here<00:03:08.829> and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
also you have the windows back here and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.869 
also you have the windows back here and
there's<00:03:09.730> also<00:03:09.939> a<00:03:10.739> exploding<00:03:11.739> glass<00:03:12.189> feature

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
there's also a exploding glass feature

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.869 
there's also a exploding glass feature
basically<00:03:13.469> where<00:03:14.469> man-bat<00:03:15.310> will<00:03:15.459> be<00:03:15.579> able<00:03:15.699> to

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
basically where man-bat will be able to

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.819 
basically where man-bat will be able to
fly<00:03:16.389> through<00:03:16.629> there<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.409> just<00:03:17.439> push<00:03:17.799> down

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
fly through there and you just push down

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.059 
fly through there and you just push down
on<00:03:18.069> that<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.639> the<00:03:19.000> glass<00:03:19.229> pops<00:03:20.229> out<00:03:20.439> like<00:03:20.650> that

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
on that and the glass pops out like that

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.659 
on that and the glass pops out like that
it's<00:03:21.849> pretty<00:03:22.060> simple<00:03:23.109> and<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:24.189> just<00:03:24.370> wanted<00:03:24.549> to

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
it's pretty simple and I just wanted to

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.809 
it's pretty simple and I just wanted to
do<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:25.000> because<00:03:25.359> I<00:03:26.259> tried<00:03:27.069> some<00:03:27.340> different

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
do that because I tried some different

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.929 
do that because I tried some different
methods<00:03:28.000> for<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.569> glass<00:03:28.810> but<00:03:29.680> man-bat<00:03:30.310> with

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
methods for the glass but man-bat with

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.020 
methods for the glass but man-bat with
his<00:03:31.470> wings<00:03:32.470> spread<00:03:32.709> out<00:03:33.040> actually<00:03:33.459> could<00:03:33.879> not

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
his wings spread out actually could not

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.759 
his wings spread out actually could not
fit<00:03:34.299> through<00:03:34.449> most<00:03:34.569> of<00:03:34.900> them

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
fit through most of them

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.619 
fit through most of them
whereas<00:03:36.310> this<00:03:36.519> one<00:03:36.579> he<00:03:36.939> can<00:03:37.090> actually<00:03:37.419> fit

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
whereas this one he can actually fit

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.110 
whereas this one he can actually fit
through<00:03:37.900> which<00:03:38.739> is<00:03:38.889> why<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.069> went<00:03:39.759> with<00:03:39.849> this

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
through which is why I went with this

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.449 
through which is why I went with this
because<00:03:41.879> you<00:03:42.879> can<00:03:43.060> see<00:03:43.530> he<00:03:44.530> does<00:03:44.709> fit<00:03:45.040> across

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
because you can see he does fit across

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.640 
because you can see he does fit across
there<00:03:45.790> like<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.479> so<00:03:47.019> we<00:03:47.079> can<00:03:47.109> actually<00:03:47.259> fit

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
there like that so we can actually fit

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.530 
there like that so we can actually fit
through<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:47.949> window<00:03:48.000> with<00:03:49.000> his<00:03:49.120> arms<00:03:49.389> out

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
through the window with his arms out

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.960 
through the window with his arms out
like<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:51.459> thought<00:03:51.639> that<00:03:51.819> would<00:03:51.909> be

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
like that and I thought that would be

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.899 
like that and I thought that would be
kind<00:03:52.180> of<00:03:52.299> cool<00:03:52.449> to<00:03:52.509> include<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:54.459> set<00:03:54.699> him<00:03:54.879> up

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
kind of cool to include and set him up

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.479 
kind of cool to include and set him up
there<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.359> I<00:03:56.049> do<00:03:56.109> have<00:03:56.349> stairs<00:03:56.709> going<00:03:57.069> from

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
there and I do have stairs going from

actually a printed piece from an old

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.380 
actually a printed piece from an old
Harry<00:04:47.380> Potter<00:04:47.680> set<00:04:48.040> with<00:04:48.970> all<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.180> potions

Harry Potter set with all the potions
and<00:04:49.750> things<00:04:49.960> I<00:04:50.140> thought<00:04:50.320> it<00:04:50.470> fit<00:04:50.710> perfectly

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.030 
and things I thought it fit perfectly
with<00:04:51.490> this<00:04:51.640> so<00:04:52.360> I<00:04:52.390> put<00:04:52.690> it<00:04:52.780> in<00:04:52.900> there<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.320> you

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
with this so I put it in there and you

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.240 
with this so I put it in there and you
do<00:04:54.130> have<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:55.210> red<00:04:55.420> chair<00:04:55.810> that<00:04:56.350> you<00:04:57.070> know<00:04:57.160> you

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
do have the red chair that you know you

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.370 
do have the red chair that you know you
can<00:04:57.490> see<00:04:57.670> a<00:04:57.700> desk<00:04:57.940> level<00:04:58.150> around<00:04:58.510> and<00:04:58.780> I<00:04:59.230> did

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
can see a desk level around and I did

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.310 
can see a desk level around and I did
design<00:04:59.710> the<00:05:00.070> desk<00:05:00.670> you<00:05:01.150> can<00:05:01.330> see<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.930> go<00:05:02.050> around

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
design the desk you can see to go around

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.190 
design the desk you can see to go around
the<00:05:02.410> corner<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:02.890> you<00:05:02.950> have<00:05:03.460> little<00:05:04.330> drawers

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
the corner and you have little drawers

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.350 
the corner and you have little drawers
obviously<00:05:05.830> they<00:05:05.950> don't<00:05:06.130> open<00:05:06.310> but<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.120> does

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
obviously they don't open but it does

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.690 
obviously they don't open but it does
appear<00:05:07.900> like<00:05:08.140> drawers<00:05:08.500> on<00:05:08.770> each<00:05:09.130> side<00:05:09.400> there

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
appear like drawers on each side there

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.370 
appear like drawers on each side there
so<00:05:09.910> I<00:05:10.420> thought<00:05:10.600> it<00:05:10.720> was<00:05:10.840> kind<00:05:11.020> of<00:05:11.050> a<00:05:11.170> neat<00:05:11.350> thing

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
so I thought it was kind of a neat thing

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.090 
so I thought it was kind of a neat thing
to<00:05:12.160> add<00:05:12.280> to<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.610> lab<00:05:12.790> I<00:05:13.290> said<00:05:14.290> that<00:05:14.860> right

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.980 
to add to the lab I said that right

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
there is where man-bat would hang out

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.190 
there is where man-bat would hang out
and<00:05:17.760> up<00:05:18.760> here<00:05:18.910> on<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.120> second<00:05:19.480> floor<00:05:19.510> you've
