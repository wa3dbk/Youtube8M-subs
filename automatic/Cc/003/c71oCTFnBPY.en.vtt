Crocs<00:00:24.000> inside<00:00:24.540> it<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.779> crocs<00:00:25.170> are<00:00:25.439> broken<00:00:25.980> up

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
Crocs inside it and crocs are broken up

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.510 
Crocs inside it and crocs are broken up
it's<00:00:26.340> an<00:00:26.520> old<00:00:26.700> pot<00:00:27.000> or<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.570> use<00:00:27.600> stones

it's an old pot or you can use stones

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.030 
it's an old pot or you can use stones
and<00:00:29.520> that<00:00:30.360> just<00:00:30.690> produces<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.350> little<00:00:31.710> area<00:00:31.860> at

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
and that just produces a little area at

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.549 
and that just produces a little area at
the<00:00:32.129> bottom<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:33.030> help<00:00:33.239> water<00:00:33.840> drain<00:00:34.290> through

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the bottom to help water drain through

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
the winter so they put a good good hand

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.500 
the winter so they put a good good hand
for<00:00:50.040> a<00:00:50.070> couple<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.339> handfuls<00:00:50.670> into<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.269> pot

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
for a couple of handfuls into the pot

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.450 
for a couple of handfuls into the pot
and<00:00:52.019> make<00:00:52.199> sure<00:00:52.229> it's<00:00:52.470> nice<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.680> nice<00:00:53.220> and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and make sure it's nice and nice and

and make sure it's nice and nice and
even<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.510> about<00:00:55.370> two-thirds<00:00:56.370> three<00:00:56.940> half

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
even so it's about two-thirds three half

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.140 
even so it's about two-thirds three half
and<00:00:57.390> two<00:00:57.540> thirds<00:00:57.839> of<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.019> way<00:00:58.110> at<00:00:58.229> the<00:00:58.260> pot

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
and two thirds of the way at the pot

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.920 
and two thirds of the way at the pot
with<00:01:00.150> bulbs<00:01:01.699> to<00:01:02.699> get<00:01:02.879> them<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.150> right<00:01:03.299> depth<00:01:03.659> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
with bulbs to get them the right depth a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.100 
with bulbs to get them the right depth a
rule<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.290> thumb<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.610> plant<00:01:06.150> them<00:01:06.420> about<00:01:06.570> as

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
rule of thumb is to plant them about as

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.640 
rule of thumb is to plant them about as
deep<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.700> bulb<00:01:08.940> is<00:01:09.150> tall<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.320> you've<00:01:10.620> got

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
deep as the bulb is tall so you've got

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.430 
deep as the bulb is tall so you've got
bulb<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.430> sort<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:12.200> make<00:01:13.200> enough

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
bulb here that sort of make enough

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.620 
bulb here that sort of make enough
height<00:01:13.649> and<00:01:13.950> that's<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.969> kind<00:01:15.149> of<00:01:15.210> depth<00:01:15.450> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
height and that's the kind of depth you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.480 
height and that's the kind of depth you
kind<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.930> want<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.829> not<00:01:17.039> such<00:01:17.340> an

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
kind of want it it's not such an

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.700 
kind of want it it's not such an
important<00:01:18.030> thing<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.390> pots<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.500> apply

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
important thing in pots if you apply

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.069 
important thing in pots if you apply
them<00:01:19.920> outside<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.549> garden<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:22.020> do

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
them outside in the garden then they do

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.020 
them outside in the garden then they do
really<00:01:22.530> want<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.829> be<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.159> deeper<00:01:23.579> with<00:01:23.759> pots

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
really want to be a bit deeper with pots

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.800 
really want to be a bit deeper with pots
it's<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.420> such<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> problem<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:26.070> what<00:01:26.219> we'll<00:01:26.369> do

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
it's not such a problem so what we'll do

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.940 
it's not such a problem so what we'll do
make<00:01:27.810> sure<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:28.049> get<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> compost<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
make sure we get the compost up to the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.590 
make sure we get the compost up to the
right<00:01:29.070> level<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:29.850> start<00:01:30.090> placing<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
right level and we start placing the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.380 
right level and we start placing the
bulbs<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.369> we'll<00:01:32.549> put<00:01:32.789> them<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.000> nice<00:01:33.359> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
bulbs in and we'll put them in nice and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.060 
bulbs in and we'll put them in nice and
thick<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.280> locks<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> bulbs<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.899> lots<00:01:37.829> of
