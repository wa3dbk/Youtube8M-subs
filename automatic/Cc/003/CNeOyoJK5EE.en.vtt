00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.850 
wick and a smaller drill bit for detail
work<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:45.030> step<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.260> get<00:00:46.410> your<00:00:46.530> drill

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
work so step one is to get your drill

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.549 
work so step one is to get your drill
ready<00:00:47.360> ohh-ho-ho<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.140> drill<00:00:49.350> bit

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
ready ohh-ho-ho now that's a drill bit

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.670 
ready ohh-ho-ho now that's a drill bit
then<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:50.129> drill<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> log<00:00:51.809> straight

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
then just drill and do the log straight

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.830 
then just drill and do the log straight
down<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> middle<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:54.000> 3/4<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> way

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
down the middle but like 3/4 of the way

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.650 
down the middle but like 3/4 of the way
down<00:00:54.989> into<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> log<00:00:55.640> then<00:00:56.640> dump<00:00:57.270> out<00:00:57.449> all<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
down into the log then dump out all the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.180 
down into the log then dump out all the
excess<00:00:58.500> sawdust<00:01:00.500> here<00:01:01.500> I'm<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.800> measuring

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
excess sawdust here I'm just measuring

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.189 
excess sawdust here I'm just measuring
how<00:01:02.370> deep<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.699> went<00:01:02.910> into<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> log<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> can

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
how deep I went into the log so I can

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.140 
how deep I went into the log so I can
line<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> hole<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> side<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.880> want<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
line up the hole on the side you want to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.210 
line up the hole on the side you want to
go<00:01:06.360> into<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.960> side<00:01:07.170> slightly<00:01:07.920> above<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
go into the side slightly above the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.030 
go into the side slightly above the
bottom<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> first<00:01:09.659> hole<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.710> side<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
bottom of the first hole and the side of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.490 
bottom of the first hole and the side of
the<00:01:11.159> log<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.790> lot<00:01:12.030> harder<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.750> into<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.470> I

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the log is a lot harder to get into so I

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.340 
the log is a lot harder to get into so I
needed<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.070> drill<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> pilot<00:01:14.580> hole<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.450> take<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
needed a drill a pilot hole and take the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.890 
needed a drill a pilot hole and take the
huge<00:01:16.680> drill<00:01:17.189> bit<00:01:17.369> go<00:01:17.880> all<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.450> way<00:01:18.479> into<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
huge drill bit go all the way into the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.719 
huge drill bit go all the way into the
log<00:01:19.020> until<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> two<00:01:19.560> holes<00:01:19.830> connect<00:01:20.159> dump<00:01:20.580> out

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
log until the two holes connect dump out

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.170 
log until the two holes connect dump out
all<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.030> excess<00:01:21.420> sawdust<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.950> now<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.850> can

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
all the excess sawdust and now you can

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.260 
all the excess sawdust and now you can
see<00:01:24.390> there's<00:01:24.689> two<00:01:25.110> holes<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> log<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:30.090> is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
see there's two holes in the log this is

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.609 
see there's two holes in the log this is
what<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.540> kind<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.780> looks<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.079> inside<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
what it kind of looks like inside the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.490 
what it kind of looks like inside the
log<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.490> see<00:01:32.729> how<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.420> first<00:01:33.659> hole<00:01:33.869> goes<00:01:34.170> down

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
log you see how the first hole goes down

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.140 
log you see how the first hole goes down
three-quarters<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> way<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.939> side

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
three-quarters of the way and the side

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240 
three-quarters of the way and the side
hole<00:01:36.390> comes<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.380> slightly<00:01:37.470> above<00:01:37.860> where

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
hole comes in just slightly above where

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.010 
hole comes in just slightly above where
the<00:01:38.340> other<00:01:38.460> hole<00:01:38.670> ended<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.630> point<00:01:39.900> if

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the other hole ended at this point if

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.539 
the other hole ended at this point if
you're<00:01:40.110> lazy<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.680> could<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.950> finished<00:01:41.340> you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
you're lazy you could be finished you

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.789 
you're lazy you could be finished you
just<00:01:41.579> light<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> piece<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.509> firestarter<00:01:43.140> drop

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
just light a piece of firestarter drop

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.310 
just light a piece of firestarter drop
it<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> top<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:45.049> eventually<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> whole

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.679 
it in the top and eventually the whole
log<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.740> catch<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.340> burn<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
log will catch and just burn like it

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.440 
log will catch and just burn like it
should<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.520> want<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.759> give<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
should but if you want to give it get a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.350 
should but if you want to give it get a
bit<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:52.020> creative<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.920> make<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> logs<00:01:54.119> more

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
bit more creative and make the logs more

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.050 
bit more creative and make the logs more
unique<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.990> interesting<00:01:55.229> looking<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.969> like<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
unique and interesting looking I like to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.950 
unique and interesting looking I like to
draw<00:01:57.240> faces<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.930> stuff<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.290> them

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.969 

like<00:02:04.619> some<00:02:04.799> look<00:02:04.979> funny<00:02:06.679> now<00:02:07.679> here's<00:02:07.920> another

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
like some look funny now here's another

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.770 
like some look funny now here's another
thing<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.700> do<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:09.149> drill<00:02:09.539> through

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
thing you can do you can drill through

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.040 
thing you can do you can drill through
the<00:02:10.500> eyes<00:02:10.679> into<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.430> middle<00:02:11.790> hole<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.780> will

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
the eyes into the middle hole and will

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.050 
the eyes into the middle hole and will
make<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.379> eyes<00:02:13.410> glow<00:02:14.129> on<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.430> log<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.819> lit

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
make the eyes glow on the log is lit

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.820 
make the eyes glow on the log is lit
although<00:02:15.569> this<00:02:15.750> will<00:02:15.930> shorten<00:02:16.260> how<00:02:16.410> long<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
although this will shorten how long the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.740 
although this will shorten how long the
log<00:02:17.010> will<00:02:17.220> burn<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:19.370> now<00:02:20.370> I'm<00:02:20.760> just<00:02:20.790> melting

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
log will burn for now I'm just melting

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.759 
log will burn for now I'm just melting
the<00:02:22.170> wax<00:02:22.459> now<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.730> melted<00:02:24.319> take<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.590> wick

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
the wax now it is melted take the wick

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.900 
the wax now it is melted take the wick
soak<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.489> wax<00:02:28.280> stick<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.430> wick<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
soak it in wax stick the wick in the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.610 
soak it in wax stick the wick in the
bottom<00:02:30.209> opening<00:02:30.629> until<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.140> reaches<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
bottom opening until it reaches the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.820 
bottom opening until it reaches the
other<00:02:32.099> hole<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:33.360> then<00:02:33.569> push<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.590> down<00:02:34.620> with

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
other hole and then push it down with

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.370 
other hole and then push it down with
something<00:02:35.510> so<00:02:36.510> it's<00:02:36.630> at<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.870> bottom<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.290> the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
something so it's at the bottom of the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.860 
something so it's at the bottom of the
other<00:02:37.500> hole<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.670> fill<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.569> with<00:02:39.690> wax

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
other hole and just fill it with wax

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.089 
other hole and just fill it with wax
until<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.410> start<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.799> see<00:02:40.829> it<00:02:41.130> reach<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.340> end

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
until you start to see it reach the end

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.430 
until you start to see it reach the end
once<00:02:44.099> this<00:02:44.220> wax<00:02:44.489> hardens<00:02:45.019> it'll<00:02:46.019> shrink<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.410> bit

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
once this wax hardens it'll shrink a bit

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.559 
once this wax hardens it'll shrink a bit
so<00:02:46.829> you'll<00:02:46.980> have<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.310> top<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.940> up<00:02:48.030> with<00:02:48.090> another

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
so you'll have to top it up with another

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.080 
so you'll have to top it up with another
batch<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.140> melted<00:02:49.470> wax<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.069> now<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.910> done

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
batch of melted wax and now it is done

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.970 
batch of melted wax and now it is done
here<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.780> see<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.140> picture<00:02:52.530> how<00:02:52.950> I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
here you can see in the picture how I

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.699 
here you can see in the picture how I
have<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.549> wax<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.120> wick<00:02:54.329> setup

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
have the wax and wick setup

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.580 
have the wax and wick setup
and<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.819> fire<00:02:57.030> log<00:02:57.299> is<00:02:57.480> complete<00:02:57.840> let's<00:02:58.290> test

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
and the fire log is complete let's test

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.899 
and the fire log is complete let's test
it<00:02:58.769> out<00:03:00.079> so<00:03:01.079> it<00:03:01.230> takes<00:03:01.439> a<00:03:01.590> while<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.519> get<00:03:02.849> going

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
it out so it takes a while to get going

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.220 
it out so it takes a while to get going
but<00:03:03.540> eventually<00:03:03.989> does<00:03:05.840> sometimes<00:03:06.840> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
but eventually does sometimes the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.720 
but eventually does sometimes the
outside<00:03:07.349> catches<00:03:07.829> a<00:03:07.920> bit<00:03:08.069> on<00:03:08.189> fire<00:03:08.459> but

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
outside catches a bit on fire but

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.490 
outside catches a bit on fire but
nothing<00:03:09.359> to<00:03:09.480> worry<00:03:09.659> about<00:03:12.019> this<00:03:13.019> is<00:03:13.200> just<00:03:13.319> a

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
nothing to worry about this is just a

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.709 
nothing to worry about this is just a
time-lapse<00:03:14.069> of<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.340> life<00:03:14.639> of<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.909> log<00:03:17.569> it<00:03:18.569> was

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:18.719 
time-lapse of the life of the log it was

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.020 
time-lapse of the life of the log it was
really<00:03:19.019> windy<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.560> day<00:03:19.799> so<00:03:19.859> it<00:03:20.370> burnt<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.819> lot

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
really windy that day so it burnt a lot

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.520 
really windy that day so it burnt a lot
faster<00:03:21.450> than<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.689> probably<00:03:21.959> showed<00:03:22.139> up<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.439> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
faster than it probably showed up in the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.379 
faster than it probably showed up in the
fire<00:03:22.709> was<00:03:22.859> a<00:03:22.920> bit<00:03:23.099> crazy<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:23.730> you're<00:03:24.180> in<00:03:24.269> an

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
fire was a bit crazy if you're in an

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.420 
fire was a bit crazy if you're in an
area<00:03:24.569> protected<00:03:24.870> from<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.530> wind<00:03:25.680> fire

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
area protected from the wind fire

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.220 
area protected from the wind fire
probably<00:03:26.700> wouldn't<00:03:27.030> be<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.239> crazy<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
probably wouldn't be this crazy and the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:51.870 
probably wouldn't be this crazy and the
log<00:03:28.379> would<00:03:28.530> probably<00:03:28.799> last<00:03:28.950> longer

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.360 

this<00:03:52.810> is<00:03:52.960> what<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.230> log<00:03:53.410> look<00:03:53.680> like<00:03:53.890> after<00:03:54.220> 2

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
this is what the log look like after 2

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.650 
this is what the log look like after 2
hours<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.820> 45<00:03:55.090> minutes

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
hours and 45 minutes

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.740 
hours and 45 minutes
I<00:03:55.780> consider<00:03:56.380> this<00:03:56.620> done<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:57.820> I<00:03:57.850> just<00:03:58.150> picked<00:03:58.600> it

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
I consider this done so I just picked it

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.550 
I consider this done so I just picked it
up<00:03:58.840> and<00:04:00.840> threw<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.990> in<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.170> fire<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:05.050> can<00:04:05.290> do

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
up and threw it in the fire you can do

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.640 
up and threw it in the fire you can do
whatever<00:04:05.830> you<00:04:06.130> want<00:04:06.370> with<00:04:06.490> it<00:04:07.380> put<00:04:08.380> it<00:04:08.500> out

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
whatever you want with it put it out

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.650 
whatever you want with it put it out
with<00:04:08.980> some<00:04:09.340> water<00:04:09.850> would<00:04:10.120> probably<00:04:10.450> be<00:04:10.540> the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
with some water would probably be the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.890 
with some water would probably be the
best<00:04:10.780> option<00:04:11.230> if<00:04:11.320> you<00:04:11.380> don't<00:04:11.530> have<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.650> fire
