00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.250
 no no 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.800
 then pep guardiola tab for the bayern 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.590
 of Munich and then almost half of the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.840
 last season or a little more advanced 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.500
 that half of last season did not 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.530
 you could have imagined then that 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.930
 jupp heynckes would win a triplet to the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.510
 German cup the bundesliga and also the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.510
 European Cup good if I could but it was 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.690
 very unlikely to win 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.600
 absolutely everything 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.030
 it was people like me too that we think 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.360
 for pepe that's the little whore 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.289
 because of course how can you overcome that 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.140
 and not win a triplet now 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.869
 I have seen the Munich bayern in situ 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.720
 a couple of times this season and many 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.479
 evidently and on television 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.740
 begins the season in the supercopa of 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:18.490
 europe against the chelsea in prague me 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.920
 It seemed extremely strange to see this 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.840
 equipment that was so robust 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.060
 obviously there are no quality people 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.600
 There is a lot of quality but it had or has 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.390
 central then grandullones and such and 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.929
 pp asking that he plays playing from 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.530
 back and omeyer types like boateng and 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:41.170
 is getting the ball again on 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.680
 goalkeeper and leg tremble to novais 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.560
 here we are going to lose 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.350
 and they are watching philipp lahm that has 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.650
 played a thousand times as captain 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.840
 from germany on the right wing 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.509
 doing midfielder 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.729
 but very strange very strange and not what 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.310
 they did badly but not at all well 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.380
 it was also very strange to see 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.860
 thomas mÃ¼ller that all life plays 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.830
 either for orange or as a forward 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.650
 when almost a playmaker looked like a fish 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.010
 on the ground really strange but still 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:24.440
 and went on and on and now every time 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.630
 better time is also that you can win 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.630
 the championship the bundesliga in time 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.360
 record still missing things like eleven 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.140
 days when we in the past 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.570
 we have complained about duopoly if such not 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.050
 Binds imagine defend Germany 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.990
 because those who win in a win are the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.840
 Bayern Munich or even that team 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.590
 that is going in europe because devastating 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.709
 what choice did they give Manchester City in 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.739
 Manchester not really when I saw that 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.380
 we thought that you can not go beyond 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.140
 here wins the triplet because I do not know if 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.330
 is going to win a triplet this season 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.239
 but he did an accent program robinson the 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.209
 chain will be close to that of the bundesliga 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.510
 It is the league where you have more attendees 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.849
 the fields of world football 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.299
 only for audience attendance does the 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.780
 nfl clear listings are are larger 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.870
 of the Bundesliga is the league that has 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.569
 well, more prosperous in every way 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.819
 well pep guardiola speaking in accent 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.980
 robinson with a pair of lost of 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.110
 Germans and they were commenting that clear 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.150
 when I started to meet a weird 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.010
 including franz beckenbauer is 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.579
 traditional this team does not shoot 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.400
 for a traumatic change of style what 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.680
 more older I'm not necessarily 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.140
 alluding beckenbauer see who's going and about 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.000
 the more they say they do not shoot 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.870
 wants to enter with what could 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.389
 walking but the youngest those 35 40 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.690
 years down and they are thinking then and 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.840
 this is pretty 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.650
 in an interview that was granted to 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.150
 philipp lahm to the English garden was 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.030
 saying that the workouts are 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.340
 much more fun and they are learning 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.070
 because of course it puts soccer players without 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.640
 different demarcations is that pep 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.800
 guardiola has that fan to eradicate 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.440
 demarcations and grosso modo is 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.110
 doing it because now I remember 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.750
 very recently said this the game that is 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.400
 a right extreme of extremadura that is 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.530
 a tip means for example the problem 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.450
 What do you have? 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.970
 playmaker has to learn to play 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.450
 other demarcations what position plays 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:47.860
 before iniesta I do not know what position he plays 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:50.770
 I do not know either completely what position 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.050
 Messi plays do not want to see them 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.720
 save yourself has ends so solvent in 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.020
 long that are midfielders in the 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.870
 lost and is creating that revolution in 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.560
 germany and it's straining and not in 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.790
 prejudice of any result I think 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.310
 what 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.700
 coming to the moment when he can win 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.280
 something more a bundesliga and also in 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.990
 record time but mostly it's 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.990
 changing the thought
