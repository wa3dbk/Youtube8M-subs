00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.410
 we started this commented what are the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.410
 materials that we are going to need 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.050
 The first thing we will need as 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.740
 base is a kitchen paper 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.480
 a paper a towel that you no longer use 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.180
 then we're going to need enamel 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.580
 colors to make it look pretty 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.820
 our design a spatula that is going to 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.790
 help a lot and you can also use a 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.910
 Palito de Naranjo does not matter a file of 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.910

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.530
 pretty small an eyebrow tweezers 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:39.950
 although I do not think we use it but for 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.860
 the doubts a basic enamel 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.860
 puntocom to finish then the design 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:54.729
 and we are going to use these new stickers 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.729
 of gel that have taken the mark s 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.820
 to begin we will apply first 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.130
 the base an enamel base 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.470
 this will help us make the color that 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.830
 apply above 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.430
 stay in a very yellowish 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.790
 over time the nails and that also the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.850
 enamel once we remove do not leave 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.950
 stains on the good dream once 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.220
 dry in what is the base we are going to 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.620
 start applying the enamels on 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.900
 colors 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.600
 little by little with patience with a lot 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.110
 sweetie 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.430
 with a spatula that the acrylic 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.540
 that I had previously commented 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.540
 let's start 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.600
 outside the nail 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.070
 This way we will stay 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.070
 nice and more verbose 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.660
 apply in that one in a way 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.820
 different let's paint all the 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.870
 colors that we applied previously but 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.870
 in the form of a rainbow 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.540
 more personalized what is this 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.290
 decoration of one let's apply a 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.290
 little by little 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.280
 you can use the colors that 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.020
 your 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.459
 you have as long as it is 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.459
 pretty colorful will be 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.580
 better and pretty nice 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.630
 once we apply everything 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.480
 with a cotton swab to wet it anguita 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.750
 enamel 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.750
 and slowly we are going to clean the 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.819
 now with the same back 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.950
 that we already know to what nail will go then what 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.930
 we apply it is important to remember that there 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.590
 than waiting for the enamel we apply 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.960
 previously it is very dry to be able 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.910
 apply over the sticker of this 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.070
 way you could work a lot 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.520
 we cut everything that is left over with the 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.520
 scissors 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.530
 and so we will apply little by little 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.330
 let's press the sticker so that 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.330
 this adheres pretty well to the nails 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.760
 applying on all nails 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.520
 successively once we finish 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.729
 apply on all the nails what we are going to 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.570
 to do is to file the edges so that 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.570
 more verbose 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.629
 we are going to apply 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.990
 to help seal 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.150
 we liked it 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.920
 Take note remember that you can use 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.760
 any explains 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.250
 in the market there is a lot 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.930
 life and employ all the enamels of 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.890
