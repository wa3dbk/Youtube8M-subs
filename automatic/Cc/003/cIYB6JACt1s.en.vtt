00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.129
 hello youtube people good in this 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:09.160
 tutorial I come to bring you how to record 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.610
 with the mobile headset without 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.170
 heard well with the headphones the mobile 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.840
 used to record tutorials 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.940
 to speak for the good messenger 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.400
 practically serves for all these 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.760
 little programs that need a micro and 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.189
 as we do not have pasta or what we are going to 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.380
 spend is not money to buy 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.120
 micros then we take those of the mobile 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.730
 the micros 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.520
 You already know what the round peg of 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.110
 all life with three bands to see if 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.670
 I'm going to show you an image like that in 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.030
 Youtube 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.140
 so that they see yes 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.140
 which are 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.070
 sorry is new something slow but it's the 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 I would sing 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.650
 now it's going slow 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.650
 let's go to images 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.330
 headphones 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.120
 or not 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.320
 and it is already 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.420
 to be seen 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.229
 they will be one like these 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.229
 it gives 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.210
 for example 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.909
 this peg come look is this 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.859
 is 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.229
 but with three rounds that usually bring 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:49.229
 these good micros are worth equal 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.990
 these are very similar to those that I 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.850
 I have this that I hear them are the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.540
 that would see those who came with me 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.490
 alcatel 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.659
 So nothing 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.659
 Well this is very simple 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.960
 let's start a control panel 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:19.000
 let's go to sound devices or my voice 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.920
 audio sound devices 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.380
 we go to where it says voice 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.880
 we apply in hardware test 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.880
 we click on next 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.150
 We wait for 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.150
 or complete 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.100
 Look, I'm going to tell you this is for a 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.290
 tutorial that I have been asked 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.010
 they ask me for a desk clock 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.300
 then I diego for watches this 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.990
 is for another 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.990
 of the good time not on how to activate it and 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.500
 this is to have an antivirus 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.470
 milestone dish until 2038 that good 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.070
 they also asked me and it seemed very 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.070
 okay upload it 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.890
 good good good what this takes 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.870
 now 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.590
 look at this is very simple 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.890
 here is if you unplug the 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.890
 headphones 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.570
 and here where it says recording you will have to 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.370
 go out is green right now with that the 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:40.100
 Look, they see that it's good because 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.790
 I should leave them 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.799
 click on next 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:51.000
 and here the same thing in the volume should 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.850
 leave also the two 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.680
 so we remove the next one and 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.370
 Finalize 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.750
 we are going to accept and everything would be 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.750
 we want to see the test 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.940
 accessories 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.069
 an entertainment 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.460
 the time of sounds 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:18.100
 and here we talk 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.910
 let's give rise to the aggravated and 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.930
 keep recording 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.100
 and that have been all 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.100
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.530
 comment if you want to subscribe, I think 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.200
 which is a very free way to have 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.320
 an ace headset or a micro and very 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.350
 easy you do not hear bad otherwise you hear 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.270
 fairly good 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.090
 and well that would be all 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.690
 Enjoy it and have a nice day 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.690
 bye
