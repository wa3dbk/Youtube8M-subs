00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.110
 good evening not yet 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.360
 good evening good evening I'm with my friend the 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.390
 judge and we are each equipped with 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:30.220
 his little wavy good ah yes his 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:36.309
 guitars so are made in France to 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:37.780
 caen or a fairy tale each one of you 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.280
 personally I am very happy that 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.000
 mine because already the pickups 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.519
 tivi jones 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.019
 in addition she has a tuning fork and then 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.940
 and then I like this little girl 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.440
 opening in the form of y 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.420
 but in which we would have put a 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.239
 hamster locked in a fence 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.670
 so I prefer them prefer them 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.989
 guitars a little more but let's say me 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.109
 I like it when it starts to be seen 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.589
 and lollipop there on the sides here is me 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.219
 I love it 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:06.220
 So here is a little thought to my 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.510
 fetish guitar to explore them even though 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.930
 it has nothing to do and then so what 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.550
 I like 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.950
 I love two-tone guitars and 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.159
 looked at the bright green and green 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.810
 dark and Malian companies do not 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.130
 do not do that we love yours do not do 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.509
 not this is damien does not look like the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.729
 jack white guitar of the blow she me 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.250
 makes happy and then the material and 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.259
 Funny fact makes a plastic noise 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.670
 we started to do not do that you know 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.500
 yeah but that's a piece of plastic 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.159
 of a core of nations but must not do 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.689
 what for what 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.140
 because it makes a plastic noise 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:38.860
 when total then so me mine 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.439
 this one so she has a beat by good me 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.329
 I am not a big fan of big bih but 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.439
 then it works well sure that there it 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.500
 last year in Bordeaux 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:51.230

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.390

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.920
