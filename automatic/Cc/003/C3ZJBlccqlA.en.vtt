00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.589
 labels 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.889
 I think he is very tall and very cool 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.679
 now a total of 65 5 centimeters and me 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.969
 I measured 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.869
 he also looks visually I think pretty 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.180
 good from the beginning 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.060
 here you have the cockpit is not sitting 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.869
 pilot in klum pilot but you can see 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.869
 here 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:35.660
 these details from the grid there sees 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.660
 you come here in front of the four front cannons here 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:44.460
 Here you can see the legs then you can 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.070
 here on both sides of the fold up 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.770
 there you see a clown protect 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.840
 wittmann custom chrome shooter with one 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.890
 ladder you can fold down then 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.890
 he can get out 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:03.000
 it works on the other side too 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.339
 you can see here the main channel of the good 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.369
 did not move fully naturally, of course 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:13.290
 Fold down 360 degrees further down 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.930
 he just sits loose in it 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:23.250
 and you have a computer we have 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:26.040
 the oranges go up it goes 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.890
 broken right now but you could 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:35.579
 open this flap is here the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.979
 generator which can be seen here again 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.509
 nachhaken apple device me 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.799
 Made easy if you play with it 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:47.159
 that you just felt as the cannons 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:51.780
 or whatever counts then can 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:58.610

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:04.670
 space for six flights and a media 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.670
 Again and again, thanks so much 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:28.160
 that one was bad and had to 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:28.160
 again a gear the way forward 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:40.860
 yes because ever further to the middle part 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:43.620
 it can actually open up and always 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:49.849
 nice to share this tight he uses 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:54.170
 I have been unruly here 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:03:00.390
 You can not make a motor in here 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:02.340
 with the blue flowers on it that 's it 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.019
 even the legs here are movable 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.730
 I had set a post scaffolding 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.720
 I have just done it for him 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.340

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:43.290
 here are again protect on both 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.209
 hardly ever because they fold up 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.860
 but they are not coming out now 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:55.240
 Just come here with the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.240

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:10.460
 then they will be down when I here the 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:16.630
 Down there comes the atr 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.630
 Often I am so injured 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:34.940

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.360

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:49.690
 There are also on both sides 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:49.690

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.750

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.600

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.310
