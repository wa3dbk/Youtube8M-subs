00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
little bit so sometimes it's very thing

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.900 
little bit so sometimes it's very thing
that<00:00:41.780> you<00:00:42.110> do<00:00:42.290> just<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.860> try<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:43.370> help<00:00:43.520> those

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
that you do just to try and help those

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.090 
that you do just to try and help those
sort<00:00:44.180> of<00:00:44.210> issues<00:00:44.300> I<00:00:44.840> guess<00:00:45.469> for<00:00:45.890> me<00:00:45.980> I've

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
sort of issues I guess for me I've

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.350 
sort of issues I guess for me I've
always<00:00:46.190> been<00:00:46.460> quite<00:00:46.640> lucky<00:00:46.940> I<00:00:46.969> don't<00:00:47.210> really

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
always been quite lucky I don't really

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.330 
always been quite lucky I don't really
get<00:00:47.510> them<00:00:47.690> that's<00:00:48.079> at<00:00:48.320> that<00:00:48.680> much<00:00:48.829> saddle<00:00:49.190> sore

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
get them that's at that much saddle sore

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.000 
get them that's at that much saddle sore
but<00:00:49.610> my<00:00:49.789> saddles<00:00:50.300> are<00:00:50.899> all<00:00:51.110> women's<00:00:51.469> specific

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
but my saddles are all women's specific

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.069 
but my saddles are all women's specific
and<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:53.090> I<00:00:53.210> always<00:00:53.420> have<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.809> have<00:00:53.930> one

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
and that I always have to have one

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.330 
and that I always have to have one
that's<00:00:54.230> got<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.469> hole<00:00:54.710> in<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.949> middle<00:00:55.100> as<00:00:55.309> well

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
that's got a hole in the middle as well

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.209 
that's got a hole in the middle as well
and<00:00:55.850> I<00:00:56.360> think<00:00:56.539> once<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:56.809> do<00:00:57.020> find<00:00:57.050> a<00:00:57.770> saddle

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
and I think once you do find a saddle

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.560 
and I think once you do find a saddle
like<00:00:58.489> it<00:00:58.670> will<00:00:58.789> be<00:00:58.910> right<00:00:59.059> for<00:00:59.090> you<00:00:59.329> but<00:00:59.449> it's

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
like it will be right for you but it's

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.910 
like it will be right for you but it's
just<00:00:59.719> knowing<00:01:00.020> what<00:01:00.140> sort<00:01:00.410> of<00:01:00.469> one<00:01:00.620> you<00:01:00.739> need

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
just knowing what sort of one you need

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.889 
just knowing what sort of one you need
and<00:01:01.160> I<00:01:01.370> think<00:01:01.850> as<00:01:01.969> well<00:01:02.090> for<00:01:02.270> me<00:01:02.390> lifting<00:01:02.780> the

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
and I think as well for me lifting the

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.380 
and I think as well for me lifting the
handlebars<00:01:03.440> and<00:01:03.770> I<00:01:04.190> don't<00:01:04.250> have<00:01:04.759> such<00:01:05.059> a<00:01:05.089> horse

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
handlebars and I don't have such a horse

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.320 
handlebars and I don't have such a horse
race<00:01:05.990> position<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.860> I<00:01:07.160> mean<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.580> did<00:01:07.640> try<00:01:08.030> like

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
race position and I mean I did try like

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.249 
race position and I mean I did try like
everybody<00:01:08.660> wants<00:01:08.899> to<00:01:08.930> have<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.140> best

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
everybody wants to have the best

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:10.420 
everybody wants to have the best
position<00:01:09.619> don't<00:01:09.710> know<00:01:09.890> but<00:01:10.039> it<00:01:10.100> just<00:01:10.160> wasn't

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
position don't know but it just wasn't

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.160 
position don't know but it just wasn't
comfortable<00:01:10.700> um<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.810> other<00:01:11.840> thing<00:01:12.110> I

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
comfortable um and the other thing I

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.600 
comfortable um and the other thing I
used<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:12.470> do<00:01:12.590> as<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.710> kid<00:01:12.950> it's<00:01:13.130> where<00:01:13.280> to

00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:15.349 
shammies and as much as that sounds

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:17.380 
shammies and as much as that sounds
ridiculous<00:01:15.830> just<00:01:16.550> wear<00:01:16.729> two<00:01:16.880> pairs<00:01:16.910> of<00:01:17.209> shorts

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
ridiculous just wear two pairs of shorts

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.380 
ridiculous just wear two pairs of shorts
um<00:01:17.810> seems<00:01:18.410> to<00:01:18.590> cure<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.069> problem<00:01:19.459> the<00:01:20.240> one

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
me on the pill so that I could actually

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.600 
me on the pill so that I could actually
gauge<00:01:46.580> it<00:01:46.849> and<00:01:47.090> but<00:01:47.780> for<00:01:47.959> me<00:01:48.080> yeah<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.739> I<00:01:49.250> have

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
gauge it and but for me yeah and I have

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.130 
gauge it and but for me yeah and I have
had<00:01:49.789> a<00:01:49.819> few<00:01:50.030> awkward<00:01:50.330> times<00:01:50.509> but<00:01:50.869> I<00:01:50.899> mean

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
had a few awkward times but I mean

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.930 
had a few awkward times but I mean
that's<00:01:51.770> just<00:01:51.860> part<00:01:52.039> of<00:01:52.340> being<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:52.610> woman<00:01:52.640> I

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
that's just part of being a woman I

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.190 
that's just part of being a woman I
guess<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.330> just<00:01:53.390> have<00:01:53.569> to<00:01:53.720> get<00:01:53.869> on<00:01:53.959> with<00:01:54.080> these

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
guess you just have to get on with these

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.859 
guess you just have to get on with these
things<00:01:54.440> and<00:01:54.649> deal<00:01:54.770> with<00:01:54.800> it<00:01:55.209> finally<00:01:56.209> what<00:01:56.840> you

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
things and deal with it finally what you

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.059 
things and deal with it finally what you
looking<00:01:57.140> forward<00:01:57.319> to<00:01:57.470> most<00:01:57.619> this<00:01:57.800> year<00:01:57.979> with

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069
