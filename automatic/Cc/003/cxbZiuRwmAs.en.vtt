hi this is Peter again I've created this

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.030 
hi this is Peter again I've created this
video<00:00:09.320> to<00:00:09.530> show<00:00:10.280> you<00:00:10.309> how<00:00:11.270> you<00:00:11.930> can<00:00:12.110> interface

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
video to show you how you can interface

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.910 
video to show you how you can interface
for<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:13.369> next<00:00:13.670> ten<00:00:13.850> device<00:00:14.199> with<00:00:15.199> Eva<00:00:15.410> to<00:00:15.770> turn

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
for the next ten device with Eva to turn

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.250 
for the next ten device with Eva to turn
your<00:00:16.100> lights<00:00:16.279> on<00:00:16.520> and<00:00:16.550> off<00:00:16.730> and<00:00:17.170> what<00:00:18.170> I've

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
your lights on and off and what I've

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.429 
your lights on and off and what I've
already<00:00:18.440> done<00:00:18.590> here<00:00:18.800> is<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:20.180> switch<00:00:21.080> here<00:00:21.289> to

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
already done here is the switch here to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.890 
already done here is the switch here to
my<00:00:21.560> lights<00:00:21.800> I've<00:00:22.519> replaced<00:00:22.910> the<00:00:23.300> existing<00:00:23.390> one

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
my lights I've replaced the existing one

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.779 
my lights I've replaced the existing one
which<00:00:24.109> was<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:24.349> dimmer<00:00:24.619> switch<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.279> I've<00:00:25.550> put

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
which was a dimmer switch and I've put

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.019 
which was a dimmer switch and I've put
in<00:00:25.910> this<00:00:26.539> x10<00:00:27.140> unit<00:00:27.499> here<00:00:27.829> and<00:00:28.009> you<00:00:28.339> see<00:00:28.550> I<00:00:28.789> can

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
in this x10 unit here and you see I can

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.160 
in this x10 unit here and you see I can
turn<00:00:29.839> the<00:00:29.960> lights<00:00:30.169> off<00:00:30.380> here<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:32.020> turn<00:00:33.020> them

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
turn the lights off here and turn them

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.229 
turn the lights off here and turn them
back<00:00:33.290> on<00:00:33.470> again<00:00:33.620> just<00:00:33.950> by<00:00:34.340> switching<00:00:34.550> that<00:00:34.910> and

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
back on again just by switching that and

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.470 
back on again just by switching that and
that's<00:00:35.690> hooked<00:00:35.930> in<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:37.040> able<00:00:37.880> to<00:00:38.090> communicate

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
that's hooked in and able to communicate

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.790 
that's hooked in and able to communicate
with<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.520> Gion<00:00:40.600> controller<00:00:41.600> via<00:00:42.500> the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
with the Gion controller via the

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.440 
with the Gion controller via the
electrical<00:00:43.250> circuit<00:00:43.640> in<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:43.970> house<00:00:44.090> now<00:00:44.420> I

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
electrical circuit in the house now I

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.870 
electrical circuit in the house now I
don't<00:00:44.570> want<00:00:44.750> to<00:00:44.840> go<00:00:45.710> into<00:00:45.980> you<00:00:46.400> know<00:00:46.430> what<00:00:46.790> it

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
don't want to go into you know what it

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.210 
don't want to go into you know what it
takes<00:00:47.120> to<00:00:47.330> put<00:00:48.050> that<00:00:48.200> in<00:00:48.350> but<00:00:48.590> basically<00:00:49.010> the

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
takes to put that in but basically the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.920 
takes to put that in but basically the
instructions<00:00:49.790> in<00:00:50.420> there<00:00:50.660> are<00:00:50.750> fairly

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
instructions in there are fairly

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.360 
instructions in there are fairly
straightforward<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.590> I<00:00:51.680> think<00:00:51.860> anybody<00:00:52.220> with

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
straightforward and I think anybody with

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.130 
straightforward and I think anybody with
a<00:00:52.400> screwdriver<00:00:52.730> is<00:00:53.150> and<00:00:53.360> knows<00:00:53.720> how<00:00:53.900> to<00:00:53.960> turn

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
a screwdriver is and knows how to turn

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.350 
a screwdriver is and knows how to turn
off<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.350> power<00:00:54.650> in<00:00:54.890> their<00:00:55.010> place<00:00:55.250> can<00:00:56.060> do<00:00:56.240> it

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
off the power in their place can do it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.650 
off the power in their place can do it
safely<00:00:56.710> so<00:00:57.710> what<00:00:58.340> I've<00:00:58.460> done<00:00:58.640> next<00:00:58.910> is<00:00:59.270> I've

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
safely so what I've done next is I've

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.580 
safely so what I've done next is I've
already<00:00:59.990> created<00:01:00.250> inside<00:01:01.250> of<00:01:01.310> either<00:01:02.050> an<00:01:03.050> x10

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
already created inside of either an x10

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.469 
already created inside of either an x10
zone<00:01:03.980> that<00:01:04.580> I've<00:01:04.729> called<00:01:05.650> lights<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.479> I'll

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
zone that I've called lights and I'll

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.470 
zone that I've called lights and I'll
ask<00:01:08.750> even<00:01:09.140> now<00:01:09.259> to<00:01:09.320> display<00:01:09.859> that<00:01:10.070> for<00:01:10.399> me

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:30.150 

display<00:01:14.350> my<00:01:14.560> zones<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.500> she's<00:01:29.680> listed<00:01:30.070> the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
display my zones so she's listed the

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.800 
display my zones so she's listed the
zone<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.490> I've<00:01:30.610> created<00:01:30.880> there<00:01:31.360> now<00:01:31.690> the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
zone that I've created there now the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.930 
zone that I've created there now the
first<00:01:32.110> time<00:01:32.290> I<00:01:32.560> want<00:01:33.010> to<00:01:33.100> set<00:01:33.280> this<00:01:33.400> up<00:01:33.580> this

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
first time I want to set this up this

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.400 
first time I want to set this up this
particular<00:01:34.300> switch<00:01:34.810> here<00:01:35.050> has<00:01:35.230> a<00:01:35.260> little

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
particular switch here has a little

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.980 
particular switch here has a little
button<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.860> can<00:01:36.010> press<00:01:36.130> underneath<00:01:36.610> here<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
button you can press underneath here and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.710 
button you can press underneath here and
if<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.230> hold<00:01:38.440> it<00:01:38.620> in<00:01:38.680> for<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:38.980> few<00:01:39.160> seconds<00:01:39.720> you'll

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
if I hold it in for a few seconds you'll

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.210 
if I hold it in for a few seconds you'll
see<00:01:40.900> it<00:01:40.990> beeps<00:01:41.230> and<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.500> lights<00:01:41.710> turn<00:01:42.010> on/off

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
see it beeps and the lights turn on/off

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.950 
see it beeps and the lights turn on/off
now<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.670> little<00:01:43.240> indicator<00:01:43.570> light<00:01:43.930> is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
now the little indicator light is

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.810 
now the little indicator light is
flashing<00:01:44.320> there<00:01:44.710> so<00:01:44.920> all<00:01:45.040> I<00:01:45.070> have<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.310> do<00:01:45.520> in

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
flashing there so all I have to do in

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.600 
flashing there so all I have to do in
IVA<00:01:46.000> is<00:01:46.270> just<00:01:46.480> tap<00:01:47.260> on<00:01:47.440> that<00:01:47.950> zone<00:01:48.370> I've

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
IVA is just tap on that zone I've

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.300 
IVA is just tap on that zone I've
created<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.300> that<00:01:49.540> will<00:01:49.660> register<00:01:50.310> this

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
created and that will register this

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.550 
created and that will register this
thing<00:01:51.970> as<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.450> one<00:01:52.900> zone<00:01:53.230> that<00:01:53.440> I've

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
thing as the a one zone that I've

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.420 
thing as the a one zone that I've
created<00:01:58.590> okay<00:01:59.590> so<00:01:59.650> she's<00:01:59.980> sending<00:02:00.220> the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
created okay so she's sending the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.190 
created okay so she's sending the
instruction<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.000> that<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.420> say<00:02:01.570> register<00:02:02.050> it

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
instruction to that to say register it

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.459 
instruction to that to say register it
as<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.680> one

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.140 

takes<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.249> few<00:02:07.399> seconds

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.270 

okay<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:12.989> now<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:13.500> registered<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.190> it

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
okay so now it's registered and it

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.880 
okay so now it's registered and it
understands<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.360> it's<00:02:15.540> supposed<00:02:16.379> to<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.620> on

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
understands that it's supposed to be on

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.000 
understands that it's supposed to be on
Zone<00:02:17.879> a<00:02:18.120> one<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.870> now<00:02:19.049> I<00:02:19.080> can<00:02:19.379> basically<00:02:19.590> just

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
Zone a one so now I can basically just

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.039 
Zone a one so now I can basically just
tell<00:02:20.790> either<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.180> turn<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.659> lights<00:02:21.870> while

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
tell either to turn on the lights while

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.509 
tell either to turn on the lights while
they're<00:02:22.319> already<00:02:22.440> on<00:02:22.620> site<00:02:22.830> Ella<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.310> turn

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
they're already on site Ella to turn

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:33.360 
they're already on site Ella to turn
them<00:02:23.700> off<00:02:23.819> turn<00:02:26.239> off<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.599> lights

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.190 

and<00:02:33.849> it<00:02:33.970> takes<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.330> couple<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.690> seconds<00:02:35.019> because

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
and it takes a couple of seconds because

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680 
and it takes a couple of seconds because
of<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.590> delay<00:02:35.860> with<00:02:36.129> talking<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.330> service

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
of the delay with talking to the service

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.540 
of the delay with talking to the service
and<00:02:37.810> also<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.500> I've<00:02:38.620> got<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.830> password<00:02:39.430> on

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
and also to that I've got a password on

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.020 
and also to that I've got a password on
there<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:41.459> that's<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.580> little<00:02:42.730> bit<00:02:42.879> more

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
there so that that's a little bit more

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.520 
there so that that's a little bit more
of<00:02:43.090> delay<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.599> can<00:02:43.810> see<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:44.170> she's

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
of delay so you can see that she's

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.600 
of delay so you can see that she's
turned<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.830> lights<00:02:45.040> off<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.250> again

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
turned the lights off and again

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.190 
turned the lights off and again
obviously<00:02:45.910> this<00:02:46.300> can<00:02:46.510> work<00:02:46.660> from<00:02:46.780> anyway<00:02:47.140> you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
obviously this can work from anyway you

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.660 
obviously this can work from anyway you
don't<00:02:47.379> have<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.680> be<00:02:47.800> on<00:02:47.980> your<00:02:48.129> Wi-Fi<00:02:48.519> network

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
don't have to be on your Wi-Fi network

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.670 
don't have to be on your Wi-Fi network
or<00:02:48.970> anything<00:02:49.180> I'll<00:02:49.569> turn<00:02:50.019> them<00:02:50.110> back<00:02:50.290> on<00:02:50.410> again

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:07.210 

turn<00:02:53.680> on<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.980> lights

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.500 

there<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.310> go<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.610> then<00:03:08.700> back<00:03:08.849> on<00:03:09.030> again

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
there you go and then back on again

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.570 
there you go and then back on again
so<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.260> shows<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.500> how<00:03:10.890> easy<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.340> to

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
so that shows you how easy it is to

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.390 
so that shows you how easy it is to
register<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.750> mean<00:03:13.050> really<00:03:13.400> replacing

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
register it and I mean really replacing

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.610 
register it and I mean really replacing
that<00:03:14.550> switch<00:03:15.090> in<00:03:15.270> there<00:03:15.420> took<00:03:15.599> me<00:03:15.780> about<00:03:16.020> ten

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
that switch in there took me about ten

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.710 
that switch in there took me about ten
minutes<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:17.099> do<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.360> was<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.510> think

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
minutes to do that and it was I think

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.630 
minutes to do that and it was I think
was<00:03:18.959> twenty<00:03:19.260> dollars<00:03:19.530> for<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.830> switch<00:03:20.099> so

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
was twenty dollars for that switch so

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.240 
was twenty dollars for that switch so
that<00:03:21.030> if<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.020> have<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.319> Insteon<00:03:22.769> controller

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
that if you have the Insteon controller

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.270 
that if you have the Insteon controller
or<00:03:23.489> either<00:03:23.730> 2412<00:03:24.480> in<00:03:24.720> which<00:03:24.959> was<00:03:25.140> about<00:03:25.349> 120

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
or either 2412 in which was about 120

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.979 
or either 2412 in which was about 120
dollars<00:03:26.550> or<00:03:26.700> something<00:03:26.819> like<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.810> can

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
dollars or something like that you can

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.809 
dollars or something like that you can
start<00:03:28.290> controlling<00:03:28.830> all<00:03:29.040> sorts<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.370> things<00:03:29.550> in

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
start controlling all sorts of things in

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:41.700 
start controlling all sorts of things in
your<00:03:29.910> house<00:03:30.090> alright<00:03:31.019> hope<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.620> enjoyed

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.770
