00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.890
 via our calculations and technique n ya 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.060
 today some little tricks on a 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.450
 adjustment of the shower doors 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.450
 know 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.740
 the tools the assembly for the adjustment 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.540
 of the shower door are the keys to 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.210
 2,534 thousand images provided with the 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.500
 shower door a star screwdriver and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.500
 a level of 10 feet in length 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.190
 at first the fixed panel 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.200
 this one is always a brand new one 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.840
 this is the level at the right place on our 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.460
 Murat motorbikes subsequently placed two 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.750
 levels on top of the goal even though 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.550
 this one is not at the level 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.500
 you'll get three-quarters of 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.850
 post adjustments simply do 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.210
 slide panels in the amount 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.920
 global 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.740
 when you have found there 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.890
 optimal fixed this one using the ten 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.810
 other people provided with death 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.610
 thirdly the trunk rail 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.760
 previously pierced in the green 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.710
 should be enough to adjust for 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.330
 the additional adjustment in the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.700
 corner installation frame like 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.619
 examples presented here ashley you that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.869
 the back panel and snug fit 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.670
 adjustment of the latter and performed 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.910
 in the same way as with panels 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.690
 fixed sorry for an installation by 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.150
 same account 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.369
 the rural anchorage has three 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.020
 possibilities of adjustment that should 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.020
 suffice to maximize justice 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.850
 for the adjustment of movable panels 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.859
 v series goal is to roll for 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.319
 allow the set to be adjusted by the 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:47.509
 unscrewed from about an old metal 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.549
 the life without big of the roulette which is 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.349
 located above the handle in 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.929
 getting the outer facade of the 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:55.909
 pellet 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.159
 insert the hex key on the side of 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.990
 the roulette plate to adjust the 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.300
 door turning the key 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.580
 it will be possible to adjust gaps 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.800
 the door to its closure insert the 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.110
 roulette as to sweat if the door is not 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.090
 still not perfectly adjusted it is 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.070
 also went from unscrewing the second 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.490
 casters tighten the caster by the 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.040
 after 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.140
 after he has tightened the habit of 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.440
 ride until it is very close 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.090
 for about 20 min mike without once 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.090
 the budget we did not create friction 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.980
 finally to complete the adjustment 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.959
 from our relaxed door 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.940
 we must eliminate the five sources of 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.910
 friction has to him returns to do 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.950
 firstly violence the friction to 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.170
 the opening and closing of the port of 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.150
 come from casters that would have said 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.310
 aim for a second source of friction 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.200
 could be caused by the goals and 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.739
 of casters that are left too tight 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.480
 in touch then to m then the 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.250
 dickens positioning down the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.470
 door may not have been installed 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.959
 correctly in the game their must be 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.959
 checked between the guide and the fixed bumper 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.530
 fourthly the royan where the order 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.910
 had fallen against an installation 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.010
 which is not a word 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.079
 he is therefore bent and opposes more than 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.730
 resistance to the sphere the south makes sure 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.810
 that there will be one so installed 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.329
 parallel 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.310
 finally for showers less he 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.170
 complains the bread back was hurt 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.170
 installed so you have to adjust it 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.720
 so here is our door is now 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.099
 adjust perfection for more 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.599
 more information see our 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.079

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.079
