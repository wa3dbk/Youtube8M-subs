because Mike's urging me on to get some
more<00:03:51.209> kills<00:03:51.480> because<00:03:51.690> it's<00:03:52.109> commits<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.680> end

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.809 
of the game as you can see in the bottom
left<00:03:54.090> but<00:03:54.329> i<00:03:55.169> think<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.190> mobile<00:03:56.430> kill<00:03:56.609> is<00:03:56.730> the

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
left but i think the mobile kill is the

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.399 
left but i think the mobile kill is the
next<00:03:57.030> one<00:03:57.209> so<00:03:57.389> it<00:03:57.540> goes<00:03:57.569> over<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.109> enjoyed<00:03:58.319> the
