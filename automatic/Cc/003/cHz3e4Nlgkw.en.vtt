00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:15.849
 bÃ©chard the bas-rhin in paris but on this theme without speaking but 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.289
 it is true that dalloyau cited the great legend 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.589
 that made me dream when I passed in front of the windows 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.359
 exactly the four-year-old charles base of the lab and how do these specialists 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.449
 yet a frame chris imagine as truth who does what 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.900
 good you have to be innovative 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.140
 it's very curious 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.379
 good I think we must also eliminate the focus the esa yes but because it 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.780
 goes a little bit everywhere which avoids sweden 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.760
 this search for northern excellence 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.560
 So here is my course is also to do a little balls 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.900
 approaching the young here is that is pretty disappointed with jewels 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.490
 get spotted pretty quickly in two years doing things too 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.780
 ok specialty galoya is still quite traditional to please everyone 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.190
 Is that an aspect that you like? 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.940
 an extract of the cells on the spot but we try them are enough 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.280
 devastating 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.310
 on design 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.680
 because we can look for things much further 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.110
 e on the spot we stay in a line of conduct very thugs in arms in 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.730
 the burial of a very specific loyal Buddha but it's true that offers 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.460
 your departure from this rule because it belongs to us and we learn that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.460
 all other data we want our own situation 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 and that invoked to the attraction is here that saleh al-ali 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.260
 I think I have to rigor rigor as well 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.920
 order perpetuated precisely the game 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.340
 the taste the rigor to perpetuate also pay a nanny mm through me 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.690
 For example, we have the job I think we're going 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.330
 to know how to do, we must transmit and we have been striving since 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.270
 from generation to generation so I'm gonna I got and on transfers I 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.400
 mean to young people and so even if the husband is taken to ride them at most 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.850
 high point 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.720
