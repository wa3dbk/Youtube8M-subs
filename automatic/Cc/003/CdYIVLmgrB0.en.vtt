00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
with the rolls and one more roll I

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.510 
with the rolls and one more roll I
wanted<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.840> talk<00:01:14.049> about<00:01:14.079> it's<00:01:14.860> called<00:01:14.979> the

wanted to talk about it's called the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.370 
wanted to talk about it's called the
alternating<00:01:16.270> thumb<00:01:16.810> roll<00:01:18.899> and<00:01:19.899> what<00:01:20.170> that

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
alternating thumb roll and what that

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.850 
alternating thumb roll and what that
consists<00:01:21.369> of<00:01:21.549> is<00:01:23.130> picking<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:26.409> of<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.710> ways

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
consists of is picking one of the ways

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.039 
consists of is picking one of the ways
to<00:01:27.189> pick<00:01:27.399> it<00:01:27.549> out<00:01:27.610> in<00:01:27.880> this<00:01:28.060> example<00:01:28.240> anyways

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
to pick it out in this example anyways

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.370 
to pick it out in this example anyways
is<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:30.580> pick<00:01:30.789> the<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.060> third<00:01:31.689> string<00:01:32.020> with<00:01:32.229> the

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
is to pick the the third string with the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.749 
is to pick the the third string with the
thumb<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:35.079> pick<00:01:35.679> the<00:01:35.799> second<00:01:36.250> string<00:01:36.549> with

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
thumb now pick the second string with

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.859 
thumb now pick the second string with
the<00:01:36.880> index<00:01:37.329> finger<00:01:38.880> now<00:01:39.880> come<00:01:40.210> back<00:01:40.240> with<00:01:40.479> the

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
the index finger now come back with the

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.149 
the index finger now come back with the
thumb<00:01:41.200> that's<00:01:41.500> why<00:01:41.710> they<00:01:41.890> call<00:01:42.130> it

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
thumb that's why they call it

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.800 
thumb that's why they call it
alternating<00:01:43.000> because<00:01:43.240> it's<00:01:43.420> going<00:01:43.569> to<00:01:43.630> be

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
alternating because it's going to be

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.620 
alternating because it's going to be
thumb<00:01:44.140> index<00:01:45.750> thumb<00:01:46.750> middle<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.700> again

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.420 

now<00:01:52.170> we're<00:01:52.350> going<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.530> pick<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> fifth<00:01:53.159> string

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
now we're going to pick the fifth string

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.510 
now we're going to pick the fifth string
with<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> thumb<00:01:54.890> now<00:01:55.890> we're<00:01:56.070> going<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.220> pick

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
with the thumb now we're going to pick

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.060 
with the thumb now we're going to pick
the<00:01:56.970> first<00:01:57.720> string<00:01:58.020> with<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.409> middle<00:01:58.680> finger

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the first string with the middle finger

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.289 
the first string with the middle finger
of<00:01:59.130> our<00:01:59.280> right<00:01:59.340> hand

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
of our right hand

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:09.270 
of our right hand
so<00:02:01.899> it<00:02:02.049> sounds<00:02:02.380> like<00:02:02.560> this

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.320 

again<00:02:10.280> that's<00:02:10.520> why<00:02:10.700> they<00:02:10.880> call<00:02:11.090> it<00:02:11.120> the

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
again that's why they call it the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.920 
again that's why they call it the
alternating<00:02:12.200> thumb<00:02:12.349> roll<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.970> because<00:02:14.330> you're

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
alternating thumb roll is because you're

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.100 
alternating thumb roll is because you're
hitting<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.290> thumb<00:02:15.760> index

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:46.040 

index<00:02:22.110> thumb

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.640 

and<00:02:46.800> that's<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.280> alternating<00:02:47.820> thumb<00:02:47.970> roll

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
and that's the alternating thumb roll

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.620 
and that's the alternating thumb roll
and<00:02:49.650> again<00:02:49.890> we<00:02:50.040> can<00:02:50.220> use<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.550> on<00:02:50.820> other

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
and again we can use this on other

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.140 
and again we can use this on other
strings<00:02:52.290> as<00:02:52.560> well

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
strings as well

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.820 
strings as well
so<00:02:55.190> we<00:02:56.190> can<00:02:56.400> play<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.819> first<00:02:57.290> set<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.519> notes

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
so we can play that first set of notes

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.970 
so we can play that first set of notes
now<00:03:01.830> we<00:03:01.890> can<00:03:02.159> drop<00:03:02.400> our<00:03:02.610> thumb<00:03:02.909> down<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:04.860> the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
now we can drop our thumb down to the

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.759 
now we can drop our thumb down to the
fourth<00:03:05.250> string<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.849> play<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.390> same<00:03:07.110> role

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
fourth string and play that same role

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:24.230 
fourth string and play that same role
and<00:03:10.769> we<00:03:10.890> get<00:03:11.040> this

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.210 

and<00:03:24.780> that's<00:03:24.960> cold

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.699 

alternating

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.080 

so<00:03:38.340> practice<00:03:39.239> on<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:39.599> role<00:03:40.469> as<00:03:40.709> well<00:03:41.090> and

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
so practice on that role as well and

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.860 
so practice on that role as well and
practice<00:03:42.510> all<00:03:42.689> these<00:03:42.959> roles<00:03:43.200> again<00:03:44.239> just<00:03:45.239> to

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
practice all these roles again just to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.610 
practice all these roles again just to
go<00:03:46.079> over<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.909> foundational<00:03:48.900> roles<00:03:49.170> for

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
go over the the foundational roles for

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:57.350 
go over the the foundational roles for
this<00:03:49.769> style<00:03:50.129> we<00:03:50.790> have<00:03:50.969> the<00:03:51.180> forward<00:03:51.450> roll

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.550 

we<00:03:57.720> have<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.050> backward<00:03:58.500> roll

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.620 

we<00:04:03.980> have<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.510> forward-backward<00:04:05.510> roll

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:21.640 

we<00:04:11.110> have<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:12.040> backward<00:04:12.580> forward<00:04:13.480> roll

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.210 

and<00:04:22.070> we<00:04:22.250> have<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.699> alternating<00:04:23.449> thumb<00:04:24.220> rule

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
and we have the alternating thumb rule

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:39.300 
and we have the alternating thumb rule
or<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.669> thumb<00:04:25.970> 1<00:04:26.240> thumb<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.960> roll

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.300 

so<00:04:39.880> those<00:04:40.180> are<00:04:40.720> again<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.470> foundational

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
so those are again the foundational

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.170 
so those are again the foundational
roles<00:04:42.639> in<00:04:43.570> this<00:04:44.230> three<00:04:44.530> finger<00:04:44.950> style<00:04:45.250> so<00:04:45.940> take

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
roles in this three finger style so take

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.210 
roles in this three finger style so take
your<00:04:46.330> time<00:04:46.570> with<00:04:46.600> all<00:04:46.810> these<00:04:47.139> roles<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:47.919> again

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
your time with all these roles and again

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.060 
your time with all these roles and again
build<00:04:49.060> up<00:04:49.270> your<00:04:49.450> speed<00:04:49.930> really<00:04:50.320> slow<00:04:50.740> and

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
build up your speed really slow and

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.620
