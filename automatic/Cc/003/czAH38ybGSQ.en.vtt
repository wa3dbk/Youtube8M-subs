00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
the chief technology officer of

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.140 
the chief technology officer of
multi-touch<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.960> clarify<00:00:10.370> in<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.550> tutorial

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
multi-touch to clarify in this tutorial

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.850 
multi-touch to clarify in this tutorial
I'm<00:00:12.450> going<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.780> walk<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.139> through<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.650> our

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
I'm going to walk you through of our

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.980 
I'm going to walk you through of our
very<00:00:14.490> simple<00:00:14.700> multi-touch<00:00:15.299> application

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
very simple multi-touch application

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.019 
very simple multi-touch application
called<00:00:16.710> hello<00:00:16.949> world<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:17.970> this

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
called hello world so in this

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.029 
called hello world so in this
application<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:18.930> just<00:00:19.230> our<00:00:19.470> simple

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
application we have just our simple

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.710 
application we have just our simple
rectangles<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.820> screen<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:21.570> play

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
rectangles on the screen and we can play

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:35.450 
rectangles on the screen and we can play
around<00:00:21.840> with<00:00:22.140> those

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.430 

okay<00:00:36.460> now<00:00:37.090> we<00:00:37.420> can<00:00:37.600> have<00:00:37.750> a<00:00:37.780> look<00:00:37.990> at<00:00:38.080> how<00:00:38.230> this

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
okay now we can have a look at how this

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.950 
okay now we can have a look at how this
is<00:00:38.560> actually<00:00:38.770> done<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:40.090> here<00:00:40.330> we<00:00:40.630> have<00:00:40.840> the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
is actually done so here we have the

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.960 
is actually done so here we have the
full<00:00:41.080> application<00:00:41.430> source<00:00:42.430> code<00:00:42.580> that's

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
full application source code that's

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.690 
full application source code that's
related<00:00:43.450> to<00:00:43.660> this<00:00:43.780> example<00:00:44.350> if<00:00:45.220> we<00:00:45.340> start<00:00:45.610> off

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
related to this example if we start off

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.420 
related to this example if we start off
in<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.030> first<00:00:46.239> line<00:00:46.510> we<00:00:47.110> have<00:00:47.320> included<00:00:48.070> multi

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
in the first line we have included multi

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.960 
in the first line we have included multi
widgets<00:00:48.850> /<00:00:49.360> simple<00:00:50.080> SQL<00:00:50.200> application<00:00:51.070> of<00:00:51.250> HPP

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
widgets / simple SQL application of HPP

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.840 
widgets / simple SQL application of HPP
so<00:00:52.840> this<00:00:53.050> header<00:00:53.290> file<00:00:53.559> gives<00:00:54.010> us<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.489> basic

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
so this header file gives us the basic

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.040 
so this header file gives us the basic
definitions<00:00:55.420> that<00:00:55.480> we<00:00:55.629> are<00:00:55.690> going<00:00:55.870> to<00:00:55.960> be

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
definitions that we are going to be

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
definitions that we are going to be
needing<00:00:56.430> then<00:00:57.430> it's<00:00:57.790> time<00:00:58.090> to<00:00:58.120> call<00:00:58.239> into<00:00:58.660> main

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
needing then it's time to call into main

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.850 
needing then it's time to call into main
as<00:01:00.070> in<00:01:00.280> any<00:01:00.430> C<00:01:00.670> or<00:01:00.910> C++<00:01:01.140> application<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.680> after

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
as in any C or C++ application and after

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.280 
as in any C or C++ application and after
that<00:01:03.100> we<00:01:03.309> can<00:01:03.430> call<00:01:03.670> STL<00:01:04.180> in<00:01:04.360> it<00:01:04.479> which<00:01:05.140> is

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
that we can call STL in it which is

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.380 
that we can call STL in it which is
responsible<00:01:05.680> for<00:01:06.040> initializing<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:07.060> video

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
responsible for initializing the video

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.710 
responsible for initializing the video
system<00:01:07.810> for<00:01:07.990> us<00:01:08.670> once<00:01:09.670> this<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:10.000> done<00:01:10.210> we<00:01:10.479> move

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
system for us once this is done we move

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.070 
system for us once this is done we move
on<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.200> doing<00:01:11.560> actual<00:01:11.800> multi-touch<00:01:12.250> work<00:01:13.080> so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
on to doing actual multi-touch work so

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.020 
on to doing actual multi-touch work so
we<00:01:14.259> create<00:01:14.530> an<00:01:14.619> object<00:01:14.770> of<00:01:15.250> type<00:01:15.460> multi

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
we create an object of type multi

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.690 
we create an object of type multi
widgets<00:01:16.420> :<00:01:16.869> :<00:01:17.170> simple<00:01:17.619> is<00:01:17.770> real<00:01:17.979> application

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
widgets : : simple is real application

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.510 
widgets : : simple is real application
so<00:01:19.479> this<00:01:19.720> is<00:01:19.869> an<00:01:20.020> application<00:01:20.170> object<00:01:21.100> that's

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
so this is an application object that's

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.889 
so this is an application object that's
the<00:01:21.640> responsible<00:01:22.300> for<00:01:22.479> managing<00:01:22.840> the

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
the responsible for managing the

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.900 
the responsible for managing the
touchscreen<00:01:23.350> with<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.009> graphics<00:01:24.399> and<00:01:24.580> so<00:01:24.700> on

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
touchscreen with the graphics and so on

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.510 
touchscreen with the graphics and so on
so<00:01:25.570> in<00:01:25.690> this<00:01:25.780> next<00:01:25.990> line<00:01:26.290> when<00:01:26.740> we<00:01:26.830> call<00:01:27.009> app<00:01:27.220> so

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
so in this next line when we call app so

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.370 
so in this next line when we call app so
simple<00:01:27.970> in<00:01:28.090> it<00:01:28.210> what's<00:01:28.540> happening<00:01:29.020> that<00:01:29.050> it's

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
simple in it what's happening that it's

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.530 
simple in it what's happening that it's
our<00:01:29.670> starting<00:01:30.670> off<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:30.970> camera<00:01:31.300> based

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
our starting off the camera based

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.710 
our starting off the camera based
computer<00:01:32.229> vision<00:01:32.560> it's<00:01:33.060> opening<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.119> OpenGL

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
computer vision it's opening the OpenGL

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.749 
computer vision it's opening the OpenGL
windows<00:01:35.110> for<00:01:35.350> us<00:01:35.500> it's<00:01:35.860> starting<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.399> sound

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
windows for us it's starting the sound

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.870 
windows for us it's starting the sound
engine<00:01:37.149> and<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:37.450> on<00:01:38.459> just<00:01:39.459> we're<00:01:39.670> careful

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
engine and so on just we're careful

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.699 
engine and so on just we're careful
people<00:01:40.179> we<00:01:40.479> will<00:01:40.630> check<00:01:40.810> out<00:01:40.959> if<00:01:41.200> for<00:01:41.679> some

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
people we will check out if for some

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.490 
people we will check out if for some
reason<00:01:42.069> it<00:01:42.160> fails<00:01:42.429> we<00:01:42.640> will<00:01:42.880> return<00:01:43.500> following

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
reason it fails we will return following

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.130 
reason it fails we will return following
that<00:01:44.950> we<00:01:45.520> are<00:01:45.610> going<00:01:45.789> to<00:01:45.880> create<00:01:46.119> some<00:01:46.780> content

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
that we are going to create some content

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.809 
that we are going to create some content
on<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:47.410> screen<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:48.039> we're<00:01:48.190> creating<00:01:48.459> five

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
on the screen so we're creating five

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.120 
on the screen so we're creating five
widgets<00:01:49.330> different<00:01:49.929> colors<00:01:50.319> so<00:01:50.920> the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
widgets different colors so the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.559 
widgets different colors so the
rectangles<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:52.090> see<00:01:52.270> on<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.479> video

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
rectangles that you see on the video

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.169 
rectangles that you see on the video
each<00:01:52.959> of<00:01:53.110> them<00:01:53.229> is<00:01:53.319> called<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.590> widget<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.220> they

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
each of them is called a widget and they

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.600 
each of them is called a widget and they
are<00:01:55.270> created<00:01:55.690> with<00:01:55.869> called<00:01:56.229> new<00:01:56.679> multi

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
are created with called new multi

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.870 
are created with called new multi
widgets<00:01:58.030> :<00:01:58.630> :<00:01:59.009> widget

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
widgets : : widget

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.600 
widgets : : widget
and<00:02:01.210> as<00:02:01.750> an<00:02:01.960> argument<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.040> call<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.340> would

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
and as an argument to that call I would

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.020 
and as an argument to that call I would
say<00:02:03.790> even<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.290> Abydos<00:02:06.070> root<00:02:06.369> is<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.759> widget

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
say even so Abydos root is a widget

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.540 
say even so Abydos root is a widget
itself<00:02:07.509> that's<00:02:07.960> like<00:02:08.170> other<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.890> root<00:02:09.069> widget

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
itself that's like other the root widget

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.630 
itself that's like other the root widget
that's<00:02:10.270> just<00:02:10.830> holding<00:02:11.830> everything<00:02:12.010> else<00:02:12.430> in

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
that's just holding everything else in

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.570 
that's just holding everything else in
the<00:02:12.730> scene<00:02:13.709> then<00:02:14.709> we<00:02:14.950> start<00:02:15.220> setting<00:02:15.520> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
the scene then we start setting the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.210 
the scene then we start setting the
parameters<00:02:16.120> for<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.420> widget<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.680> we<00:02:17.920> set<00:02:18.100> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
parameters for the widget so we set the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.470 
parameters for the widget so we set the
size<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.030> widget<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:20.080> case<00:02:20.410> it's<00:02:20.650> our

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
size of the widget in this case it's our

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.870 
size of the widget in this case it's our
100<00:02:22.480> by<00:02:22.630> 100<00:02:22.840> pixels<00:02:23.370> then<00:02:24.370> we<00:02:24.580> set<00:02:24.760> the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
100 by 100 pixels then we set the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.590 
100 by 100 pixels then we set the
location<00:02:25.239> which<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.550> basically<00:02:27.600> calculated

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
location which is basically calculated

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.030 
location which is basically calculated
so<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:29.020> starts<00:02:29.260> from<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.620> top<00:02:29.800> left

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
so that it starts from the top left

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.979 
so that it starts from the top left
corner<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:30.580> it's<00:02:30.940> going<00:02:31.060> diagonally<00:02:31.780> down

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
corner and it's going diagonally down

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.680 
corner and it's going diagonally down
towards<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.680> bottom<00:02:32.830> right<00:02:33.160> corner<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:34.120> then

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
towards the bottom right corner and then

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.240 
towards the bottom right corner and then
we<00:02:34.870> create<00:02:35.110> random<00:02:35.470> colors<00:02:35.830> for<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.100> widget

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
we create random colors for the widget

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.030 
we create random colors for the widget
so<00:02:36.790> it's<00:02:36.910> actually<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.450> color<00:02:38.170> gradient<00:02:38.410> so

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
so it's actually a color gradient so

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.309 
so it's actually a color gradient so
colors<00:02:39.459> for<00:02:40.090> us<00:02:40.209> they<00:02:40.450> are<00:02:40.480> four<00:02:40.810> dimensional

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
colors for us they are four dimensional

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.490 
colors for us they are four dimensional
vectors<00:02:41.739> floating<00:02:42.459> point<00:02:42.670> vectors<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.500> here

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
vectors floating point vectors and here

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.990 
vectors floating point vectors and here
the<00:02:44.800> red<00:02:45.370> value<00:02:45.640> set<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.650> 1.0<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:48.400> green<00:02:48.610> value

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
the red value set to 1.0 the green value

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.979 
the red value set to 1.0 the green value
we<00:02:49.150> interpolate<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.750> bit<00:02:50.819> we<00:02:51.819> working<00:02:52.660> with<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
we interpolate a bit we working with the

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.690 
we interpolate a bit we working with the
blue<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.530> then<00:02:53.860> we<00:02:54.010> have<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.220> alpha<00:02:54.549> value

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
blue and then we have the alpha value

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.650 
blue and then we have the alpha value
about<00:02:55.470> 0.97<00:02:56.470> which<00:02:57.100> is<00:02:57.250> are<00:02:57.459> almost<00:02:58.390> fully

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
about 0.97 which is are almost fully

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.570 
about 0.97 which is are almost fully
opaque<00:02:59.019> just<00:02:59.590> very<00:02:59.920> slightly<00:03:00.220> above

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
opaque just very slightly above

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.509 
opaque just very slightly above
transparency<00:03:01.299> there<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.980> that's<00:03:03.190> enough<00:03:03.489> to

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
transparency there and that's enough to

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.640 
transparency there and that's enough to
create<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.970> widget<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.690> once<00:03:05.470> we've<00:03:05.620> done

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
create the widget so once we've done

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.740 
create the widget so once we've done
this<00:03:05.980> we<00:03:06.040> set<00:03:06.430> up<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.700> scene<00:03:06.910> we've<00:03:07.510> created

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
this we set up the scene we've created

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.120 
this we set up the scene we've created
five<00:03:08.079> regions<00:03:08.470> of<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.709> screen<00:03:08.950> with

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
five regions of the screen with

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.250 
five regions of the screen with
different<00:03:09.489> colors<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.120> now<00:03:10.510> it's<00:03:10.900> time<00:03:11.230> to

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
different colors and now it's time to

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.650 
different colors and now it's time to
run<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.680> application<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.519> which<00:03:13.299> is<00:03:13.450> done<00:03:13.630> by

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
run the application and which is done by

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.199 
run the application and which is done by
simply<00:03:13.900> calling<00:03:14.290> up<00:03:14.590> dr.<00:03:15.190> Brad<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:16.030> will

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
simply calling up dr. Brad and this will

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.240 
simply calling up dr. Brad and this will
execute<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.870> application<00:03:16.930> until<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:18.070> user

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
execute the application until the user

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:41.100 
execute the application until the user
presses<00:03:18.880> our<00:03:19.120> Q<00:03:19.720> or<00:03:19.959> esque

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110
