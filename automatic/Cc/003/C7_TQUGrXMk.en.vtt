00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.760
 Hello 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:29.910
 we're 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:34.380
 to December 15th that means it's 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.120
 a month and a half the time they take 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.760
 these seedlings 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:48.269
 see what I want to comment 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:52.530
 that are crooked why are two 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:57.869
 appointments that now at headquarters fix it 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.350
 for the reason that when spraying the 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:00.350
 weight 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.220
 has motivated you to tilt 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.590
 when the water falls on the plant that has 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.299
 a great weight 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:19.069
 down below us at the base we can not 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:22.789
 see them here the roots but it is that it is 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.990
 minimum the hairlines are very very roots 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.020
 little 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.079
 that's why this is what I see 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:35.080
 here that is lying down and that I will try 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.080
 fix with a pen will help me 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:44.010
 well this is a stick that they had 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.010
 there to check the growth 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.070
 what is the a 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.640
 here we have another one that has the same 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.640
 problem 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:00.700
 let's see now the general state 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:04.740
 It is helpful if excess water 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:10.160
 can take us to 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.530
 is for example to fix you here is 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.330
 the excess water one of the cooks 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.480
 is 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.230
 you are losing that you have to carry 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.940
 Care when spraying and do it between parties 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:29.090
 you see here and here and not 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.240
 sprinkle it over because it will happen to us 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.040
 this 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.040
 another general view 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:47.060
 and now I'm going to fix them before I want 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.060
 wish you a merry christmas 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.660
 2013 for all that the world is better 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.470
 and that we 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.470
 we help him 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.040
 well then 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.510
 I want to do it in your presence 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.850
 look at it 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:16.080
 here it squeezes a little 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.910
 and with some pebbles from here the 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.390
 I put right 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:25.730
 but for example 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:30.220
 this one that you have here is the one I will leave but 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:35.060
 realize that the cotyledons being 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.880
 moistened by spraying up 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.550
 we will run plant is not 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.340
 will progress the function is logical 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.980
 chlorophyll is made by the leaves here 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.709
 we have another one that they use is this 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.769
 another that also happens the same 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.010
 let's hope that it is so before and here 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.680
 other 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.260
 You see that was because I made the mistake on 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.920
 alex lotus powder sprinkle water 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.189
 water them without taking into account that 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.280
 to water here and here I can sprinkle 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:11.930
 there with a small 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:15.379
 with a tiny device 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.090
 I did not do it and the error is here 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.359
 nevertheless you can observe is there 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.770
 it's like they are good conditions now 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:29.169
 here it is that it is quite lying down 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.169
 I will try to see how 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.039
 I hold you 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.039
 so that it is 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.300
 there is 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.759
 you see 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.639
 but also it is also true 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:48.759
 that does not have 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:52.210
 we go that the roots in the long run 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:55.659
 roots are incredibly sensitive other 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.830
 mistake here in this is water takes 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.830
 be very careful in that 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:07.080
 that's why now I'll put it on the sun 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:09.760
 to give you enough 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.880
 we have 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.750
 only with helping them a little 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.750
 respond 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:25.159
 It is not already either is that it is so 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.159
 for example 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:33.409
 now and I'm telling you that I 'll put it in 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.949
 in direct the sun 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:39.080
 and with caution after carrying great 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.840
 caution 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.230
 why 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.889
 what do you think would happen then what 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.749
 would happen is that 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:52.240
 everything is already that way 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:55.360
 would happen is that they would burn 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:00.860
 although this December sun is not 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:04.960
 strong enough if it is for 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.960
 that mother leaf that leaf 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.950
 this plant that I lost the 2 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.950
 cotyledons 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:24.000
 and well now it will only be 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.000
 so I will not be very rigorous 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:34.280
 in putting two more video information 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:36.970
 because it's about keeping them with 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.970
 irrigations 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:46.240
 start and very gently to donate 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.729
 otherwise 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.889
 It is done 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.889
 there we have a good result 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:02.960
 well what is said 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:02.960
 Merry Christmas and a better world 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:09.069
 we can do something we can do something 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:09.069
 if 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.009
 on this floor 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.870
 because this genre
