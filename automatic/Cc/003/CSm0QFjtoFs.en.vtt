what's up guys in this video I'm going

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.340 
what's up guys in this video I'm going
to<00:00:01.829> show<00:00:02.040> you<00:00:02.100> three<00:00:02.790> simple<00:00:03.149> steps<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.870> help

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
to show you three simple steps to help

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.829 
to show you three simple steps to help
speed<00:00:04.799> up<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.250> improve<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:06.240> performance<00:00:06.359> of

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
speed up and improve the performance of

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.750 
speed up and improve the performance of
your<00:00:06.899> Mac<00:00:07.140> computer<00:00:07.529> three<00:00:08.010> simple<00:00:08.309> steps<00:00:08.370> all

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
your Mac computer three simple steps all

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.250 
your Mac computer three simple steps all
you<00:00:08.910> have<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.120> do<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.389> follow<00:00:09.570> these<00:00:09.840> steps<00:00:09.960> and

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
you have to do is follow these steps and

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.080 
you have to do is follow these steps and
hopefully<00:00:10.889> your<00:00:11.070> max<00:00:11.280> should<00:00:11.460> be<00:00:11.610> running<00:00:11.940> at

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
hopefully your max should be running at

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.850 
hopefully your max should be running at
optimal<00:00:12.660> performance<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.469> let's<00:00:13.679> go<00:00:13.830> ahead

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
optimal performance so let's go ahead

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.369 
optimal performance so let's go ahead
and<00:00:14.040> start<00:00:14.429> with<00:00:14.670> step<00:00:15.000> number<00:00:15.210> one<00:00:15.660> okay<00:00:16.199> guys

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
and start with step number one okay guys

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.170 
and start with step number one okay guys
the<00:00:16.560> first<00:00:16.710> step<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.160> want<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.550> do<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.880> go

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the first step I want you to do is go

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.320 
the first step I want you to do is go
into<00:00:18.420> your<00:00:18.690> macintosh<00:00:19.320> HD<00:00:19.820> hard<00:00:20.820> drive<00:00:21.090> on

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
into your macintosh HD hard drive on

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.900 
into your macintosh HD hard drive on
your<00:00:21.359> Mac<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.810> simply<00:00:22.710> go<00:00:22.890> into<00:00:22.920> applications

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
your Mac and simply go into applications

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.519 
your Mac and simply go into applications
now<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.420> see<00:00:24.570> any<00:00:24.779> applications<00:00:25.380> here

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
now if you see any applications here

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.830 
now if you see any applications here
that<00:00:26.010> are<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.550> useless<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.539> don't<00:00:27.720> even

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
that are just useless and you don't even

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.720 
that are just useless and you don't even
use<00:00:28.050> them<00:00:28.170> anymore<00:00:28.380> like<00:00:28.650> geekbench<00:00:29.160> i<00:00:29.369> mean<00:00:29.640> i

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
use them anymore like geekbench i mean i

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.830 
use them anymore like geekbench i mean i
haven't<00:00:29.910> used<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.449> really<00:00:30.570> long<00:00:30.689> time

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
haven't used this in a really long time

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.650 
haven't used this in a really long time
so<00:00:31.289> i<00:00:31.920> would<00:00:32.309> move<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.880> trash<00:00:33.210> but

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
so i would move this to the trash but

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.880 
so i would move this to the trash but
i'm<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:33.870> going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.200> right<00:00:34.320> now<00:00:34.469> but

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
i'm not going to do that right now but

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
i'm not going to do that right now but
if<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.250> applications<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:36.120> grand

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
if you have applications like grand

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.139 
if you have applications like grand
theft<00:00:36.750> auto<00:00:37.050> 3<00:00:37.200> san<00:00:37.860> andreas<00:00:38.340> vice<00:00:38.670> city<00:00:38.940> i

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
theft auto 3 san andreas vice city i

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.790 
theft auto 3 san andreas vice city i
mean<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.629> last<00:00:39.780> time<00:00:39.930> i<00:00:40.050> played<00:00:40.230> these<00:00:40.559> things

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
mean the last time i played these things

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.270 
mean the last time i played these things
was<00:00:41.010> 8<00:00:41.190> 25<00:00:41.850> 11<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.410> tell<00:00:43.469> i<00:00:43.860> haven't

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
was 8 25 11 so as you can tell i haven't

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.709 
was 8 25 11 so as you can tell i haven't
really<00:00:44.550> done<00:00:44.700> anything<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.270> game<00:00:45.480> for

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
really done anything with this game for

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.470 
really done anything with this game for
a<00:00:45.750> very<00:00:45.930> long<00:00:46.079> time<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.559> that's<00:00:46.860> taking<00:00:47.219> up

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
a very long time and that's taking up

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.900 
a very long time and that's taking up
1.63<00:00:48.480> gigabytes<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.530> hard<00:00:50.129> drive<00:00:50.340> space<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.789> my

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
1.63 gigabytes of hard drive space on my

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.080 
1.63 gigabytes of hard drive space on my
computer<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.110> delete<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.640> just

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
computer so if you delete this and just

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.029 
computer so if you delete this and just
random<00:00:54.480> applications<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.469> crap<00:00:55.800> that

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
random applications and just crap that

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.500 
random applications and just crap that
you<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:56.550> computer<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:57.149> your<00:00:57.180> hard

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
you have on your computer in your hard

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.479 
you have on your computer in your hard
drive<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.649> might<00:00:58.890> help<00:00:59.070> speed<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
drive this might help speed up the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.099 
drive this might help speed up the
process<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.359> doesn't<00:01:00.660> work<00:01:00.690> let's

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
process but if that doesn't work let's

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.110 
process but if that doesn't work let's
go<00:01:01.230> ahead<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.410> jump<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.039> step<00:01:02.399> number<00:01:02.609> two<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
go ahead and jump to step number two and

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.299 
go ahead and jump to step number two and
hopefully<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.989> step<00:01:04.229> will<00:01:04.530> also<00:01:04.920> increase

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
hopefully this step will also increase

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.429 
hopefully this step will also increase
the<00:01:05.670> performance<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:06.930> Mac<00:01:07.049> computer

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the performance on your Mac computer

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.960 
the performance on your Mac computer
alright<00:01:07.770> guys<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.130> step<00:01:08.310> number<00:01:08.340> two<00:01:08.760> we're

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
alright guys for step number two we're

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.109 
alright guys for step number two we're
going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> go<00:01:09.330> into<00:01:09.360> go<00:01:10.280> utilities<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.490> then

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
going to go into go utilities and then

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.450 
going to go into go utilities and then
we're<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.510> jump<00:01:12.810> down<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.439> where<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.250> it

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
we're going to jump down to where is it

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.640 
we're going to jump down to where is it
where<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.820> where<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.210> disk<00:01:15.509> utility<00:01:16.020> open

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
where is it where is a disk utility open

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.130 
where is it where is a disk utility open
up<00:01:16.770> disk<00:01:17.100> utility<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> basically<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:18.960> this

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
up disk utility and basically what this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.980 
up disk utility and basically what this
does<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.820> repairs<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.180> verifies<00:01:21.689> disk

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
does is it repairs and verifies disk

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.200 
does is it repairs and verifies disk
permissions<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.680> your<00:01:22.890> computer<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:24.000> what

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
permissions on your computer so on what

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270 
permissions on your computer so on what
you<00:01:24.330> want<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> do<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.930> select<00:01:25.320> macintosh<00:01:26.040> HD

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
you want to do is select macintosh HD

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.460 
you want to do is select macintosh HD
and<00:01:26.880> then<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.689> either<00:01:27.840> verify<00:01:28.409> disk

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and then you can either verify disk

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.109 
and then you can either verify disk
permissions<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.549> anything's<00:01:29.909> messed

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
permissions to see if anything's messed

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.030 
permissions to see if anything's messed
up<00:01:30.329> or<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.380> ahead<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.590> repair

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
up or you can just go ahead and repair

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.410 
up or you can just go ahead and repair
the<00:01:32.189> disk<00:01:32.310> permissions<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.880> think<00:01:33.270> your

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the disk permissions you think your
