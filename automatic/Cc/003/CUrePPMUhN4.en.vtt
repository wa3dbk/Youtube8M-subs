here that will come in time this is a

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.270 
here that will come in time this is a
veteran<00:03:48.610> group<00:03:49.000> for<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.540> most<00:03:49.750> part<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.320> don't

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
veteran group for the most part I don't

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.440 
veteran group for the most part I don't
think<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.610> right<00:03:51.790> thing<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.120> do<00:03:52.270> is<00:03:52.300> to

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
think the right thing to do is to

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.979 
think the right thing to do is to
reinvent<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.170> wheel<00:03:53.459> we<00:03:54.459> have<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.880> we<00:03:55.840> have<00:03:55.870> to

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
reinvent the wheel we have to we have to

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.320 
reinvent the wheel we have to we have to
work<00:03:56.290> our<00:03:56.500> way<00:03:56.530> into<00:03:57.010> into<00:03:57.790> different<00:03:58.150> things

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
work our way into into different things

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.020 
work our way into into different things
at<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.510> same<00:03:58.660> time<00:03:59.140> be<00:03:59.440> good<00:03:59.739> at<00:04:00.010> things<00:04:00.820> that

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
at the same time be good at things that

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.280 
at the same time be good at things that

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
much of a factor is that really good

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.330

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.200 
was more or less the idea of you know
beginning<00:04:21.480> with<00:04:21.750> with<00:04:22.640> Andy<00:04:23.640> just<00:04:23.850> because

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
beginning with with Andy just because

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.250 
beginning with with Andy just because
those<00:04:24.480> two<00:04:24.660> guys<00:04:24.840> are<00:04:25.110> so<00:04:25.290> good<00:04:25.470> together<00:04:25.650> and

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
those two guys are so good together and

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.440 
those two guys are so good together and
interest<00:04:28.260> in<00:04:28.380> us<00:04:28.500> is<00:04:28.770> equally<00:04:29.700> as<00:04:29.850> efficient

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
interest in us is equally as efficient

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.500 
interest in us is equally as efficient
and<00:04:30.630> in<00:04:30.900> either<00:04:31.050> case<00:04:31.200> so<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:33.120> know<00:04:33.270> that's

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
and in either case so you know that's

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.720 
and in either case so you know that's
more<00:04:33.900> or<00:04:33.930> less<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.140> basis<00:04:34.710> but<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.370> doesn't

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
more or less the basis but it doesn't

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.280 
more or less the basis but it doesn't
mean<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:36.000> Tristan<00:04:36.330> won't<00:04:36.510> be<00:04:36.630> starting<00:04:36.900> some

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
mean that Tristan won't be starting some

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.860 
mean that Tristan won't be starting some
of<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.440> games<00:04:37.680> I'm<00:04:37.920> sure<00:04:38.130> he<00:04:38.250> will<00:04:38.430> be<00:04:38.870> just

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
or less the rotations that we're looking

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.330 
or less the rotations that we're looking
to<00:06:26.639> go<00:06:26.789> with<00:06:26.970> right<00:06:27.210> now<00:06:27.889> but<00:06:28.889> that<00:06:29.039> you<00:06:29.220> know

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
to go with right now but that you know

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.399 
to go with right now but that you know
it's<00:06:29.430> not<00:06:29.639> that's<00:06:30.330> not<00:06:31.819> so<00:06:32.819> firm<00:06:33.150> and<00:06:33.479> stone

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409 
it's not that's not so firm and stone

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:36.469 
it's not that's not so firm and stone
that<00:06:34.680> that<00:06:35.310> you<00:06:35.580> know<00:06:35.610> we<00:06:35.849> can't<00:06:36.120> have<00:06:36.330> any

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
that that you know we can't have any

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.270 
that that you know we can't have any
kind<00:06:36.690> of<00:06:36.840> change<00:06:39.500> but<00:06:40.500> you<00:06:40.680> know<00:06:40.800> I<00:06:40.860> think

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
kind of change but you know I think

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.700 
kind of change but you know I think
we've<00:06:41.669> been<00:06:41.789> pretty<00:06:42.000> true<00:06:42.810> to<00:06:42.840> what<00:06:43.289> we<00:06:43.409> wanted

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
we've been pretty true to what we wanted

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.589 
we've been pretty true to what we wanted
to<00:06:43.770> do<00:06:43.979> going<00:06:44.370> throughout<00:06:44.610> the<00:06:44.729> preseason<00:06:45.060> and

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
to do going throughout the preseason and

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:49.130 
to do going throughout the preseason and
that's<00:06:46.020> that's<00:06:46.860> good
