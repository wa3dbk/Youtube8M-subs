in another version that I wanted to show
you<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.270> exactly<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> same<00:01:37.259> as

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530

you here so this is exactly the same as
the<00:01:37.920> other<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.900> so<00:01:39.900> same<00:01:40.640> primary<00:01:41.640> blade

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the other one so same primary blade

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.780 
the other one so same primary blade
there<00:01:42.420> back<00:01:43.049> lock<00:01:44.030> gut<00:01:45.030> hook<00:01:46.340> was<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.520> thumb

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
there back lock gut hook was the thumb

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.569 
there back lock gut hook was the thumb
stud<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.960> version<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.860> pouch<00:01:50.070> comes

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
stud but this version in the pouch comes

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.770 
stud but this version in the pouch comes
with<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:51.000> nice<00:01:51.570> little<00:01:51.630> saw<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.979> well<00:01:53.780> check

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
with this nice little saw as well check

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.050 
with this nice little saw as well check
that<00:01:54.930> out<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.960> could<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.170> used<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
that out so this could be used as a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.580 
that out so this could be used as a
survival<00:02:00.060> tool<00:02:00.270> or<00:02:00.689> if<00:02:01.229> you're<00:02:01.350> getting

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
survival tool or if you're getting

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.010 
survival tool or if you're getting
gnarly<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:02.189> some<00:02:02.430> bones<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.240> think<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.719> mostly

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
gnarly on some bones I think it's mostly

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.709 
gnarly on some bones I think it's mostly
designed<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> bones<00:02:04.829> but<00:02:05.689> check<00:02:06.689> that

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
designed for the bones but check that

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.820 
designed for the bones but check that
