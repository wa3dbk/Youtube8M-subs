Janeiro in Brazil and Brazil is unusual
as<00:00:07.740> it's<00:00:08.130> one<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.580> few<00:00:08.820> countries<00:00:09.090> that<00:00:09.990> is

named after a tree when the Portuguese

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.349 
named after a tree when the Portuguese

hundred years ago more than five hundred
years<00:00:20.910> ago<00:00:21.029> they<00:00:21.840> found<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.859> tree<00:00:23.250> which

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
years ago they found this tree which

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.710 
years ago they found this tree which
they<00:00:23.910> called<00:00:24.180> Brazil<00:00:24.480> woods<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:27.390> reason

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
they called Brazil woods and the reason

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.230 
they called Brazil woods and the reason
they<00:00:27.840> were<00:00:27.900> interested<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.949> tree<00:00:29.250> was

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
they were interested in this tree was

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.430 
they were interested in this tree was
because<00:00:31.050> inside<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:32.009> contains<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.700> red<00:00:32.910> dye<00:00:33.440> now

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
because inside it contains a red dye now

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
because inside it contains a red dye now
the<00:00:35.040> tree<00:00:35.280> had<00:00:35.489> been<00:00:35.640> known<00:00:35.850> already<00:00:36.300> all

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
the tree had been known already all

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
the tree had been known already all
relatives<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:39.000> could<00:00:39.239> find<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.840> Asia<00:00:40.020> but

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
relatives you could find it in Asia but

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.880 
relatives you could find it in Asia but
it<00:00:40.950> was<00:00:41.070> very<00:00:41.250> expensive<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.390> here<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.530> Brazil

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
it was very expensive and here in Brazil

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.250 
it was very expensive and here in Brazil
there<00:00:44.460> were<00:00:44.579> huge<00:00:45.000> numbers<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.719> these<00:00:45.870> trees

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
there were huge numbers of these trees

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.060 
there were huge numbers of these trees
and<00:00:46.739> they<00:00:47.550> started<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.149> whole<00:00:48.329> industry

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
and they started a whole industry

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.369 
and they started a whole industry
shipping<00:00:50.070> these<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.760> wood<00:00:51.020> across<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.230> Europe

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
shipping these the wood across to Europe

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.400 
shipping these the wood across to Europe
and<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.059> valuable<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:55.289> were

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and it was so valuable that there were

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.470 
and it was so valuable that there were
pirates<00:00:55.680> who<00:00:56.190> tried<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> capture<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.149> ships

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
pirates who tried to capture the ships

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.209 
pirates who tried to capture the ships
and<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.340> but<00:00:59.340> by<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.550> 18th<00:01:00.059> century<00:01:01.219> they'd

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
and so on but by the 18th century they'd

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.009 
and so on but by the 18th century they'd
cut<00:01:02.489> down<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.940> many<00:01:03.090> trees<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.899> was

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
cut down so many trees that it was

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.320 
cut down so many trees that it was
becoming<00:01:04.199> rare<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.610> industry<00:01:06.150> was

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
becoming rare and the industry was

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.649 
becoming rare and the industry was
collapsing<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.930> dye<00:01:10.170> inside<00:01:10.700> is<00:01:11.700> now

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
collapsing and the dye inside is now

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.429 
collapsing and the dye inside is now
called<00:01:12.990> Brazil<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:15.390> can't<00:01:15.689> see<00:01:15.990> anything

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
called Brazil in you can't see anything

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.130 
called Brazil in you can't see anything
inside<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.040> tree<00:01:17.479> there's<00:01:18.479> some<00:01:18.630> nice<00:01:18.810> other

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
inside this tree there's some nice other

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.980 
inside this tree there's some nice other
plants<00:01:19.650> growing<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.400> looks<00:01:21.360> really<00:01:21.720> quite

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
plants growing on it looks really quite

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.950 
plants growing on it looks really quite
decorative<00:01:22.729> but<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:23.939> go<00:01:24.090> over<00:01:24.119> here

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
decorative but if we go over here

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.499 
decorative but if we go over here
I<00:01:24.990> found<00:01:25.770> another<00:01:25.950> tree<00:01:26.490> where<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.330> see

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
I found another tree where you can see

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.899 
I found another tree where you can see
inside<00:01:27.900> I'm<00:01:28.259> not<00:01:28.590> sure<00:01:28.829> whether<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.850> is

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
inside I'm not sure whether this is

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.780 
inside I'm not sure whether this is
natural<00:01:30.659> or<00:01:30.930> whether<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.280> grew<00:01:32.520> like

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
natural or whether it just grew like

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.260 
natural or whether it just grew like
this<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.670> red<00:01:35.850> colour

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this but you can see here the red colour

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.890 
this but you can see here the red colour
to<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:37.799> they<00:01:38.610> used<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.119> grind<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
to get it out they used to grind the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.410 
to get it out they used to grind the
tree<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.500> essentially<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.340> make<00:01:41.369> sawdust<00:01:42.090> and

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
tree up essentially to make sawdust and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.219 
tree up essentially to make sawdust and
then<00:01:43.200> after<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.369> was<00:01:44.399> extracted<00:01:45.270> often

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
then after that it was extracted often

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.249 
then after that it was extracted often

metal the dye is not a terribly
complicated<00:01:55.460> molecule<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.729> has<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:57.000> couple<00:01:57.420> of

name<00:02:05.299> natural<00:02:06.299> red<00:02:06.600> 24<00:02:07.729> but<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.679> sort<00:02:10.920> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
name natural red 24 but it's the sort of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.580 
name natural red 24 but it's the sort of
dye<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.849> known<00:02:12.180> as<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> lake<00:02:12.720> dye

dye that is known as a lake dye

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.339 
dye that is known as a lake dye
what<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.459> means<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.090> when<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.110> died

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
what that means is that when you died

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.920 
what that means is that when you died
cloth<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:17.280> doesn't<00:02:17.760> react<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> fiber

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
cloth it doesn't react with the fiber

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.260 
cloth it doesn't react with the fiber
but<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.069> have<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.459> use<00:02:20.610> some<00:02:20.940> sort<00:02:21.150> of

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
but you have to use some sort of

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.750 
but you have to use some sort of
inorganic<00:02:21.900> material<00:02:22.590> which<00:02:22.890> precipitates

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
inorganic material which precipitates

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.160 
inorganic material which precipitates
and<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.720> dye<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.260> absorbed<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.099> surface

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
and the dye is absorbed on the surface

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.600 
and the dye is absorbed on the surface
these<00:02:28.170> are<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.470> sort<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.800> dyes<00:02:29.040> which<00:02:29.370> when

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
these are the sort of dyes which when

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.490 
these are the sort of dyes which when
you<00:02:29.730> wash<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.180> clothes<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.720> color<00:02:30.989> sometimes

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
you wash the clothes the color sometimes

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.240 
you wash the clothes the color sometimes
comes<00:02:32.040> out<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:33.560> depending<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:35.010> chemical

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
comes out and depending on the chemical

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.960 
comes out and depending on the chemical
you<00:02:35.730> use<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.239> precipitate<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.670> color

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
you use to precipitate it so the color

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.540 
you use to precipitate it so the color
changes<00:02:39.720> slightly<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.590> can<00:02:40.769> be<00:02:40.890> red<00:02:41.160> or<00:02:41.519> a

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
changes slightly so it can be red or a

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.410 
changes slightly so it can be red or a
bit<00:02:41.880> purple<00:02:42.500> but<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.709> think<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.790> originally

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
bit purple but I think that originally

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.020 
bit purple but I think that originally
one<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.840> major<00:02:46.080> uses<00:02:46.620> was<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.100> die<00:02:47.310> velvet

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
one of the major uses was to die velvet

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.030 
one of the major uses was to die velvet
and<00:02:49.010> because<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.580> was<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.819> luxury<00:02:51.290> buy<00:02:52.290> cloth

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
and because it was a luxury buy cloth

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.820 
and because it was a luxury buy cloth
and<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.150> have<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.450> luxury<00:02:54.959> dye<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.230> go<00:02:55.620> with

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
and so you have a luxury dye to go with

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.509 
and so you have a luxury dye to go with
it<00:02:55.980> nice<00:02:56.640> red<00:02:57.150> velvet<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:58.140> can<00:02:58.349> imagine<00:02:58.590> me<00:02:58.950> in

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
it nice red velvet you can imagine me in

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.420 
it nice red velvet you can imagine me in
the<00:02:59.670> red<00:02:59.849> velvet<00:03:00.090> jacket<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:01.950> think<00:03:02.099> this

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
the red velvet jacket so I think this

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.120 
the red velvet jacket so I think this
tree<00:03:02.730> has<00:03:03.150> two<00:03:03.780> very<00:03:04.170> important<00:03:04.709> points<00:03:04.860> for

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
tree has two very important points for

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.300 
tree has two very important points for
us<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.610> 21st<00:03:06.180> century<00:03:06.799> it<00:03:07.799> makes<00:03:08.099> a

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
us in the 21st century it makes a

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.900 
us in the 21st century it makes a
valuable<00:03:08.640> product<00:03:09.209> this<00:03:09.599> dye<00:03:10.190> but<00:03:11.190> there

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
valuable product this dye but there

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.949 
valuable product this dye but there
isn't<00:03:12.120> enough<00:03:12.420> trees<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:14.239> make<00:03:15.239> dye<00:03:15.900> to

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
isn't enough trees to make dye to

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.340 
isn't enough trees to make dye to
satisfy<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.890> demand<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.420> one<00:03:18.690> needs<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.170> make

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
satisfy the demand so one needs to make

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.039 
satisfy the demand so one needs to make
this<00:03:19.530> dye<00:03:19.880> chemically<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:21.420> can<00:03:21.720> get<00:03:21.900> the

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
this dye chemically so you can get the

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.500 
this dye chemically so you can get the
same<00:03:22.260> material<00:03:22.890> but<00:03:23.370> without<00:03:23.670> cutting<00:03:24.180> down

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
same material but without cutting down

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.670 
same material but without cutting down
the<00:03:24.660> trees<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:26.549> trees<00:03:26.850> are<00:03:27.090> now<00:03:27.239> quite<00:03:27.680> well

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
the trees the trees are now quite well

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.460 
the trees the trees are now quite well
preserved<00:03:29.359> you<00:03:30.359> have<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.840> get<00:03:30.989> special

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
preserved you have to get special

permission to cut one down and here it

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.990 
permission to cut one down and here it
is<00:03:33.989> like<00:03:34.260> in<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.560> museum<00:03:34.950> in<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.430> Botanic

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
is like in a museum in the Botanic

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.259 
is like in a museum in the Botanic
Gardens<00:03:36.920> but<00:03:37.920> there's<00:03:38.130> another<00:03:38.430> problem<00:03:38.730> that

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
Gardens but there's another problem that

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.180 
Gardens but there's another problem that
the<00:03:40.260> wood<00:03:40.530> from<00:03:40.829> this<00:03:41.010> tree<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:42.269> very<00:03:43.170> good<00:03:43.530> for

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
the wood from this tree is very good for

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.520 
the wood from this tree is very good for
making<00:03:44.639> the<00:03:44.790> boughs<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.060> violins<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.470> you

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
making the boughs of violins so you

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.129 
making the boughs of violins so you
imagine<00:03:47.100> me<00:03:47.310> playing<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.880> violin<00:03:48.329> with<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> bowl

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
imagine me playing a violin with a bowl

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.509 
imagine me playing a violin with a bowl
made<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.100> wood<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:51.859> the<00:03:52.859> properties<00:03:53.489> of

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
made of this wood and the properties of

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.840 
made of this wood and the properties of
woods<00:03:54.709> differ<00:03:55.709> from<00:03:56.040> one<00:03:56.280> tree<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:56.579> another

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
woods differ from one tree to another

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.900 
woods differ from one tree to another
and<00:03:57.420> we<00:03:57.810> still<00:03:58.139> don't<00:03:58.560> really<00:03:58.709> understand<00:03:59.639> how

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
and we still don't really understand how

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.449 
and we still don't really understand how
to<00:04:00.359> make<00:04:00.630> materials<00:04:01.049> that<00:04:01.859> have<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.280> same

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
to make materials that have the same

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.110 
to make materials that have the same
properties<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.299> some<00:04:03.510> woods<00:04:04.069> so<00:04:05.069> what<00:04:05.880> this

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
properties of some woods so what this

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.720 
properties of some woods so what this
tree<00:04:06.359> reminds<00:04:06.840> us<00:04:07.139> is<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:08.190> there's<00:04:08.400> still<00:04:08.670> a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
tree reminds us is that there's still a

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.539 
tree reminds us is that there's still a
lot<00:04:09.030> for<00:04:09.329> chemists<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.959> learn<00:04:10.170> how<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.069> make

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
lot for chemists to learn how to make

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.009 
lot for chemists to learn how to make
materials<00:04:12.389> with<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:13.290> properties<00:04:13.799> we<00:04:14.010> want

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
materials with the properties we want

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.680 
materials with the properties we want
but<00:04:16.019> it's<00:04:16.200> still<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.440> very<00:04:16.560> nice<00:04:16.950> tree<00:04:17.280> as<00:04:17.430> well

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
but it's still a very nice tree as well

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.649 
but it's still a very nice tree as well
this<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:18.750> just<00:04:18.930> one<00:04:19.380> tree<00:04:19.799> in<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.579> huge<00:04:20.970> country

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
this is just one tree in a huge country

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.370 
this is just one tree in a huge country
and<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:23.610> rain<00:04:23.880> forest<00:04:24.450> still<00:04:24.840> has<00:04:25.110> many

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
and the rain forest still has many

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.410 
and the rain forest still has many

chemicals that come out of these trees
and<00:04:33.330> it's<00:04:33.900> very<00:04:34.170> important<00:04:34.770> before<00:04:35.220> all<00:04:35.880> the

and it's very important before all the
trees<00:04:36.810> are<00:04:37.050> cut<00:04:37.230> down<00:04:37.400> that<00:04:38.400> we<00:04:38.550> find<00:04:38.850> out<00:04:39.030> what

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
trees are cut down that we find out what

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.000 
trees are cut down that we find out what
the<00:04:39.360> chemicals<00:04:39.900> are<00:04:40.080> because<00:04:40.500> they<00:04:40.650> could<00:04:40.860> be

that come from this huge richness of

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.820 
that come from this huge richness of
plants<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.140> grow<00:05:04.350> in<00:05:04.470> this<00:05:04.590> country

I<00:05:07.060> was<00:05:08.060> taking<00:05:08.479> a<00:05:08.569> picture<00:05:08.810> because<00:05:09.349> my<00:05:09.560> wife

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
I was taking a picture because my wife

I was taking a picture because my wife
is<00:05:09.830> very<00:05:10.370> interested<00:05:10.849> in<00:05:10.970> plants<00:05:11.509> and

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
is very interested in plants and

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.379 
is very interested in plants and
unfortunately<00:05:12.830> she<00:05:13.039> couldn't<00:05:13.190> come<00:05:13.550> here<00:05:13.909> so
