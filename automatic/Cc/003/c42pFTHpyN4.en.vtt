four years federal regulators have been
scrambling<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.210> find<00:00:15.389> out<00:00:15.660> why<00:00:15.960> honeybees<00:00:16.680> are

scrambling to find out why honeybees are

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.700 
scrambling to find out why honeybees are
disappearing<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:18.180> huge<00:00:18.600> numbers<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.410> figures

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
disappearing in huge numbers the figures

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.200 
disappearing in huge numbers the figures
have<00:00:19.890> been<00:00:19.980> estimated<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.550> thirty<00:00:21.000> percent

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
have been estimated that thirty percent

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.439 
have been estimated that thirty percent
per<00:00:21.900> year<00:00:22.230> but<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.070> year<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.430> particular<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
per year but this year in particular the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.019 
per year but this year in particular the
losses<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:24.930> been<00:00:24.990> drastic<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.400> what<00:00:26.640> would

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
losses have been drastic so what would

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.660 
losses have been drastic so what would
happen<00:00:27.570> if<00:00:27.960> those<00:00:28.140> bees<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.410> pollinate

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
happen if those bees that pollinate

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.999 
happen if those bees that pollinate
one-third<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> human<00:00:30.179> diet<00:00:30.390> die<00:00:31.230> off<00:00:31.410> well

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
one-third of the human diet die off well

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.740 
one-third of the human diet die off well
earlier<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.369> cut<00:00:32.640> up<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> co-owner<00:00:33.480> of

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
earlier I cut up with the co-owner of

the chef's garden farmer Lee Jones to
discuss<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> rising<00:00:37.410> problem<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:39.230> first<00:00:40.230> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
discuss the rising problem I first I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.540 
discuss the rising problem I first I
think<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.950> need<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.219> gain<00:00:41.370> an

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
think the we need to gain an

think the we need to gain an
understanding<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.510> tell<00:00:42.690> us

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
understanding here can you tell us

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.500 
understanding here can you tell us
exactly<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:43.559> important<00:00:44.250> honey<00:00:44.579> bees<00:00:44.850> are<00:00:45.120> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
exactly how important honey bees are to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.279 
exactly how important honey bees are to
to<00:00:46.079> our<00:00:46.200> food<00:00:46.440> supply<00:00:48.170> well<00:00:49.170> they're

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
to our food supply well they're

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.760 
to our food supply well they're
extremely<00:00:49.770> important<00:00:51.020> actually<00:00:52.020> over<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
extremely important actually over a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.950 
extremely important actually over a
third<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.340> everything<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.120> consume<00:00:54.600> in

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
third of everything that we consume in

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.290 
third of everything that we consume in
the<00:00:55.260> way<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.530> fruits<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.860> vegetables<00:00:56.300> needs

the way of fruits and vegetables needs

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.160 
the way of fruits and vegetables needs
pollination<00:00:57.840> from<00:00:58.260> beasts<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.840> to<00:01:00.840> put<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> in

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
pollination from beasts and to put it in

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.930 
pollination from beasts and to put it in
perspective<00:01:01.320> was<00:01:02.309> said<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.550> Albert

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
perspective was said that Albert

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.420 
perspective was said that Albert
Einstein<00:01:03.420> vedic<00:01:03.870> quote<00:01:04.080> once<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.769> four

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
Einstein vedic quote once that four

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.340 
Einstein vedic quote once that four
years<00:01:05.729> after<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.180> bee<00:01:06.299> population<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:07.140> wiped

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
years after the bee population is wiped

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.190 
years after the bee population is wiped
out<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.860> will<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> human<00:01:08.400> rates<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.140> here<00:01:10.140> at

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
out so will the human rates and here at

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.410 
out so will the human rates and here at
the<00:01:10.320> farm<00:01:10.500> level<00:01:10.650> we're<00:01:11.159> seeing<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.240> bee

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the farm level we're seeing the bee

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.820 
the farm level we're seeing the bee
population<00:01:12.770> diminish<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.920> an<00:01:14.040> alarming<00:01:14.549> rate

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
population diminish at an alarming rate

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.700 
population diminish at an alarming rate
so<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.930> being<00:01:19.170> called<00:01:19.439> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
so then if this I it is being called a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.730 
so then if this I it is being called a
crisis<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.909> how<00:01:21.570> widespread<00:01:21.900> how

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
crisis if this how widespread how

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.990 
crisis if this how widespread how
widespread<00:01:22.979> were<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> effects<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.880> this

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
widespread were the effects of this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.749 
widespread were the effects of this
crisis<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:24.930> something<00:01:25.320> isn't<00:01:25.439> done<00:01:25.759> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
crisis be if something isn't done to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.080 
crisis be if something isn't done to
stop<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> diminishing<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.930> bees<00:01:29.090> well

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
stop the diminishing of the bees well

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.929 
stop the diminishing of the bees well
it's<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.390> global<00:01:30.720> crisis<00:01:31.610> we<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.790> been

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it's a global crisis we have been

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.969 
it's a global crisis we have been
noticing<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.630> really<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> last<00:01:34.560> ten

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
noticing it really for the last ten

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.700 
noticing it really for the last ten
years<00:01:35.210> now<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.509> would<00:01:36.840> certainly<00:01:37.049> want<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> tell

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
years now I would certainly want to tell

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.580 
years now I would certainly want to tell
you<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.890> look<00:01:38.880> we're<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.150> be<00:01:39.570> experts<00:01:40.110> but

you that look we're not be experts but
we're<00:01:40.829> we're<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.670> agriculture<00:01:42.420> or<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> small

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
we're we're in agriculture or a small

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.609 
we're we're in agriculture or a small
family<00:01:43.290> farm<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:45.600> support<00:01:46.020> sustainable

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
family farm we we support sustainable

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.100 
family farm we we support sustainable
initiatives<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.430> we've<00:01:48.090> recognized<00:01:48.750> that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
initiatives and we've recognized that

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.380 
initiatives and we've recognized that
this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.369> only<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> problem<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.360> us

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
this is really not only a problem for us

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.200 
this is really not only a problem for us
but<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.670> entire<00:01:54.170> society<00:01:56.210> we've

Wayne the buckwheat comes in as the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.890 
Wayne the buckwheat comes in as the

we're<00:05:35.590> seeing<00:05:35.919> some<00:05:36.160> positive<00:05:36.970> sign<00:05:37.830> we<00:05:38.830> have
