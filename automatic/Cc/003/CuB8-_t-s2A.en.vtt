you with w notes with down stems and up

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.100 
you with w notes with down stems and up
stems<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:10.850> for<00:02:11.090> instance<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.540> first<00:02:11.720> note<00:02:11.990> you

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
stems so for instance the first note you

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.140 
stems so for instance the first note you
play<00:02:12.230> is<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.650> third<00:02:12.890> string<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.940> six

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
play is the third string and the six

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.540 
play is the third string and the six
string<00:02:14.300> together<00:02:15.010> right<00:02:16.010> that's<00:02:16.130> go<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
string together right that's go on the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.400 
string together right that's go on the
beat<00:02:16.730> next<00:02:17.600> you<00:02:17.660> can<00:02:17.750> use<00:02:17.780> U<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.140> fourth

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
beat next you can use U to the fourth

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.130 
beat next you can use U to the fourth
string<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:20.270> third<00:02:20.540> string<00:02:20.750> plays<00:02:20.930> off

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
string and that third string plays off

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.870 
string and that third string plays off
the<00:02:21.380> beat<00:02:24.160> right<00:02:25.160> that's<00:02:25.459> how<00:02:25.610> we<00:02:25.670> get
