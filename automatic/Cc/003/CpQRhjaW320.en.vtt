was<00:00:50.489> absolutely<00:00:51.030> epic<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.629> looking<00:00:52.079> back<00:00:52.260> I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.590 
was absolutely epic and looking back I
could<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.370> probably<00:00:53.579> gone<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> double

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
could have probably gone for a double

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.279 
could have probably gone for a double
more<00:00:54.719> up<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.410> tea<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.280> 66<00:00:56.670> TDM<00:00:57.300> cuz<00:00:57.870> my<00:00:58.020> team

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
more up in a tea in a 66 TDM cuz my team

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.380 
more up in a tea in a 66 TDM cuz my team
just<00:00:58.890> basically<00:00:59.370> did<00:00:59.579> nothing<00:00:59.609> I<00:01:00.030> carried

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
just basically did nothing I carried

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.270 
just basically did nothing I carried
them<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:00.629> away<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.859> end<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:02.010> getting

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
them all away and think I end up getting

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.149 
them all away and think I end up getting
fifty<00:01:02.640> four<00:01:02.820> kills<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.140> 75<00:01:04.739> which<00:01:05.010> is

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
fifty four kills out of the 75 which is

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.120 
fifty four kills out of the 75 which is
mental<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.270> final<00:01:06.630> scores<00:01:06.840> 54<00:01:07.530> 46<00:01:07.740> or

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
mental I think the final scores 54 46 or

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.830 
mental I think the final scores 54 46 or
something<00:01:08.400> but<00:01:09.030> yeah<00:01:09.180> when<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.360> get<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> mo<00:01:09.689> up

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
something but yeah when I get the mo up

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.929 
something but yeah when I get the mo up
and<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.680> could<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.159> probably<00:01:11.280> had<00:01:11.520> time<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and I could have probably had time for a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.850 
and I could have probably had time for a
second<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.960> off<00:01:13.140> with<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> p90

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and but obviously it's a quite long run

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.779 
and but obviously it's a quite long run
as<00:02:06.390> well<00:02:06.509> because<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.860> ground<00:02:08.610> war

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
as well because it is ground war

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.059 
as well because it is ground war
domination<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.140> an<00:02:10.349> assault<00:02:10.560> mob<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.039> i

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
domination and it is an assault mob so i

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.949 
domination and it is an assault mob so i
calling<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.090> many<00:02:12.270> attack<00:02:12.510> early<00:02:12.690> adopters

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
calling so many attack early adopters

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.430 
calling so many attack early adopters
and<00:02:13.020> stuff

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and stuff

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440 
and stuff
and<00:02:14.070> I'm<00:02:14.430> really<00:02:14.580> getting<00:02:14.850> close<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
and I'm really getting close to the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.300 
and I'm really getting close to the
precision<00:02:15.900> precision<00:02:16.500> airstrike<00:02:17.010> as<00:02:17.160> well

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
precision precision airstrike as well

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.970 
precision precision airstrike as well
I'm<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.330> 900s<00:02:18.870> now<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.230> ground<00:02:19.800> was

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
I'm in the 900s now and ground was

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.260 
I'm in the 900s now and ground was
definitely<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.430> way<00:02:20.550> forward<00:02:20.580> for<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.060> guy

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
definitely the way forward for that guy

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.000 
definitely the way forward for that guy
so<00:02:21.510> if<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:21.660> need<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> go<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:22.860> title

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
so if you need to go for that title

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.710 
so if you need to go for that title
stick<00:02:23.490> ground<00:02:23.730> war<00:02:23.910> on<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.240> you'll<00:02:24.600> be

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
stick ground war on and you'll be

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.570 
stick ground war on and you'll be
laughing<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.350> really<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.070> best<00:02:26.100> way<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.400> do

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.560 
doing now was going for the streak I
mean<00:02:37.560> look<00:02:37.590> at<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.830> score<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.480> could<00:02:39.480> have

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
be something in the thirties easily in

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.180 
be something in the thirties easily in
the<00:02:48.480> thirties<00:02:48.900> maybe<00:02:49.170> about<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.560> 35<00:02:50.160> or

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.430 
the thirties maybe about a 35 or
something<00:02:50.760> like<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:51.570> yeah<00:02:51.750> there<00:02:52.320> was

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
something like that but yeah there was

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.770 
something like that but yeah there was
still<00:02:52.620> at<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:53.010> point<00:02:53.280> 35<00:02:53.820> more<00:02:54.210> kills<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.630> go

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
still at this point 35 more kills to go

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.470 
still at this point 35 more kills to go
and<00:02:55.070> I<00:02:56.070> should<00:02:56.610> have<00:02:56.730> gone<00:02:56.850> for<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.030> out<00:02:57.360> have

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
and I should have gone for it out have

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.550 
and I should have gone for it out have
been<00:02:57.600> pretty<00:02:57.750> impressive<00:02:58.200> i<00:02:58.260> don't<00:02:58.410> know<00:02:58.470> if

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
been pretty impressive i don't know if

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.380 
been pretty impressive i don't know if
there's<00:02:58.680> been<00:02:58.800> any<00:02:58.860> probably<00:02:59.760> not<00:02:59.850> to<00:03:00.120> be<00:03:00.240> fair

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
there's been any probably not to be fair

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.270 
there's been any probably not to be fair
in<00:03:00.660> 6v6<00:03:01.080> team<00:03:01.440> deathmatch<00:03:01.740> i<00:03:01.860> don't<00:03:02.070> think

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
in 6v6 team deathmatch i don't think

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.270 
in 6v6 team deathmatch i don't think
it'll<00:03:02.460> been<00:03:02.640> any<00:03:02.880> double<00:03:03.690> Moab<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.040> game
