easily placed on a spawn beacon and a
motion<00:03:22.840> sensor<00:03:22.959> now<00:03:23.230> what<00:03:23.380> if<00:03:23.470> things<00:03:23.650> made<00:03:23.830> I

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
motion sensor now what if things made I

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.080 
motion sensor now what if things made I
would<00:03:24.370> have<00:03:24.459> made<00:03:24.550> things<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:24.910> much<00:03:24.970> easier

because skype is just so crystal clear
it's<00:04:44.340> it's<00:04:44.850> like<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.060> telephone<00:04:45.540> call<00:04:45.750> it<00:04:45.990> may

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
it's it's like a telephone call it may

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.500 
it's it's like a telephone call it may
be<00:04:46.140> even<00:04:46.440> better<00:04:46.530> because<00:04:46.770> of<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.040> headsets

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510

because his video he had to pause on

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.820 
because his video he had to pause on
several<00:05:38.850> occasions<00:05:39.300> just<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.200> just<00:05:40.560> to<00:05:40.620> keep

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
several occasions just to just to keep

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.860 
several occasions just to just to keep
his<00:05:40.980> composure<00:05:41.340> because<00:05:41.670> he<00:05:42.060> was<00:05:42.300> abused<00:05:42.690> the

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
his composure because he was abused the

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.960 
his composure because he was abused the
kid<00:05:43.080> he<00:05:43.650> was<00:05:43.740> legitimately<00:05:44.340> abused<00:05:44.730> as<00:05:44.850> a<00:05:44.880> kid

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
kid he was legitimately abused as a kid

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.560 
kid he was legitimately abused as a kid
and<00:05:45.300> so<00:05:46.460> it<00:05:47.460> must<00:05:47.910> have<00:05:48.030> been<00:05:48.120> very<00:05:48.180> hard

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
and so it must have been very hard

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.940 
and so it must have been very hard
hearing<00:05:48.840> about<00:05:49.110> that<00:05:49.290> he<00:05:49.440> said<00:05:49.470> that<00:05:49.740> he

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
hearing about that he said that he

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.620 
hearing about that he said that he
didn't<00:05:50.100> even<00:05:50.190> watch<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.640> video<00:05:50.910> because<00:05:51.330> he

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
didn't even watch the video because he

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.940 
didn't even watch the video because he
just<00:05:51.810> didn't<00:05:52.080> he<00:05:52.290> didn't<00:05:52.440> want<00:05:52.590> the<00:05:52.650> memories
