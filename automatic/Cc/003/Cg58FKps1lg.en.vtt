00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
another alien TV broadcast tonight we

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.639 
another alien TV broadcast tonight we
cover<00:00:27.430> the<00:00:27.640> moon<00:00:27.820> wave<00:00:28.149> and<00:00:28.480> go<00:00:28.989> moon<00:00:29.230> crazy

cover the moon wave and go moon crazy

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.710 
cover the moon wave and go moon crazy
and<00:00:30.039> explain<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:30.640> reason<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.119> moon<00:00:31.329> gave<00:00:31.689> a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
and explain the reason the moon gave a

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.170 
and explain the reason the moon gave a
little<00:00:32.110> ripple<00:00:32.349> also<00:00:33.129> we<00:00:33.309> cover<00:00:33.579> the<00:00:33.790> stupid

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
little ripple also we cover the stupid

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.420 
little ripple also we cover the stupid
idea<00:00:34.540> that<00:00:34.750> seems<00:00:35.050> to<00:00:35.260> be<00:00:35.379> flavor<00:00:35.680> of<00:00:35.980> the<00:00:36.100> year
