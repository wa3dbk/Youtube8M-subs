00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.470 
mouse thanks it's great to be here yeah
so<00:04:29.310> do<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.610> know<00:04:29.670> anything<00:04:29.700> about<00:04:30.030> quantum

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
so do you know anything about quantum

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.600 
so do you know anything about quantum
entanglement<00:04:30.990> hell's<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.800> no<00:04:32.100> I've<00:04:32.430> got

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
an English degree we really should have

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.900 
an English degree we really should have
Cameron<00:04:34.560> on<00:04:34.680> this<00:04:34.860> one<00:04:35.040> he<00:04:35.310> knows<00:04:35.730> all<00:04:35.850> about

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
Cameron on this one he knows all about

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.700 
Cameron on this one he knows all about
the<00:04:36.210> Quantum's<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.750> believe<00:04:37.410> quantum

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
the Quantum's I believe quantum

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.170 
the Quantum's I believe quantum
entanglement<00:04:38.190> means<00:04:38.400> something<00:04:38.850> along<00:04:39.030> the

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
entanglement means something along the

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.390 
entanglement means something along the
lines<00:04:39.330> of<00:04:39.570> things<00:04:40.350> that<00:04:40.620> are<00:04:40.800> stuck<00:04:41.190> to<00:04:41.370> each

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
lines of things that are stuck to each

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.730 
lines of things that are stuck to each
other<00:04:41.790> because<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.780> science<00:04:43.230> that<00:04:43.380> makes

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
other because of science that makes

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.000 
other because of science that makes
sense<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:44.480> yeah<00:04:45.480> maybe<00:04:46.470> this<00:04:46.710> will<00:04:46.890> explain

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
sense so yeah maybe this will explain

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.680 
sense so yeah maybe this will explain
quantum<00:04:47.400> entanglement<00:04:48.710> oh<00:04:49.710> wow<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:51.060> torrent

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
and led by Quantum's there you go oh oh

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.370 
and led by Quantum's there you go oh oh
that's<00:04:56.640> actually<00:04:57.420> a<00:04:57.450> really<00:04:57.660> cool<00:04:57.930> idea

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
don't like playing co-op games that are

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.350 
don't like playing co-op games that are
you<00:05:16.890> I<00:05:17.040> did<00:05:17.370> you<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.520> same<00:05:17.790> room<00:05:17.970> or<00:05:18.120> someone

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
you I did you the same room or someone

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.030 
you I did you the same room or someone
oh<00:05:18.419> yeah<00:05:18.660> I<00:05:18.690> don't<00:05:19.200> like<00:05:19.440> doing<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.860> online

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
oh yeah I don't like doing it online

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.770 
oh yeah I don't like doing it online
that<00:05:20.460> much<00:05:20.640> like<00:05:20.880> when<00:05:21.030> I<00:05:21.060> play<00:05:21.300> left<00:05:21.510> 4<00:05:21.630> dead<00:05:21.660> i

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
that much like when I play left 4 dead i

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.440 
that much like when I play left 4 dead i
only<00:05:22.050> play<00:05:22.200> it<00:05:22.290> really<00:05:22.470> like<00:05:23.150> with<00:05:24.150> somebody

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
only play it really like with somebody

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.390 
only play it really like with somebody
else<00:05:24.690> in<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:24.930> room<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.320> two<00:05:25.590> AI<00:05:25.740> characters

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
else in the room and two AI characters

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.780 
else in the room and two AI characters
just<00:05:27.180> cuz<00:05:27.300> it<00:05:27.419> like<00:05:27.720> it's<00:05:28.650> more<00:05:28.860> fun<00:05:29.070> yeah<00:05:29.580> it's

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
just cuz it like it's more fun yeah it's

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.730 
just cuz it like it's more fun yeah it's
just<00:05:30.030> one<00:05:30.510> if<00:05:30.690> you<00:05:30.870> had<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.080> chance<00:05:31.350> you<00:05:31.620> would

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
just one if you had the chance you would

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.940 
just one if you had the chance you would
probably<00:05:32.130> play<00:05:32.280> um<00:05:33.350> co-op<00:05:34.350> games<00:05:34.560> with

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
probably play um co-op games with

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.130 
probably play um co-op games with
friends<00:05:35.100> yes<00:05:35.970> I<00:05:36.090> don't<00:05:36.270> have<00:05:36.390> friends<00:05:36.660> so<00:05:36.900> i

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
friends yes I don't have friends so i

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.520 
friends yes I don't have friends so i
play<00:05:37.950> with<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.100> Internet<00:05:38.520> boom<00:05:39.410> see<00:05:40.410> how

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
play with the Internet boom see how

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.469 
play with the Internet boom see how
entangled<00:05:41.040> it<00:05:41.130> is<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.669> is<00:05:41.850> entangled<00:05:42.210> and

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
entangled it is that is entangled and

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.300 
entangled it is that is entangled and
then<00:05:42.720> it<00:05:42.930> drops<00:05:43.200> and<00:05:43.410> it<00:05:43.500> hits<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.860> button<00:05:44.040> and

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
then it drops and it hits the button and

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.010 
then it drops and it hits the button and
then<00:05:44.400> opens<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:44.850> door<00:05:45.090> that's<00:05:45.840> pretty

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
then opens the door that's pretty

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.680 
then opens the door that's pretty
awesome<00:05:46.140> so<00:05:47.070> yeah<00:05:47.100> this<00:05:48.060> is<00:05:48.240> quantum

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
awesome so yeah this is quantum

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.110 
awesome so yeah this is quantum
entanglement<00:05:49.229> one<00:05:49.440> a<00:05:49.680> lot<00:05:50.669> of<00:05:50.700> these<00:05:50.880> what<00:05:51.090> I

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
entanglement one a lot of these what I

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.760 
entanglement one a lot of these what I
love<00:05:51.330> about<00:05:51.360> this<00:05:51.690> what<00:05:52.260> about<00:05:52.290> this<00:05:52.560> whole

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
love about this what about this whole

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.070 
love about this what about this whole
level<00:05:53.450> creation<00:05:54.450> thing<00:05:54.540> is<00:05:54.690> a<00:05:54.720> lot<00:05:54.840> of<00:05:54.900> stuff

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
level creation thing is a lot of stuff

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.040 
level creation thing is a lot of stuff
that's<00:05:55.140> going<00:05:55.380> on<00:05:55.440> at<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:55.590> moment<00:05:55.740> is<00:05:56.010> like

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
that's going on at the moment is like

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.890 
that's going on at the moment is like
concept<00:05:58.050> testing<00:05:58.560> mmm<00:05:59.190> so<00:05:59.520> please<00:06:00.330> Lauren
