I like a lot of help yes others want the
old<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:40.950> traditional<00:01:41.610> obvious<00:01:42.000> back<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:43.400> think

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
old or traditional obvious back I think

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.600 
old or traditional obvious back I think
they<00:01:44.549> should<00:01:44.820> make<00:01:45.060> these<00:01:45.960> new<00:01:46.590> ones<00:01:47.130> i<00:01:47.400> guess

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
they should make these new ones i guess

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.660 
they should make these new ones i guess
and<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.630> regular<00:01:48.990> ones<00:01:49.229> too<00:01:49.710> then<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.549> would

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
and the regular ones too then they would

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.260 
and the regular ones too then they would
make<00:01:50.820> super<00:01:51.210> good<00:01:51.390> money<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:52.790> i<00:01:53.790> think<00:01:54.149> they

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
make super good money but i think they

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.730 
make super good money but i think they
might<00:01:54.450> go<00:01:54.600> out<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.840> business<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.350> they<00:01:55.500> keep

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
might go out of business if they keep

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.770 
might go out of business if they keep
continuing<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.579> there's<00:01:57.030> only<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.630> many
