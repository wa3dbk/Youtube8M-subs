estimating the distance between the cat

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.800 
estimating the distance between the cat
and<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.680> gulper<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.250> be<00:01:22.990> two<00:01:23.990> feet<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:26.570> maybe

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
and the gulper to be two feet and maybe

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.740 
and the gulper to be two feet and maybe
a<00:01:26.900> little<00:01:27.110> bit<00:01:27.290> more<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:29.590> quite<00:01:30.590> frankly

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
a little bit more and quite frankly

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.580 
a little bit more and quite frankly
despite<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:33.850> cat-like<00:01:34.850> agility<00:01:34.909> of<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:35.810> cat

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
despite the cat-like agility of the cat

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.700 
despite the cat-like agility of the cat
like<00:01:36.800> cat<00:01:37.100> i<00:01:37.750> suspect<00:01:38.750> that<00:01:38.869> gopher<00:01:39.229> can<00:01:39.590> get

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
like cat i suspect that gopher can get

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.620 
like cat i suspect that gopher can get
down<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.039> hole<00:01:40.220> much<00:01:40.490> faster<00:01:41.000> than<00:01:41.119> indica

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
down the hole much faster than indica

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:49.719 
down the hole much faster than indica
the<00:01:41.990> cat<00:01:42.229> can<00:01:43.009> get<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.399> gopher<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:48.729> well

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
the cat can get to the gopher and well

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.249 
the cat can get to the gopher and well
it's<00:01:49.850> been<00:01:50.000> one<00:01:50.119> hundred<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:50.450> eleven<00:01:50.570> seconds

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
it's been one hundred and eleven seconds

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.940 
it's been one hundred and eleven seconds
since<00:01:51.440> i<00:01:51.560> started<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.039> tape<00:01:52.250> here<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:53.710> so<00:01:54.710> far

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
since i started the tape here and so far

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.590 
since i started the tape here and so far
no<00:01:55.220> movement<00:01:55.880> one<00:01:56.600> way<00:01:56.750> or<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.929> other<00:01:58.600> my

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
no movement one way or the other my

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.469 
no movement one way or the other my
opinion<00:02:00.200> at<00:02:00.320> this<00:02:00.470> point<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.300> my<00:02:02.300> nose

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
opinion at this point is that my nose

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.320 
opinion at this point is that my nose
itches<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:07.429> both<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.670> cat<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.300> the

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
itches and the both the cat and the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.220 
itches and the both the cat and the
gopher<00:02:08.690> are<00:02:08.840> aware<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.259> each<00:02:09.470> other
