over 30 plants that have been modeled in

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.430 
over 30 plants that have been modeled in
high<00:01:26.800> detail<00:01:27.220> high<00:01:27.520> fidelity<00:01:28.020> will<00:01:29.020> walk<00:01:29.230> up

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
high detail high fidelity will walk up

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.260 
high detail high fidelity will walk up
to<00:01:29.620> this<00:01:29.770> little<00:01:30.100> sprite<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.790> see<00:01:30.970> what<00:01:31.120> it

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
to this little sprite and see what it

00:01:31.270 --> 00:02:00.770 
to this little sprite and see what it
has<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.630> say

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.710 

so<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.560> concept<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.460> telling<00:02:03.240> us<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.540> lot

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
so this concept is telling us a lot

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.400 
so this concept is telling us a lot
about<00:02:04.490> identification<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.230> walk<00:02:07.380> over

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
about identification you can walk over

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.970 
about identification you can walk over
here<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.100> some<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.789> fact<00:02:09.060> cards

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.589 

find<00:02:13.610> out<00:02:13.819> what<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.180> is

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.790 

lots<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.409> red<00:02:22.620> Trillium

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:38.400 

there<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.430> is

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.620 

so<00:02:39.070> this<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.370> completely<00:02:39.760> open<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.510> the

it is in a way almost a game because

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.950 
it is in a way almost a game because
children<00:02:52.540> will<00:02:53.100> spontaneously<00:02:54.600> create<00:02:55.600> games

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
children will spontaneously create games

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.450 
children will spontaneously create games
and<00:02:57.750> turn<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.870> into<00:02:59.050> a<00:02:59.170> spontaneous<00:03:00.010> treasure
