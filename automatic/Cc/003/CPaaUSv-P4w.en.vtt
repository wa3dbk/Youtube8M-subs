opportunity to see what the size

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.730 
opportunity to see what the size
difference<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.869> between<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.380> two<00:00:25.590> devices

capsule case so let's just remove the
packaging<00:00:51.239> into<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:51.989> side<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.370> first

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
packaging into one side and the first

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.790 
packaging into one side and the first
thing<00:00:53.730> i<00:00:53.820> want<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:55.350> put<00:00:55.680> these

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
thing i want to do is just put these

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920 
thing i want to do is just put these
side<00:00:56.100> by<00:00:56.129> side<00:00:56.640> really<00:00:57.510> gives<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.780> good

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
side by side really gives you a good

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.260 
side by side really gives you a good
idea<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.680> size<00:00:59.160> difference<00:00:59.460> between<00:01:00.059> all

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
idea of the size difference between all

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.340 
idea of the size difference between all
three<00:01:00.629> devices<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> iphone<00:01:02.609> 5s<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
three devices so the iphone 5s on the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.340 
three devices so the iphone 5s on the
left<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.700> we've<00:01:05.909> got<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.479> iphone

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
left here and then we've got the iphone

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.190 
left here and then we've got the iphone
6<00:01:07.680> size<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.369> then<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.850> iphone<00:01:09.299> 6<00:01:09.659> plus<00:01:09.750> which

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
6 size and then the iphone 6 plus which

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.980 
6 size and then the iphone 6 plus which
has<00:01:10.650> really<00:01:11.189> surprised<00:01:11.610> me<00:01:11.790> how<00:01:12.060> large<00:01:12.510> this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
has really surprised me how large this

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.399 
has really surprised me how large this
is<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.740> really<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> large<00:01:14.760> case<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
is it really is a large case and

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.530 
is it really is a large case and
obviously<00:01:16.409> going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> large<00:01:17.040> device

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
obviously going to be a large device

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.850 
obviously going to be a large device
it'll<00:01:18.540> also<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.780> useful<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.650> this

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
it'll also be useful if I just do this

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.520 
it'll also be useful if I just do this
if<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.159> turn<00:01:20.430> these<00:01:20.640> over<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.500> fact

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
if I turn these over and we can in fact

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.460 
if I turn these over and we can in fact
fit<00:01:23.220> them<00:01:23.400> all<00:01:23.490> inside<00:01:23.759> each<00:01:24.299> other<00:01:24.570> look<00:01:25.350> at

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
fit them all inside each other look at

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.859 
fit them all inside each other look at
this<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.950> size<00:01:26.100> difference<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.420> we've<00:01:27.659> got

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
this for size difference so we've got

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.950 
this for size difference so we've got
the<00:01:28.110> iphone<00:01:28.920> 5s<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> middle<00:01:30.180> there<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the iphone 5s in the middle there and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.600 
the iphone 5s in the middle there and
then<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.320> see<00:01:31.530> quite<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.829> bit<00:01:31.920> bigger<00:01:32.310> for

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
then you can see quite a bit bigger for

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.149 
then you can see quite a bit bigger for
the<00:01:33.090> iphone<00:01:33.509> 6<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.140> then<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> iphone<00:01:34.710> 6<00:01:35.040> plus

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the iphone 6 and then the iphone 6 plus

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.660 
the iphone 6 and then the iphone 6 plus
towering<00:01:36.060> all<00:01:36.600> three<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:38.189> big<00:01:38.400> size

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
towering all three a really big size

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.060 
towering all three a really big size
difference<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:39.990> my<00:01:40.200> concerns<00:01:40.619> with

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
difference now one of my concerns with

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.910 
difference now one of my concerns with
the<00:01:41.280> iphone<00:01:41.729> 6<00:01:42.119> plus<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> be

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the iphone 6 plus is it going to be

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830 
the iphone 6 plus is it going to be
cumbersome<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.790> hold<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> fit<00:01:45.689> in

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
cumbersome to hold is it going to fit in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.399 
cumbersome to hold is it going to fit in
a<00:01:45.899> pocket<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.060> really<00:01:48.960> serve

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
a pocket and is it going to really serve

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.960 
a pocket and is it going to really serve
me<00:01:49.740> well<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.070> know<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.850> be

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
me well you know is it going to be

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.690 
me well you know is it going to be
comfortable<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> use<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.829> now<00:01:52.950> let's<00:01:53.189> see<00:01:53.430> how

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
comfortable to use so now let's see how

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.219 
comfortable to use so now let's see how
these<00:01:53.909> fee<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.420> ham<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.840> course<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
these fee in the ham and of course the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.639 
these fee in the ham and of course the
iphone<00:01:55.619> 5s<00:01:56.159> fits<00:01:56.820> really<00:01:57.119> nicely<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.380> quite

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
curved edges I think that's going to

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.099
