00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
get back down to the start where the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.910 
get back down to the start where the
finishes<00:01:00.550> at<00:01:00.700> and<00:01:01.030> you<00:01:01.900> have<00:01:01.990> to<00:01:02.110> slide<00:01:02.890> down

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
finishes at and you have to slide down

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.070 
finishes at and you have to slide down
that<00:01:03.070> wall<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.730> make<00:01:04.330> sure<00:01:04.480> to<00:01:04.630> not<00:01:04.780> run<00:01:04.930> into

that wall and make sure to not run into

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:13.050 
that wall and make sure to not run into
that<00:01:05.230> robot<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:12.430> level<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.760> pretty<00:01:12.940> tricky

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
that robot this level is pretty tricky

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.810 
that robot this level is pretty tricky
because<00:01:13.660> this<00:01:13.990> part<00:01:14.200> right<00:01:14.230> here<00:01:14.520> want<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.610> get

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
because this part right here want to get

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.580 
because this part right here want to get
on<00:01:15.880> top<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.120> these<00:01:16.300> things<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.900> then<00:01:17.320> jump

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
on top of these things and then jump

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.030 
on top of these things and then jump
over<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:17.920> top<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.280> those<00:01:18.430> other<00:01:18.610> ones<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:20.680> you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
over the top of those other ones if you

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.130 
over the top of those other ones if you
can<00:01:21.190> master<00:01:21.520> that<00:01:21.850> um<00:01:22.030> start<00:01:22.630> at<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.780> level

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
can master that um start at the level

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.170 
can master that um start at the level
and<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.830> rest<00:01:24.040> of<00:01:24.190> it<00:01:24.280> is<00:01:24.369> a<00:01:24.400> lot<00:01:24.640> easier<00:01:27.180> still

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
and the rest of it is a lot easier still

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:38.640 
and the rest of it is a lot easier still
not<00:01:28.330> easy<00:01:28.540> but<00:01:29.080> it's<00:01:29.260> easier<00:01:29.619> oh<00:01:37.500> by<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.530> way

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
not easy but it's easier oh by the way

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.609 
not easy but it's easier oh by the way
this<00:01:38.950> music<00:01:39.869> when<00:01:40.869> I<00:01:40.930> was<00:01:41.050> recording<00:01:41.320> these

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
this music when I was recording these

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.210 
this music when I was recording these
levels<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.810> sound<00:01:44.080> still<00:01:44.320> wasn't<00:01:44.590> working<00:01:45.100> on

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
levels the sound still wasn't working on

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.430 
levels the sound still wasn't working on
my<00:01:45.400> recording<00:01:45.850> because<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:47.050> didn't<00:01:47.259> have<00:01:47.350> the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
my recording because I didn't have the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.790 
my recording because I didn't have the
same<00:01:47.650> set<00:01:47.950> correctly<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.230> went<00:01:50.590> back<00:01:50.770> and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
same set correctly but I went back and

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.520 
same set correctly but I went back and
recorded<00:01:51.430> some<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:52.060> music<00:01:52.420> so<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.440> can

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
recorded some the music so you can

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.050 
recorded some the music so you can
actually<00:01:53.620> hear<00:01:54.190> what<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.430> music<00:01:54.700> sounds<00:01:54.970> like

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
actually hear what the music sounds like

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.830 
actually hear what the music sounds like
in<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.240> game<00:01:59.159> so<00:02:00.159> this<00:02:00.310> is<00:02:00.340> just<00:02:00.670> like<00:02:00.790> a<00:02:00.909> 30

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
in the game so this is just like a 30

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.600 
in the game so this is just like a 30
second<00:02:02.229> clip<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.590> music<00:02:02.890> which<00:02:03.729> is<00:02:04.030> on<00:02:04.210> repeat

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
second clip the music which is on repeat

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.770 
second clip the music which is on repeat
when<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.729> actual<00:02:06.970> game<00:02:07.000> is<00:02:07.240> one<00:02:07.360> like<00:02:07.479> 10

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
when the actual game is one like 10

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.000 
when the actual game is one like 10
second<00:02:08.050> little<00:02:08.260> clip<00:02:08.410> anyway<00:02:08.769> so<00:02:08.830> this

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
second little clip anyway so this

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:25.110 
second little clip anyway so this
repeats<00:02:09.519> over<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:09.790> over<00:02:09.910> again

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.119 

this<00:02:25.989> can<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.290> hard<00:02:26.590> because<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:27.010> these

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
this can be hard because of these

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.789 
this can be hard because of these
rockets<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.909> are<00:02:28.200> coming<00:02:29.200> right<00:02:29.260> next<00:02:29.709> to

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
rockets that are coming right next to

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.170 
rockets that are coming right next to
you<00:02:29.890> right<00:02:29.920> when<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.280> get<00:02:30.519> up<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:30.940> top<00:02:30.970> and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
you right when you get up to the top and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.119 
you right when you get up to the top and
stuff<00:02:31.599> they<00:02:31.959> shoot<00:02:32.019> right<00:02:32.440> at<00:02:32.560> right<00:02:32.830> next<00:02:33.069> to

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
stuff they shoot right at right next to

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.970 
stuff they shoot right at right next to
you<00:02:33.360> find<00:02:34.360> easiest<00:02:34.690> ways<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.290> go<00:02:35.470> back<00:02:35.799> to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
you find easiest ways just go back to

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.360 
you find easiest ways just go back to
