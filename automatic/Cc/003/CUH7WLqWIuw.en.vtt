lumpy<00:04:11.310> pub<00:04:11.730> down<00:04:12.000> there<00:04:12.300> so<00:04:13.050> this<00:04:13.320> helicopter

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
lumpy pub down there so this helicopter

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.300 
lumpy pub down there so this helicopter
is<00:04:14.130> quite<00:04:14.490> easy<00:04:14.520> to<00:04:15.170> you<00:04:16.170> know<00:04:16.200> how<00:04:16.709> long<00:04:17.040> but

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
is quite easy to you know how long but

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.820 
is quite easy to you know how long but
it's<00:04:17.580> just<00:04:17.880> on<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.239> edge<00:04:18.330> and<00:04:19.140> I<00:04:19.290> think<00:04:19.650> not

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
it's just on the edge and I think not

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.800 
it's just on the edge and I think not
only<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:20.190> end<00:04:20.370> of<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:20.580> video<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:21.420> in<00:04:21.690> the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
only the end of this video so in the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.190

next episode we'll be testing out the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.640
