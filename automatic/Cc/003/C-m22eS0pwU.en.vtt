00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:03.939
 hello how about good friends because among them I wanted 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.700
 do a small rendered 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.879
 about epa two that I would demand out green 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:12.539
 get 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.129
 by the way the white version that was arrived is like the country only 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.239
 I think that's all I need I had the ipad 1 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.159
 my other videos have been seen and 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:27.279
 and good I sold it since it came after it died it was 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.800
 what you need so 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.340
 it's pretty good 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.480
 percent 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.200
 there is for all 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.080
 has changes 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.080
 it's not going to be very sincere I'm a 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.370
 definitely contributed to die 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.610
 very very fan I think everything that makes pol is well done 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.470
 but the Bavarian explosions against soto be very impartial about the ipad 2 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.400
 I think the pro to start 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.400
 in this specific is the color 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.840
 the white color sta 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.240
 beautiful 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.530
 simply 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.710
 It attracts a lot of attention because the population but its products 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.790
 in with majors have been white 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.990
 I say black 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.369
 then notwithstanding the tension and the truth 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580
 this one is very well the color 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.540
 the blank button todologist the white finish is perfectly fine 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 the controls could say what 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.320
 would be the cameras 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.340
 specifically the front that is a beast 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.370
 percent 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.280
 a very simple camera simply for video calls 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.940
 and the back 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.740
 what 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.770
 record 720p 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.300
 he taught them 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.550
 yes fair 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.900
 egan 720p 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.420
 I have understood that point 8 megapixels 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.510
 It is a very bad camera 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.140
 It is sincerely 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.390
 you will not reach to see 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.740
 the cause to the great 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.350
 the great thing about how I'm taking it looks like it's a good camera but in 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.670
 reality because I say in with us 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.870
 what I'm seeing is 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.439
 They will end up very bad express p 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.869
 it is a bad job solution 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.639
 this camera pp as I told you I understand that it is the same as that of 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.649
 fourth generation preserves 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.929
 and in an era 8 you do not see anything wrong 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:23.649
 by the size of the screen but a bad camera combined with this screen 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.479
 so good and so great 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:29.459
 it's a terrible combination you see all because we all look 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.559
 so the cameras really very bad 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:35.649
 percent are fulfilling their 6% function 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:37.689
 but 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:38.919
 But nothing more 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:44.369
 dare not never goya take out nor is there peace to take a photo nor far from it 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.229
 bartolomé does not know what 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:51.779
 good is very bad the processor that was also of the big things is 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:55.429
 impressive the ly faes is dual-core 512 ram 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:59.259
 it's very good it's too much I would say for 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.329
 percent one tablet yes 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.329
 the leader also wanted to comment 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:09.839
 that there are a lot of people who said that they thought it needed ample between 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:13.219
 is more power cans that in fact he or she does not run very well I agree 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.219
 but facts and I got to have files in 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.789
 we do not have why not 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:20.950
 what was he 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.080
 daring téllez who what all those applications that those of apple in the 1 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.290
 I arrived there were files that sent me that the iPad cost a lot of work to 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.009
 This specific entity does not cost you any work to pull that 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.090
 taboo being improvements 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.469
 between 1 and 2 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.699
 definitely the process yes 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.059
 I hope 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:44.019
 I believe that this agreement goes for long endure many representations is a 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.929
 awesome teacher 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:51.199
 ed things other new nonsense like forum cup that I think was not very 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.119
 necessary 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:54.429
 is an application that 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:56.580
 have fun in the minutes and 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.369
 it's over 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.199
 you will not use it again 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.620
 percent and good nothing in specific nothing else sevilla 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:04.899
 the delegate 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:07.619
 It is specifically impressive 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:10.619
 they feel so much better than 1 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:13.949
 I would dare say that even the finishes 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.239
 on the buttons 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.590
 and some small details and 100 kilos like me 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.360
 I think it's a difference 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.360
 If it's better done, the iPad is very good 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.659
 and I all the bad things is the shortage of this product 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.610
 in Mexico specifically 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.599
 without this minor another part of the American continent 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.960
 in mexico there are very few mountain hector with the other countries that 

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.409
 will have with him also there are very few 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:42.939
 ep 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.689
 the only good thing is that it lowered the dollar a little and it costs 500 pesos less than the 1 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:48.240
 so 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.240
 percent that's fine by a hundred 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.770
 more than to emphasize it also does not bring anything new 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.919
 I think this epa has a lot more life than u here 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.550
 and well that's a small review if you have any questions or want to see it 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.089
 some on the ipad 2 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:07.429
 some competition in specific awnings versus what you like 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.610
 if I have access to the other workshop I will gladly make them the river and good 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.729
 thank you very much and if you like to subscribe it would be uploading more videos I am a 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.189
 little 900 but 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:20.689
 but I'll keep trying to upload the videos 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:25.520
 and contribute much more about specifically the world to pons and I have 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.169
 access other gadgets that I am also very fan 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.290
 the style is this 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.689
 the previous arrests and all areas 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:35.389
 so this was just a preview of the ipad 2 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.510
 and good 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.660
 thank you very much see you later
