quite<00:04:30.930> a<00:04:30.960> simple<00:04:31.320> process<00:04:31.830> so<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:32.820> chicken<00:04:33.180> is

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
quite a simple process so the chicken is

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.589 
quite a simple process so the chicken is
done<00:04:34.970> that's<00:04:35.970> it

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
done that's it

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.960 
done that's it
not<00:04:37.440> soldering<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:38.010> much<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.460> don't<00:04:38.639> want<00:04:38.909> to

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
not soldering it much I don't want to

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.600
