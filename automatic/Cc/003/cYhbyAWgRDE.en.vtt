both of both of these computers and when

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.110 
both of both of these computers and when
I<00:01:24.020> say<00:01:24.290> go<00:01:24.500> we're<00:01:24.680> going<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:25.120> simultaneously

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
I say go we're going to simultaneously

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.760 
I say go we're going to simultaneously
launch<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.570> application<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.260> see<00:01:27.440> which<00:01:27.560> one

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
launch the application and see which one

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.880 
launch the application and see which one
launches<00:01:28.340> it<00:01:28.460> faster<00:01:29.170> okay<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:30.230> let's<00:01:30.500> do<00:01:30.770> this

this<00:01:49.250> next<00:01:49.340> test<00:01:49.700> we're<00:01:49.820> gonna<00:01:49.880> do<00:01:50.060> an

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
this next test we're gonna do an

this next test we're gonna do an
internet<00:01:50.770> download<00:01:51.770> speed<00:01:52.130> test<00:01:52.490> what<00:01:53.420> we're

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540

in the URL bar that has the the ISO that
we're<00:02:49.070> going<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.250> be<00:02:49.340> downloading<00:02:49.880> it's

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
we're going to be downloading it's

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.410 
we're going to be downloading it's
around<00:02:51.080> about<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.320> 30<00:02:51.680> Meg<00:02:51.970> download<00:02:52.970> file<00:02:53.150> that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
around about a 30 Meg download file that

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.850 
around about a 30 Meg download file that
we're<00:02:53.510> going<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.660> see<00:02:53.840> which<00:02:54.050> one<00:02:54.290> which<00:02:54.680> one

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
we're going to see which one which one

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.190 
we're going to see which one which one
of<00:02:54.890> these<00:02:55.010> computers<00:02:55.459> can<00:02:55.640> complete<00:02:56.060> first<00:02:56.390> so

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
of these computers can complete first so

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.580 
of these computers can complete first so
what<00:02:57.740> we're<00:02:57.860> gonna<00:02:57.920> do<00:02:58.220> is<00:02:59.980> three<00:03:00.980> two<00:03:01.400> one<00:03:01.970> go

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
what we're gonna do is three two one go

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.800 
what we're gonna do is three two one go
we're<00:03:03.590> gonna<00:03:03.680> see<00:03:03.920> which<00:03:04.100> one<00:03:04.340> can<00:03:04.810> download

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
we're gonna see which one can download

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.410 
we're gonna see which one can download
this<00:03:06.110> file<00:03:06.350> faster<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.790> we<00:03:07.850> can<00:03:07.970> see<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.270> both

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
this file faster so we can see that both

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.530 
this file faster so we can see that both
files<00:03:08.750> are<00:03:08.990> now<00:03:09.110> going<00:03:09.820> and<00:03:10.820> we<00:03:10.970> can<00:03:11.000> see<00:03:11.330> that

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
files are now going and we can see that

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.810
