 I do not hold a grudge, it 's fine. 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.850
 dan kamel said that my clip has already fallen 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.060
 in the playoffs but just compare tv poker 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.560
 boy beard versus khan and today there it is 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.060
 this abandoned the cells of the game 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.120
 I must agree 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.670
 the game of clippers with the river of blood 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.880
 of the river vs. oil wilson as areas 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.880
 when it's time to give forgiveness 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.110
 it is a must see then dabul since it is 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.680
 unmissable from our broadcast also 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.780
 then ask how do cam camel abba 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.360
 will open your screen to follow the 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.479
 conference end and james duel 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.939
 hayden with the car and also accompanies the 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.179
 TV poker bread leaves the game on mute 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:58.630
 because you can see everything and discuss 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:02:02.539
 the tv because in a certain vital powder 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.549
 perfectly perfect mateus felipe 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.899
 remember that the dream is so beautiful that already 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.429
 was applauded and I was able to score a goal in the 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.920
 brazil no mineirÃ£o 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.920
 it is because that is beautiful to see the 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.220
 Drama taxpayer now had minimax 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.519
 alex col came leading the victory 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.319
 although it allows for more action 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.000
 substantial snow because this board of 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.220
 worth is 32 cases to pause it 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.530
 enables a more substantial action 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.569
 because although coordinated coordinated by 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.660
 he has he's not the king though 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.880
 flash request and a goat that they have of ami 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.320
 valet that although that hits a lot yields 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.840
 does not yield to the range demonstrated which 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.640
 opponent to the rise has a lot 10 and 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.650
 10 and 9 is the alder of many ami 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.280
 hands combined with the eventual father 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.650
 queues for gifts, then it is 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.959
 very very interesting though 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.560
 tends to have the action because he hits 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.910
 enough hollande decol opponents 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.500
 this kind of situation we will see now 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.010
 if it really took a hit 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.720
 the flop or try to do some other 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.660
 thing or whether to abandon the parade we 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:18.829
 see placement leading boarded n roll 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:21.859
 leading the victory is ooo pot 1 14 thousand 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.410
 and look at the letter that appears in the 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.970
 turn of the discord cheer marques too 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.380
 will fight the meeting of 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.670
 condo goes from the parents meeting and 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.390
 teachers more semesters will give the pass 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.990
 rally 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.190
 Look what happens and he's not afraid. 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.350
 no right 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.580
 this is an interesting action that is the 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.020
 following the diary as the aggressor 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.850
 he is well tempted a letter that is 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.890
 more of your opponent 's hand opting 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.490
 and of course one day this does not 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.990
 general considerations where it can not be 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.790
 suddenly the band oasis and red bull of 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.660
 pause while the people are talking 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:04.040
 it is not a letter that usually 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:07.370
 hit the hand more than give the col 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.040
 flop and flop with the combination of 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.680
 hands with which he laughs 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.320
 preflop beth lopes bedtime then what 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.859
 happens in two possible scenarios 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.870
 when you beta in a letter that is the 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.460
 sure but your first opponent 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.890
 When you're at maximum value, you 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.100
 wants to represent the player used 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:33.700
 and the other which tends to be most 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.700
 times the play tends to be more often in 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.310
 sooner than I am than the hand of the 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.540
 who really got it right 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.419
 exactly what we're talking about 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.280
 Taking home came back this is very 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.960
 logical you beta in a letter that is very 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.790
 more than the result after 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.300
 near the flop flop 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.100
 This can be the value 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.470
 maximum that calls call take with more 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.200
 usually it tends to be a bit more 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.080
 sooner than the value because the 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.940
 River opponent and gave him a check by 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.360
 example I know I do I have 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.460
 part reveals a pair of aces for example there 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.430
 red fell and if 10 check the face 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.680
 has no environmental meaning because 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.090
 my mother is she has value and that is 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.700
 very interesting that we will talk 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.800
 How do you see a bad luck in this sport? 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.560
 so it's very interesting until after I 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.720
 I'll call if we can see the replay. 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.340
 This hand is already waiting for this hand. 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.050
 also for the best we will save 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.270
 Because these people can talk a lot 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.190
 thing about tactical values 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.710
 dynamic value letter that matches the network 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.300
 opponent manipulation of hand afinsa 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.669
 so that there is very interesting to 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.250
 people a little deeper because it is 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.980
 Even we see the hand to the 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.660
 I live here my guess is that it is 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.060
 sometimes the median value will be brief 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.530
 than the heavy value because it is a letter 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.730
 that hits a lot more yields from your 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.530
 adversary 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.210
 since you beta when you have a 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.610
 Chance because you have to check later. 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.590
 who struck 10 clubs because his hand she 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.840
 dynamic value in order to have 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.670
 a static value or better never again 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.010
 Of course, a king may fall eventually. 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.230
 if you do the sequence but it becomes 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.440
 what the static value it will win 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:15.140
 will work as blackhat am and how is it 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.300
 and the fact that you manipulate the hand of your 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.420
 opponents of the times that he has a 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:24.530
 lady of whom we are going to see or in which she 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:26.720
 finds itself without essential incom already 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.790
 we had one of the best hands to 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.400
 image that is happening now more 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:34.760
 than ever evandro has king 10 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.340
 flush draw two pair tips of 10 and 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.220
 we hate have a pair of droy drill valves 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:43.040
 flash drug in the valet are many 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.010
 combinations a pot giant 60,900 and 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.170
 We're going to the river now it's all on the screen. 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:54.190
 here in rio caliente attention brazil 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:59.090
 Let's go to the river on screen 14 of paulo 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:04.580
 evandro ver toy pulls the pot with the flash 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:07.390
 and the milk 34 perception of andrÃ© gewehr 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.390
