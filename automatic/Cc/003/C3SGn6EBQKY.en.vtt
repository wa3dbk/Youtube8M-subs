00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
this drawer set that's why I decided to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.179 
this drawer set that's why I decided to
take<00:01:24.509> him<00:01:24.689> off<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:28.350> last<00:01:28.619> handle<00:01:29.040> I

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.260 
hammer and a screwdriver right in
between<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.650> handle<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> actual<00:01:41.670> drawer

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
between the handle and the actual drawer

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.780 
between the handle and the actual drawer
to<00:01:42.930> kind<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.200> wedge<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.740> screwdriver<00:01:44.189> through

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.520 
to kind of wedge the screwdriver through
and<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.390> pull<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> handle<00:01:46.110> off<00:01:46.259> because

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and like pull the handle off because

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.410 
and like pull the handle off because
they<00:01:46.619> were<00:01:46.680> nailed<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.060> first<00:01:48.270> one

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
they were nailed in and the first one

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.330 
they were nailed in and the first one
took<00:01:48.540> me<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> really<00:01:48.810> long<00:01:49.200> time<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.860> was<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> pain

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
took me a really long time it was a pain

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.830 
took me a really long time it was a pain
in<00:01:50.369> my<00:01:50.549> butt<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:50.970> then<00:01:51.210> they<00:01:51.360> were<00:01:51.420> screw

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
in my butt and then they were screw

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.109 
in my butt and then they were screw
sticking<00:01:52.049> out<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.460> what<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.759> drawer

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
sticking out but this is what the drawer

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.030 
sticking out but this is what the drawer
looks<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.570> once<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.049> handle<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.619> off<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
looks like once the handle is off and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.770 
looks like once the handle is off and
then<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.670> second<00:01:57.000> drawer<00:01:57.090> took<00:01:57.390> me<00:01:57.540> no

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
then for the second drawer took me no

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.690 
then for the second drawer took me no
time<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.560> hammered<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> screw<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.610> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
time I just hammered the screw in and it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:10.920 
time I just hammered the screw in and it
popped<00:01:59.939> right<00:02:00.149> off

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.390 

so<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:12.230> what<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.500> set<00:02:12.740> looks<00:02:12.920> like<00:02:13.070> now

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
so this is what the set looks like now

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.580 
so this is what the set looks like now
that<00:02:13.430> all<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.180> handles<00:02:14.600> are<00:02:14.750> off<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.410> can

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
that all of the handles are off you can

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.740 
that all of the handles are off you can
see<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.040> red<00:02:16.190> paint<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.730> stuff<00:02:16.970> like<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.210> so

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
see the red paint and stuff like that so

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.900 
see the red paint and stuff like that so
now<00:02:18.350> it's<00:02:18.530> time<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:18.890> sand<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.490> want<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.790> make

new knobs on and i'm using the e6000
glue<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:02.480> probably<00:04:02.930> should<00:04:03.110> have<00:04:03.290> drilled

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
glue I probably should have drilled

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.290 
glue I probably should have drilled
these<00:04:03.799> in<00:04:04.040> but<00:04:04.310> I<00:04:04.340> don't<00:04:04.670> really<00:04:04.850> know<00:04:05.000> how<00:04:05.030> to

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
these in but I don't really know how to

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.020 
these in but I don't really know how to
that<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:06.110> used<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.770> really<00:04:07.100> heavy<00:04:07.340> duty<00:04:07.460> glue

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
that so I used a really heavy duty glue

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.120 
that so I used a really heavy duty glue
and<00:04:08.270> I<00:04:08.330> also<00:04:08.480> let<00:04:08.840> this<00:04:09.020> sit<00:04:09.380> for<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.620> night<00:04:09.890> I

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
and I also let this sit for the night I

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.650 
and I also let this sit for the night I
wanted<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:10.820> make<00:04:10.940> sure<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.240> these<00:04:11.510> were

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
wanted to make sure that these were

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.600 
wanted to make sure that these were
really<00:04:11.930> stuck<00:04:12.290> on<00:04:12.470> and<00:04:12.920> they<00:04:13.100> weren't<00:04:13.370> going

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
really stuck on and they weren't going

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.750 
really stuck on and they weren't going
to<00:04:13.700> come<00:04:13.730> off<00:04:18.100> for<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.160> inside<00:04:19.580> of<00:04:19.610> the
