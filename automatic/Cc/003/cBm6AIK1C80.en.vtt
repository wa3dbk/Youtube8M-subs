00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:51.770 
using the bevel on this cut I'm just
using<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.060> bottom<00:00:38.420> edge<00:00:38.570> of<00:00:38.720> the<00:00:38.810> couch

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:00.100

concave<00:01:02.300> there<00:01:03.850> so<00:01:04.850> it's<00:01:05.030> going<00:01:05.120> to<00:01:05.180> sit<00:01:05.480> on<00:01:05.600> my

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
concave there so it's going to sit on my

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:15.840 
concave there so it's going to sit on my
foot<00:01:05.990> out<00:01:06.020> here

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:36.050 
now have a little tiny footprint there
is<00:01:18.230> just<00:01:18.500> taking<00:01:18.740> shape

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.270 

okay<00:01:37.260> let's<00:01:38.260> get<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.560> outside<00:01:38.950> I've<00:01:39.130> got<00:01:39.250> a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
okay let's get the outside I've got a

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.350 
okay let's get the outside I've got a
little<00:01:39.400> bit<00:01:39.580> of<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.700> ridge<00:01:39.880> here<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.150> need<00:01:40.330> a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
sand out past here each time a little

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.680 
sand out past here each time a little
farther<00:01:53.830> on<00:01:54.070> each<00:01:54.220> grit<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:55.090> blend<00:01:55.330> these<00:01:55.450> two

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
farther on each grit to blend these two

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.980 
farther on each grit to blend these two
surfaces<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:57.100> feels<00:01:57.400> pretty<00:01:57.490> good<00:01:57.930> now<00:01:58.930> we

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
surfaces that feels pretty good now we

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.740 
surfaces that feels pretty good now we
can<00:01:59.170> move<00:01:59.320> this<00:01:59.560> away
