you're<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> tf2<00:01:08.310> player<00:01:08.700> think<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.510> as<00:01:09.630> if

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
you're a tf2 player think of it as if

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.260 
you're a tf2 player think of it as if
unusual<00:01:10.619> hats<00:01:10.860> could<00:01:11.100> drop<00:01:11.340> they've

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
unusual hats could drop they've

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.510 
unusual hats could drop they've
increased<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.020> chance<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.830> game<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
increased that chance in this game to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.410 
increased that chance in this game to
happen<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.810> quite<00:01:16.020> cool<00:01:16.229> while<00:01:17.270> some<00:01:18.270> people

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
happen it's quite cool while some people

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.210 
happen it's quite cool while some people
have<00:01:18.869> been<00:01:18.960> freaking<00:01:19.350> out<00:01:19.439> oh<00:01:19.710> my<00:01:20.040> goodness

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
have been freaking out oh my goodness

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.399 
have been freaking out oh my goodness
should<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.700> twenty<00:01:21.330> five<00:01:21.479> percent<00:01:21.509> that's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
should be twenty five percent that's

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.679 
should be twenty five percent that's
like<00:01:22.799> you're<00:01:23.340> guaranteed<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.880> legendary<00:01:24.390> every

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
like you're guaranteed a legendary every

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.920 
like you're guaranteed a legendary every
four<00:01:24.930> runs<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> own<00:01:25.470> 25%<00:01:26.280> 14<00:01:26.820> well<00:01:27.479> not<00:01:27.689> really

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
four runs the own 25% 14 well not really

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.069 
four runs the own 25% 14 well not really
I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:29.060> legendary<00:01:30.060> drop<00:01:30.360> rates<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.840> like

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
I think legendary drop rates is like

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.890 
I think legendary drop rates is like
point<00:01:31.590> zero<00:01:32.009> zero<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.810> just

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
point zero zero one so now it's just

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.460 
point zero zero one so now it's just
point<00:01:34.229> zero<00:01:34.950> zero<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.909> two<00:01:36.090> five<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
point zero zero one two five so not a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.190 
point zero zero one two five so not a
huge<00:01:37.740> increase<00:01:38.040> as<00:01:38.280> far<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.700> I'm<00:01:39.210> aware<00:01:39.240> now<00:01:40.079> if

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
huge increase as far as I'm aware now if

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.780 
huge increase as far as I'm aware now if
we<00:01:40.290> play<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.680> harder<00:01:41.009> difficulties<00:01:41.400> we're

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
we play on harder difficulties we're

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.850 
we play on harder difficulties we're
playing<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.119> torment<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:42.750> pretty<00:01:43.560> much<00:01:43.740> is

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
playing on torment one pretty much is

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.260 
playing on torment one pretty much is
cut<00:01:44.070> through<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.549> butter<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.060> really

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
cut through it like butter it's really

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.480 
cut through it like butter it's really
not<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.450> difficult<00:01:45.810> when<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.920> get<00:01:47.310> some

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
not that difficult when you get some

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.460 
not that difficult when you get some
nice<00:01:47.670> level<00:01:47.939> 70<00:01:48.420> gear<00:01:48.890> but<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.100> mean<00:01:50.490> overall

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
nice level 70 gear but I mean overall

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.840 
nice level 70 gear but I mean overall
it's<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.829> balance<00:01:53.549> between<00:01:53.670> efficiency<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's a balance between efficiency and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.429 
it's a balance between efficiency and
difficulty<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> always<00:01:57.509> want<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.290> my

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
difficulty so you always want to in my

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.620 
difficulty so you always want to in my
opinion<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.979> playing<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.430> torment<00:02:00.180> or<00:02:00.360> higher

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
opinion be playing on torment or higher

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.380 
opinion be playing on torment or higher
because<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:01.890> chances<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.729> getting

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
because then you have chances of getting

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.270 
because then you have chances of getting
imperial<00:02:03.899> gems<00:02:04.200> which<00:02:04.649> are<00:02:04.799> really<00:02:04.979> nice<00:02:05.219> and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
imperial gems which are really nice and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.399 
imperial gems which are really nice and
pretty<00:02:05.790> expensive<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.420> make<00:02:06.600> especially<00:02:07.350> if

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
pretty expensive to make especially if

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.990 
pretty expensive to make especially if
you<00:02:07.469> want<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.680> take<00:02:07.860> them<00:02:08.069> further<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.459> common

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
you want to take them further a common

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.140 
you want to take them further a common
nice<00:02:09.119> starting<00:02:09.989> place<00:02:10.200> for<00:02:10.229> crafting<00:02:10.890> and
