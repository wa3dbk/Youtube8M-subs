features<00:03:26.769> here<00:03:27.190> we<00:03:28.150> just<00:03:28.299> kind<00:03:28.569> of<00:03:28.630> write<00:03:28.810> a

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
features here we just kind of write a

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.780 
features here we just kind of write a
word<00:03:29.109> here<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:34.120> nice<00:03:34.750> little<00:03:34.900> word<00:03:35.139> but<00:03:35.440> if<00:03:36.430> you

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
word here so nice little word but if you

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.420 
word here so nice little word but if you
can<00:03:36.940> read<00:03:37.120> my<00:03:37.269> scribble<00:03:37.600> good<00:03:37.930> luck<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:39.160> aqua

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
can read my scribble good luck the aqua

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.800 
can read my scribble good luck the aqua
support<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.760> smart<00:03:40.030> enough<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.269> actually<00:03:40.660> do

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
support is smart enough to actually do

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.780 
support is smart enough to actually do
that<00:03:40.959> itself<00:03:41.380> so<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.250> want<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.519> make<00:03:42.609> this<00:03:42.730> a

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
that itself so I want to make this a

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.120 
that itself so I want to make this a
little<00:03:42.970> bit<00:03:43.150> cleaner<00:03:43.389> design<00:03:43.650> we<00:03:44.650> can<00:03:44.799> select

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
little bit cleaner design we can select

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.940 
little bit cleaner design we can select
that<00:03:45.310> word<00:03:45.549> and<00:03:46.380> automatically<00:03:47.380> convert<00:03:47.829> it

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
that word and automatically convert it

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.569 
that word and automatically convert it
to<00:03:47.980> text<00:03:48.569> real<00:03:49.569> cool<00:03:49.750> feature<00:03:50.519> sometimes<00:03:51.519> you

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
to text real cool feature sometimes you

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.280 
to text real cool feature sometimes you
want<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:51.760> take<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.120> even<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.420> step<00:03:52.569> further<00:03:52.630> and

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
want to take it even a step further and

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.080 
want to take it even a step further and
maybe<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.560> want<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.769> research<00:03:54.100> about<00:03:54.970> the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
maybe you want to research about the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.940 
maybe you want to research about the
product<00:03:55.480> well<00:03:56.079> that's<00:03:56.319> not<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.530> problem<00:03:56.769> for

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
product well that's not a problem for

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.500 
product well that's not a problem for
the<00:03:57.099> aqua<00:03:57.340> support<00:03:57.639> either<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:58.389> can

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
the aqua support either you can

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.890 
the aqua support either you can
highlight<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:59.280> click<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.370> web<00:04:00.549> search<00:04:00.900> it

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
highlight that click the web search it

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.410 
highlight that click the web search it
understands<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.590> gibberish<00:04:03.010> share<00:04:03.420> search

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
understands the gibberish share search

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.190 
understands the gibberish share search
for<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.609> there<00:04:06.609> we<00:04:06.760> go<00:04:07.109> sometimes<00:04:08.109> you

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
for it and there we go sometimes you

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.150 
for it and there we go sometimes you
want<00:04:08.349> to<00:04:08.410> import<00:04:08.650> things<00:04:10.950> that's<00:04:11.950> not<00:04:12.099> a

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
want to import things that's not a

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.920 
want to import things that's not a
problem<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:12.700> aqua<00:04:12.910> support<00:04:13.180> either<00:04:13.329> so<00:04:13.900> I

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
problem for the aqua support either so I

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.170 
problem for the aqua support either so I
can<00:04:14.109> take<00:04:14.260> an<00:04:14.410> image<00:04:14.519> insert<00:04:15.519> it<00:04:15.669> so<00:04:16.030> let's

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
can take an image insert it so let's

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.150 
can take an image insert it so let's
screen<00:04:16.539> capture<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.109> kind<00:04:17.380> of<00:04:17.769> like<00:04:17.950> that

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
screen capture that kind of like that

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.350 
screen capture that kind of like that

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
alkis board one of the things we've

alike<00:04:54.910> is<00:04:55.150> sometimes<00:04:56.130> you<00:04:57.130> may<00:04:57.280> need<00:04:57.460> more

than a single touch point maybe there's

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.950 
than a single touch point maybe there's
two<00:04:59.770> users<00:05:00.160> that's<00:05:01.000> really<00:05:01.389> not<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.570> problem

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960
