00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.110 
first few weeks of after launch they did
patch<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.530> from<00:03:24.799> its<00:03:24.950> ridiculous<00:03:25.579> state<00:03:25.880> but

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
patch it from its ridiculous state but

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.940 
patch it from its ridiculous state but
once<00:03:26.510> people<00:03:26.570> figure<00:03:27.109> out<00:03:27.260> that<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.440> can<00:03:27.650> just

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
once people figure out that you can just

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.270 
once people figure out that you can just
add<00:03:28.359> FMJ<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:29.630> akimbo<00:03:29.959> it'll<00:03:30.859> be<00:03:30.950> just<00:03:31.160> the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
add FMJ and akimbo it'll be just the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.400 
add FMJ and akimbo it'll be just the
same<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:31.850> just<00:03:32.269> like<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.450> tactile<00:03:32.959> insertion

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
same so just like the tactile insertion

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.289 
same so just like the tactile insertion
I<00:03:33.500> suggest<00:03:33.859> you<00:03:33.950> take<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.250> out<00:03:34.459> replace<00:03:35.150> it

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
I suggest you take it out replace it

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.630 
I suggest you take it out replace it
with<00:03:35.390> something<00:03:35.420> else<00:03:35.780> possibly<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.829> W<00:03:37.160> 1200

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
with something else possibly the W 1200

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.120 
with something else possibly the W 1200
from<00:03:37.790> cod4<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:39.260> gun<00:03:39.410> is<00:03:39.530> just<00:03:39.709> too<00:03:39.920> powerful

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
from cod4 the gun is just too powerful

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.610 
from cod4 the gun is just too powerful
and<00:03:40.700> has<00:03:41.090> two<00:03:41.450> longer<00:03:41.780> arranged<00:03:42.109> to<00:03:42.380> have<00:03:42.410> the

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
and has two longer arranged to have the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.160 
and has two longer arranged to have the
akimbo<00:03:43.190> feature<00:03:43.579> available<00:03:44.120> much<00:03:44.750> like<00:03:44.959> all

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
akimbo feature available much like all

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.930 
akimbo feature available much like all
the<00:03:45.290> other<00:03:45.440> guns<00:03:45.680> with<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:45.859> low<00:03:46.130> recoil<00:03:46.400> and

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
the other guns with a low recoil and

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.750 
the other guns with a low recoil and
lack<00:03:47.510> of<00:03:47.540> idols<00:03:48.230> away<00:03:48.530> this<00:03:49.130> gun<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.489> only

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
lack of idols away this gun is the only

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.120 
lack of idols away this gun is the only
one<00:03:49.970> that<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.180> believe<00:03:50.660> is<00:03:50.840> truly<00:03:51.380> overpowered

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
one that I believe is truly overpowered

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.270 
one that I believe is truly overpowered
compared<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:52.970> rest<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.329> guns<00:03:53.540> and

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
compared to the rest of the guns and

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.000 
compared to the rest of the guns and
last<00:03:55.280> but<00:03:55.430> not<00:03:55.700> least<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:56.690> commando<00:03:57.440> perky

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
last but not least the commando perky

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.550 
last but not least the commando perky
from<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.940> first<00:03:59.180> moment<00:03:59.630> I<00:03:59.870> heard<00:04:00.049> about<00:04:00.170> it<00:04:00.350> I

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
from the first moment I heard about it I

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.770 
from the first moment I heard about it I
didn't<00:04:00.890> really<00:04:01.040> understand<00:04:01.640> because<00:04:02.450> i<00:04:02.630> had

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
didn't really understand because i had

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.440 
didn't really understand because i had
thought<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.859> knife<00:04:04.400> range<00:04:04.700> was<00:04:04.910> already<00:04:05.209> too

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
thought the knife range was already too

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.479 
thought the knife range was already too
long<00:04:05.690> I<00:04:05.900> like<00:04:06.109> the<00:04:06.260> knife<00:04:06.440> range<00:04:06.680> in<00:04:07.040> world<00:04:07.370> of

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
long I like the knife range in world of

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.370 
long I like the knife range in world of
war<00:04:07.640> which<00:04:07.819> most<00:04:08.030> people<00:04:08.150> thought<00:04:08.480> was<00:04:09.200> you

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
war which most people thought was you

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.949 
war which most people thought was you
know<00:04:09.500> just<00:04:09.709> useless<00:04:10.040> but<00:04:11.000> commando<00:04:11.390> adds<00:04:11.569> just

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
know just useless but commando adds just

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.710 
know just useless but commando adds just
too<00:04:12.319> long<00:04:12.829> of<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.100> melee

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
too long of a melee

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.500 
too long of a melee
