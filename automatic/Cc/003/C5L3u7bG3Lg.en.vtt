00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello I'm luca in this video we'll see 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.910
 a very effective workout to train i 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.140
 triceps and biceps in super series if 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.300
 by now we say it follows my method 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.800
 butterfly in case you go on doing 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.049
 referring to my videos you will know me 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.160
 in general I propose to train biceps 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.660
 and triceps in the same session 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.430
 together behind 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.199
 however this case we do not see then 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.180
 this case we see how super sectarian 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.970
 that is how to train biceps triceps 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.189
 in series in super series then without ever 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.660
 take a break between one series and another e 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.640
 so a skillful work with a lot of weights 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.740
 light pulses in pure butterfly style 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.360
 but a great effectiveness since 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.370
 the intensity will be very high so e 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.920
 breaks will be practically zeroed 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.090
 we will first see the triceps then biceps and 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.920
 so a mini circuit you can 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.930
 repeat 5 times for each one then 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.730
 you'll see between exercises for the triceps from 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.219
 repeat 5 times in super series without 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.559
 never pause after three exercises 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.149
 for the biceps also to be repeated 5 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.270
 times here in total will be for 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.610
 the note let's say 10 total series that 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.620
 go you go for each exercise e 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.719
 first the triceps co completely 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.500
 then biceps and I really guarantee you 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.059
 that can have a great deal 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.100
 effectiveness to develop precisely 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.750
 good arms before seeing the video 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.310
 as always I suggest you sign up 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.260
 to my free mini course by clicking here 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.790
 under 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.140
 then we start with the triceps in 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.180
 this case we see the distensions 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.680
 haller paulina with the barbell like 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.509
 see the execution must be enough 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.700
 slow with a weight not too high 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.229
 as always your sincere goal that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.759
 works best without worrying 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.829
 too much of the repetition series one 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.140
 a second and two of contraction then 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.500
 let's move on to relaxation with a single 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.500
 handlebars 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.630
 in this case they did not pause then 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.549
 as you will see the arm just finished 15 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.110
 pt right we pass immediately to the left 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.060
 you can also see that the weight really 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.179
 very low but despite this the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.530
 very effective contraction 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.850
 so as you see super we set without 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.850
 take breaks for maximum effectiveness 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.829
 even here we do two seconds of 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.830
 contraction so let's go to france 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.789
 press 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.860
 take a weight as always enough 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.599
 light as you see this position 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.769
 correct to rest a foot for the 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.290
 greater stability or even for 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.790
 earth and indifferent movement 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.840
 quite slow 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.730
 I always recommend breathing 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.709
 therefore do not do apnea do not raise the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.599
 back china cul de the weight is too much 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.019
 high or you have a poor one 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:39.010
 flexibility as you see the cody movement 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.010
 it must be as wide as possible 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.930
 also here a second of contraction 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.360
 then we place the handlebars e 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.840
 let's start with a circuit then 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.430
 therefore, haller paulina distensions 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.010
 let's repeat this two other circuits 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.829
 times for a total of three times over 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.329
 this then we pass to the biceps 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.920
 then let's start the biceps circuit 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.230
 with the scott tanks as you see this 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.489
 correct posture uses little weight with 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.769
 a wider range of motion 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.329
 possible and watch your wrists for 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.920
 avoid making too much effort together 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.530
 forearms then a grip 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.450
 quite let's say loose with ei 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.400
 placed in the correct position then does 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.690
 reference to my other video was 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.700
 breathing is also very careful 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.650
 very important therefore in the phase 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.100
 concentric inspire when muscles 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.100
 contract 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.450
 then back learco lina in this 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.480
 case we use the rope as you see from below 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.740
 for this type of exercise a weight 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.300
 always quite light as you see 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.680
 this is the type of movement then 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.790
 very important 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.740
 wanting to follow even a little more 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.870
 slowly and very important for 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.340
 the note that the wells should rotate 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.920
 inwards to feel the maximum 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.480
 the contraction of the biceps as always 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.020
 been around breathing so e 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.570
 spiri when you go to check then ai 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.580
 both a poetic movement and the arms 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.990
 it is also the phase in which precisely 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.990
 bend yourself to the inside 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.010
 finally we pass the last exercise for 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.019
 the fidas focal biceps circuit 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.489
 made with standing dumbbells 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.500
 I recommend you choose two dumbbells a lot 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.390
 light for an impeccable technique for 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.030
 duty and to avoid precisely of 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.890
 having to go and ruin the 30 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.510
 of the execution keeps the grip 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.460
 towards the internal disk the movement 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.110
 composed both of explaining the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.630
 arms both by the rotation of the wrists 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.430
 very important breathing you can also 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.080
 useful last in the last repetition le 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.800
 last series also run a carnet 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.510
 with the hammer handle finished this 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.430
 so let's repeat this same exercise 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.210
 biceps circuit 32 times 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.210
 ready late between
