a<00:00:41.070> tip<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.850> rotate<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.899> blade<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.570> watch

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
a tip and rotate the blade and I watch

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.779 
a tip and rotate the blade and I watch
the<00:00:49.050> bolt<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> crankshaft<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.219> see<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.610> it

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
the bolt on the crankshaft to see if it

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.660 
the bolt on the crankshaft to see if it
wobbles<00:00:51.680> that'll<00:00:52.680> tell<00:00:52.860> me<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> crank<00:00:53.520> is

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
wobbles that'll tell me if the crank is

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.590 
wobbles that'll tell me if the crank is
bent<00:00:53.879> or<00:00:54.030> not<00:00:58.550> this<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.820> wobbles<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.359> little

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
bent or not this one wobbles a little

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.170 
bent or not this one wobbles a little
bit<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.410> that's<00:01:01.620> telling<00:01:01.890> me<00:01:02.039> he<00:01:02.850> may<00:01:03.059> have

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
bit so that's telling me he may have

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.750 
bit so that's telling me he may have
sheared<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> flywheel<00:01:04.140> key<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.519> could

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
sheared the flywheel key and that could

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.070 
sheared the flywheel key and that could
be<00:01:05.880> why<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.299> starting<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.930> that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
be why it's not starting because that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.730 
be why it's not starting because that
throws<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.500> timing<00:01:07.860> off<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.430> next<00:01:08.729> step<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
throws the timing off so next step is to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.600 
throws the timing off so next step is to
first<00:01:10.740> see<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.130> these<00:01:11.310> rec<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> engine

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
first see if these rec the engine

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.929 
first see if these rec the engine
pull<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> string

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
pull the string

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.550 
pull the string
the<00:01:17.939> compression<00:01:18.330> feels<00:01:18.720> normal<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the compression feels normal so the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.429 
the compression feels normal so the
engines<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:20.070> wrecked<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.990> I'll<00:01:21.990> check<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
engines not wrecked so I'll check the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.580 
engines not wrecked so I'll check the
flywheel<00:01:22.770> key<00:01:23.009> now<00:01:23.990> now<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.200> I've<00:01:25.320> got<00:01:25.560> all

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
it turns one way and ratchets the other

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.569 
it turns one way and ratchets the other
way<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:35.990> made<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> handy<00:01:37.470> dandy<00:01:37.650> tool<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.400> this

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
way I made a handy dandy tool to do this

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.380 
in there the bearings stick on the end
and<00:02:41.310> then<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.519> thing<00:02:41.730> doesn't<00:02:42.060> catch<00:02:42.209> when

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
and then the thing doesn't catch when

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.710 
and then the thing doesn't catch when
you're<00:02:42.540> pulling<00:02:43.790> well<00:02:44.790> now<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.360> I've<00:02:45.480> got

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
you're pulling well now that I've got

you're pulling well now that I've got
everything<00:02:46.380> off<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.980> can<00:02:47.310> see<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.730> foil

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
everything off I can see that the foil

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.880 
everything off I can see that the foil
key<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.599> perfect<00:02:48.930> conditions<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.709> can

key is in perfect conditions and I can

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.440 
key is in perfect conditions and I can
put<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.130> back<00:02:50.250> together<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.819> continue<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.209> see

put it back together and continue to see

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.440 
put it back together and continue to see
what's<00:02:51.630> wrong<00:02:51.810> with<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.849> it's<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:53.940> great<00:02:54.239> idea

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
what's wrong with it it's a great idea

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:02.360 
what's wrong with it it's a great idea
to<00:02:55.019> put<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:56.000> few<00:02:57.000> drops<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:58.099> light<00:02:59.099> oil<00:03:00.860> in<00:03:01.860> the

to put a few drops of light oil in the
hole<00:03:02.579> of<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:02.910> thing<00:03:05.900> every<00:03:06.900> few<00:03:06.930> years

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
hole of this thing every few years

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.300 
hole of this thing every few years
there's<00:03:08.850> even<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.209> little<00:03:09.560> sock<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.829> there<00:03:11.069> to

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
there's even a little sock in there to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.099 
there's even a little sock in there to
absorb<00:03:11.609> oil<00:03:11.880> that's<00:03:12.329> what<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.630> hole<00:03:12.810> is<00:03:12.959> there

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
absorb oil that's what the hole is there

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.530 
absorb oil that's what the hole is there
for<00:03:13.319> you<00:03:13.470> can<00:03:13.590> add<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.829> oil<00:03:14.010> from<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.160> top<00:03:14.540> you

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
for you can add the oil from the top you

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.590 
for you can add the oil from the top you
ever<00:03:15.720> start<00:03:16.079> your<00:03:16.200> lawnmower<00:03:16.380> up<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:18.480> it's

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
ever start your lawnmower up and it's

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.970 
ever start your lawnmower up and it's
three<00:03:18.780> seconds<00:03:19.139> later<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.560> starts<00:03:19.799> making

three seconds later and starts making
huge<00:03:20.489> screeching<00:03:21.090> sounds<00:03:21.590> well<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:24.540> shaft

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
huge screeching sounds well that shaft

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.500 
huge screeching sounds well that shaft
is<00:03:25.319> seizing<00:03:25.769> up<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.190> here<00:03:26.819> because<00:03:27.239> there's<00:03:27.450> no

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
is seizing up on here because there's no

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.569 
is seizing up on here because there's no
oil<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:28.139> all<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.380> do<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.680> sand<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:29.040> shaft<00:03:29.280> and

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
oil so all you do is sand the shaft and

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.250 
oil so all you do is sand the shaft and
add<00:03:29.880> some<00:03:30.150> oil<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:31.560> never<00:03:31.739> use<00:03:31.980> grease<00:03:33.230> now<00:03:34.230> I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
add some oil you never use grease now I

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.580 
add some oil you never use grease now I
need<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.590> put<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.829> up<00:03:36.560> same<00:03:37.560> tool<00:03:39.230> just<00:03:40.230> change

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
need to put it up same tool just change

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.059 
need to put it up same tool just change
the<00:03:40.709> direction<00:03:41.190> on<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.519> tool<00:03:42.620> I've<00:03:43.620> got<00:03:43.920> my

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
the direction on this tool I've got my

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.680 
the direction on this tool I've got my
foot<00:03:44.310> on<00:03:44.340> here<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.790> hold<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.090> flywheel<00:03:45.269> from

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
foot on here to hold the flywheel from

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.530 
foot on here to hold the flywheel from
turning<00:03:46.079> and<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.470> just<00:03:46.739> lock<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.130> up<00:03:47.510> it's<00:03:48.510> very

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
turning and I just lock it up it's very

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.690 
turning and I just lock it up it's very
important<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.319> put<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.680> thing<00:03:49.950> back<00:03:50.010> on<00:03:50.430> very

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
important to put that thing back on very

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.550 
important to put that thing back on very
tight<00:03:51.030> because<00:03:51.420> if<00:03:51.599> it<00:03:51.720> isn't<00:03:52.109> when<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.380> go<00:03:52.500> to

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
tight because if it isn't when you go to

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.530 
tight because if it isn't when you go to
start<00:03:52.889> it<00:03:53.040> shortly<00:03:53.400> afterwards<00:03:53.940> so<00:03:54.090> if<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.269> will

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
start it shortly afterwards so if I will

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.289 
start it shortly afterwards so if I will
key<00:03:54.720> will<00:03:54.900> break<00:03:55.079> all<00:03:55.290> by<00:03:55.440> itself

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
key will break all by itself

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.699 
key will break all by itself
next<00:03:57.299> it's<00:03:57.419> very<00:03:57.599> important<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.109> always<00:03:58.290> try

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
next it's very important to always try

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:59.960 
next it's very important to always try
to<00:03:58.769> start<00:03:59.040> your<00:03:59.069> lawnmower<00:03:59.310> only<00:03:59.849> when

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
to start your lawnmower only when

there's a blade on very tight the blade

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.370 
there's a blade on very tight the blade
is<00:04:02.609> actually<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.150> flywheel<00:04:03.660> this<00:04:03.989> doesn't

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
is actually the flywheel this doesn't

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.349 
is actually the flywheel this doesn't
have<00:04:04.530> enough<00:04:04.769> weight<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.310> be<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.639> real<00:04:05.910> flywheel

it's just a cooling device if you try to

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.630 
it's just a cooling device if you try to
start<00:04:10.319> it<00:04:10.439> without<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.829> blade<00:04:11.040> attached

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.020

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
well next problem we're at the corner

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.640 
well next problem we're at the corner
the<00:05:22.270> spark<00:05:22.570> plug<00:05:22.810> there's<00:05:23.050> this<00:05:23.230> piece<00:05:23.470> of

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
the spark plug there's this piece of

the spark plug there's this piece of
crud<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.370> don't<00:05:25.360> know<00:05:25.420> what<00:05:25.600> it<00:05:25.690> is

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
crud I don't know what it is

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.250 
crud I don't know what it is
could<00:05:26.710> be<00:05:26.860> an<00:05:26.980> oil<00:05:27.160> deposit<00:05:28.050> but<00:05:29.050> that's

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
could be an oil deposit but that's

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.810 
could be an oil deposit but that's
shorting<00:05:29.650> out<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.890> electrode<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.520> spark

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
shorting out the electrode the spark

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.760 
shorting out the electrode the spark
would<00:05:30.970> rather<00:05:31.150> not<00:05:31.630> jump<00:05:31.990> across<00:05:32.290> that<00:05:32.530> gap

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
would rather not jump across that gap

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.500 
would rather not jump across that gap
but<00:05:32.980> we<00:05:33.100> got<00:05:33.250> to<00:05:33.370> jump<00:05:33.550> across<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:34.090> Carboni

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
but we got to jump across the Carboni

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.900 
but we got to jump across the Carboni
piece<00:05:34.690> of<00:05:34.870> crud<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:36.430> that<00:05:36.610> would<00:05:36.730> probably

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
piece of crud and that would probably

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.200 
piece of crud and that would probably
stop<00:05:37.240> a<00:05:37.450> lot<00:05:37.660> more<00:05:37.870> from<00:05:38.020> running<00:05:39.000> so<00:05:40.000> now

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
stop a lot more from running so now

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.570 
stop a lot more from running so now
we're<00:05:40.420> all<00:05:40.540> oiled<00:05:40.960> up<00:05:41.110> time<00:05:41.980> for<00:05:42.250> a<00:05:42.280> fresh

carburetor took the air cleaner just got
dusts<00:05:50.890> not<00:05:51.190> bad<00:05:51.400> I'll<00:05:51.670> blow<00:05:51.880> it<00:05:52.030> out<00:05:52.150> and<00:05:52.210> reel

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480

dusts not bad I'll blow it out and reel
it<00:05:54.210> it<00:05:55.210> hasn't<00:05:55.450> been<00:05:55.630> oiled<00:05:55.990> so<00:05:56.260> as<00:05:56.410> you<00:05:56.590> can

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
it it hasn't been oiled so as you can

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.200 
it it hasn't been oiled so as you can
see<00:05:56.950> the<00:05:57.100> dust<00:05:57.310> has<00:05:57.490> been<00:05:57.670> getting<00:05:57.970> through

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
see the dust has been getting through

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.740 
see the dust has been getting through
the<00:05:58.330> air<00:05:58.480> filter<00:05:59.610> and<00:06:00.610> actually<00:06:01.300> going<00:06:01.540> into

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
the engine which isn't good when you

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
have this all apart saw was a great idea

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.290 
have this all apart saw was a great idea
to<00:06:07.810> check<00:06:08.470> the<00:06:08.740> movement<00:06:08.919> of<00:06:09.730> the<00:06:09.880> governor

heavier grass the air reduces pushes it

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.110 
heavier grass the air reduces pushes it

less then it causes it to rev up and

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.000 
less then it causes it to rev up and
