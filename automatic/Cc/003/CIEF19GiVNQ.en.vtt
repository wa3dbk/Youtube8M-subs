00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.030
 what can it do for 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.340
 in your opinion a key so vote 2 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.260

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:57.530
 adjustable and spanner August the flat 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:03.019
 of 10 then to loosen the chain 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:06.330
 that's all that you have a screw here and 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:10.439
 augusto has fangs here so you take 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:25.080
 your two keys from your old tube is 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:30.350
 here and here and exhale and the series then 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:38.390
 once this is done so you take 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:42.210
 your key of 10 and your tomb this 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.960
 job and all that down there like that 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.360
 then call back with you all novices 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.130
 so you'll see so how does the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.520
 chain and relaxed so for sure derby I 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.850
 believe it's a barge of 1 to 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.780
 3 cm 2 that there you see that there is a little 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.409
 more so for the or series you have 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.780
 a life 6 6 and 10 here and that's what will 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.770
 play so away from the road so for 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.569
 they are the chain so to play with 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.099
 the quarters of the chain that will have to 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:23.910
 tighten the screw here 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:28.140
 so you take a bug either 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.379
 exactly the same here it is possible and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.319
 here I should see me so a give 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:38.069
 that you come back here and you turn 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:41.489
 the ancient genius of a death his men I 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.010
 do the same you take two buttons of 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.150
 fast and you look so eric has so 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.330
 this is the point of view I think I 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:54.950
 want to be able to insert a small stove of 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:59.750
 more so I resume you mentioned 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.750
 a 15th at all 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.060
 and I look there so you see the 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.540
 chain the cuatro series because when 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.310
 so you go the right arbed the chain 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.080
 date and time in ashdod and when you 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.150
 will taste will follow even more 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.430
 tend so it could undermine so 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.970
 pity and so your ancient pilot 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.840
 box and maybe to break the chain 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.840
 so that I dug up a little 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.849
 and m 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:52.850
 or after 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.340
 chen according to you so be pretty 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.480
 stretched so all about between 1 and 3 cm 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.850
 you will take your sliding foot 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.190
 was not required because you 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.850
 have here have it would be if you 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.650
 see my nonsense lower body and with 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.650
 a little created here so to help 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.699
 the ruhr package is too much right too much to 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.400
 left and me so vxs not very accurate 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:26.590
 and I like precision even if it's not 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.030
 very mandatory on the if you do not have 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.639
 not a millimeter of the initials 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.639
 after that you will go alone 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.620
 take a lot of backstage dishes and 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:40.360
 you are going to take a davis 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.360
 do not tighten very convenient 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:06.090
 so as soon as you have taken the measure of 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.010
 the length of your life you go 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.580
 do the same on the other side to see 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:17.639
 if length is here you can see 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:19.590
 that those two bloggers so after 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.760
 it admits of voice and toys for 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:26.400
 the road be so that both 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.990
 of history same length for us 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:34.919
 guide clarous be too staggered then 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:38.850
 then as soon as all that is done 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.470
 you can take yours since the 22nd 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.630
 to tighten the screws and nuts and 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:49.370
 crowded the road to the visitors she stands 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.370
 to see a roll is only concrete 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.750
 ep 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.960
 and 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:15.169
 so here is then you take so 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:20.710
 and you make it a little rolled to see 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:24.409
 if your dog is so tense 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:27.050
 not so tense or three goals so there 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:31.000
 when you see the chain is too 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.000
 tense and I'm going there series 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:42.650
