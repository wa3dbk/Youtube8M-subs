 the song says something like that 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:52.480
 I was born in my neighbors when I spoke 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.040
 the rhythm is very basic would be 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.900
 the stanza and I grew up looking at the sky that 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.020
 would be where the chords 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.020

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.320
