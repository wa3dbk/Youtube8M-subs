towards<00:01:47.279> a<00:01:47.609> shoulder<00:01:48.029> slide<00:01:48.359> is<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.749> what<00:01:48.929> I

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
towards a shoulder slide is that what I

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.629 
towards a shoulder slide is that what I
want<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> do<00:01:49.349> yeah<00:01:49.799> pointing<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.429> down

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
slightly so that you get the curl to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.980 
slightly so that you get the curl to
turn<00:01:52.859> in<00:01:53.099> and<00:01:54.029> that<00:01:54.209> should<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.630> about<00:01:54.810> it

most<00:03:50.599> important<00:03:51.019> thing<00:03:51.140> is<00:03:51.290> how<00:03:51.530> do<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.739> brush

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
most important thing is how do you brush

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.250 
most important thing is how do you brush
that<00:03:52.159> out<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.549> always<00:03:52.849> prefer<00:03:53.480> it<00:03:53.750> when<00:03:53.930> people

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
that out I always prefer it when people

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.830 
that out I always prefer it when people
don't<00:03:54.500> use<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.250> brush<00:03:55.670> to<00:03:56.390> brush<00:03:56.420> this<00:03:56.780> through

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
don't use a brush to brush this through

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.710 
don't use a brush to brush this through
it's<00:03:57.439> better<00:03:57.680> if<00:03:58.069> you<00:03:58.220> use<00:03:58.549> just<00:03:59.090> your<00:03:59.299> fingers

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
it's better if you use just your fingers

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.630 
it's better if you use just your fingers
first<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.439> all<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.739> use<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.430> whole<00:04:01.609> thing

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
first of all to use the whole thing

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.839 
first of all to use the whole thing
together<00:04:05.680> what<00:04:06.680> we're<00:04:06.799> going<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:07.040> do<00:04:07.280> is<00:04:07.609> to

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
together what we're going to do is to

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.729 
together what we're going to do is to
just<00:04:08.090> put<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.420> serum<00:04:08.689> through<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.140> hair<00:04:09.319> so

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
just put the serum through the hair so

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.150 
just put the serum through the hair so
that<00:04:09.920> it's<00:04:10.250> really<00:04:10.849> nice<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.390> separated<00:04:15.160> what

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
that it's really nice and separated what

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.529 
that it's really nice and separated what
it<00:04:16.280> does<00:04:16.459> do<00:04:16.699> is<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:16.850> gives<00:04:17.120> it<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.329> nice<00:04:17.510> shine

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
it does do is it gives it a nice shine

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.469 
it does do is it gives it a nice shine
and<00:04:18.229> then<00:04:19.039> we<00:04:19.190> start<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.699> separate<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.359> out

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
and then we start to separate it out

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.620 
and then we start to separate it out
okay<00:04:21.169> but<00:04:21.919> then<00:04:22.160> you<00:04:22.550> can<00:04:22.729> do<00:04:22.910> this<00:04:23.150> you<00:04:23.570> can

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
okay but then you can do this you can

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.159 
okay but then you can do this you can
take<00:04:24.400> something<00:04:25.400> like<00:04:25.789> either<00:04:26.360> a<00:04:26.539> vent<00:04:26.870> brush
