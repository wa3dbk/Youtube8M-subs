00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
a vitality on it as you can see as well

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.849 
a vitality on it as you can see as well
which<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.720> another<00:02:36.720> desirable<00:02:37.319> stat<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.650> mean

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
which is another desirable stat I mean

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.789 
which is another desirable stat I mean
you're<00:02:38.010> probably<00:02:38.220> going<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.549> want<00:02:38.609> to<00:02:38.790> put

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
you're probably going to want to put

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.520 
you're probably going to want to put
vitality<00:02:40.799> in<00:02:40.980> your<00:02:41.160> original<00:02:41.819> search<00:02:42.030> as<00:02:42.359> well

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
vitality in your original search as well

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.020 
vitality in your original search as well
so<00:02:43.880> just<00:02:44.880> think<00:02:45.030> about<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.239> one<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:46.880> if<00:02:47.880> you

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
so just think about that one and if you

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.020 
so just think about that one and if you
can<00:02:48.180> also<00:02:48.329> find<00:02:48.690> or<00:02:49.109> put<00:02:49.859> in<00:02:50.010> max<00:02:50.489> discipline

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
can also find or put in max discipline

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.089 
can also find or put in max discipline
in<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.680> obviously<00:02:52.680> they're<00:02:52.859> going<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.040> be

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
in and obviously they're going to be

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.680 
in and obviously they're going to be
harder<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.400> find<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.910> without<00:02:54.030> gems<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.599> the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
harder to find it without gems in the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.520 
harder to find it without gems in the
sockets<00:02:55.079> but<00:02:55.349> they<00:02:56.069> sell<00:02:56.280> for<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.489> lot<00:02:56.519> more<00:02:57.530> so

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
sockets but they sell for a lot more so

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.160 
sockets but they sell for a lot more so
I'm<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:58.769> going<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:58.980> prove<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.519> or
