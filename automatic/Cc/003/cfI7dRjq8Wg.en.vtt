first two that I have are going to be
our<00:00:10.040> coated<00:00:10.940> and<00:00:11.150> treated<00:00:11.450> line<00:00:11.630> which<00:00:11.870> are

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
our coated and treated line which are

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.619 
our coated and treated line which are
the<00:00:12.920> premium<00:00:13.309> acoustic<00:00:13.849> guitar<00:00:14.120> strings<00:00:14.450> on

the premium acoustic guitar strings on

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.540 
the premium acoustic guitar strings on
the<00:00:14.719> market<00:00:15.080> I<00:00:15.259> will<00:00:16.010> start<00:00:16.189> with<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.369> licks

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
the market I will start with the licks

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.700 
the market I will start with the licks
er<00:00:16.670> first<00:00:16.880> they<00:00:17.510> actually<00:00:17.840> have<00:00:18.020> a<00:00:18.050> coating<00:00:18.560> on

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
er first they actually have a coating on

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.340 
er first they actually have a coating on
the<00:00:18.859> outside<00:00:18.890> of<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:19.550> string<00:00:19.900> so<00:00:20.900> basically<00:00:21.230> a

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
the outside of the string so basically a

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.460 
the outside of the string so basically a
wrap<00:00:21.619> over<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.310> bronze<00:00:23.080> material<00:00:24.080> of<00:00:24.380> the

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
wrap over the bronze material of the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.099 
wrap over the bronze material of the
string<00:00:24.740> which<00:00:25.369> helps<00:00:25.760> repel<00:00:26.210> you<00:00:26.810> know<00:00:26.900> dead

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
string which helps repel you know dead

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.279 
string which helps repel you know dead
skin<00:00:27.410> oil<00:00:27.859> dirt<00:00:28.369> help<00:00:29.300> fight<00:00:29.480> corrosion<00:00:30.109> and

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
skin oil dirt help fight corrosion and

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.120 
skin oil dirt help fight corrosion and
then<00:00:30.830> Martin<00:00:31.250> life-span<00:00:31.849> SP<00:00:32.750> is<00:00:32.930> their<00:00:33.920> take

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
then Martin life-span SP is their take

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.650 
then Martin life-span SP is their take
on<00:00:34.340> that<00:00:34.550> which<00:00:34.760> basically<00:00:35.030> is<00:00:35.210> a<00:00:35.240> treated

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
on that which basically is a treated

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.690 
on that which basically is a treated
string<00:00:35.960> so<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.920> difference<00:00:37.220> there<00:00:37.430> is<00:00:37.580> that

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
string so the difference there is that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.790 
string so the difference there is that
it<00:00:37.820> doesn't<00:00:38.030> have<00:00:38.200> anything<00:00:39.200> physically

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
it doesn't have anything physically

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.500 
it doesn't have anything physically
wrapped<00:00:40.040> over<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:40.460> string<00:00:40.760> as<00:00:41.090> a<00:00:41.210> treatment

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
wrapped over the string as a treatment

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.030 
wrapped over the string as a treatment
on<00:00:41.810> the<00:00:41.930> core<00:00:42.140> of<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.320> string<00:00:42.560> to<00:00:42.710> help<00:00:42.890> it

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
on the core of the string to help it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.730 
on the core of the string to help it
reject<00:00:43.630> different<00:00:44.630> oils<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:45.500> dead<00:00:45.620> skin

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
reject different oils and dead skin

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.130 
reject different oils and dead skin
things<00:00:46.220> like<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:46.580> we're<00:00:46.820> elixir<00:00:47.210> has<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.720> wrap

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
things like that we're elixir has a wrap

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.480 
things like that we're elixir has a wrap
over<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.530> string<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.310> biggest

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
over the string so the biggest

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.700 
over the string so the biggest
difference<00:00:49.970> in<00:00:50.090> my<00:00:50.120> opinion<00:00:50.600> there<00:00:50.810> is<00:00:50.990> that

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
difference in my opinion there is that

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.150 
difference in my opinion there is that
the<00:00:52.250> elixir<00:00:53.110> lasts<00:00:54.110> a<00:00:54.200> little<00:00:54.290> bit<00:00:54.410> longer<00:00:54.530> but

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
the elixir lasts a little bit longer but

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.220 
the elixir lasts a little bit longer but
it<00:00:55.430> doesn't<00:00:55.850> vibrate<00:00:56.060> as<00:00:56.420> freely<00:00:56.810> because<00:00:57.080> it

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
it doesn't vibrate as freely because it

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.350 
it doesn't vibrate as freely because it
has<00:00:57.380> the<00:00:57.770> wrap<00:00:58.610> on<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.910> outside<00:00:59.210> of<00:00:59.270> the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
has the wrap on the outside of the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.470 
has the wrap on the outside of the
string<00:00:59.630> where<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.620> SP<00:01:01.100> string<00:01:01.460> by<00:01:02.060> Martin

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
string where the SP string by Martin

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.110 
string where the SP string by Martin
definitely<00:01:03.260> sounds<00:01:03.950> better<00:01:04.190> because<00:01:04.970> it

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
definitely sounds better because it

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.330 
definitely sounds better because it
doesn't<00:01:05.390> have<00:01:05.510> anything<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:06.500> deaden<00:01:07.310> the

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
doesn't have anything to deaden the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.950 
doesn't have anything to deaden the
sound<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:07.850> string<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:08.390> sounds<00:01:08.690> fuller

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
sound of the string so it sounds fuller

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.460 
sound of the string so it sounds fuller
more<00:01:09.680> body<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.460> sound<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:12.080> just<00:01:12.350> an

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
more body to the sound and just an

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.080 
more body to the sound and just an
overall<00:01:12.620> better<00:01:13.100> quality<00:01:13.640> string<00:01:13.850> in<00:01:13.970> my

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
overall better quality string in my

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.940 
overall better quality string in my
opinion<00:01:14.510> because<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.080> SP<00:01:15.500> or<00:01:15.710> stage

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
opinion because the SP or stage

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.400 
opinion because the SP or stage
performance<00:01:16.520> line<00:01:16.730> by<00:01:16.940> Martin<00:01:17.330> has<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:18.110> better

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
performance line by Martin has a better

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.770 
performance line by Martin has a better
stronger<00:01:18.950> core<00:01:19.220> than<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.520> lick<00:01:19.700> sir<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.510> if<00:01:20.630> you

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
stronger core than a lick sir so if you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.600 
stronger core than a lick sir so if you
like<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.110> change<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.680> alternate<00:01:22.100> tunings<00:01:22.490> or

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
like to change to alternate tunings or

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.070 
like to change to alternate tunings or
drop<00:01:22.820> down<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.300> then<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.720> know<00:01:23.810> bring<00:01:23.990> it

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
drop down and then you know bring it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.600 
drop down and then you know bring it
back<00:01:24.230> up<00:01:24.260> to<00:01:24.500> pitch<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:24.950> standard<00:01:25.250> tuning

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
back up to pitch and standard tuning

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.640 
back up to pitch and standard tuning
this<00:01:26.270> string<00:01:26.540> is<00:01:26.660> definitely<00:01:27.320> going<00:01:27.440> to<00:01:27.470> last

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
this string is definitely going to last

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.740 
this string is definitely going to last
you<00:01:27.830> longer<00:01:28.100> because<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.090> stronger<00:01:29.420> core

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
you longer because of the stronger core

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.620 
you longer because of the stronger core
of<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:29.990> string<00:01:30.290> which<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.580> elixir<00:01:31.820> doesn't

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
of the string which the elixir doesn't

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.530 
of the string which the elixir doesn't
work<00:01:32.750> too<00:01:32.990> well<00:01:33.430> when<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:34.640> D<00:01:34.940> tune<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.390> and

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
work too well when you D tune it and

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.110 
work too well when you D tune it and
then<00:01:35.690> try<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.900> raise<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.590> pitch<00:01:36.710> back<00:01:36.950> up<00:01:37.220> in

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
then try to raise the pitch back up in

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.880 
then try to raise the pitch back up in
my<00:01:38.330> personal<00:01:38.630> experience<00:01:39.200> I've<00:01:39.320> definitely

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
my personal experience I've definitely

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.830 
my personal experience I've definitely
popped<00:01:40.130> quite<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.640> few<00:01:40.880> licks<00:01:41.150> or<00:01:41.330> strings<00:01:41.630> so

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
popped quite a few licks or strings so

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.050 
popped quite a few licks or strings so
they<00:01:41.960> break<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.230> little<00:01:42.620> bit<00:01:42.740> easier<00:01:43.220> in<00:01:43.460> my

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
they break a little bit easier in my

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.770 
they break a little bit easier in my
opinion<00:01:44.510> than<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.750> Martin<00:01:45.140> SP<00:01:45.620> lifespan<00:01:46.780> the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
opinion than the Martin SP lifespan the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.380 
opinion than the Martin SP lifespan the
difference<00:01:48.170> there<00:01:48.440> also<00:01:48.890> is<00:01:49.400> engaged<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.270> in

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
difference there also is engaged so in

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.360 
difference there also is engaged so in
every<00:01:50.750> acoustic<00:01:51.350> guitar<00:01:51.620> string<00:01:52.010> there's

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
every acoustic guitar string there's

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.760 
every acoustic guitar string there's
different<00:01:52.790> gauges<00:01:53.120> both<00:01:54.080> of<00:01:54.260> these<00:01:54.320> sets<00:01:54.590> I'm

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
different gauges both of these sets I'm

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.190 
different gauges both of these sets I'm
holding<00:01:55.159> are<00:01:55.340> medium<00:01:55.850> gauge<00:01:56.060> strings<00:01:56.450> or<00:01:56.690> 13

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
holding are medium gauge strings or 13

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.090 
holding are medium gauge strings or 13
through<00:01:57.440> 56<00:01:58.060> point<00:01:59.060> 13<00:01:59.420> through<00:01:59.659> 56<00:02:00.080> so<00:02:00.770> the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
through 56 point 13 through 56 so the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.160 
through 56 point 13 through 56 so the
thicker<00:02:01.370> string<00:02:02.090> is<00:02:02.299> going<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.810> be<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:02.960> lot

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
thicker string is going to be a lot

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.020 
thicker string is going to be a lot
harder<00:02:03.409> on<00:02:03.530> your<00:02:03.920> fingertips<00:02:04.400> when<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.790> press

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
harder on your fingertips when you press

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.270 
harder on your fingertips when you press
down<00:02:05.240> on<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:05.630> neck<00:02:05.840> but<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:06.920> gives<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:07.250> a

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
down on the neck but it gives you a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.419 
down on the neck but it gives you a
bigger<00:02:07.880> sound<00:02:08.679> which<00:02:09.679> sounds<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:10.160> lot<00:02:10.369> better

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
bigger sound which sounds a lot better

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.730 
bigger sound which sounds a lot better
in<00:02:10.819> my<00:02:10.850> opinion<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.390> fuller<00:02:11.690> guitar<00:02:12.110> body<00:02:12.350> sound

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
in my opinion a fuller guitar body sound

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.090 
in my opinion a fuller guitar body sound
the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.850 
the
it<00:02:13.190> if<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.300> don't<00:02:14.450> have<00:02:14.630> strong<00:02:15.050> fingers<00:02:15.680> or

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
it if you don't have strong fingers or

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.220 
it if you don't have strong fingers or
strong<00:02:16.100> hands<00:02:16.700> then<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.480> shouldn't<00:02:17.810> play<00:02:17.960> on

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
strong hands then you shouldn't play on

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.250 
strong hands then you shouldn't play on
a<00:02:18.470> very<00:02:18.800> thick<00:02:19.070> string<00:02:19.460> you<00:02:19.670> should<00:02:19.850> go<00:02:20.000> with

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
a very thick string you should go with

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.800 
a very thick string you should go with
something<00:02:21.260> like<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.800> light<00:02:22.790> gauge<00:02:23.060> which<00:02:23.660> is

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
something like a light gauge which is

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.320 
something like a light gauge which is
point<00:02:24.050> 12<00:02:24.290> through<00:02:24.500> 54<00:02:24.980> or<00:02:25.310> an<00:02:25.760> extra<00:02:26.150> light

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
point 12 through 54 or an extra light

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.430 
point 12 through 54 or an extra light
gauge<00:02:26.630> which<00:02:27.020> is<00:02:27.050> 0.2<00:02:27.800> through<00:02:28.490> 47<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.870> those

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
gauge which is 0.2 through 47 so those

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.380 
gauge which is 0.2 through 47 so those
strings<00:02:30.950> are<00:02:31.160> going<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.430> be<00:02:31.520> softer<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.360> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
strings are going to be softer to the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.540 
strings are going to be softer to the
touch<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:33.050> easier<00:02:33.500> for<00:02:33.590> beginners<00:02:33.950> or<00:02:34.430> if<00:02:34.490> you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
touch and easier for beginners or if you

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.250 
touch and easier for beginners or if you
just<00:02:34.580> don't<00:02:34.760> have<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.090> hand<00:02:35.300> strength<00:02:35.630> it'll

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
just don't have the hand strength it'll

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.570 
just don't have the hand strength it'll
be<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.380> lot<00:02:36.530> easier<00:02:36.890> on<00:02:36.950> your<00:02:37.220> your<00:02:37.610> hands<00:02:38.050> so

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
be a lot easier on your your hands so

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.920 
be a lot easier on your your hands so
you<00:02:40.580> also<00:02:40.730> have<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.000> custom<00:02:41.390> light<00:02:41.540> set<00:02:41.780> which

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
you also have a custom light set which

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.450 
you also have a custom light set which
is<00:02:42.080> in-between<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.710> extra<00:02:43.070> light<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
is in-between the extra light and the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.450 
is in-between the extra light and the
light<00:02:43.610> sets<00:02:43.910> point<00:02:44.300> 11<00:02:44.690> gauge<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:46.160> know<00:02:46.220> some

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
light sets point 11 gauge you know some

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.810 
light sets point 11 gauge you know some
people<00:02:46.580> do<00:02:46.850> prefer<00:02:46.880> those<00:02:47.360> as<00:02:47.540> well<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.820> to

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
people do prefer those as well so to

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.700 
people do prefer those as well so to
wrap<00:02:50.000> things<00:02:50.210> up<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.690> have<00:02:50.870> your<00:02:51.080> coated<00:02:51.500> and

wrap things up you have your coated and

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.630 
wrap things up you have your coated and
treated<00:02:52.220> strings<00:02:52.580> which<00:02:53.480> last<00:02:54.440> easily<00:02:55.310> two<00:02:55.520> to

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
Martin SP Martin Marquis di Dario there

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.800 
Martin SP Martin Marquis di Dario there
are<00:03:04.190> several<00:03:04.610> other<00:03:04.850> makers<00:03:05.210> on<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.450> internet

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
are several other makers on the internet

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.840 
are several other makers on the internet
but<00:03:06.320> if<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.560> doesn't<00:03:06.860> say<00:03:06.980> coated<00:03:07.370> or<00:03:07.490> treated

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
but if it doesn't say coated or treated

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.790 
but if it doesn't say coated or treated
then<00:03:08.360> it's<00:03:08.570> just<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.840> standard<00:03:09.200> string<00:03:09.590> the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
then it's just a standard string the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.010 
then it's just a standard string the
price<00:03:10.070> is<00:03:10.280> probably<00:03:10.670> half<00:03:11.210> of<00:03:11.540> what<00:03:11.900> you're

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
price is probably half of what you're

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.560 
price is probably half of what you're
going<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.200> pay<00:03:12.380> for<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:13.370> better<00:03:13.790> strings<00:03:14.210> but

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
going to pay for the better strings but

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.060 
going to pay for the better strings but
then<00:03:14.750> again<00:03:14.870> like<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.230> said<00:03:15.350> they<00:03:15.560> last<00:03:15.770> two<00:03:15.950> to

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
then again like I said they last two to

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.130 
then again like I said they last two to
three<00:03:16.220> times<00:03:16.370> longer<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.510> kind<00:03:17.990> of<00:03:18.020> get

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
three times longer so you kind of get

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.220 
three times longer so you kind of get
what<00:03:18.230> you<00:03:18.350> pay<00:03:18.560> for<00:03:18.590> in<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.730> category<00:03:20.230> also

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
what you pay for in that category also

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.480 
what you pay for in that category also
the<00:03:21.560> difference<00:03:21.890> between<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.220> couple

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
the difference between a couple

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.520 
the difference between a couple
different<00:03:22.880> sets<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.330> have<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.690> SP<00:03:24.170> which<00:03:24.410> is

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
different sets you have the SP which is

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.320 
different sets you have the SP which is
a<00:03:24.560> stage<00:03:24.830> performance<00:03:25.310> again<00:03:25.670> that's

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
a stage performance again that's

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.450 
a stage performance again that's
Martin's<00:03:26.870> stage<00:03:27.590> performance<00:03:28.070> line<00:03:28.250> with<00:03:28.430> a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
stronger chord a little bit longer

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.260 
stronger chord a little bit longer
lasting<00:03:30.530> than<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.130> basic<00:03:31.640> Martin<00:03:31.970> strings

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
lasting than the basic Martin strings

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.770

the<00:03:33.080> Martin<00:03:33.350> Marquis<00:03:33.770> strings<00:03:34.160> have<00:03:34.850> a<00:03:35.180> yarn
