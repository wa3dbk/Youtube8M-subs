00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
technique and that we are definitely

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.180 
technique and that we are definitely
getting<00:05:22.180> so<00:05:23.180> amazing<00:05:23.690> at<00:05:23.870> now<00:05:24.110> with<00:05:24.950> the<00:05:25.040> kind

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190

of<00:05:25.310> stuff<00:05:25.460> that<00:05:25.580> we've<00:05:25.730> done<00:05:25.910> whether<00:05:26.150> it's

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
of stuff that we've done whether it's

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.690
