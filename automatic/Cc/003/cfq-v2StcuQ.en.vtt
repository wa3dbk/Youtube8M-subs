00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
quite a launch to see so hopefully we'll

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.410 
quite a launch to see so hopefully we'll
get<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.579> now<00:00:36.000> you're<00:00:36.090> gonna<00:00:36.180> notice

the configuration of the basement it's

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.360 
the configuration of the basement it's
just<00:00:51.539> really<00:00:51.960> chilly<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.770> was<00:00:52.860> getting<00:00:52.980> hard

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
just really chilly and was getting hard

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.580 
just really chilly and was getting hard
to<00:00:53.520> concentrate<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.750> good<00:00:55.320> work

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
to concentrate and really do good work

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.959 
to concentrate and really do good work
down<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.010> while<00:00:56.190> i<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.399> freezing<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
down there while i was freezing all the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.369 
down there while i was freezing all the
time<00:00:57.149> i<00:00:57.180> put<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> little<00:00:57.600> space<00:00:57.899> heater<00:00:58.140> in

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
time i put a little space heater in

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.689

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
there nothing was really working so I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.430 
there nothing was really working so I
figure<00:01:00.000> when<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> got<00:01:00.300> back<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.780> would<00:01:01.170> take<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
figure when I got back I would take a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.170 
figure when I got back I would take a
little<00:01:01.739> bit<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.250> change<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> little

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
little bit of a change here a little

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.539 
little bit of a change here a little
change<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.660> pace<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.870> see<00:01:04.290> how<00:01:04.949> things<00:01:05.220> work

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
change of pace and see how things work

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.039

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
up here in the office I do a lot of my

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.510 
up here in the office I do a lot of my
product<00:01:07.470> testing<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.400> really

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
product testing up here so it's really

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.039 
product testing up here so it's really
convenient<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.270> me<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.630> kind<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> move

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
convenient for me just to kind of move

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.230 
convenient for me just to kind of move
things<00:01:10.350> over<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.490> everything<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
things over and get everything going the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.910 
things over and get everything going the
cool<00:01:12.420> thing<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.630> we've<00:01:12.869> got<00:01:12.900> our<00:01:13.140> gaming<00:01:13.409> pc

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
cool thing is we've got our gaming pc

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.740 
cool thing is we've got our gaming pc
right<00:01:14.670> over<00:01:14.880> there<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> corner<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.689> i

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
right over there in the corner so i

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.149 
right over there in the corner so i
could<00:01:15.900> probably<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.259> some<00:01:16.439> more<00:01:16.530> live<00:01:16.799> streams

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
could probably do some more live streams

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.640 
could probably do some more live streams
maybe<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> little<00:01:18.119> bit<00:01:18.450> more<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.930> gaming

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
maybe do a little bit more a gaming

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.320 
maybe do a little bit more a gaming
stuff<00:01:19.890> since<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.369> work<00:01:20.820> together<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
stuff since we all work together to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.999 
stuff since we all work together to
build<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.780> machine<00:01:21.990> i'm<00:01:22.530> going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.860> probably

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
build that machine i'm going to probably

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.950 
build that machine i'm going to probably
do<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.580> bit<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.970> retro<00:01:24.210> treatment<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.700 
do a little bit of a retro treatment to
it<00:01:25.080> though<00:01:25.170> i'm<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> move<00:01:25.560> those

didn't have anyone complaining about it

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.450 
didn't have anyone complaining about it
but<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:18.050> do<00:02:18.260> open<00:02:18.560> yourself<00:02:18.950> up<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.190> some

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
but you do open yourself up to some

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.920 
but you do open yourself up to some
liability<00:02:19.730> there<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.450> wanted<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.720> just

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
liability there and I wanted to just

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.690 
liability there and I wanted to just
kind<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.230> clear<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.650> decks<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.190> have<00:02:22.670> a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
kind of clear the decks and have a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.200 
kind of clear the decks and have a
pretty<00:02:23.210> brand<00:02:24.080> neutral<00:02:24.650> background<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.610> the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
pretty brand neutral background so the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.580 
pretty brand neutral background so the
Home<00:02:26.360> Office<00:02:26.510> might<00:02:26.900> work<00:02:27.110> better<00:02:27.320> for<00:02:27.560> that

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
Home Office might work better for that

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.680 
Home Office might work better for that
moving<00:02:28.430> forward<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.090> again<00:02:29.300> let<00:02:29.450> me<00:02:29.480> know<00:02:29.540> what

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
moving forward so again let me know what

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.730 
moving forward so again let me know what
you<00:02:29.780> think<00:02:29.930> it's<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.170> little<00:02:30.230> bit<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.500> change

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
you think it's a little bit of a change

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.890 
you think it's a little bit of a change
but<00:02:31.100> I'm<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.790> lot<00:02:32.060> more<00:02:32.120> comfortable<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.840> I

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
but I'm a lot more comfortable and I

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.150 
but I'm a lot more comfortable and I
think<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.140> might<00:02:33.290> be<00:02:33.320> able<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.560> do<00:02:33.770> much<00:02:33.980> better

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
think I might be able to do much better

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.750 
think I might be able to do much better
