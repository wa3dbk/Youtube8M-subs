00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
of shoes this color for a while they're

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.479

pretty<00:02:57.389> comfortable<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.139> have<00:02:58.889> to<00:02:59.010> say<00:02:59.129> my<00:02:59.310> feet

pretty comfortable I have to say my feet

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.699 
pretty comfortable I have to say my feet
did<00:02:59.700> hurt<00:03:00.120> at<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.389> end<00:03:00.719> of<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.079> day<00:03:01.230> like<00:03:01.530> my

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
did hurt at the end of the day like my

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.920 
did hurt at the end of the day like my
toast<00:03:02.010> kind<00:03:02.579> of<00:03:02.669> ached<00:03:02.849> but<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.450> wore<00:03:03.719> these<00:03:03.870> for

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
toast kind of ached but I wore these for

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.899 
toast kind of ached but I wore these for
about<00:03:04.139> nine<00:03:04.500> hours<00:03:04.530> without<00:03:05.219> breaking<00:03:05.370> them

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
about nine hours without breaking them

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.909 
about nine hours without breaking them
in<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:06.359> i<00:03:06.569> think<00:03:06.870> that's<00:03:07.200> due<00:03:07.469> to<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.799> fact

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
in so i think that's due to the fact

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.020 
in so i think that's due to the fact
that<00:03:08.069> i<00:03:08.219> didn't<00:03:08.400> really<00:03:08.519> break<00:03:08.730> them<00:03:08.909> in

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
that i didn't really break them in

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.339 
that i didn't really break them in
before<00:03:09.180> wearing<00:03:09.510> them<00:03:09.689> to<00:03:09.810> work<00:03:09.959> they

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
before wearing them to work they

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.929 
before wearing them to work they
actually<00:03:10.469> came<00:03:10.889> with<00:03:10.949> these<00:03:11.669> little

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
actually came with these little

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.259 
actually came with these little
replacement<00:03:12.870> bottoms<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:13.919> think<00:03:14.159> it's<00:03:14.310> if<00:03:14.579> this

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
replacement bottoms I think it's if this

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.420 
replacement bottoms I think it's if this
one<00:03:15.449> falls<00:03:15.719> out<00:03:15.989> or<00:03:16.260> something<00:03:16.650> happens<00:03:17.219> to<00:03:17.400> it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
one falls out or something happens to it

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.439 
one falls out or something happens to it
wears<00:03:17.730> out<00:03:17.909> there's<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.719> replacement<00:03:19.439> heel<00:03:20.449> pad

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
wears out there's a replacement heel pad

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:25.129 
wears out there's a replacement heel pad

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
he'll grip pad I don't know what you

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.080 
he'll grip pad I don't know what you
call<00:03:25.199> these<00:03:25.530> things<00:03:25.590> but<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.489> just<00:03:26.699> goes<00:03:26.879> right

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
call these things but it just goes right
