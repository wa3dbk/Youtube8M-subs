heelflip<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.900> believe<00:02:37.250> what<00:02:38.250> was<00:02:38.370> going

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
heelflip I believe what was going

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.590 
heelflip I believe what was going
through<00:02:38.790> your<00:02:38.820> head<00:02:39.030> at<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.300> point<00:02:39.510> because

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
through your head at that point because

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.120 
through your head at that point because

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
if you landed that there could have been

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.280 
if you landed that there could have been
the<00:02:41.250> possibility<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.790> was<00:02:42.000> like<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.510> know<00:02:42.570> man

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
the possibility that was like I know man

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.410 
the possibility that was like I know man
I<00:02:43.320> don't<00:02:43.530> like<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.490> only<00:02:44.670> mean<00:02:44.820> like<00:02:45.150> you

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
I don't like the only mean like you

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.060 
I don't like the only mean like you

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
could he might have pulled it up what

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.980 
could he might have pulled it up what
was<00:02:47.160> going<00:02:47.340> through<00:02:47.460> your<00:02:47.490> head<00:02:47.700> when<00:02:47.730> he<00:02:48.150> went

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
was going through your head when he went

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.530

to<00:02:49.170> pop<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.620> trick<00:02:49.920> um<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:51.000> was<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.180> very

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
to pop that trick um it was a very

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.330 
to pop that trick um it was a very
stressful<00:02:52.020> moment<00:02:52.680> probably<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.160> most

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
stressful moment probably the most

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.180 
stressful moment probably the most
stressful<00:02:53.610> moment<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.240> my<00:02:54.330> whole<00:02:54.360> life<00:02:54.540> um<00:02:55.190> I

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
stressful moment of my whole life um I

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.520 
stressful moment of my whole life um I
was<00:02:56.490> super<00:02:57.120> nervous<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.750> was<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.930> very<00:02:58.200> high

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
was super nervous it was a very high

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.840 
was super nervous it was a very high
chance<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:59.010> he<00:02:59.190> could<00:02:59.220> have<00:02:59.490> landed<00:02:59.610> that

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
chance that he could have landed that

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.060 
chance that he could have landed that
chick<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.180> he's<00:03:00.480> um<00:03:00.630> he's<00:03:00.810> amazing<00:03:01.590> at<00:03:01.710> him<00:03:01.890> and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
chick is he's um he's amazing at him and

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.700 
chick is he's um he's amazing at him and
I<00:03:03.000> guess<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.600> could<00:03:03.780> say<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.020> was<00:03:04.230> kind<00:03:04.650> of

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
I guess I could say I was kind of

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.950 
I guess I could say I was kind of
disappointed<00:03:04.770> in<00:03:05.550> myself<00:03:05.730> for<00:03:06.210> missing<00:03:06.690> my

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
disappointed in myself for missing my

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.870 
disappointed in myself for missing my
last<00:03:07.230> two<00:03:07.440> chicks<00:03:07.740> because<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.490> had<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
last two chicks because I had the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.190 
last two chicks because I had the
opportunity<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.510> land<00:03:09.810> one<00:03:09.960> of<00:03:10.080> those<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:12.200> get

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
opportunity to land one of those and get

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.930 
opportunity to land one of those and get
a<00:03:13.260> high<00:03:13.440> enough<00:03:13.470> score<00:03:13.710> to<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.520> point<00:03:14.790> where

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
a high enough score to the point where

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.000 
a high enough score to the point where
he<00:03:15.090> would<00:03:15.180> have<00:03:15.330> needed<00:03:15.680> probably<00:03:16.680> like

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
he would have needed probably like

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.110 
he would have needed probably like
almost<00:03:17.490> close<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.940> nine<00:03:18.410> instead<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.590> only<00:03:19.920> a

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
almost close to a nine instead of only a

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.020 
almost close to a nine instead of only a
