 Listen to this music. 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.639
 I was just a kid watching your program again and they are 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.700
 I can notice a few friends 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.080
 In regard to the Bible it seems like 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.640
 In you will know 3-4 times a week there are some antibiotics or kinda 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.430
 Ok and you know that everything is fine and amazing I knew I was not even Christian 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.010
 whatever 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.510
 You are also a master in a page of up to 50 getting in trouble 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.110
 The issue of freedom of expression yadda yadda yadda okay whatever 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.260
 Well anyway I just decided on Kieran type 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.800
 Yeah cr okay he did not get anything but 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.070
 Defend the car and Terry Jones to put Yai in jail for a course at 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.809
 This implementation press conference 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.160
 I am yes but the situation goes to jail 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.850
 The senator on the sticker on it is so big that I just wonder 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.920
 What is the main difference between a competent cross-bit 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.920
 Liberals I am their religious leaders in the garage Yeah let's start there 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.049
 Throwing the Bible you liberals idea is always very funny to me 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.580
 Louis We do not defend the Koran and I believe that the Koran and the Bible 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.799
 Both are documents that have collections that have been initialized 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:13.520
 intention 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.299
 I am not a part of any literal interpretation 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.369
 % Uh any of these I think the reason there is more emphasis on the Bible 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.200
 In the United States is that we have in the United States in particular when considering 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.799
 Most local terrorism can be right-wing non-Muslim tear 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.560
 Most laws seek to be implemented based on religious texts 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.650
 Based on the Bible not on the Qur'an we just happened to be in the United States up 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.060
 This is really a dock in the holy document 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.159
 Love over most attention when it comes to law deviations 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.200
 Yes it's just circumstantial if we're in Afghanistan to have a different story 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.700
 In your 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.329
 I personally knew I did not think there should be a Bible spoken about or the Torah 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.790
 I'm anywhere in the world, but down while it's just so it happens in this 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.450
 country
