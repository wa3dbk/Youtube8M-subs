00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone is david and 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.780
 today I showed how to play 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:14.549
 it's a doll so this music is 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.800
 plays in one two three chords then the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.140
 first chord is in limit in mid 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.430
 minor 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:26.240
 the second agreement it was a role in the 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.240
 third a body is done in bray 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:39.360
 for the rhythm of the first chord that 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:45.629
 done and not for the weary did not for 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:50.460
 lure it's two times low and we 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:54.960
 come back up there down and come back 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.530
 in mid minor until tomorrow so I 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.530
 shows you 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.850
 so that's not very complicated so 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.840
 I repeat to you at the technical level 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.840
 it's not 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.230
 so to train on the lgv but 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.230
 do not forget to block your bodies 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.940
 here 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.560
 so that's how it makes these chords 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.869
 no longer hassle on all the music 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.580
 so here is it's of opinion that you 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.820
 show how to play a doll 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.820
 meet again
