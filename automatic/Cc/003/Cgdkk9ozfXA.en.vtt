00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
section your hair because you want it to

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.520 
section your hair because you want it to
just<00:02:08.129> be<00:02:08.310> kind<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.729> random<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.929> kind<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.170> loose

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
just be kind of random and kind of loose

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.850 
just be kind of random and kind of loose
all<00:02:11.190> over<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.730> place<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.470> structure<00:02:13.470> curls

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
all over the place not structure curls

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.339 
all over the place not structure curls
you're<00:02:14.580> just<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.239> want<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.629> kind<00:02:16.290> of

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
you're just going to want to kind of

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.110 
you're just going to want to kind of
take<00:02:16.560> random<00:02:17.010> sections<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:19.580> like<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:20.879> pull

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
take random sections I like to just pull

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.509 
take random sections I like to just pull
it<00:02:21.239> on<00:02:21.330> my<00:02:21.480> hair<00:02:21.690> back<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.200> grab<00:02:22.980> kind<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.430> a

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.250 
it on my hair back and grab kind of a
sake<00:02:23.700> please<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.690> then<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.019> wrap<00:02:28.230> your

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
sake please and then you just wrap your

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.229 
sake please and then you just wrap your
barrel<00:02:28.769> around<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:32.459> just<00:02:32.640> wrap<00:02:32.910> your<00:02:32.940> hair

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.130 
around the barrel and hold it for
depending<00:02:35.849> on<00:02:35.940> how<00:02:36.090> quickly<00:02:36.360> your<00:02:36.660> hair<00:02:36.780> curls

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
but I'm going to wait until it dries or

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.360 
but I'm going to wait until it dries or

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
before I go and do it again so you don't

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:46.170 
before I go and do it again so you don't
want<00:03:12.750> too<00:03:12.930> big<00:03:13.079> of<00:03:13.200> sections<00:03:13.590> either

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.330 

okay<00:03:47.180> so<00:03:47.240> already<00:03:47.900> I<00:03:48.050> don't<00:03:48.350> pretty<00:03:49.010> much<00:03:49.130> have

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
one side done I like to do it this side

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.270 
one side done I like to do it this side
first<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.480> then<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:53.810> side<00:03:54.050> and<00:03:54.470> I<00:03:54.770> pull<00:03:55.040> all

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
back to the front so I just do it like

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.840 
back to the front so I just do it like
this<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.260> I<00:04:00.530> get<00:04:00.740> it<00:04:00.830> that<00:04:00.890> way<00:04:01.160> so<00:04:01.220> I<00:04:01.460> have<00:04:01.670> all

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850

my hair done on this side and just
pieces<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:05.060> think<00:04:05.300> get<00:04:05.720> curly<00:04:06.020> enough<00:04:06.370> now<00:04:07.370> i'm

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
pieces I think get curly enough now i'm

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.790 
pieces I think get curly enough now i'm
going<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.760> go<00:04:07.910> redo<00:04:10.330> and<00:04:11.330> that<00:04:12.260> only<00:04:12.410> took<00:04:12.620> me

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
going to go redo and that only took me

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.670 
going to go redo and that only took me
about<00:04:12.830> two<00:04:13.250> minutes<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.760> do<00:04:13.880> one<00:04:14.090> side<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:15.410> it's

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
about two minutes to do one side so it's

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:24.220 
about two minutes to do one side so it's
not<00:04:15.830> too<00:04:16.040> bad<00:04:16.160> at<00:04:16.340> all<00:04:22.720> and<00:04:23.720> if<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:23.900> get<00:04:23.990> her<00:04:24.110> to

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
not too bad at all and if you get her to

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.860 
not too bad at all and if you get her to
curly<00:04:24.680> like<00:04:25.340> if<00:04:25.580> you<00:04:25.910> think<00:04:26.150> this<00:04:26.300> is<00:04:26.480> too<00:04:26.630> Carl

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
curly like if you think this is too Carl

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.030 
curly like if you think this is too Carl
it<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.050> think<00:04:27.260> it<00:04:27.350> looks<00:04:27.500> fine<00:04:27.620> but<00:04:27.680> it<00:04:27.950> will

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
it I think it looks fine but it will

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.980 
it I think it looks fine but it will
definitely<00:04:28.160> fall<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.150> little<00:04:29.480> bit<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:29.840> all

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
definitely fall a little bit and all

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.460 
definitely fall a little bit and all
kind<00:04:30.410> of<00:04:30.820> go<00:04:31.820> together<00:04:32.000> well<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:32.900> now<00:04:33.380> I'm

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
kind of go together well and now I'm

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.050 
kind of go together well and now I'm
just<00:04:33.560> going<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.770> go<00:04:33.950> in<00:04:33.980> and<00:04:34.430> take<00:04:34.820> care<00:04:35.000> of

it doesn't fall before i'm done with the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.940 
it doesn't fall before i'm done with the
second<00:04:46.250> side<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:46.930> this<00:04:47.930> is<00:04:48.080> a<00:04:48.110> vedas<00:04:48.500> control

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
second side and this is a vedas control

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.570 
second side and this is a vedas control
force<00:04:49.930> hairspray<00:04:51.010> so<00:04:52.010> now<00:04:52.130> i'm<00:04:52.250> going<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.430> go

force hairspray so now i'm going to go

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.860 
force hairspray so now i'm going to go
ahead<00:04:52.610> and<00:04:52.940> do<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.180> other<00:04:53.210> side<00:04:53.540> and<00:04:53.750> then

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
ahead and do the other side and then

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.260 
ahead and do the other side and then
I'll<00:04:53.990> be<00:04:54.169> right<00:04:54.830> back<00:04:55.010> just<00:04:55.610> keep<00:04:55.910> in<00:04:56.030> mind<00:04:56.060> for

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
I'll be right back just keep in mind for

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.650 
I'll be right back just keep in mind for
the<00:04:56.450> other<00:04:56.570> side<00:04:56.870> you<00:04:57.740> might<00:04:57.919> have<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.660> the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
the other side you might have to the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.330 
the other side you might have to the
sections<00:05:00.080> up<00:05:00.200> top<00:05:00.380> if<00:05:00.590> you<00:05:00.710> have<00:05:00.800> layers<00:05:01.040> at

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
sections up top if you have layers at

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.880 
sections up top if you have layers at
least<00:05:01.520> they're<00:05:02.060> a<00:05:02.110> shorter<00:05:03.110> so<00:05:03.320> you're<00:05:03.530> not<00:05:03.680> it

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
least they're a shorter so you're not it

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.170 
least they're a shorter so you're not it
might<00:05:04.040> take<00:05:04.070> a<00:05:04.250> little<00:05:04.430> bit<00:05:04.520> longer<00:05:04.729> and

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
might take a little bit longer and

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.450 
might take a little bit longer and
you're<00:05:05.930> going<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.110> take<00:05:06.440> smaller<00:05:07.220> sections

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
you're going to take smaller sections

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.520 
you're going to take smaller sections
like<00:05:07.880> down<00:05:08.120> here<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.660> then<00:05:08.810> grab<00:05:09.020> these<00:05:09.260> one

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
like down here and then grab these one

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.170 
like down here and then grab these one
second<00:05:10.510> okay<00:05:11.510> so<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.690> finished<00:05:11.750> this<00:05:12.229> side<00:05:12.530> and

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
second okay so I finished this side and

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.409 
second okay so I finished this side and
it<00:05:14.180> only<00:05:14.540> took<00:05:14.810> me<00:05:14.870> about<00:05:15.020> like<00:05:15.820> five<00:05:16.820> minutes

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
it only took me about like five minutes

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.190 
it only took me about like five minutes
not<00:05:17.990> much<00:05:18.770> at<00:05:18.979> all<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:19.700> just<00:05:20.510> held<00:05:20.720> every<00:05:20.990> piece

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.870 
doesn't even feel like you have
hairspray<00:06:50.010> so<00:06:51.010> I'm<00:06:51.160> just<00:06:51.280> gonna<00:06:51.400> run<00:06:51.730> my

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
hairspray so I'm just gonna run my

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.870 
hairspray so I'm just gonna run my
fingers<00:06:53.070> through<00:06:54.070> my<00:06:54.130> hair<00:06:56.700> separate<00:06:57.700> the

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
fingers through my hair separate the

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.450 
fingers through my hair separate the
curls<00:06:58.060> and<00:06:58.360> just<00:06:58.510> loosen<00:06:58.960> it<00:06:59.080> up

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.290 

and<00:07:04.350> then<00:07:05.350> you're<00:07:05.590> good<00:07:05.800> to<00:07:05.830> go<00:07:06.039> so<00:07:06.610> every<00:07:07.270> time

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.300 
and then you're good to go so every time

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.610 
and then you're good to go so every time
I<00:07:07.509> do<00:07:07.630> this<00:07:07.720> it<00:07:07.870> kind<00:07:08.020> of<00:07:08.080> turns<00:07:08.289> out<00:07:08.380> a<00:07:08.410> little

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
I do this it kind of turns out a little

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.469 
I do this it kind of turns out a little
bit<00:07:08.770> different<00:07:09.190> it<00:07:09.460> just<00:07:09.789> depends<00:07:10.240> since

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 
bit different it just depends since

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.600 
bit different it just depends since
you're<00:07:10.780> not<00:07:10.900> sectioning<00:07:11.830> off<00:07:11.889> your<00:07:12.099> hair<00:07:12.310> kind

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
you're not sectioning off your hair kind

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.790 
you're not sectioning off your hair kind
of<00:07:12.669> turns<00:07:12.910> out<00:07:13.120> um<00:07:15.330> different<00:07:16.330> every<00:07:16.479> time<00:07:16.800> but

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 
of turns out um different every time but

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.760 
of turns out um different every time but
just<00:07:17.830> figure<00:07:18.190> out<00:07:18.250> how<00:07:18.720> long<00:07:19.720> it<00:07:20.199> works<00:07:20.530> to

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770 
just figure out how long it works to

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.439 
just figure out how long it works to
hold<00:07:20.949> for<00:07:21.220> your<00:07:21.370> hair<00:07:21.550> because<00:07:21.910> every<00:07:22.240> hair<00:07:22.389> is

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:22.449 
hold for your hair because every hair is

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:26.159

different<00:07:22.630> um<00:07:23.080> and<00:07:24.389> yeah<00:07:25.389> so<00:07:25.720> that's<00:07:25.930> it<00:07:26.080> I

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:26.169 
different um and yeah so that's it I

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:27.540
