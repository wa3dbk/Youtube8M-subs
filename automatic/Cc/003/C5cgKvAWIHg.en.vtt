00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:10.150
 'm here in oxford 80 and tava go there 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.730
 and I thought why not redo the 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.090
 video that I did many years ago 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.570
 on the subway which is undoubtedly one of the 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.580
 most watched tv videos and the post 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.550
 all the colts on the london subway 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:29.140
 are also among the most accessed and 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.439
 most commented and an old video is well 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.380
 explanatory talma is super dated 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.610
 several systems of the maximum of och and 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.280
 everything changed 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.899
 So since I 'm here and I'm going to 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.500
 direction to the subway again 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:47.940
 way was to record another to update 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.940
 everything is with brand new video 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.300
 anyone coming to london is 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.730
 to walk or to live to study is 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.100
 practically impossible not to go through 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.620
 least once in me here in the situation 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.590
 of what to do says it is one of the 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.980
 main london is not is not the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.250
 more complicated but it is undoubtedly 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.490
 of the busiest is always crowded 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.800
 and then I thought it was not appropriate 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.350
 do the subway video 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.610
 showing this station which is one of the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.610
 everybody likes 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.820
 here now you have to be super careful 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.660
 because you can not film inside the subway 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.479
 joÃ£o v cdm barra I'll pass you by here 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.740
 my shackles today have already 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:56.000
 loaded just pull over here and show 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:01.130
 my balance and I in one act still to the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.280
 feel the online of each here ladder 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.530
 to stand and decided to 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.619
 climb the ladder is stopped on the ladder 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.570
 always on the right side if you want to 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.360
 walking to be one more record is 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.420
 only one on the left side 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.530
 all seasons are super win 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.110
 analyzed 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.600
 all have boards have several maps of 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.310
 subway and there you will follow in the direction 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.840
 You're the one and you have to. 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.970
 pay attention 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.540
 What is the direction if you 're always going? 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.510
 so the first and last station 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.150
 you on each line because with the 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.459
 lines have their forks know then 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.220
 you have to pay attention to where 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.230
 You're going to make sure you're not going. 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.160
 get the wrong line and end up going pro 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.600
 wrong place 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.150
 something else that has to always lend 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.390
 attention is the direction you will get the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.310
 line I know you're going north-south 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.250
 east-west this more or less guide 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.200
 This is where you're going on the subway and 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.349
 with the right platform you have to 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.209
 take and motorhome on the arrival of the 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.130
 steering wheel was taken straight 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.000
 If anyone wants to come by, come here. 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.000
 that I did not find 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.660
 ettore debate the question this I am here 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.780
 our plunder and plunder from here to the region 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.489
 central and does not really make a difference 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.849
 with the line with the final station that 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.459
 I'm going to stop here in the middle and 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.140
 The subway then let run. 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.780
 wait for everyone to leave first, right? 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.349
 issue of education is not just the subway 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.019
 london and then just get experience 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.350
 place if it is not the time to react and 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.630
 courage 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.640
 I was full, you will not be able to 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.640
 The tap will be lucky, I got it. 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.290
 but then the subway is the same thing as it is 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.900
 always your west to the posts 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.920
 nothing annoys more london than one 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.340
 unsuspecting tourist looking to search 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.209
 I waited for the note on the face of the 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.040
 ticket gate 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.410
 You're going to take a few good nudges. 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.880
 happy educated are angry with fraram 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.500
 oster or else it's recharging ladies 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.130
 It's also super race can our 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.550
 here most coin acceptors 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.460
 It's notes or card, then you come here. 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.910
 You can choose what you wear in the 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.240
 specific ethics and discovers day or 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.370
 If you already have a monster, just lean 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.110
 here if you do not have a 'hostel' think 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:53.030
 even if you can is with nowadays 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.990
 If you can already buy the direct card 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.990
 any discount machine you want 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.020
 It's already jade if you want to buy 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.569
 I think that already with some passage 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.899
 included you can not choose 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:12.699
 if you want a boy it was money no 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:15.649
 cancel because I already have mine there 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:20.899
 already shows that when I have 

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:23.300
 that I can or are buy did not take away the 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:27.259
 cut or else I can go 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:31.729
 the specific value only touched the money 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:35.839
 it's notes or cards complete the transaction 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:39.889
 recharge and ready and that's it is easy and 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:42.709
 efficient is fast for me it's expensive but 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:49.610
 Do not need anything else to walk by. 

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:52.129
 London and I showed the subway is not a bug 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.839
 of seven heads any doubt can 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.839
 leave below corresponding 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.639
