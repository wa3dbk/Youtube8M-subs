 of the 72nd anniversary of the founding of 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.520
 the volunteer firemen of guatemala 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.920

 agazapa escuintla a man unloaded 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.150
 his weapon against a firefighter this 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.150
 institution 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.220
 the good humor and the desire to help 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.840
 the others are characteristics that 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.510
 they define german fernando sandoval 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.490
 Moreno who shared his 28 years 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.210
 almost half with the love of his life 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.210
 evelyn cifuentes we met a 22 of 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.660
 July 2001 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.280
 and we became engaged at 4 days on the 26th 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.690
 of July 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.310
 and from that they were 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.830
 12 years of sharing my life with him 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.290
 in 2005, Fernando graduated as a firefighter 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.810
 after seven years of courtship on the 26th 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.820
 April 2008 joined their lives after a 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.490
 trip to esquipulas next to his mother-in-law a 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.250
 news filled them with happiness we asked 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.720
 the same miracle the three of us believe that the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.300
 fifteen days I found out I was 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.880
 pregnant the truth is that it was a 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.930
 great blessing was the year and a half 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.930
 after we got married 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.020
 the truth is that it has been the best gift 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.189
 that left me from the truth 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.340
 because it's the photocopy of him like that was him 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:34.310
 how to see it and on October 2, 2010 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.310
 nation to om and tatiana sandoval cifuentes 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.549
 looking 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.930
 he was very loving very affectionate very 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.860
 Playful loved to lie on the floor 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.740
 play with her and as she exposed 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.180
 the truth that is well affectionate well 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.180
 at least two examples 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.890
 it was always characterized by a smile 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.280
 what 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.990
 impossible to erase the face no no 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.690
 I have words, I believe that my words 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.270
 they fall short to describe him 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.160
 as a person as a man it was even the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.989
 inspiration for her husband too 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.819
 decided to become a firefighter 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.030
 any accident of the ship with its 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.610
 first aid kit or he was walking with something and he worked and 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.890
 attend to patients and how 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.930
 obviously one can not attend to 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.519
 people without having the knowledge said 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.360
 I want to help you but I can not then 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.430
 I started to like it and that's where 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.730
 I got firefighters I think he was my 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.310
 true mentor 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.230
 I learned many things from firefighters 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.209
 the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.980
 since April of this year sandoval 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.510
 he worked as a paramedic and security 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.879
 industrial of a hydroelectric in 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.430
 escuintla every 11 days I returned to 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.090
 share three with your family that 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.650
 Sunday between 17 and 17 30 hours walked 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.049
 heading to the apartment he rented in 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.230
 wana gas lapa six bullets ripped him 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.230
 life 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.720
 That day I ask my mom who was going to 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.270
 be during the day and I said I 'm not going to 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.700
 stay here in the house resting up 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.290
 on Sunday 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.150
 but at noon I got the 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.910
 despair and I told the girl you know 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.239
 that we are going to mass we are going to dress 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.310
 of firemen already comes back uniform and 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.819
 two in the afternoon we left here because 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.219
 they know us transmetro 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.159
 we arrived at the cathedral had already started 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:42.950
 the mass because we are going a little late and 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:46.090
 I went straight to the chapel where is 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.810
 the lord of esquipulas 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.840
 but that was like inertia do not arrive 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.150
 directly with her 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.300
 and I said look at my love if you're here 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.530
 it is by a miracle that he is buying a 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.709
 candle 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.310
 and we put seal on it and I told him 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.310
 let's ask daddy god 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.230
 and I clearly remember when I said 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.800
 God dad we ask you always 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.000
 let us be united the three as a family 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.239
 taking photos we were for 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.579
 send them to him who saw her 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.240
 when my sister-in-law calls me and tells me that 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.240
 I had sent him 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.560
 at that time I did not know what to do 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.430
 I started screaming asking God 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.380
 that it was not true that it was not him 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.270
 fernando was a member of the tenth 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.490
 Volunteer fire company located 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.010
 in the capital zone 11 part of the group 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.340
 of spenders of the institution on 15 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.970
 August parading I played him the first 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.360
 feeling that I had was the saying no is not 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.940
 true no it can not be possible not what 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.390
 I really wanted to believe I did not want to believe 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.200
 because 24 hours before he had been 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.650
 turn at the station 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.480
 and with hope that it was not that 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.670
 they had stolen those papers late and 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.670
 that they had someone 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.990
 the 24 hours before I had seen him 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:21.680
 he had shared it 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.420
 and that 24 hours later I instead of 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.750
 see him walking smiling 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:31.770
 I 'll see it on a metal stretcher 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:34.340
 cold I knew he was there 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.660
 good 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.180
 for me and my brother-in-law was a hero 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.950
 true those heroes that sometimes are not 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.680
 recognized for what they do in that 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.230
 work that go to save the 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.430
 people without distinguishing race without 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:53.010
 distinguish 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.010
 what person is theirs 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:10.300
 I gave him the opportunity I would handle him 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.610
 and we sent it to be examined and 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.980
 approved and elevate what he liked most 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.200
 come to drive and the car was given 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.560
 with great confidence to him lately 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.020
 I wanted him to teach him to be a pilot 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.520
 machinist being a fireman was his dream of 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.440
 childhood like the one that infected his 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.440
 wife and from 5 months of age 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:33.070
 also to your little daughter there are moments 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.550
 I want nothing but just for 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:38.880
 she is that I 'm still fighting now 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.880
 why 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:44.650
 if there are times when I say already for 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.820
 what to live if my life went and part of 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.830
 my life 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:51.160
 now it is so easy to take life away from 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.260
 someone else without thinking about how good it is 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.110
 that person could have been me 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.990
 remember as a hero more than a hero 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.630
 He was my friend and more than a friend to 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.700
 I was my brother I remember it and I'm going to 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.870
 have five minutes 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.980
 in the people who did this damage 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:13.240
 remind them that we are not the 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:16.440
 justice justice comes from heaven the 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.440
 take the life of someone else 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:21.599
 any reason may have but the 

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:23.639
 only owner of our lives is God 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:26.990
 He was one more brother who left 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:32.080
 us that got us ahead 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:35.390
 a life without return and that God gives them 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.980
 mercy to them that what they did 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.830
 and that maybe there is a 

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:44.000
 repentance in their life because they have 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:48.550
 killed a being who served guatemala 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.550
 I have a slight hope that maybe 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.770
 and actions and act and that is not another 

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:56.439
 case you leave the files and you do not 

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.210
 I investigated on 12 August veil 

00:07:56.439 --> 00:08:00.340
 what was your company up to date 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.500
 next on board a motorcycle bomb was 

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.810
 moved to the cemetery his 

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:08.759
 I remember as a good friend element and 

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.759
 brother will never be forgotten
