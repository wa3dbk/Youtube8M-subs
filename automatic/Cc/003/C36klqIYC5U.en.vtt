XCOM enemy Unknown well these are two
very<00:00:29.910> different<00:00:30.599> games<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.170> let's<00:00:31.500> start<00:00:31.769> with

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
very different games so let's start with

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.060 
very different games so let's start with
the<00:00:31.980> basics

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.210 

the<00:00:37.070> bureau<00:00:37.460> XCOM<00:00:38.000> declassified<00:00:38.210> is<00:00:39.170> a

third-person cover based shooter while

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.350 
third-person cover based shooter while
XCOM<00:00:42.470> enemy<00:00:42.710> unknown<00:00:43.310> is<00:00:43.550> more<00:00:44.150> of<00:00:44.270> a

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
turn-based strategy game but while these

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.970 
turn-based strategy game but while these
two<00:00:47.570> games<00:00:47.810> have<00:00:48.020> very<00:00:48.260> different<00:00:48.620> play

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
two games have very different play

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.430 
two games have very different play
styles<00:00:49.550> they<00:00:49.730> still<00:00:50.060> share<00:00:50.330> a<00:00:50.390> lot<00:00:50.630> in<00:00:50.750> common

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
styles they still share a lot in common

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.510

death and dying and bleeding out those
systems<00:02:07.880> sort<00:02:08.119> of<00:02:08.209> work<00:02:08.450> in<00:02:08.600> much<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.810> same

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
systems sort of work in much the same

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.289 
systems sort of work in much the same
way<00:02:09.310> basically<00:02:10.310> when<00:02:10.549> your<00:02:10.640> characters<00:02:11.060> take

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
way basically when your characters take

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.759

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
too much damage they'll fall down

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.650 
too much damage they'll fall down
they'll<00:02:13.280> start<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.640> bleed<00:02:13.850> out<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.510> have

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
they'll start to bleed out and you have

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.600 
they'll start to bleed out and you have
a<00:02:14.690> certain<00:02:15.080> amount<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.500> time<00:02:15.799> to<00:02:15.830> resuscitate

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
a certain amount of time to resuscitate

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.460 
a certain amount of time to resuscitate
them<00:02:16.790> before<00:02:17.390> they're<00:02:17.540> gone<00:02:17.720> for<00:02:18.019> good
