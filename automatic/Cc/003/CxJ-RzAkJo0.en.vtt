 profile preceded 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.799

 Paste and the other side are the better sell yes that's a piece 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.130
 marketing what they use a bit more from that side but yes it actually has 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.009
 there is absolutely nothing to follow where there is a chance of course 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.420
 while on the event 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.540
 from that it is only a next year, however, it was on that 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.560
 always paid for it and that it may be later in the 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.570
 city ​​center is thinking with the Chinese experts or that there is a special role 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.130
 set up front button 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.540
 the hospitality industry has been able to prevent that 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.190
 do not think on the side there is a nice on 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.770
 yes and that is say it is do that without I of course you already in and 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.280
 we got there with a small school phone signal then got to friday 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.370
 easy to get 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.280
 but a true skater that she is actually quite rare yes that fletcher 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.570
 stipulates tips the microphone is yes and and ours with other good news 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.630
 he also sounds good yes a lateral fair in his one 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.450
 we have seen quite a bit of what he has seen here too in recent years and 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.430
 this is clearly really with you we have with us but the company 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.820
 the better the 20 percent say but even if you if you then and that amount was 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.009
 and she looks the most had wire as the head trainer of vitesse by the evening 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.129
 it is very good that this 24 makes the question yes 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.630
 but well we have had the benefits for it because it is about a 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.950
 pair a sharp edge of this product for example, that is to say it is 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.340
 Besides, May comes with it and liesbeth to roll 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.680
 and that is in fact the sound card 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.750
 so you have no option to connect to the andré lagasse 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.070
 stereo for a TV or whatever you can then only use for the PC 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.120
 m and now the sound card that is ma falls on itself does appreciate ball 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.270
 and second assure that wanting to meet you must also come to endure 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.550
 turn us around 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.240
 added after your stuff so then video enthusiasts love the findings 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.430
 completely internet is that jumping as a doctor is the brand when it comes to 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.760
 alternative audio and video yes 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.060
 after what is called this is the remix trustudio psv 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:16.249
 what it is exactly by purpose filters on the read on their website it is that 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.349
 I bailed a lot of marketing he brought all his techniques redirected 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.749
 has been introduced to make it sound better and what the smother must be beautiful 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.970
 sounding your logo should be better 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.529
 understood but can be 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:32.129
 yes and the principle and the anp finally the band of certificates from other side 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.329
 It is also clear that it was about having a premium party recently 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.549
 eriks is because there is told in thx trustudio pc product and that is here 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.839
 in between brains in the little information not so much pain advertising on the 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:48.779
 website of the jacks and then you can also read that they have it in the 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.500
 a pregnant collaboration is made in collaboration 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.600
 in the second set got 30 years and you know you have to tap into a different keg 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.679
 at the moment yes 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.449
 marecek is a whole world 4000 can actually also very people 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.289
 software has to 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:05.229
 years of sounding music and games in the misfortune that I am directly x files 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:07.560
 put on theater tour licensing all sound cards 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.050
 even today a lot of motherboard manufacturer you look how 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.039
 motherboards with 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:16.019
 another old shimano with the x files or just go for this headset 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.939
 they then deployable again for years but don't throw their own shop overboard and get it 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.519
 you then she makes the richly activate improvements yes because I also have one 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.019
 bit of a pity says that of course you depend on that when it 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.229
 maintenance is at sea can delay this I see you also a fine on the case 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.889
 is an example of that muscle fast book from van dell 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.919
 it is also there that you have lost a piece according to the fact that it is due to it 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.949
 using such an i'm your own afterwards set off according to 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.579
 Porsche agree yes 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.959
 yes I come to the last point of barcelona and say something 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.439
 I am lucky that I will leave ribéry slowroll than with the other 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.069
 properties totally took over in this sector with writing invoices after the consequences 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.389
 for a short time it may not have been free, and that means 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:56.109
 city 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.160
 that competition also everything except buyers on average 105 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.780
 70 euros he hopes half a year and when you get home when you look at what costs 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.760
 Normally I have shared space marine in one of the headsets that we always have here 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.629
 best of seven the best choice festival tell a disguised family that headset 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.909
 that I think that I am fine a little less than this that must be said that is 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.840
 good to see and not everything from 35 euros yes it is a pond and 175 sewers 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.099
 is quite a bit in between 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.499
 and to say that for that money you also see that you are finished 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:27.259
 tricky with the plastic keeper that looks good at the office always the familiar 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.150
 japan the japanese middle class best bend plastics 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.880
 for that money it could all have been a little nicer and a little better finished 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.490
 The money you pick up is the money 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.580
 meters from each other yes that is or is often patronage if you 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.910
 if everything has to be headed for use, then you have a microphone again a bit one 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:44.930
 bulky 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.999
 not entirely wrong but it sounds good 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:51.319
 they are this toy but for 150 euros you can really buy headsets 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.319
 or wired that sound much better 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.339
 the advantage but the built-in and these lists where everyone for themselves one 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:02.650
 I had not had the chance I would have preferred the choice 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.699
 However, that did not have a forum but not made of silk wall street at noon 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.839
 tonight we have another broadcast 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:14.289
 but in the end we have the four days and especially through the speaker of 8
