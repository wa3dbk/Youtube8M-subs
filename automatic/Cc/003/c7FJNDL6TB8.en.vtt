 I already have my channel back 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.950
 good many of you will ask 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.570
 why did they shut my channel and if you 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.950
 you continue on my social networks you will see 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.140
 that I told them that they suspended me 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.670
 account and I did not tell you because what happened 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.500
 was that in three of my videos happens 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.330
 music that did not belong to me and that in 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.070
 Youtube is not allowed, you can not use 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.989
 music that does not belong to you 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.610
 then they delete my videos and I 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.680
 they closed my channel I the truth is 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.360
 super sad I did not know it was going to be that

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.130
 how much do you spend here the father of this is 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.720
 that you dedicate time to the person 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.940
 that you want your friends to your family to 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.979
 your boyfriend and if you do not have a boyfriend, 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.009
 worry you do not need to have a boyfriend to 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.140

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.740
 I had to teach them to me 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.030

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.229

 video that as I tell you this is very very 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.460
 easy and very father this idea to me 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.620
 loved it to me if someone gives me something 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.930
 A) Yes 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.000
 I get married if you do not know what to give to 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.130
 your boyfriend to your friend your mom your dad your 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.230
 grandparents to anyone to whom 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.430
 you that add something but you do not know that 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.920
 to watch this video because this one is already 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.750
 very beautiful is very easy is original 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.730
 it's super good so they can put it 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.370
 in your room in the kitchen wherever 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.840
 that I have is for any place and you 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.880
 I promise that the person who gives it to you 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.940
 is going to be delighted 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.830
 also but let's start the only thing 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.010
 what you need is paper illustration or 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.020
 cardboard one compass scissors pencil one color 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.000
 white paint for x pistol 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.000
 silicone tweezers and the photos you want 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.200
 you're going to start tracing the circumference 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.640
 in a circle does not have an exact measurement 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.720
 the truth just has to be a circle 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.720
 big like this size 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.800
 and now with the scissors you are going to cut it 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.800
 very well 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.880
 and now with the painting of I have painted 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.480
 before pasting the tweezers we are going to 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.130
 accommodate the around try that all 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.720
 be straight and then with the 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.880
 silicon gun we are going to stick 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.500
 the tweezers but the other way around I do not know 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.030
 I explained but the part where the clamp 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.730
 subject the photo has to be by 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.470
 outside and to hang it I stuck a 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.470
 piece of rope with silicon and ready 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.049
 and now it only fits the photos 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.060
 and already to finish in the middle part 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.340
 You can write whatever you want 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.710
 phrase a drawing I prefer to write in 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.980
 the bio but you can put it what you 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.980
 want 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.090
 and well that was all for the video and what 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.560

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.419
