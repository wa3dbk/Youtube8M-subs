around<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.580> whole<00:01:05.790> thing<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.950> there<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.100> go

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
around the whole thing and there we go

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
around the whole thing and there we go
you<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.960> then<00:01:09.960> come

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you can just have it like that then come

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.620 
you can just have it like that then come
back<00:01:10.710> down<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> end<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.970> put<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
back down here to the end and put a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.359 
back down here to the end and put a
piece<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.020> redstone<00:01:13.170> wire<00:01:13.470> there<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.950> put

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
piece of redstone wire there and put

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.870 
piece of redstone wire there and put
three<00:01:14.760> reviews<00:01:15.799> with<00:01:16.799> all<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> max<00:01:17.670> speed

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
three reviews with all at the max speed

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.289 
three reviews with all at the max speed
and<00:01:18.860> then<00:01:19.860> there<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.250> definitely<00:01:20.939> other<00:01:21.090> ways

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
and then there is definitely other ways

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.969 
and then there is definitely other ways
to<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.110> find<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.650> easiest

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to do this but I find this the easiest

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.219 
to do this but I find this the easiest
way<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.280> we're<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.420> way<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
way so we're going to do it this way and

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.380 
way so we're going to do it this way and
then<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.340> want<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.549> make<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.880> staircase

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
then you want to make a little staircase

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.710 
then you want to make a little staircase
going<00:01:27.900> up

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
going up

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.370 
going up
doesn't<00:01:30.720> matter<00:01:30.810> how<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.049> make<00:01:31.259> your

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
doesn't matter how you make your

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.530 
doesn't matter how you make your
staircase<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:32.100> was<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.930> making<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.140> then<00:01:35.100> go

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
staircase I was just making one then go

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.710 
staircase I was just making one then go
ups<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:38.670> was<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> fail<00:01:39.060> that's<00:01:39.479> what<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
ups that was a fail that's what you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.390 
ups that was a fail that's what you
don't<00:01:39.869> want<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.079> put<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.439> TNT<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.220> too

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
don't want to put your TNT in there too

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.010 
don't want to put your TNT in there too
early<00:01:41.700> because<00:01:41.850> say<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.420> fail<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
early because say you fail like that

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.649 
early because say you fail like that
then<00:01:43.799> oh<00:01:43.979> my<00:01:44.159> god<00:01:44.399> my<00:01:44.610> controls<00:01:44.970> mess<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.390> all

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
then oh my god my controls mess up all

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.139 
then oh my god my controls mess up all
the<00:01:45.990> time<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.759> there<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:47.850> go

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the time like this there we go

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.080 
the time like this there we go
then<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.960> wire<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.200> back<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.159> top<00:01:50.759> and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
then just wire it back up on top and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.330 
then just wire it back up on top and
then<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.350> at<00:01:52.530> any<00:01:52.710> height<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
then you can have it at any height the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.469 
then you can have it at any height the
higher<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.950> more<00:01:55.950> speed<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.640> will<00:01:56.759> no<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
higher the more speed it will no the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.870 
higher the more speed it will no the
shorter<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.320> will<00:01:58.409> go<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.490> want<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.790> go

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
shorter it will go so if you want to go

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.450 
shorter it will go so if you want to go
kind<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.329> farther<00:02:00.570> put<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.140> low<00:02:01.259> down<00:02:01.460> then

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
kind of farther put it low down then

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.039 
kind of farther put it low down then
what<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.729> want<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.210> put<00:02:03.390> TNT<00:02:03.780> all

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
what you want to do is just put TNT all

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.679 
what you want to do is just put TNT all
in<00:02:04.619> here<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.700> leave<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.119> water<00:02:06.360> source

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
in here and but leave the water source

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.979 
in here and but leave the water source
at<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> top<00:02:07.489> then<00:02:08.489> go<00:02:09.000> over<00:02:09.270> here<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.599> put<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
at the top then go over here and put a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.380 
at the top then go over here and put a
lever<00:02:10.430> then<00:02:11.430> blamo

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
lever then blamo

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.630 
lever then blamo
and<00:02:12.570> then<00:02:13.380> see<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.680> will<00:02:13.770> drop<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.160> TNT

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and then see it will drop that TNT

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.160 
and then see it will drop that TNT
launch<00:02:15.480> that's<00:02:15.810> auntie<00:02:16.430> boom<00:02:17.810> awesome<00:02:18.810> weapon

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
launch that's auntie boom awesome weapon

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.170 
launch that's auntie boom awesome weapon
and<00:02:19.380> doesn't<00:02:20.190> require<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.550> lot<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.790> time<00:02:20.970> just

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
and doesn't require a lot of time just

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.170 
and doesn't require a lot of time just
kind<00:02:21.270> require<00:02:21.900> some<00:02:22.140> water<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.680> some<00:02:23.250> TNT<00:02:23.580> so

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
kind require some water and some TNT so

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.420 
kind require some water and some TNT so
yeah<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.960> do<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.350> with<00:02:25.530> less<00:02:25.950> pieces<00:02:26.190> of

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
yeah you can do this with less pieces of

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.970 
yeah you can do this with less pieces of
TNT<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.110> you're<00:02:28.110> otherwise<00:02:28.440> going<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:28.800> get<00:02:28.890> it

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
TNT but you're otherwise going to get it

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.490 
TNT but you're otherwise going to get it
not<00:02:29.130> going<00:02:29.430> for<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.670> also<00:02:30.140> yeah<00:02:31.140> that's<00:02:31.350> how<00:02:31.440> to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
not going for it also yeah that's how to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.310 
not going for it also yeah that's how to
make<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.680> customisable<00:02:32.600> tnt<00:02:33.600> cannon<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.110> if

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
make a customisable tnt cannon and if

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.100 
make a customisable tnt cannon and if
you<00:02:34.470> do<00:02:34.620> want<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.950> go<00:02:35.330> shorter<00:02:36.330> than<00:02:36.840> just

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
you do want it to go shorter than just

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.150 
you do want it to go shorter than just
shorten<00:02:37.440> these<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:39.209> yeah<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.020> if<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.130> want

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.770 
shorten these on so yeah and if you want
you<00:02:41.520> can<00:02:41.610> even<00:02:41.760> add<00:02:41.910> more<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.510> will<00:02:42.600> take

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
you can even add more and it will take

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.680 
you can even add more and it will take
more<00:02:43.140> long<00:02:43.320> time<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:44.160> blow<00:02:44.520> up<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.940> everything

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
more long time to blow up and everything

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.300 
more long time to blow up and everything
so<00:02:45.900> if<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:46.110> guys<00:02:46.200> want<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.590> do<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.040> can

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
but sometimes you can't actually have

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.070 
but sometimes you can't actually have
that<00:02:50.790> many<00:02:51.000> repeaters<00:02:51.510> or<00:02:51.630> otherwise<00:02:51.900> it

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
that many repeaters or otherwise it

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.010 
that many repeaters or otherwise it
doesn't<00:02:52.230> work<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.130> sometimes<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:54.780> would

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
doesn't work so sometimes it would

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.979 
doesn't work so sometimes it would
launch<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.310> then<00:02:56.790> yeah<00:02:57.510> see<00:02:57.720> it's<00:02:57.870> just
