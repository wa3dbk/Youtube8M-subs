the beginning stats with the ability to
tie<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.060> good<00:00:06.299> knot<00:00:06.359> because<00:00:06.899> if<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.200> can't<00:00:07.470> tie

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.350 
tie a good knot because if you can't tie
good<00:00:08.040> night<00:00:08.250> pretty<00:00:08.730> much<00:00:08.790> you're<00:00:09.059> beaten

good night pretty much you're beaten
before<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:09.780> started<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.380> for<00:00:11.010> me<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.490> the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
before you started and for me the the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.089 
before you started and for me the the
main<00:00:11.940> not<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.360> my<00:00:12.480> repertoire<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.620> Uni<00:00:13.950> not

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
main not in my repertoire is the Uni not

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.760 
main not in my repertoire is the Uni not
and<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.580> call<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> uni<00:00:15.360> knot<00:00:15.480> system<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.320> call

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
and I call it the uni knot system I call

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.140 
and I call it the uni knot system I call
it<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.920> system<00:00:17.250> because<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.609> can<00:00:17.760> use<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> knot

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
it a system because you can use a knot

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.609 
it a system because you can use a knot
for<00:00:18.359> tying<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.720> hooks<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.109> swivels<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
for tying on hooks and swivels in the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.439 
for tying on hooks and swivels in the
traditional<00:00:20.100> method<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:20.970> also<00:00:21.119> use<00:00:21.420> it

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
traditional method you can also use it

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.390 
traditional method you can also use it
for<00:00:21.720> joining<00:00:22.199> two<00:00:22.439> lines<00:00:22.680> together<00:00:22.949> whether

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
for joining two lines together whether

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.790 
for joining two lines together whether
it's<00:00:23.609> monofilament<00:00:24.359> flora<00:00:24.960> cabin<00:00:25.410> or<00:00:25.560> even

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
it's monofilament flora cabin or even

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.740 
it's monofilament flora cabin or even
braid<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.730> very<00:00:26.760> versatile<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.720> can

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
braid so it's a very versatile you can

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.660 
braid so it's a very versatile you can
also<00:00:27.990> use<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.380> as<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> not<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.920> Snell<00:00:29.189> hooks<00:00:29.490> onto

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
also use it as a not to Snell hooks onto

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.490 
also use it as a not to Snell hooks onto
line<00:00:29.970> when<00:00:30.179> you're<00:00:30.300> using<00:00:30.449> bigger<00:00:30.750> hooks<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
line when you're using bigger hooks and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.359 
line when you're using bigger hooks and
what<00:00:31.619> I'm<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.099> I'm<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.279> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.220 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.579> those<00:00:32.790> three<00:00:33.000> techniques<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:33.690> so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
show you those three techniques now so

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.650 
show you those three techniques now so
to<00:00:34.290> tie<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.559> uni<00:00:35.010> knot<00:00:35.130> onto<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.579> hook<00:00:35.910> you

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
to tie the uni knot onto a hook you

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.470 
to tie the uni knot onto a hook you
basically<00:00:36.870> get<00:00:37.440> your<00:00:37.680> hook<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.100> run<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.210> line

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
basically get your hook and run the line

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.930 
basically get your hook and run the line
through<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> eye<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.800> hook<00:00:41.040> give

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
through the eye of the hook give

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.330 
through the eye of the hook give
yourself<00:00:42.270> plenty<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.750> tag<00:00:43.140> because<00:00:44.129> this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
yourself plenty of tag because this

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.160 
yourself plenty of tag because this
allows<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.719> tie<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.930> knot

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
allows it to make you tie the knot

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.270 
allows it to make you tie the knot
easily<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.239> fold<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> around<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.280> double

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
easily and fold it around and double

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.270 
easily and fold it around and double
your<00:00:50.399> line<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.820> take<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:51.719> tag<00:00:51.930> end<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.410> wrap

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
your line and take your tag end and wrap

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.459 
your line and take your tag end and wrap
it<00:00:53.690> three<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> five<00:00:55.020> times<00:00:57.020> away<00:00:58.020> from<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
it three to five times away from the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.590 
it three to five times away from the
hook<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.460> always<00:00:59.789> wait<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.270> your<00:01:00.390> knots

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
hook now you always wait to your knots

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.930 
hook now you always wait to your knots
use<00:01:01.469> water<00:01:01.800> saliva<00:01:02.250> whatever<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.760> want

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
use water saliva whatever you want

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.750 
use water saliva whatever you want
before<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.780> tighten<00:01:04.080> them<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.500> tighten<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.640> up

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
before you tighten them up tighten it up

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.289 
before you tighten them up tighten it up
but<00:01:06.060> not<00:01:06.150> fully<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.799> then<00:01:08.280> snug<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.119> with

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but not fully and then snug it up with

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.080 
but not fully and then snug it up with
your<00:01:09.420> fingers<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.740> slowly<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.909> mean

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
your fingers and then slowly and I mean

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.179 
your fingers and then slowly and I mean
slowly<00:01:12.420> slide<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> down<00:01:13.439> onto<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> eye<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
slowly slide it down onto the eye of the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.920 
slowly slide it down onto the eye of the
hook<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.850> reason<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.720> that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
hook the reason you do this is so that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.749 
hook the reason you do this is so that
friction<00:01:16.439> doesn't<00:01:16.740> burn<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.220> damage<00:01:17.580> your

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
friction doesn't burn or damage your

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.740 
friction doesn't burn or damage your
line<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.240> happen<00:01:18.420> very<00:01:18.630> easily

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
line and it can happen very easily

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.359 
line and it can happen very easily
especially<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> pull<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.100> really

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
especially if you pull you not really

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.850 
especially if you pull you not really
quickly<00:01:20.729> now<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.570> knots<00:01:21.780> tied<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.740> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
quickly now that knots tied and all you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.280 
quickly now that knots tied and all you
need<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.100> do<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.549> trim<00:01:23.939> your<00:01:24.060> tag<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
need to do now is trim your tag in and a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.840 
need to do now is trim your tag in and a
question<00:01:25.770> that's<00:01:25.920> often<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.460> how<00:01:26.580> far

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
question that's often that is how far

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.550 
question that's often that is how far
should<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.119> trim<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.509> tag<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.350> like

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to do it so it's neat and tidy you could

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.640 
to do it so it's neat and tidy you could
leave<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:30.840> I'm<00:01:31.020> sure<00:01:31.259> you'd<00:01:31.409> still

will<00:01:36.810> not<00:01:37.079> slip<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.430> not<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.759> any

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.910 
will not slip so it's not going any
further<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.049> trim<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.710> close

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
further so you can trim it really close

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
hook same way that you tie a uni knot

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.880 
hook same way that you tie a uni knot
any<00:02:20.760> other<00:02:20.970> way<00:02:21.740> except<00:02:22.740> you're

any other way except you're

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.490 
any other way except you're
incorporating<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.580> shank<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> hook<00:02:24.500> one

incorporating the shank of the hook one
of<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.680> benefits<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.550> can<00:02:26.700> tie

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
of the benefits of that is you can tie

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.240 
of the benefits of that is you can tie
with<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.180> not<00:02:27.390> anytime<00:02:27.680> pull<00:02:28.680> your<00:02:29.010> tag

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
with this not anytime pull your tag

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.390 
with this not anytime pull your tag
carefully<00:02:32.209> wet<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.360> again<00:02:34.130> get<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.220> nice<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
carefully wet it again get it nice and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.510 
carefully wet it again get it nice and
tight<00:02:35.690> there<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.720> have<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.230> uni<00:02:38.010> knot<00:02:38.130> Snell

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
tight there you have the uni knot Snell

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.570 
tight there you have the uni knot Snell
on<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.330> shank<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.750> hook<00:02:40.070> trim<00:02:41.070> your<00:02:41.100> tag<00:02:41.370> end

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
on the shank of a hook trim your tag end

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.479 
on the shank of a hook trim your tag end
again<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.060> away<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.300> go<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:46.739> join<00:02:46.980> two<00:02:47.250> lines

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
again and away you go to join two lines

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.120 
again and away you go to join two lines
together<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:48.150> use<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.080> double<00:02:49.470> uni<00:02:49.770> knot<00:02:49.890> and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
together I use the double uni knot and

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.130 
together I use the double uni knot and
it's<00:02:50.520> very<00:02:50.730> simple<00:02:50.940> knot<00:02:51.150> again<00:02:51.270> is<00:02:51.570> exactly

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
it's very simple knot again is exactly

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.050 
it's very simple knot again is exactly
the<00:02:52.320> same<00:02:52.470> as<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.680> other<00:02:53.040> one<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:53.820> very

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
the same as the other one but it's very

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.420 
the same as the other one but it's very
useful<00:02:54.300> for<00:02:54.540> tying<00:02:55.380> through<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.860> cabin<00:02:56.280> to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
useful for tying through a cabin to

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.850 
useful for tying through a cabin to
bribe<00:02:56.670> when<00:02:57.300> I'm<00:02:57.420> tying<00:02:57.870> braid<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.470> it's<00:02:58.620> very

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
bribe when I'm tying braid and it's very

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.410 
bribe when I'm tying braid and it's very
thin<00:02:59.100> braid<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.310> usually<00:02:59.700> double<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.360> to

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
thin braid I usually double it just to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.729 
thin braid I usually double it just to
give<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.660> little<00:03:00.959> bit<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.170> extra<00:03:01.500> thickness

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
give you a little bit of extra thickness

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.160 
give you a little bit of extra thickness
but<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.520> also<00:03:02.640> use<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.180> with<00:03:03.209> lines<00:03:03.959> of

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
but you can also use it with lines of

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.260 
but you can also use it with lines of
uneven<00:03:04.709> diameter<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.489> can<00:03:05.610> have<00:03:05.730> 50<00:03:06.030> pound

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
uneven diameter so you can have 50 pound

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.020 
uneven diameter so you can have 50 pound
and<00:03:06.510> 20<00:03:06.780> pound<00:03:07.020> mono<00:03:07.350> or<00:03:07.709> fluorocarbon<00:03:08.280> it's

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
and 20 pound mono or fluorocarbon it's

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.550 
and 20 pound mono or fluorocarbon it's
also<00:03:09.180> pretty<00:03:09.450> handy<00:03:09.840> for<00:03:09.989> surf<00:03:10.140> casting

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
also pretty handy for surf casting

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.500 
also pretty handy for surf casting
leaders<00:03:10.860> or<00:03:11.190> even<00:03:11.459> just<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.730> join<00:03:12.000> two<00:03:12.270> lines

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.970 
leaders or even just to join two lines
together<00:03:12.780> if<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.140> get<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> break<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:13.800> need

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
together if you get a break and you need

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.910 
together if you get a break and you need
to<00:03:14.130> tie<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> knot<00:03:14.910> on<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:16.140> joining<00:03:16.410> two<00:03:16.709> lines

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
to tie a knot on it so joining two lines

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.500 
to tie a knot on it so joining two lines
together<00:03:17.160> predominantly<00:03:17.850> these<00:03:18.060> days<00:03:18.299> we're

using<00:03:18.690> braid<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.769> fluorocarbon<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.209> what

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
using braid and fluorocarbon so what

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.990 
using braid and fluorocarbon so what
I've<00:03:21.420> got<00:03:21.600> here<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:22.049> my<00:03:22.799> fluorocarbon<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.940> my

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
I've got here is my fluorocarbon and my

do<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.830> lay<00:03:32.010> your<00:03:32.519> braid<00:03:32.820> alongside<00:03:33.209> your

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
do is you lay your braid alongside your

do is you lay your braid alongside your
fluorocarbon<00:03:34.110> leader<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.799> tie<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.730> uni<00:03:36.269> not

using the braid five turns with braids

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.520 
using the braid five turns with braids
usually<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.239> gives<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.720> really<00:03:42.959> good<00:03:43.200> snug

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
and then you do the opposite with the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.620 
and then you do the opposite with the
fluorocarbon<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:56.250> tie<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.820> uni<00:03:57.480> knot

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
fluorocarbon you tie it a uni knot

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.400 
fluorocarbon you tie it a uni knot
around<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.260> braid<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:59.820> again<00:04:00.690> five<00:04:00.930> turns<00:04:01.230> is

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
around the braid and again five turns is

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.699 
around the braid and again five turns is
all<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.620> need<00:04:02.720> which<00:04:03.720> you're<00:04:03.930> not<00:04:04.079> as<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.530> see
