 hello youtubers good today this video is going 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.860
 more aimed at the girls who are the 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.840
 that we worry a little bit more about 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.000
 the conditions of our hair makes 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.970
 some time I do not know if you have seen my videos 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.940
 previous but there they will be able to see if 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.680
 It will not happen all I pass a few photos to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.660
 to see that there has been a lot of difference 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.660
 in the condition of my hair 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.989
 we wonder what we can do to 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.140
 that they improve especially those that 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:35.720
 we have the ends battered then 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.440
 I had to comment a little bit and I saw 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.260
 many videos read something trying to 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.360
 look for ways to improve the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.670
 hair condition and some 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.280
 menjurjes some where they say ponte 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.140
 new vinegar went through injury the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.699
 hair 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.739
 like I did not get to a video where 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.260
 it said cut olive oil that I do not know 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.539
 what good olive oil or smells bad 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.780
 then I really dress them 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.729
 I recommend putting on olive oil 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.479
 now let's see the steps first that 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.160
 nothing you put a bit of oil 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.830
 Olive have because it is very liquid it 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.619
 can row then you put on a little and 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.050
 you distribute it at its tips doing 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.850
 this homogenous way if you get to have 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.729
 layers like 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.040
 then you can apply it from half of 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.930
 your hair to later see several 8 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.360
 Throughout the hair, I take great care of the part 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.280
 from behind since we regularly know 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.350
 this by nimbus the sport in front and 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:39.049
 let's completely forget the back 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:43.039
 and you wait 45 minutes and after 45 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.930
 minutes you can rinse it with warm water 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.390
 or cold not hot 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.360
 already when you have rinsed it 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.069
 pack it there and dry it in a normal way 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.590
 you take all the water and I do what I do 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:00.530
 personally, the water is not going to 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.580
 remove all the oil then waited 20 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.190
 minutes and then I wash it with shampoo 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.299
 and she with conditioner skillfully by 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.870
 the tips are all per week the 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:20.150
 results you observe the same day I 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:23.900
 I do it on Monday and Thursday night 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.790
 what I do is that tense if year believed 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.700
 that that was just a myth legends 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.769
 urban but really without functions that 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.410
 I'm going to regularly grow from a 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.239
 centimeter to a centimeter and a half to 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.459
 month thinking you do not grow a little more 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.790
 fast the truth has aged quite 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.790
 he already has it 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.820
 I hope the councils will serve you and that 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.740
 do not be bored with the video really 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.950
 I am not much of beauty things 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.870
 this advice has helped me a lot 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.870
 I saw around and it 's all thanks
