00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Guava speaks everything good. He wanted to know if I 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.270
 I can do some kind of exercise 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.620
 Only one football year , I only have this. 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:21.119
 I was wondering at home if there is any 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:23.460
 This exercise was worth washing my 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.660
 wanted or asked the question all 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.150
 ox herd at home 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.399
 I do not know, they cursed me that they did not have a box. 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.899
 No good ball class is s 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.510
 you find good football cup 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.640
 2014 world is going to be here in Brazil 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.260
 And then you and you provide a ball. 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.860
 football by the way who goes on the outside 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.989
 everything will know nothing and went to 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.539
 awards but it's also pretty cool 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.850
 so soccer ball is great because 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.530
 it gives a destabilized 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.480
 When we do exercises with this 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.039
 lack of stability 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.079
 the abdomen ends up working 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.469
 indirectly in any movement that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.899
 It is easy right exercises exercises 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.369
 we'll show those muscles all over 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.150
 The region imports the abdomen and uncle from a 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.430
 Pub 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.150
 they end up working a lot and that's 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.090
 very good to develop 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.310
 mainly balance but it is not even 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.470
 that he between eric dier balance and 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.240

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:35.400
 It's already genital surratt gave a 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:37.380
 drawn therein one because it puxadinha 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.790
 it is easier to be balanced and 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.759
 The exercises that we will do is 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.770
 require rebalancing and if it has 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.040
 too full will be difficult for you 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:55.530
 balance with sprains or 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:57.060
