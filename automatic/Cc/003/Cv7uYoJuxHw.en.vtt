00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.269
 the game and they were talking about it 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.429
 we were amiably among ourselves 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.740
 checking the registration of before 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.470
 had come along well etc. they walked on 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.779
 blows but this only increases 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.550
 the pathos that you will find them in the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.720

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.190
 bones so I have to do so because 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.620
 we can make such a positive move 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.620

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.250

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:53.390
 the moves but then you're nothing 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.750

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.910
 we entered the game already dying for 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.710
 sometimes it does nothing at all from flour 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.950
 the mince we don't do tests at home anymore 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.500

 recovering is made to enter one 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.570
 decision of the fact re-enter or but 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.810
 because the appropriate beauty now appears 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.550

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.800

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.600
 I understood how we want to be defended 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.080
 Not securing the life so it locks 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.990

 spits poison and then becomes invisible 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:33.600

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:36.360
 a more bag bag this is 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.090

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.250
 tk is also something you do n't want to know 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.840
 which you will soon see we do not know when 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.120
 we will publish these gameplay then 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.979
 could be already out but a nice one 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.530

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.350

 sketch that tries but is up to you 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.630
 entering that way consumes the bar 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.550
 the underlying energy and yes I think 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:22.110
 yes at this point the word 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:26.490
 I believe the team attackers do 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.349
 Instead we gave more harm is done by tarpaulins 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.349
 that optimal both 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.900

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:45.590

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.300
 the wait for me to make this cup is never 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:01.840
 been with a move fanta fantab all 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.840

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.070
 goodnight hunter just ok 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.610
 touched again he talks to me when I am 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.960
 tears of blood mt are ticked 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.960
 little batman things on the forearms 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:27.280
 shack and founder you guys but me 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:27.280
 I wanted to do mass I wanted to do that 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:33.020
 this that you never put to those who are giving 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.509
 a trap of past but I wanted to try 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.430
 a move but you give it a try and try 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.419
 but it hurts so much of us that we are a 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.479
 mladen sources 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:49.280
 our goal is to get more ho 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:52.849
 visas like and blessed but loses without 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.280
 I entered it was perfect that punch was 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:57.380
 just to avoid it 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.650
 I couldn't do better looking at how many 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.510
 this is quick and easy 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.820
 I think it's good that it just happened 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:11.480
 in the fourth round not to the eighth to put it 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:14.470
 or from the mena the brand troia woman go go 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.480
 you have it you have it you have it who knows 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.560
 when but when opportunity when I stay 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.330
 it would be repaired 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.980
 I think he pulled the football and both 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:26.060
 passed under is the only explanation 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:27.590
 plausible that we see a synergy 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.400
 angry kicking in the face 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:35.360
