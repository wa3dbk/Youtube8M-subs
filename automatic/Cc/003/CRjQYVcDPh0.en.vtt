00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.870
 how about youtube like stand squat zombie and 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:07.910
 this is another video accessory 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.830
 for game consoles then 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.889
 let's see a review of this control that is 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.890
 for which in which this control came out in 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.640
 the 2002 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.939
 it is a long control 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.009
 very close to the original control of the game 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.410
 cube a little bit bigger for the same 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.529
 what is the wire with 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.160
 This is called the wiper name 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:37.020
 strange for control but good this 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.170
 was one of the first controls of the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.239
 same console company something that does not 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.280
 had tried before maybe this 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.519
 third companies had done this 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.040
 wireless controls me the first time 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:54.420
 that I saw look at a wireless control was 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.930
 in the in the atari 2600 that was the sacaba 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.570
 the antenna this was the first control of 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.660
 the same who made the same company 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.060
 the console and well this was me I think 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.369
 that the second or third makes 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.369
 also between 3d or o also had 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.979
 that kind of controls and well then this 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.340
 is the waiver the same position of 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.860
 buttons the normal control the crosshead 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.259
 all everything exactly the same 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.250
 the difference is this one that has a button 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.550
 of ignition that you learn here 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.550
 on another of the differences that 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.450
 It has no vibration is what it lacked 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.100
 but good 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.439
 you also have to give him credit that 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.869
 works pretty well for example to 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.700
 distance for no need to have 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.969
 the cables there are many cables that have 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.740
 this extensions that were selling extensions 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:54.380
 and Julian is not so not so bad 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.380
 have is this kind of controls 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.159
 something strange in this part since by 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.680
 example is this control has of 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.509
 radio frequency so you can 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.549
 put different frequency differently 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.390
 channel in this part we have a small 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.310
 wheel on which they are around that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.790
 crush him 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.209
 to do that are 15 they are not around 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.209
 of 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.110
 16 channels in which you can put 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:27.040
 different games of different consoles 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.260
 and well everyone has their channel is something 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.799
 strange from 1 to 16 and for example you have 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.829
 to put the same number that comes 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.329
 of the receiver that is being this one is 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.610
 you install it on the part of someone who 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.890
 any port you want but 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.299
 mainly in port one for the 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.080
 Controls whether if a game 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.870
 multiplayer 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.370
 different controls of these same already 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.960
 occupied four of these but in 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.720
 different channels also had what 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.560
 same as it says channel 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.850
 I'm like a stranger because it's from 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.070
 radiofrequency of this type of 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.520
 controls this also has from 1 to 16 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.400
 it has to be with the same number and the 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.290
 another control if they can if they can more 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.350
 well if they put several has to be the 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.480
 same the same channel 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.390
 You can use this same control 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.010
 also for the wing in the part of 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.340
 above the first consoles of boy 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.970
 has the slots for the controls of 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.070
 the game cube this silo what used I do not 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.140
 a lot but yes in some wii games 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.570
 at the top you install it and 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.720
 it has to be the same the same as 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.320
 this 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.000
 the place seems to echo this control 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.510
 It is compatible with several wii games 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.760
 You can use it to not use the 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.670
 classic control 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.129
 but if you occupy this game to play 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.180
 gamecube games because it does not leave you with 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.250
 normal control of the wing 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.379
 but it was a good option the only 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.469
 difference then it may not have 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:04.680
 vibration but somehow it was then 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:06.930
 it was good the back has a 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.440
 small cap that are installed two two 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.050
 batteries of two batteries double to 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.660
 but if it's a good option already from that 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.690
 if they have it or those that do not have it 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.370
 I advise them third companies took out 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.170
 the same 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.640
 different is almost the same can be done 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.190
 they also take out some small controls 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.910
 smaller ones that were funny that's 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.500
 I did not have to buy it more and well 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.170
 good is this is a small video of 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.540
 this great control that already after me 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.340
 are going to give the companies to take their 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.570
 own wireless controls things that 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.560
 it is already very normal to see them in this 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.260
 weather 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.110
 and well, this is the control in the 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.880
 I made for the game cube and then there we 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.389
 we see I hope you liked it and 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.870
 up to guasave next video thanks 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.870
 until what
