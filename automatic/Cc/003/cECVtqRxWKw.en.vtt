being<00:00:26.640> stupid<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.119> what<00:00:27.720> happened<00:00:28.019> with<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
being stupid but what happened with the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.070 
being stupid but what happened with the
wooden<00:00:28.560> rack<00:00:28.830> was<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.250> was<00:00:29.369> deformed<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:30.750> top

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
wooden rack was it was deformed this top

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.940 
wooden rack was it was deformed this top
of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.289> rack<00:00:31.669> flat<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:33.270> soon<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.899> i<00:00:34.200> guess

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
of the rack flat as soon as the i guess

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.319 
of the rack flat as soon as the i guess
the<00:00:34.980> humidity<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> heat<00:00:35.880> messed<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.239> up

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the humidity and the heat messed it up

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.030 
the humidity and the heat messed it up
so<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.540> would<00:00:36.840> deform<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.010> just

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
so the would deform just like that just

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.549 
so the would deform just like that just
curved<00:00:38.579> straight<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:39.030> i<00:00:39.510> had<00:00:40.050> four<00:00:40.320> snakes

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
escape but they were found and so then i

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.459

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
on the temperatures inside the rack I

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.770 
on the temperatures inside the rack I
noticed<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.920> he<00:00:53.520> immediately<00:00:53.969> popped<00:00:54.629> his

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.180 
noticed that he immediately popped his
head<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.140> started<00:00:55.620> flicking<00:00:55.949> its<00:00:56.129> tongue

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
head up and started flicking its tongue

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.119 
head up and started flicking its tongue
out<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.640> went<00:00:57.539> after<00:00:57.629> my<00:00:57.899> hand<00:00:58.170> that's<00:00:58.920> not

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
out and went after my hand that's not

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.500 
out and went after my hand that's not
him<00:00:59.309> being<00:00:59.520> aggressive<00:00:59.910> he<00:01:00.059> was<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.359> hungry

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
him being aggressive he was just hungry

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.410 
him being aggressive he was just hungry
so<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.230> threw<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.800> small<00:01:02.280> rat<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.760> dead<00:01:03.120> pre

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
so I threw in a small rat a dead pre

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.820 
so I threw in a small rat a dead pre
killed<00:01:03.600> tomorrow<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> had<00:01:04.290> left<00:01:04.500> over

and<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.509> check<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> temperatures<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.380> this

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and I check the temperatures with this

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.550 
and I check the temperatures with this
nifty<00:01:43.860> little<00:01:44.009> thing<00:01:44.810> it's<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.930> temp<00:01:46.200> gun<00:01:46.380> from

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
nifty little thing it's a temp gun from

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.450 
nifty little thing it's a temp gun from
pro<00:01:46.770> exotics<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> laser<00:01:49.159> it's<00:01:50.159> really

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
pro exotics with the laser it's really

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.660 
pro exotics with the laser it's really
useful<00:01:50.610> um<00:01:51.649> really<00:01:52.649> really<00:01:53.070> cool<00:01:53.280> i<00:01:53.369> mean<00:01:53.490> it

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.700 
useful um really really cool i mean it
can<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:53.850> temperatures<00:01:54.180> from<00:01:54.390> far<00:01:54.689> away<00:01:54.720> i<00:01:55.259> can

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
can get temperatures from far away i can

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.080 
can get temperatures from far away i can
measure<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.009> temperature<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> basket

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
measure the temperature on the basket

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.280 
measure the temperature on the basket
spot<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.420> bluetongue<00:01:57.719> skink<00:01:57.899> from<00:01:58.170> way

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
spot on the bluetongue skink from way

anyways I like will come back here
that's<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.259> path

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
that's the path

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.789 
that's the path
so<00:02:10.899> when<00:02:11.680> spiders<00:02:12.900> okay<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.469> spiders

temperature on a hot spot for a book for

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.899 
temperature on a hot spot for a book for
a<00:02:26.499> ball<00:02:26.620> python<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:27.040> on<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.340> cool<00:02:27.549> side<00:02:27.579> where

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
a ball python and on the cool side where

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.539 
a ball python and on the cool side where
the<00:02:27.969> water<00:02:28.180> bowl<00:02:28.389> is<00:02:29.040> seventy<00:02:30.040> four<00:02:30.189> point<00:02:30.430> two

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
the water bowl is seventy four point two

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.449 
the water bowl is seventy four point two
degrees<00:02:30.849> that<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.299> perfect<00:02:32.159> so<00:02:33.159> that's<00:02:33.310> pretty

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
degrees that is perfect so that's pretty

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.990
