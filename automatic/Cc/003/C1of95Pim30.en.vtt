00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.080
 The two trainers are allowed to participate in the biggest part 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.849
 basket and joe tin-makers around you 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.400
 statement to the game is ours 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.740
 well done for you 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.870
 bitter that you end up without a point 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.690
 stands today he has first of all 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.960
 Have a nice good evening and be 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.769
 Firstly , I would like to apply to the olympic application 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.279
 first wish a lot of success 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.720
 and yes to the game because I think you have 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:39.540
 seen that football is not always fair 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:42.809
 i am the team of ours 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.180
 crew absolutely do not blame 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.140
 we played the same way as we did 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.390
 I've imagined one 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.770
 very good football 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.399
 Combination football shown as well 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.879
 in addition a high intensity on the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.420
 place and also chances 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.070
 had that all statistics clear for 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.090
 but we speak as said statistics 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.689
 do not win games 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:16.310
 we get two very annoying ones 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:18.450
 Goals and are now there without a point 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:24.659
 of course, now have to look that too 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.670
 On the one hand, we are clearly behind this 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.880
 Idea we showed today that we 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.280
 have shown on schalke 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.750
 behind it and the team is 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.369
 about this fussballer on square 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.310
 I have to bring myself so stable 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.310
 we are and I hope that we first 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.400
 a little more luck, too 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.670
 have and 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.290
 then successful are thank you very well 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.870
 analyzed I think it takes you 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.390
 do not add much 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.430
 We have over the fight and with a lot 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.350
 but we were able to win luck 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.540
 We also knew what to expect 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.550
 have also been in paderborn 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.850
 decided that we are just on error 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.320
 wait and the errors are today too 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.800
 We did not come with it 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.570
 good luck that the gates are made and 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.690
 finally as two radio said so 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.430
 unfair can be football is 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.590
 Of course not mine 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.120
 Presentation of football but with this 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.600
 list of injured players we 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.490
 to have 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.070
 At the moment we can not do anything else 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.140
 I think that brought out krems 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.510
 I think I walked over 129 kilometers 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.940
 So the team has won 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.290
 they wanted to fight they wanted the 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.450
 accept this fight they did 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.740
 they rewarded you for that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.990
 playful but not superior 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.000
 sanova in all areas superior where 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.000
 they compliment the pages of the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.950
 Team had us in 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.660
 playful needs so pure pressed 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.340
 like today , but also fair 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.560
 say that the four-string is right 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.090
 the others did well before that 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.070
 have worked 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.390
 for this team and i believe that 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.360
 was the right one we have 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.470
 I say it again decided 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.110
 not so often the ball in midfield 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.550
 to lose but rather to the mistakes 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.959
 I hope that we wait in the future 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.320
 of course with the injured 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.090
 players come back again 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.080
 be playful different but there do 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.970
 I also do not blame the team 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.430
 we wanted to do that 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.140
 although of course it is the fans and 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.670
 perhaps not suspect so but like 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.489
 Thank you 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.720
 wolfgang witte micro comes 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.879
 social time you have to change twice 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.980
 maybe you have to say something about that and 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.640
 a small review of the area of 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.260
 marcello marcello I think of myself 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.849
 Well inserted in the beginning it was a 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.620
 a bit shaky but completely normal we 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.650
 have half a training with him 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.500
 felt a few minutes then in 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.290
 paderborn 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.730
 I think that was okay. I want 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.810
 But also know that there is more 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.340
 but that is perfectly normal 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.750
 automatisms must come with him too 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.579
 the other question was what was again 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.930
 We excuses have we already 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.430
 in paderborn thought made it 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.470
 we have worked at all 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.140
 decided to bring him from the beginning 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.959
 I had a muscle hardening 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.430
 Also in Paderborn many meters 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.039
 also because i 'm already playing that 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.489
 English weeks is not so easy 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:22.350
 then also on the position where he plays 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.570
 Barcoo has just the same 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.000
 The injury phase is pretty much noticed 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.510
 late for training back to training 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.680
 got in and got us for it 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.479
 decided within time too 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.800
 switch 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.289
 due to also a bit muscular 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.849
 problems but the two still gone 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.860
 But we did not want to take any chances 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.330
 And I think the freshness has us 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.340
 a little bit what helped we have 1 0 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.300
 why should not you be the same 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.500
 Now you can change over 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.479
 argue that maybe after ten 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:54.090
 minutes brings but I have for it 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.419
 decided to bring at the same time please 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.690
 say 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.580
 wait a while for micro to admire it 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.760
 only third game where clearly more in it 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.060
 Was it just bad luck or what you see 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.740
 the own share of the team 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.990
 It was already extreme today 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.750
 it was even more extreme than it was on schalke 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.419
 we were on schalke too 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.039
 clearly superior and also had the clearest 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.800
 chances that we did not use 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.479
 but today of course I think the same 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.289
 the way for the goats 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.539
 got 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.970
 that was actually the annoying and 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.190
 Of course, the eleven meters if we think so 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.020
 I do this eleven meter with the 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.639
 domination we have aired then 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.529
 Over the 90 minutes then that will think 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.149
 I am very heavy from 5 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.159
 For the hamburger this game ever 

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:41.549
 still to win or a point too 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.269
 get as I said 

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:46.449
 in the end we do not make the gates 

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:49.259
 the opponent is pulling because of that 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.259
 the three dots stayed here 

00:05:51.899 --> 00:06:07.349
 yes that was not that 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:06:09.939
 Closing words have gone a lot 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.919
 i would have another record 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:14.109
 but if the media then kilometers 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.579
 sampled then I'm glad I have to 

00:06:14.109 --> 00:06:17.589
 say we do not need for the victory 

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:18.909
 We apologize again 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:20.559
 set up that we have a lot 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:22.959
 we will work against the ball 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:25.179
 We will work if we can 

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:27.309
 is he playing behind the chain and that 

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:28.959
 they did well today I say it 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:31.749
 again a sugar lick it was not 

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:33.699
 but we are in the fight for a fight we are 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:35.199
 not outside for a long time and therefore 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.219
 was for us goal is three points too 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.719
 I also got here already 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.459
 I had told press conferences 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:40.629
 had more ball possession 

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:44.469
 you also shot the goal 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:45.819
 and when he goes in and once 2 1 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:47.079
 shot the deflected we were 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:47.860
 We closed the shop in the back 

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:49.479
 have slept once 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.799
 otherwise the team is in 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:53.619
 have thrown every ball worked 

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:55.179
 and that is a point where we start 

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:56.139
 if I had lasogga holtby 

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:57.849
 I would probably have too 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:00.489
 set up differently but if I'm in five 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.589
 or six players with rolex six 

00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:03.729
 Removing a Tribal Player from Others 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.989
 I think the teams will be too 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.969
 in a football game not yet this 

00:07:04.989 --> 00:07:08.619
 ball possession they like to see everyone but 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:10.719
 we need points and that's why 

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:12.009
 decide what we do and if the 

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:13.239
 Men are back then we can 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:17.409
 like working with offensive football 

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:19.809
 Jump wonderful then that was 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:21.129
 Closing word is good for many 

00:07:19.809 --> 00:07:22.659
 simply happy again full against 

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:25.289
 Paderborn is at the end 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:25.289
 thank-you
