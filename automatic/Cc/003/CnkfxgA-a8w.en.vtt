 different here in the video one of my writing 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.930
 guide he asked asked a question to 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.899
 me about what I do with my life without being 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.600
 youtube is that when doing when I 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.190
 I'm not making video and comfort of 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.890
 Life where I'm going to talk to you, I think. 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.739
 let the majority who has an interest know 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.660
 than when doing daily when not 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.479
 I'm recording when I'm not playing. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.610
 so we work for those who do not 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.229
 know how to work in a company and that I 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.850
 I 'm not going to speak to you for now. 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.689

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.450
 talk to you in the future that is good 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.979
 I do not know the reason for which I will not speak and 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.900
 Like I think by company policy 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.229
 I can not talk for now, we can 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.680
 I hope you understand and I'm not 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.689
 working or even recording I'm in 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.119
 gym, I always go to the gym. 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.610
 the afternoon to arrive from the gym 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.470
 gym is to record the time videos 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.110
 I let go of every day when you see 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.020
 that there is no video because I'm not in the mood 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.360
 but I'm trying next one way 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.290
 positive here on the channel I think you gave 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.990
 to understand 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.640
 I have posted from Monday to Friday 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.409
 I'm going to change until I say I'm 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.130
 building a room for me here in 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.200
 House 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.119
 It's ready to be ready, I think. 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.500
 It will be ready by 15 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.469
 September more or less 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.329
 Then I'll be able to record video at night 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.890
 at dawn whenever you will not have 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.630
 No one on my side, my father, my mother. 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.729
 slept in the bedroom next door will not have 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.450
 No one on my side will 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.830
 to vote two videos every day and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.420
 come back with the light 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.910
 the stadium was loose type of video 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.760
 and second to second two videos by 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.920
 with noon and six o'clock 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.080
 It started at 6 o'clock or a day and a half a day. 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.990
 to keep the channel well a stop for 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.790
 grow with the average 8000 100 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.740
 subscribers and a giant number I 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.180
 I never thought I would reach this 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.830
 number when you created the channel and see 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.750
 do not get 2,000 registered 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.610
 I thought it was a fantastic thing I thought 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.680
 that was such a giant but then I arrived 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.600
 like 8 thousand I do not think it's that big 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.360
 so I hope someday I can get 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.730
 to the mark of 50 thousand 100 thousand registered 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.560
 It's my focus and it gets to that average. 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.330
 along with you who occupy together with 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.150
 You who are coming because you do not 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.940
 understood then this gameplay is very 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.190
 crazy bar agents 0 and guys invasion 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.050
 It is a very difficult thing to do 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.120
 Polish kick he can follow company 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.070
 long time in his channel if I do not 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.000
 mistake was a record he got nuclear 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.770
 of course 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.500
 got nuclear part refers to see 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.530
 leaving too crazy so that's it folks the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.660
 good video stay more focused when not 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.970

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.640
 too much that will not get better 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.489
 live stream if they come back I got 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.800
 already the card cable to connect to 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.080
 lobby for you I hope you 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.090
 the channel is 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.500
 growing up that was the focus had 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.959
 writing even though I spoke in your business 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.480
 that I got myself that way so not 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.480
 to annoy him but he spoke the point of 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.080
 He told me that when he told me that 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.910
 knew he was saying that I was another 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.470
 revealing that I did not care for writing 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.200
 People always called me for writing. 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.510
 whenever they are number written 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.750
 always post the video from Monday to Friday 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.180
 for this to get a bigger audience 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.060
 to get new was option on the channel 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.420
 so I'll hope he has a type 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.760
 this whole reason for this video is to try 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.799
