00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:40.672
[SANTOS TV] How does it look?

00:00:41.694 --> 00:00:43.857
[THIAGO] Awesome,
it looks great, dude!

00:00:44.353 --> 00:00:45.629
It's beautiful!

00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:47.911
[PAULO] It's cool,
I really like it.

00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:50.027
It's awesome!

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:51.533
[RICARDO] Dude, it's really cool!

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:54.818
This is one of those matches
in which...

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:56.412
we'll not exchange jerseys!

00:00:57.204 --> 00:00:59.125
We'll use this jersey for the
first time, and I hope...

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:01.591
we manage to achieve a good result.

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:04.412
I'll take it back home
to present my relatives.

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:06.103
[VICTOR] It's amazing!

00:01:06.458 --> 00:01:07.959
Congratulations, guys!

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.524
Seriously, dude,
it's extremely beautiful!

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:14.486
It'll bring us good luck,
God willing!

00:01:14.683 --> 00:01:17.541
[THIAGO] This is your first match,
how are you feeling?

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.055
Where is your name?

00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:22.349
[VITOR] Here it is, Vitor Bueno!

00:01:22.903 --> 00:01:25.555
[SANTOS TV] How does it feel
to be here for the first time?

00:01:25.556 --> 00:01:27.880
[VITOR] It feels great,

00:01:28.337 --> 00:01:30.667
I hope our team manages
to play well...

00:01:30.668 --> 00:01:31.980
and to win.

00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:33.748
[SANTOS TV] - What's up, Ricardo?
[RICARDO] - This is our environment!

00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:36.389
It's filled with happiness,
it's quite healthy...

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.994
[GUSTAVO] - He's going to score today!
[RICARDO] - It's also filled with confidence!

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:44.126
[BRAZ] - How I miss that guy!
[GABRIEL] - So do I!

00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:47.688
[BRAZ] He was such a nice person,
very humble,

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.194
such a nice person,

00:01:49.195 --> 00:01:50.327
how I miss him!

00:01:50.328 --> 00:01:52.815
[GABRIEL] - When he arrived here,
[BRAZ] - He wasn't cocky or annoying,

00:01:52.816 --> 00:01:55.293
[GABRIEL] - he looked like a little kid!
[BRAZ] - he barely talked!

00:01:55.294 --> 00:02:00.678
Now he's extremely annoying,
come on, dude!

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.505
[GABRIEL] I miss him!
#IMissHim!

00:02:02.603 --> 00:02:05.550
[BRAZ] How I miss him,
I really do!

00:02:05.652 --> 00:02:07.542
[LUCAS] What? I didn't hear anything.

00:02:07.643 --> 00:02:08.285
Who?

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.194
The past is the past, dude!

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.031
[BRAZ] Pitiful!

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:46.553
[DORIVAL] We've come to a moment
in the competition in which...

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.828
we must decide what we want,

00:02:49.475 --> 00:02:50.871
where we want to be.

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.849
The time has come for us
to make up our minds,

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:58.448
and each one of you guys
will be involved,

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:01.727
each one of us will be part of it.

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.573
Do not hold back out there,

00:03:03.574 --> 00:03:04.779
I'll be the first one,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.187
I'll fight, I'll run,
I'll keep pressuring them, 

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.542
it doesn't matter if I won't
be able to dispute the entire match,

00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:13.361
whoever substitutes me
will handle it!

00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:56.085
[RICARDO] I want to tell you something,
this is not a joke.

00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:59.676
Take a look at the person
who is by your side and say:

00:03:59.904 --> 00:04:02.534
I believe in you,
you can lead this team!

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.890
We're not dependent on one player,
everyone is important!

00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:09.638
We must go out there knowing that
our teammates are capable enough,

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.950
that they'll be role models for us!

00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:15.685
Today we'll dispute another final,
let's go out there, guys,

00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:18.018
and, then, we'll come back
here to celebrate!

00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:05.123
[GABRIEL] God helped me.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.850
The ball hit me,
then it touched the woodwork,

00:06:08.176 --> 00:06:12.688
and, then, it hit my foot again
and I scored.

00:06:13.178 --> 00:06:17.334
It's important to highlight
our team's spirit,

00:06:17.446 --> 00:06:19.862
we won the derby and today
we maintained our performance.

00:06:19.863 --> 00:06:22.199
We'll keep it up,
we'll keep working hard,

00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:23.451
there's another match coming.

00:06:23.452 --> 00:06:25.425
The ball hit his shin
and entered the goal!

00:06:25.756 --> 00:06:28.576
[THIAGO] I usually see them shooting,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.990
that's not my role,
but God blessed me,

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:35.141
I'm not right footed,
but I managed to score!

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:38.934
Coach Dorival and Lucas
had asked me to do that,

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:40.355
and, thanks to God, I scored!

00:06:40.606 --> 00:06:42.933
[BRAZ] It's the first of many,
congratulations, you deserve it!

00:06:43.965 --> 00:06:46.823
I was happy to see the team's
commitment, devotion,

00:06:46.824 --> 00:06:48.264
and I'm happy about the victory.

00:06:48.402 --> 00:06:50.406
I managed to score today,

00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:53.096
which is quite reassuring,

00:06:53.693 --> 00:06:56.561
what really matters is that
our team's been evolving...

00:06:56.562 --> 00:06:59.156
thanks to our hard work,

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.797
to our union,
we're just like a family,

00:07:01.798 --> 00:07:03.859
and to our devotion,
match after match.

00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:06.000
We must highlight those points.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.432
The past is the past,
we must focus on our next match,

00:07:09.433 --> 00:07:11.769
that's our vision
and we won't change it.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.666
Congratulations to everyone,
we played extremely well.
