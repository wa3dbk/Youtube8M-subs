00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 hello very good everyone I'm maximan and 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.080
 we are here in how people video 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.549
 do with what we are here with 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.140
 subscribers and a lot of people 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.150
 lots of bikes jumping around here and 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.380
 nobody knows what to do here is all the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.360
 jumping world is trying to get 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.790
 here everyone is going to fall if I do not 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.440
 I fall over I have rectified the fall 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.699
 you have to make a hit here in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.560
 bicycle to see if I get the first 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.039
 and I'm out of here and he got rid of me 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.039
 sufferings 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.420
 You have stepped on me because nothing has not even 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.630
 I could try it I think I see myself a 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.059
 little head to do it in let's say without 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.309
 to count with contacts because the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.590
 career gave you the option of putting them in 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.440
 contact because he was contactless but I 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.730
 I wanted to do it with contact because it gives me 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.940
 the march 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.320
 the swap so here it does not get me not me 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.960
 I should have fallen but I've fallen 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.440
 so to see I have to go out in a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.270
 moment to another to see if I get it and it's because 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.520
 turns as I've seen to see if I get 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.199
 it comes out, it comes out 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.870
 you want to fall and maximize not you 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.530
 you have to fall there but good I get 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.200
 that people still uy third is 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.350
 practicing here to see if they do not arrive 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.360
 Wait, I do not fall for everything 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.940
 I shit on everything it's very difficult to do 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.600
 this is that if I get eye eye eye eye 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.670
 here in the ruling that if first hit there is 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.729
 a competition here between the first and 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.800
 the second and the others are about to see 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.470
 see if they arrive or not worth it already arrived arrived 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.140
 it arrived arrived it arrived I no not as you arrive 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.700
 there that impossible is merely impossible 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.790
 get to that point I do not know how they are 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.140
 doing as they do how it's done 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.600
 words and now yes hours and hours and 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.979
 hours sir so it is worth eye that now what 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.159
 what do I have to do not fall down is that 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.140
 I know how to get up there so I do not fall 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.990
 that if I do not realize I have not appreciated 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.929
 the image but I jumped on the walt 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.420
 reversal is worth more now yes yes now 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.929
 so much again is it again now yes 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.110
 Mr. and went me me me came out 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.060
 go up goes up goes up and reaching 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.590
 this point we do not know what position we are going 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.869
 exactly has not yet reached 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.850
 nobody which I can still give the 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.890
 back and third or two have come 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.200
 I can yet 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.750
 because they are locked there I can give all 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.060
 turn around and reach them if I do not have if 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.610
 there is no room for error or that is already 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.950
 here we go come on let go come on and 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.290
 sir yes sir, and now the goal is 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.880
 here more or less still people 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.740
 is trying to get there I hope not 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.410
 I hope I have no luck and 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.330
 arrive 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.770
 and the goal where it is cursed is this 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.080
 the goal 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.810
 this is the beginning and end goal of 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.580
 moment I think that one has already passed that 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.910
 it has already happened one is the first one already has 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.770
 the brand has is that I do that 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.880
 I get to guide agricultural bike that I 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.890
 I was thrilled to see it came and now 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.380
 here is the little dot that you have to catch 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.210
 that is at the rhythm tells you that it is 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.960
 up really has to do the walt 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.220
 network the sometimes what restart I can 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.410
 get second position because the 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.840
 first I think it has arrived if it does not go 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:14.180
 to arrive to arrive now we are already arrived 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.180
 the first one I'm here trying to 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.640
 see if I get it or not and the second is 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.260
 around here still so I can 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.360
 I can do it, I can do, I can not 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.620
 I can do it 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.090
 Come on come on come on kittens I do not know how 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.250
 I fall I do not know how I fall 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.830
 honestly I do not know how I fall but I 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.440
 I fall if I want to fall I'm worth 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.010
 what comes out that I think we thought 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:44.210
 we were going but pedaling in the air 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.730
 it is impossible it is very difficult to do this and 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.770
 let's see, I'm not going to make another goal 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.180
 reider on bicycles because the truth is 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.250
 more complicated than driving to see 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.490
 to see care bike cursed 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.020
 bicycle that has made me all the son 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.300
 our fault at least he has 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.960
 fallen I fell I fell but they are 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.080
 two bicycles 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.970
 this time what the second lord 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.310
 position and has come to me to start 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.920
 a third now fourth now fifth 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.950
 ok, eye, eye, good, good 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.410
 well come and see where it is 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.760
 I think it has arrived has come tell me 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.900
 it has not arrived as long as it has not arrived 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.269
 uncle 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.260
 is there is I welcome the same point 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.480
 the same time that I still can not 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.850
 overtaking I'm lucky but it's going too 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.350
 fast and I do not think I can see it 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.620
 Sometimes I can overtake, I can overtake 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.790
 you still can not advance 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.940
 we go 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.950
 where is this and we're still going 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.440
 go go go Sube Sube Sube Sube 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.870
 Climb damn if you go to the side what 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.940
 I have next to go forward or not 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:49.010
 I get very second and third means that 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.620

 that has cost me a lot and so 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.230
 I see here is also costing all the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.060
 world is costing the same life to 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.490
 the whole world mother threw me to the slope 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.440
 very much doing this but in the end I have 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.680
 achieved but that this is the 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.660
 second 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.870

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.190
