00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
small heart I'm living the link to the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.779 
small heart I'm living the link to the
other<00:00:17.400> sizes<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.539> video<00:00:18.900> description<00:00:19.789> I'm

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
other sizes on the video description I'm

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.980 
other sizes on the video description I'm
using<00:00:21.119> at<00:00:21.570> 3.5<00:00:22.380> millimeter<00:00:23.070> yarn<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> hook

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
using at 3.5 millimeter yarn and hook

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.290 
using at 3.5 millimeter yarn and hook
this<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> same<00:00:25.650> as<00:00:25.949> us<00:00:26.519> for<00:00:26.880> hook<00:00:27.599> size<00:00:29.300> so

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
this is the same as us for hook size so

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.840 
this is the same as us for hook size so
we<00:00:30.689> will<00:00:30.840> start<00:00:31.199> doing<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.769> magic<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.550> slipknot

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
we will start doing a magic a slipknot

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.690 
we will start doing a magic a slipknot
this<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.510> done<00:00:33.780> by<00:00:34.110> placing<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.890> tip<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
this is done by placing the tip of the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.420 
this is done by placing the tip of the
yarn<00:00:36.030> over<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:37.200> long<00:00:37.700> part<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.059> yarn<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
yarn over the long part of the yarn and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.510 
yarn over the long part of the yarn and
then<00:00:41.430> creating<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.329> slipknot<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.309> this

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
then creating a slipknot just like this

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:58.930 
then creating a slipknot just like this
and<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:46.739> will<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.640> center<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.390> our<00:00:48.719> heart

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.000 

we<00:00:59.940> will<00:01:00.120> insert<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> hook<00:01:00.870> right<00:01:01.290> here<00:01:01.800> and

we will insert the hook right here and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.320 
we will insert the hook right here and
then<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:03.149> will<00:01:03.360> shine<00:01:03.629> three

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.300 

okay<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.659> now<00:01:11.020> we<00:01:11.470> will<00:01:11.680> start<00:01:12.010> working

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
okay and now we will start working

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.480 
okay and now we will start working
around<00:01:12.850> this<00:01:13.510> ring<00:01:13.840> around<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.620> first<00:01:15.010> chain

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
around this ring around the first chain

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.280 
around this ring around the first chain
first<00:01:16.390> we<00:01:16.810> will<00:01:17.020> do<00:01:17.229> three<00:01:17.740> treble<00:01:18.250> so<00:01:19.290> yarn

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290

and now we have four loops on our hook
we<00:01:31.180> go<00:01:31.420> through<00:01:31.840> two<00:01:32.140> loops<00:01:32.380> then<00:01:33.340> two<00:01:33.970> loops

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
we go through two loops then two loops

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.330 
we go through two loops then two loops
and<00:01:35.400> finally<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.880> last<00:01:37.150> two<00:01:37.810> loops<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:39.130> is

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
and finally the last two loops this is

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.359 
and finally the last two loops this is
the<00:01:39.550> first<00:01:39.910> travel<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:40.630> will<00:01:41.259> do<00:01:41.530> two<00:01:42.130> other
