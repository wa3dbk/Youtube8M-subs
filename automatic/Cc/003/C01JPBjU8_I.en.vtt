sorting<00:06:21.430> oh<00:06:21.750> and<00:06:22.750> we<00:06:22.900> got<00:06:22.930> Oh<00:06:23.370> Cantor<00:06:24.370> see<00:06:24.669> I

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:25.029 
sorting oh and we got Oh Cantor see I

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:29.129 
sorting oh and we got Oh Cantor see I
have<00:06:26.020> never<00:06:26.349> used<00:06:26.740> this<00:06:27.039> so<00:06:27.340> I<00:06:27.639> just<00:06:28.139> that's

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139

debt<00:06:34.270> to<00:06:34.509> let's<00:06:34.750> see<00:06:34.960> what<00:06:35.139> does<00:06:35.289> it<00:06:35.409> do<00:06:35.819> attack

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:36.819 
debt to let's see what does it do attack

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:39.300 
debt to let's see what does it do attack
with<00:06:37.060> a<00:06:37.180> shower<00:06:37.479> of<00:06:37.810> white<00:06:38.080> paint<00:06:38.409> so<00:06:39.250> I'm

with a shower of white paint so I'm

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.589 
with a shower of white paint so I'm
going<00:06:39.490> to<00:06:39.520> find<00:06:39.699> that<00:06:39.759> particularly<00:06:40.240> useful

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 
going to find that particularly useful

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:45.860 
going to find that particularly useful
look<00:06:40.960> right<00:06:41.729> so<00:06:42.729> it's<00:06:43.469> terrible<00:06:44.469> damage

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
look right so it's terrible damage

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.480 
look right so it's terrible damage
whereas<00:06:46.870> if<00:06:47.110> we<00:06:47.169> just<00:06:47.620> switch<00:06:47.830> back<00:06:48.099> to<00:06:48.129> a<00:06:48.279> mean

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
whereas if we just switch back to a mean

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.129 
whereas if we just switch back to a mean
tomorrow<00:06:48.789> quickly<00:06:49.300> that<00:06:49.479> need<00:06:49.629> about<00:06:49.779> four

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.320 

but<00:07:03.720> so<00:07:03.990> yeah<00:07:04.199> the<00:07:04.610> game's<00:07:05.610> pretty<00:07:05.880> good<00:07:06.120> you

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
but so yeah the game's pretty good you

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.200 
but so yeah the game's pretty good you
know<00:07:06.680> standard<00:07:07.680> scroll<00:07:08.100> around<00:07:08.280> puzzle<00:07:08.970> sort

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
know standard scroll around puzzle sort

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.330 
know standard scroll around puzzle sort
of<00:07:09.270> solving<00:07:09.780> game<00:07:09.960> kinda<00:07:10.440> like<00:07:10.590> castlevania

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
of solving game kinda like castlevania

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.600 
of solving game kinda like castlevania
series<00:07:11.580> but<00:07:12.590> you'd<00:07:13.590> think<00:07:13.620> that<00:07:14.190> wouldn't<00:07:14.430> be

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
series but you'd think that wouldn't be

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.010 
series but you'd think that wouldn't be
anything<00:07:14.850> special<00:07:15.150> so<00:07:15.449> why<00:07:15.750> would<00:07:15.900> they

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 
anything special so why would they

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.719 
anything special so why would they
probably<00:07:16.260> make<00:07:16.500> a<00:07:16.530> second<00:07:17.040> one<00:07:17.070> like<00:07:17.370> this<00:07:17.520> one

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729 
probably make a second one like this one

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.150 
probably make a second one like this one
is<00:07:17.880> there<00:07:18.060> just<00:07:18.210> stand<00:07:18.510> with<00:07:18.540> the<00:07:18.690> first<00:07:19.160> well

is there just stand with the first well

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.610 
is there just stand with the first well
they<00:07:20.550> see<00:07:21.090> they<00:07:21.690> sort<00:07:21.930> of<00:07:21.960> had<00:07:22.139> a<00:07:22.169> bad<00:07:22.440> run<00:07:22.770> with
