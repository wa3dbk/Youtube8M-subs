00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.280 
listening to music we also have an extra
audio<00:01:38.850> cable<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.479> has<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> inline<00:01:40.110> control

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
audio cable that has the inline control

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.130 
audio cable that has the inline control
for<00:01:40.770> playback<00:01:41.250> value<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.270> pause<00:01:42.479> everything

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
for playback value and pause everything

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.469 
for playback value and pause everything
like<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:44.579> now<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.450> that

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
like that so now that we got all of that

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.120 
like that so now that we got all of that
done<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.079> let's<00:01:46.290> go<00:01:46.409> ahead<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.649> put<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
done with let's go ahead and put that to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.740 
done with let's go ahead and put that to
the<00:01:47.159> side<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.700> get<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> beach<00:01:48.270> studios

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the side and get to the beach studios

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.289 
the side and get to the beach studios
themselves<00:01:49.470> okay<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.520> let's<00:01:50.820> actually<00:01:50.970> get

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
themselves okay so let's actually get

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.660 
themselves okay so let's actually get
into<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.630> first<00:01:51.869> video<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.619> from<00:01:53.159> actually

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
into the first video like from actually

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.249 
into the first video like from actually
the<00:01:53.790> videos<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.299> actually<00:01:54.720> give<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.110> my

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the videos like actually give you my

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.289 
the videos like actually give you my
impressions<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:55.950> what<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.159> think<00:01:56.490> about<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
impressions on what I think about the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.090 
impressions on what I think about the
headphone<00:01:57.630> themselves<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.590> case<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
headphone themselves so the case is the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.190 
headphone themselves so the case is the
hardshell<00:01:59.579> case<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.899> be<00:02:00.990> more

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
hardshell case so it's going to be more

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.649 
hardshell case so it's going to be more
protection<00:02:01.740> rather<00:02:01.979> than<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.430> soft<00:02:03.149> cases<00:02:03.420> on

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
protection rather than the soft cases on

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.420 
protection rather than the soft cases on
the<00:02:03.689> other<00:02:03.960> devices<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.649> my<00:02:04.860> beats<00:02:05.159> wireless

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
the other devices like my beats wireless

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.700 
the other devices like my beats wireless
that<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.820> recently<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.390> box<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> hard

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
that I recently on box so it is a hard

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.010 
that I recently on box so it is a hard
shell<00:02:07.920> case<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.940> more<00:02:09.360> protective<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:09.929> as

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
shell case and is more protective but as

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.470 
shell case and is more protective but as
you<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.229> see<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.979> already<00:02:11.220> picking<00:02:11.760> up

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
you can see it's already picking up

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.170 
you can see it's already picking up
more<00:02:12.950> fingerprints<00:02:13.950> didn't<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.730> other<00:02:14.909> ones

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
more fingerprints didn't the other ones

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.000 
more fingerprints didn't the other ones
so<00:02:15.300> that's<00:02:15.629> probably<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.959> downfall<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.799> that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
so that's probably a downfall on that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.570 
so that's probably a downfall on that
one<00:02:17.220> but<00:02:17.879> let's<00:02:18.030> go<00:02:18.120> ahead<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.330> get<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.629> open

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
one but let's go ahead and get it open

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.680 
one but let's go ahead and get it open
once<00:02:20.580> again<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.849> is<00:02:20.909> my<00:02:21.060> first<00:02:21.299> time<00:02:21.450> seeing

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
once again this is my first time seeing

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.259 
once again this is my first time seeing
it<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.500> have<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> better<00:02:22.860> view<00:02:23.069> than<00:02:23.129> me<00:02:23.430> so

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
it and you have a better view than me so

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.740 
it and you have a better view than me so
whoa<00:02:25.170> these<00:02:25.709> must<00:02:25.920> look<00:02:26.099> pretty<00:02:26.159> nice<00:02:26.750> these

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
whoa these must look pretty nice these

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.160 
whoa these must look pretty nice these
must<00:02:28.170> look<00:02:28.440> nice<00:02:29.209> they<00:02:30.209> feel<00:02:30.480> nice<00:02:30.690> too<00:02:30.959> I

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
must look nice they feel nice too I

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.000 
must look nice they feel nice too I
think<00:02:31.459> think<00:02:32.459> yeah<00:02:32.790> these<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:34.049> cushions<00:02:34.860> on

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
think think yeah these the cushions on

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.800 
think think yeah these the cushions on
the<00:02:35.129> ears<00:02:35.340> feel<00:02:35.670> much<00:02:36.000> softer<00:02:36.480> than<00:02:36.480> they<00:02:36.750> do

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
the ears feel much softer than they do

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.770 
the ears feel much softer than they do
on<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.400> beats<00:02:38.400> wireless<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:39.209> I'm<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.569> beats

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
on the beats wireless but I'm the beats

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.770 
on the beats wireless but I'm the beats
wireless<00:02:40.079> it<00:02:40.920> feels<00:02:41.310> like<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.790> pushed<00:02:42.599> out

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
wireless it feels like it's pushed out

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.289 
wireless it feels like it's pushed out
more<00:02:43.110> but<00:02:43.470> i<00:02:43.739> think<00:02:44.280> these<00:02:44.610> feel<00:02:44.849> pretty<00:02:45.090> good

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
more but i think these feel pretty good

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.479 
more but i think these feel pretty good
and<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.660> black<00:02:45.870> looks<00:02:46.170> pretty<00:02:46.440> nice<00:02:46.650> like<00:02:47.400> I

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
and the black looks pretty nice like I

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.130 
and the black looks pretty nice like I
think<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.879> black<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.269> probably<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.720> best<00:02:48.900> car

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
think the black is probably the best car

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.650 
think the black is probably the best car
to<00:02:49.319> get<00:02:49.470> rather<00:02:49.829> then<00:02:50.519> if<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:50.940> don't<00:02:51.090> want<00:02:51.359> too

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
to get rather then if you don't want too

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.199 
to get rather then if you don't want too
much<00:02:51.920> fingerprints<00:02:52.920> then<00:02:53.190> black<00:02:53.879> probably

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
much fingerprints then black probably

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.539 
much fingerprints then black probably
won't<00:02:54.359> be<00:02:54.480> your<00:02:54.660> color<00:02:54.900> but<00:02:55.290> black<00:02:56.129> probably

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
won't be your color but black probably

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.670 
won't be your color but black probably
looks<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.879> best<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.239> me<00:02:57.420> because<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.170> red<00:02:58.470> and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
looks the best to me because the red and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.470 
looks the best to me because the red and
the<00:02:58.739> white<00:02:58.799> gonna<00:02:59.250> be<00:02:59.430> too<00:02:59.640> bright<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.000> I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
the white gonna be too bright and I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.479 
the white gonna be too bright and I
don't<00:03:01.109> know<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.410> just<00:03:01.470> like<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.890> black<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.280> best

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
don't know I just like to black the best

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.640 
don't know I just like to black the best
but<00:03:03.090> yeah<00:03:03.150> it's<00:03:03.359> just<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.660> quick<00:03:03.900> unboxing<00:03:04.109> of

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
but yeah it's just a quick unboxing of

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.559 
but yeah it's just a quick unboxing of
them<00:03:04.829> not<00:03:05.010> really<00:03:05.220> gonna<00:03:05.310> talk<00:03:05.579> much<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.450> to

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
them not really gonna talk much going to

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:07.880 
them not really gonna talk much going to
show<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.870> ports<00:03:07.170> on<00:03:07.379> them<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.650> things

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
show you the ports on them and things

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.770 
show you the ports on them and things
like<00:03:08.069> that<00:03:08.129> but<00:03:08.819> yeah<00:03:09.000> let's<00:03:09.239> go<00:03:09.599> ahead<00:03:09.690> and

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
like that but yeah let's go ahead and

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.960 
like that but yeah let's go ahead and
look<00:03:10.170> at<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:11.010> first<00:03:11.250> part<00:03:11.519> we<00:03:11.670> need<00:03:11.819> to

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
look at that the first part we need to

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.410 
look at that the first part we need to
well<00:03:12.690> let's<00:03:13.079> first<00:03:13.260> take<00:03:13.440> off<00:03:13.620> these<00:03:13.739> stickers

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
well let's first take off these stickers

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.349 
well let's first take off these stickers
so<00:03:15.420> we<00:03:15.540> can<00:03:15.660> look<00:03:15.840> at<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.140> famous<00:03:16.889> beats<00:03:17.730> logo

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
so we can look at the famous beats logo
