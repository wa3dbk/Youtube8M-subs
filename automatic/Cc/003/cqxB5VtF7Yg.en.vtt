00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
my hair and many a time but I just

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.210 
my hair and many a time but I just
thought<00:03:27.110> it's<00:03:27.290> appropriate<00:03:27.830> for<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.070> many

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
thought it's appropriate for so many

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.850 
thought it's appropriate for so many
different<00:03:28.489> sort<00:03:28.820> of<00:03:28.850> hair<00:03:29.090> types<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.860> hair

colors and all that sort of jazz and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.270 
colors and all that sort of jazz and
it's<00:03:32.989> just<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.230> really<00:03:33.410> good<00:03:33.590> universal
