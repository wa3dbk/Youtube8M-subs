system between the gopro hero2 and the

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.490 
system between the gopro hero2 and the
gopro<00:00:06.180> here<00:00:06.420> now<00:00:06.569> this<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.840> just<00:00:07.050> going<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.260> be

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
gopro here now this is just going to be

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.740 
gopro here now this is just going to be
basically<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.670> size<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.330> look<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.690> the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
basically the size and the look of the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.739 
basically the size and the look of the
two<00:00:09.929> cameras<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:11.030> going<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.089> start<00:00:12.389> here<00:00:12.570> this

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:12.749 
two cameras so going to start here this

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.600 
two cameras so going to start here this
is<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> new<00:00:13.110> hero<00:00:13.320> 2<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.280> my<00:00:14.400> old

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
is the new hero 2 and this is my old

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.270 
is the new hero 2 and this is my old
hero<00:00:14.969> one<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.410> I'm<00:00:16.710> just<00:00:16.800> going<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.010> open<00:00:17.039> up

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
hero one so I'm just going to open up

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.610 
hero one so I'm just going to open up
the<00:00:17.400> hero<00:00:17.550> 2<00:00:17.810> from<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.930> outside<00:00:19.290> that<00:00:19.410> two

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:19.620 
the hero 2 from the outside that two

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.350 
the hero 2 from the outside that two
cameras<00:00:19.980> are<00:00:20.160> basically<00:00:20.730> identical<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
cameras are basically identical the

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.910 
cameras are basically identical the
cases<00:00:21.720> are<00:00:21.810> exactly<00:00:22.200> the<00:00:22.350> same<00:00:22.380> if<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.800> have

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
cases are exactly the same if you have

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.320 
cases are exactly the same if you have
an<00:00:23.010> old<00:00:23.160> case<00:00:23.430> or<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.790> have<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.940> new<00:00:24.090> case

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
an old case or you have a new case

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.940 
an old case or you have a new case
either<00:00:24.540> camera<00:00:25.020> works<00:00:25.200> in<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.410> case<00:00:25.620> so<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
either camera works in the case so the

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.700 
either camera works in the case so the
cases<00:00:26.310> there's<00:00:26.460> no<00:00:26.550> difference<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.030> case

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
cases there's no difference in the case

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.190 
cases there's no difference in the case
there's<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.920> hero<00:00:29.100> 2<00:00:29.190> and<00:00:29.600> here<00:00:30.600> is<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.900> hero

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
there's the hero 2 and here is the hero

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.829 
there's the hero 2 and here is the hero
one<00:00:33.950> okay<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.370> from<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> front<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.570> only

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:36.839 
one okay so from the front the only

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:38.299 
one okay so from the front the only
difference<00:00:37.019> that<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.379> have<00:00:37.469> noticed<00:00:37.769> is<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
difference that I have noticed is the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.430 
difference that I have noticed is the
hero<00:00:38.789> 2<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.089> the<00:00:39.269> new<00:00:39.390> LED<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.109> bit<00:00:40.260> bigger

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
hero 2 is the new LED it's a bit bigger

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.500 
hero 2 is the new LED it's a bit bigger
on<00:00:40.589> the<00:00:40.620> front<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.300> buttons<00:00:42.300> have

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
on the front and the buttons have

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.060 
on the front and the buttons have
changed<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> new<00:00:43.199> buttons<00:00:43.559> are<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> little<00:00:43.920> bit

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
changed the new buttons are a little bit

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.259 
changed the new buttons are a little bit
different<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.460> think<00:00:44.519> they're<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.210> be

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
different I think they're going to be

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.090 
different I think they're going to be
easier<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.600> press<00:00:45.870> i<00:00:46.140> think<00:00:46.409> is<00:00:46.589> my<00:00:46.739> old<00:00:46.920> one

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
easier to press i think is my old one

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.009 
easier to press i think is my old one
sometimes<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:48.149> bit<00:00:48.300> hard<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.539> press<00:00:48.809> so

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
sometimes a little bit hard to press so

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.059 
sometimes a little bit hard to press so
I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:49.409> the<00:00:49.559> difference<00:00:49.739> there

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
I think that's the difference there

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:53.779 
I think that's the difference there
there's<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.690> black<00:00:51.690> ring<00:00:52.079> around<00:00:52.109> the<00:00:53.010> lens<00:00:53.309> on

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
there's a black ring around the lens on

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.200 
there's a black ring around the lens on
the<00:00:53.850> hero<00:00:54.120> 2<00:00:54.329> instead<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.749> a<00:00:55.850> camera<00:00:56.850> colored

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the hero 2 instead of a camera colored

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.319 
the hero 2 instead of a camera colored
one<00:00:57.359> on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.839> from<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.679> hero<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.069> I<00:00:59.329> don't

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
one on the from the hero one I don't

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.879 
one on the from the hero one I don't
know<00:01:00.420> why<00:01:00.569> that<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.809> I'm<00:01:01.170> expecting<00:01:01.710> something

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:01.889 
know why that is I'm expecting something

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:04.759 
know why that is I'm expecting something
to<00:01:02.010> do<00:01:02.129> with<00:01:02.249> reflection<00:01:03.290> if<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.409> flip<00:01:04.559> onto

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to do with reflection if we flip onto

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.370 
to do with reflection if we flip onto
the<00:01:04.890> top<00:01:05.129> will<00:01:05.850> notice<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.659> new<00:01:06.960> hero<00:01:07.170> 2

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the top will notice that the new hero 2

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.399 
the top will notice that the new hero 2
has<00:01:07.649> the<00:01:07.939> LED<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.149> there's<00:01:09.360> four<00:01:09.600> new<00:01:09.750> LEDs<00:01:10.170> or

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
has the LED now there's four new LEDs or

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.289 
has the LED now there's four new LEDs or
three<00:01:10.950> new<00:01:11.070> LEDs<00:01:11.399> on<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.610> camera<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> total

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
three new LEDs on the camera for a total

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.560 
three new LEDs on the camera for a total
of<00:01:12.360> four<00:01:12.570> LEDs<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.140> new<00:01:13.799> hero<00:01:14.009> 2<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.549> let<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
of four LEDs on new hero 2 to let you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.850 
of four LEDs on new hero 2 to let you
know<00:01:15.689> if<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:15.960> record<00:01:16.259> you're<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.409> from<00:01:16.649> any

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
know if your record you're not from any

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.230 
know if your record you're not from any
angle<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.159> look<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.460> camera<00:01:17.759> there's

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
angle you look at the camera there's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.499 
angle you look at the camera there's
again<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.140> new<00:01:19.289> button<00:01:20.360> microphones<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
again the new button microphones in the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.529 
again the new button microphones in the
same<00:01:21.659> spot<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.259> back<00:01:22.789> the<00:01:23.789> new<00:01:23.939> camera

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
same spot on the back the new camera

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.980 
same spot on the back the new camera
doesn't<00:01:25.079> have<00:01:25.289> the<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:27.090> resolutions<00:01:27.689> written

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
doesn't have the the resolutions written

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.109 
doesn't have the the resolutions written
down<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> old<00:01:28.560> cameras<00:01:28.920> did<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.280> for

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
down like the old cameras did so for

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
did find helpful but after a while i

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.550 
did find helpful but after a while i
eventually<00:01:35.640> had<00:01:35.820> them<00:01:36.030> memorized<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
eventually had them memorized on the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.010 
eventually had them memorized on the
bottom<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.250> notice<00:01:38.969> that<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.780> new

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
bottom you notice that the the new

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.690 
bottom you notice that the the new
camera<00:01:40.409> they<00:01:40.560> put<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> microphone<00:01:41.039> jack<00:01:41.430> or<00:01:41.670> a
