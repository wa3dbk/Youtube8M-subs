00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.140
 watch as you talk about the die layer on it 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.210
 have low functioning and that you really low up 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.870
 put low like the green 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.519
 shoot for the sky so here you have 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.440
 that first layer that is just one 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.640
 low and now you put these things 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.640
 exactly in this box 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.439
 well look I was already looking at a tree 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.510
 not not not just exactly for a cloud 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.609
 share time this mean they are getting one 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.399
 independent of each other so you tasty 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.360
 something new and he does along with that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.680
 first paint 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.750
 so you would do something heavy with that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.180
 and you would put it over the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.860
 the whole to show as low as white then 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.890
 that on that spaciousness no nets with 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.570
 I looked at your other paintings, yes 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.539
 you look through it must look exactly 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.879
 With you it is true that you have a first 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.239
 made low and you have a lot of colors 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.059
 and 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.680
 very present and if you already have their second 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.989
 low and in this case it is black and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.440
 the white will do then it becomes whole 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.440
 difficult 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.939
 then you made yourself very tired name 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.979
 give left 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.450
 yes so that's why i had to say that first 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.189
 I do not really want to be dominant 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.700
 I say the first layer is simple 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.920
 really loves it not too hard either 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.770
 too many colors not too thick 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.630
 then the second layer is always cool and yes 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.240
 you can do two things that is or 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.220
 you switch if you think we are up 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.750
 opgrimbie louche you lose the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.000
 crypt 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.490
 because the first layer was freely present 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.150
 fur and and here you have that and then 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.650
 so much is happening that you actually 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.720
 able to say i switched and i switched 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.070
 makes everything the first one again 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.860
 low say attention and cooking 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.840
 yes just saying goodbye and another one 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.640
 Hope learned been fun working out 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.110
 try again a new try 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.549
 you keep that clarity in it 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.549
 that well 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.100
 then continue with one of those doors 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.229
 so it could be the easiest and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.360
 herre just damp quarters and I 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.250
 pull that you and you just see what i am 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.110
 do and one can turn brown 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.240
 you weigh it off with a cloth 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.890
 you can also say with that did previous 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.959
 with your previous wipe, too 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.830
 one at once what beautiful that is also with 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.670
 black and white then you remember that 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.140
 and you could apply that 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.640
 so here you have some what you get out of 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.560
 you can iron it so you would have them there 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.880
 can also be able to apply and look 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.230
 but what happens and look carefully what is 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.870
 happens look what beautiful look it is 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.300
 beautiful you do not equal the beautiful things 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.580
 arise here you 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.920
 michael you you can see what's happening 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.560
 of your powder 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.750
 QC is pudding to tops that injury 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.430
 eloleo 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.570
 the medical the far who specimen and 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.070
 Islands 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.830
 yes it is it is it is an island him 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.420
 and it would be you with the green 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.730
 You can do it to the whole 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.740
 but you can also say I do 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.730
 with a new layer the top I draw 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.730
 it together 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.310
 why wait until it is dry you can 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.209
 work wet on wet and yes that's two 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.570
 frank heavens yes yes yes I think and 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.470
 some blush and just need a little dad 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.670
 come here 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.670
 yes but maybe very exciting 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.720
 and with that you would say this one 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.060
 and that world can connect and 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.000
 as a new gap on a completely different one 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.320
 apply the capacity and try 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.320
 connecting those two worlds 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.709
 look look look look 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.709
 so very loving 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.760
 year all my tips is already 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.769
 here you have table channel yes this 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.510
 that it's just that way 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.860
 choose it again because it's it 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:54.000
 one new layer is therefore another 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.000
 direction that right yes 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.720
 and there he goes 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.990
 this is very beautiful you can for example 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.470
 by going with the sharp object 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.870
 to draw 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.830
 yes as she does you can go things 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.770
 to connect 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.720
 but you can also put some what paint on that 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.530
 sharp objects and that is what 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.530
 draw lines 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.810
 look 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.310
 Yes 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.440
 i have to care around the corner including one too 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.620
 do it if you fancy is the right hair too 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.620
 to give 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.750
 you are not happy with that painting you 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.100
 I think you think it's the will of 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.110
 you think or because of that you have no 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.110
 not happy with that 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:14.310
 nice well yes men who release again no no 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.800
 no i should not have done that i think 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.440
 these are island house point you come 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.320
 from that the same interesting point 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.960
 actually again yes indeed 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.220
 so how colorful the first substrate is 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.670
 one works there or you are 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.620
 yes there is the choice for you 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:37.050
 bring ali to a very smooth one 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:41.630
 easy surface to the direction 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:43.710
 so it is horizontal vertically you see 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.870
 that very many people are inclined to the 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.180
 use only those two directions 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.810
 oh have full the battery sources for yes yes 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.180
 yes yes 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:55.590
 keys they prices is little earthy 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:03.300
 commit correctly 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:05.420
 sometimes we play run afraid that has 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.420
 everybody 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.370
 so and after cooking we can work 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.070
 Note that legally 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.380
 smart very big it you don't have 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.720
 here with the whole plate and then doctors or 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.040
 Continue to start all mail we 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.670
