00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.780
 two 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.880
 hello what about guys if you have an action 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.250
 and today we are in a new video of gta 5 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.930
 online and I know I've been a week without 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.450
 upload not a single video but the truth is 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.660
 that there is a good reason I got really bad 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.210
 and I did not feel like playing the game or 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.590
 to get me to edit anyway I was 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.050
 with the fatal throat and could not 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.220
 comment anything and well do not think that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.070
 our nothing is worth you 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.570
 answering almost everyone to the sketch of 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.090
 byn matthews all comics state 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.430
 sending messages and such and I was also 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.129
 trying a couple of stunts but 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.710
 basically one of them during these 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.629
 seven days in total I will have dedicated 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.150
 about 14 hours for you to see what it is 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.460
 a lot of time for a single acrobatics 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.650
 and he has not been able to is a very acrobatic 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.620
 difficult I have a friend called us usa 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.199
 mix that has achieved but in 14 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.690
 hours I have not been able to have all been 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.309
 the failures and in principle that was the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.080
 acrobatics I had thought for the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.180
 first episode of challenges and acrobatics 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.550
 that's why you have not seen any 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.530
 previous week and good 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.030
 and we leave the explanation and in the video 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.920
 Today I'm going to show you how to walk 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.870
 below the map after the patch is not 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.730
 as good as the previous trick but 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.260
 good you have to come to that 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.610
 location that I have taught you can you 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.800
 come here swimming from the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.420
 heliport or you can directly come 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.910
 from this road but it has to be 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.940
 in this exact location we throw ourselves 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.500
 to the east tunnel where there is green water 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.150
 we walk a little towards this 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
 opening and we give the square to 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.730
 go up now we go to the left and 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.230
 very carefully, slowly 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.210
 we went through this wall here and we 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.240
 we will stay in the water now what we are going to 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.010
 to do is go swimming but try not to 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.420
 fall you neither for the right nor we left 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.940
 on the left it is worth continuing this 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.670
 sort of hallway and when you get to 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.640
 these shrubs you are looking for is worth or istanbul 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.740
 is and let's go a little deep 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.930
 not too much but we have to leave 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.870
 a little deep to go below the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.030
 soil and then keep us as straight 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.190
 possible to move to the next hallway 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.470
 is valid for the next plot 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.610
 and remember not to fall down or on the right 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.160
 nor for the left 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.410
 now we have to get to this 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.600
 bridge here is worth that black line that 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.150
 You see in the minimap and once we are 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.850
 in that location that is here 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.350
 right here what we are going to do is go 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.090
 for the right of that area where 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.880
 you see that there is no water that is directly 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.710
 we just throw ourselves and we give the X 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.410
 to open the parachute as soon as possible 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.780
 better if you do not have a parachute the trick 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.510
 it can not be done and as you can see we open the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.130
 parachute we look towards the area in the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.040
 we've thrown it's the bridge 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.630
 and then we will fall in this is what you are 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.220
 seeing that I have discovered that there is a 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.720
 kind of bridges under the map 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.150
 I was just doing the trick of 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.670
 water the break I fell and I saw that there was 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.770
 this that does not paint anything here and at 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.810
 end get me up if you go for 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.000
 in front what will happen is that you go 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.250
 to put as in the water if you go back to the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.170
 back, then you can directly 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.240
 catch oxygen again and stand 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.580
 shoot up as you are going to see 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.010
 now 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.540
 and the whole thing and we can not only 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.580
 to be on this bridge is now worth 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.920
 I will show the areas by which we can 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.570
 go as you are seeing if we get 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.990
 towards the water and we turn to the left 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.820
 we can go to the other bridge and as 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.500
 in the previous one there is a part in which 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.970
 there is water and another one where we can go 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.050
 walking 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.630
 we just go a little bit to 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.330
 go ahead as you are seeing and we can already 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.690
 to walk normally recover the 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.250
 oxygen and shoot from here not now 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.050
 I will show some areas by 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.940
 that you should not go, you can swim 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.650
 a little bit by the water and you can be 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.780
 here all the time you want but if 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.450
 you pass the area of ​​water is to do 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.370
 well here you are going to fall down if you do not 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.070
 you have seen well how I have opened 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.080
 parachute and how we got it is worth what 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.180
 said we simply throw ourselves open 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.030
 as soon as the parachute and once 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.459
 be open and let us see below 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.190
 of the map and we direct it towards 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.480
 the bridges these are worth in principle this 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.040
 It can only be done in the old 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.990
 generation because the new generation 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.540
 it surely disappears you can not 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.700
 to cross but I hope you like it 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.269
 the video that you like to subscribe if 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.940
 you are not 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.209
 2 share with friends and bye bye 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.209
