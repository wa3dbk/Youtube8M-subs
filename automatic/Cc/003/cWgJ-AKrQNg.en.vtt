Year's so back in December and it's now
March<00:00:57.030> I've<00:00:57.480> used<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> couple<00:00:58.170> months

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
say it it's a gateway epilator meaning

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.640 
say it it's a gateway epilator meaning
that<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.460> good<00:01:11.790> for<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.330> first<00:01:12.570> time<00:01:12.869> user<00:01:12.900> but

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that it's good for a first time user but

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.090 
that it's good for a first time user but

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
to run it over the area maybe for me

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.550 
to run it over the area maybe for me
usually<00:01:49.619> about<00:01:50.270> two

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
usually about two

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.219 
usually about two
three<00:01:51.829> times<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:53.149> get<00:01:53.329> some<00:01:53.570> of<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.810> hair<00:01:54.079> off

three times to get some of the hair off

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.010 
three times to get some of the hair off
but<00:01:54.619> for<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:54.890> most<00:01:55.100> part<00:01:55.450> it's<00:01:56.450> really<00:01:56.810> good

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
but for the most part it's really good

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.520 
but for the most part it's really good
and<00:01:57.409> for<00:01:57.979> me<00:01:58.189> when<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.670> first<00:01:59.000> started<00:01:59.299> I<00:02:00.020> used
