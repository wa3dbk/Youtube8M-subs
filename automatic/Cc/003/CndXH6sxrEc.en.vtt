 which star somehow does not seem to be 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.830
 Idea of ​​old car tires or just it 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.830

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.900
 heart is not saying anything 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.640
 cool part with Scherf and still calm 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.260
 a bit hard but as I said 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.480
 bring it with opportunity only a good one 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.660
 sharpness with pure 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.660
