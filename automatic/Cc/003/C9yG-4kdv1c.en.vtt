00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.490
 the Tokyo Game Show 2013 has opened 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.350
 officially the doors with the keynote of 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.600
 sony then sony opened the dances 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.520
 of the most important fair as far as 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.350
 regards the Asian market by giving 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.050
 some additional information for 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.550
 as far as playstation 4 is concerned 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.989
 last September 9 there was one 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.170
 conference that announced date 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.030
 of output and price in the rising sun 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.320
 in this case there were some 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.379
 updates on all 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.239
 social features and also of 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.280
 functionality of the console and of course 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.210
 there was a spot dedicated to the market 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.950
 Japanese 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.850
 we are talking about a commercial of course 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.170
 as that character has characters 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.239
 Japanese Japanese people but in the 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.670
 reality then how the video was mounted 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.430
 quite American western music 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.670
 and of course that was a little clear 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.990
 all the most important features 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.950
 most important regarding 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.810
 playstation 4 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.660
 for example at some point these 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.119
 university students arrive where it is 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.950
 the home of the university itself and do 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.650
 a kind of kingson shadows tournament 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.200
 fall with the possibility precisely to have 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.970
 to see people who live 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.619
 they also play at distance one of the 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.939
 more interesting features more 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.380
 important in regards to 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.659
 playstation 4 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.729
 on the stage then andrew house went up 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.140
 sony computer president 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.659
 entertainment that showed off a 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.939
 perfect Japanese making us even a 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.650
 to say the truth that said 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.869
 obviously he made a king cup of all 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.630
 the features of playstation 4 and ha 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.200
 spoke together with then to the president of 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.360
 business 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.729
 here in Japan he also delegates the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.700
 very very close relationship by 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.930
 sony with independent developers e 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.689
 also in this case there was a 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.340
 trailer that made some a king chief a 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.250
 a summary of all the titles 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.049
 developed independent that will arrive 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.210
 on playstation 4 we saw many 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.680
 interesting titles that we already have 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.259
 seen maybe at cologne gamescom 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.620
 we are talking about el divers or di 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.540
 odyssey or will say in this title that 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.570
 he put himself somewhere between shadow of 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.010
 the colossus and I say that a little will come 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.090
 probably next year on 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.040
 playstation 4 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.590
 so also in this case too 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.640
 Japan confirmed the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.860
 developer support 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.660
 independent and then there was perhaps the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.030
 most interesting part as far as we are concerned 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.489
 concerns also because new or one 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.860
 demo a couple of shuhei demos 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.780
 yoshida we all know by now the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.819
 president of sony worldwide studios 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.319
 first showed the application 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.390
 playstation the one that will arrive at 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.260
 launch of the application console that 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.400
 works both on ios on android and 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.190
 will allow a lot of features 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.150
 a bit like smart class a little for how much 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.310
 it's about new things 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.170
 first it will act as a screen 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.849
 secondary for playstation 4 then 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.069
 can be used as a controller 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.910
 remote to move inside the 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.680
 consul 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.519
 and then this playstation up will allow 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.569
 to check the trophies for purchases 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.700
 see a little what i am doing 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.450
 own friends then status of their own 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.890
 friends 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.180
 if they are connected on facebook and twitter 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.579
 but also what they are playing 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.530
 what they shared and see it 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.610
 directly in real time also a 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.680
 distance 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.260
 the interface is very similar of course 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.640
 to the playstation 4 dashboard remembers 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.400
 also in some ways various youtube 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.230
 company seems to be interesting for 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.319
 obviously extend the use of 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.959
 playstation 4 even when you're not playing 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.319
 in real time not just because 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.459
 we would have control is possible for example 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.590
 interface with playstation eye with 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.989
 with this series of minigames called 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.269
 playroom and use the camera 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.220
 of the smartphone itself to a certain 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.709
 point I left then drew a 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.169
 cute little man who remembers some is 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.970
 that the game developed by marx ernst e 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:57.579
 then he launched it directly with one 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.109
 slide into the play room this 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.579
 this is precisely this series of demos 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.620
 techniques that will come to the launch of 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.970
 playstation 4 which will be included in 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.650
 playstation 4 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.299
 many small nice features 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.859
 and we'll see if it's useful for sure 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.139
 the possibility of being able to manage the 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:14.470
 own account distance on 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.459
 smartphone and on tablets and well-liked to 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.410
 hundred percent 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.720
 dulcis in fundo we talked about 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.849
 playstation life tv playstation types from 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.280
 tv and this sort of little box that yes 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.060
 connects precisely to the TV through a 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.490
 hdmi socket 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.870
 the interesting thing is that it has a 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.880
 hardware very similar to the console 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.289
 sony portable and also allows 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.180
 play directly on the TV 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.220
 attaching a pad to the titles 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.500
 playstation life that do not need 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.540
 of the touch screen another thing very much 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.090
 interesting a bit like we have with 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.820
 the tv app with chrome cast with the rock box 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.650
 you can view video services 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.930
 audio directly on the console so 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.760
 you access complex summits to your own 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.350
 account playstation network you can 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.260
 see America for example netflix 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.660
 youtube and company without having to 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.490
 obviously use other set top boxes 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.750
 without having to connect the laptop or 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.730
 whatever 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.080
 and still the remote play maybe the 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.210
 possibility to control motorbike is the 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.430
 most interesting thing you can connect 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.290
 to playstation 4 and play titles 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.110
 playstation 4 remote so if ad 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.090
 example you have playstation 4 in the living room e 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.980
 one of your relatives boy or 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.020
 whatever else he has to play on the TV wants 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.520
 watch TV and do anything else you can 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.140
 connect with playstation vita tv 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.820
 from the small room for example from the 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.470
 little room and play the titles 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.160
 playstation 4 continue also the 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.750
 game without a shot being fired even online 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.250
 obviously we do not know in Italy how 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.930
 this stuff might work because 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.180
 unfortunately our ciampino connections 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.950
 very high but we can confirm you 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.180
 that playstation life tv will also arrive 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.280
 in Italy next year 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.990
 Japan will arrive on October 20 has a 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.450
 cost of 80 euros at the exchange rate therefore 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.130
 low enough it will also come from us and 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.900
 surely it can be a contraption 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.690
 interesting hardware device because 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.430
 in fact, the games are played 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.680
 playstation life you play the remote 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.510
 those ps3 ps4 we'll see 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.220
 the conference therefore ended with 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.200
 playstation vita tv and continued 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.270
 instead with data related to the market 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.850
 Japanese is less interesting for us 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.800
 then the fair is open then us 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.720
 we continue our search 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.070
 of some interesting pearl for 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.070
 playstation and other devices 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:53.750
 sweet chocolate ice cream a little salty 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:56.690
 to chocolate ice cream 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.650
 if you don't watch that chaos will be cocks 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.650
 word of grace
