nice it really helps to press your
forearm<00:02:20.099> into<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.879> mat<00:02:21.060> as<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.299> lift<00:02:21.749> your

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
forearm into the mat as you lift your

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.559

heels now this is a really tough pose I

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.970 
heels now this is a really tough pose I
think<00:02:27.870> people<00:02:27.989> tend<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.319> compensate<00:02:28.859> by

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
think people tend to compensate by

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.949 
think people tend to compensate by
dropping<00:02:29.519> their<00:02:29.670> hip<00:02:29.969> so<00:02:30.480> how<00:02:30.629> do<00:02:30.689> you<00:02:30.780> prevent

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
dropping their hip so how do you prevent

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.839 
dropping their hip so how do you prevent
that<00:02:31.260> will<00:02:31.530> keep<00:02:31.709> rebounding<00:02:32.340> off<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.609> the<00:02:32.700> mat

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
that will keep rebounding off of the mat

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.459 
that will keep rebounding off of the mat
as<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.060> lift<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.659> underside<00:02:34.049> of<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.260> waist
