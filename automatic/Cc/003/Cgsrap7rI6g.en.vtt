00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.999 
would pay attention to that okay now I'm
pretty<00:01:48.689> much<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.320> same<00:01:49.470> spot<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.979> I

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
pretty much just in the same spot that I

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.520 
pretty much just in the same spot that I
was<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.490> whenever<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.299> post<00:01:51.479> whenever<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.439> in

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
was in whenever I post whenever I was in

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.580 
was in whenever I post whenever I was in
the<00:01:52.619> last<00:01:52.799> scene<00:01:53.479> but<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.869> little<00:01:55.200> ledge

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the last scene but this little ledge

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.940 
the last scene but this little ledge
right<00:01:55.950> here<00:01:57.079> once<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.200> jump<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
right here once you jump over that and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.490 
right here once you jump over that and
come<00:01:59.189> onto<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.610> side<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.030> map<00:02:00.259> you<00:02:01.259> can't

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
come onto this side of the map you can't

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.380 
come onto this side of the map you can't
get<00:02:01.619> back<00:02:01.770> over<00:02:01.979> there<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.850> if<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.210> want<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
get back over there so if you want to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.310 
get back over there so if you want to
hit<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> mystery<00:02:03.960> box

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
hit the mystery box

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.889 
hit the mystery box
I<00:02:04.439> suggest<00:02:04.829> hitting<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:05.719> going<00:02:06.719> over

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
I suggest hitting it and then going over

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.449 
I suggest hitting it and then going over
here<00:02:07.200> because<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.409> cannot<00:02:07.740> go<00:02:07.950> back<00:02:08.099> and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
here because you cannot go back and

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.609 
here because you cannot go back and
there<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.420> weapons<00:02:09.780> around<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> map

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
there are weapons around the map

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.949 
there are weapons around the map
it's<00:02:10.940> it's<00:02:11.940> definitely<00:02:12.420> recommended<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
it's it's definitely recommended that

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.440 
it's it's definitely recommended that

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
you get a a pretty good gun from the box

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.930 
you get a a pretty good gun from the box
if<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:15.989> your<00:02:16.200> first<00:02:16.230> time<00:02:16.560> play<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.760> buy<00:02:17.909> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
well right here I kind of itch my way

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.210 
well right here I kind of itch my way
over<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.420> edge<00:02:27.450> see<00:02:28.440> if<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.590> can<00:02:28.709> get<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:28.950> perk

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
over the edge see if I can get this perk

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.550 
over the edge see if I can get this perk
and<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.700> actually<00:02:29.819> can<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.780> anything<00:02:31.140> like<00:02:31.290> it's

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and I actually can so anything like it's

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.649 
and I actually can so anything like it's
very<00:02:31.829> close<00:02:32.099> you<00:02:32.489> can<00:02:32.700> get<00:02:32.879> there<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.540> any

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
very close you can get there and any

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.180 
very close you can get there and any
teammates<00:02:34.049> that<00:02:34.200> crawl<00:02:34.500> over<00:02:34.530> there<00:02:34.890> they're

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
teammates that crawl over there they're

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.699 
teammates that crawl over there they're
down<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.940> be<00:02:36.030> revived<00:02:36.360> as<00:02:36.629> well<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.620> very

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
down can be revived as well so it's very

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.610 
down can be revived as well so it's very
convenient<00:02:38.129> if<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.909> decide<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.409> split<00:02:40.409> up<00:02:40.500> I

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
convenient if you decide to split up I

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.589 
convenient if you decide to split up I
suppose<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.670> only<00:02:41.909> way<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.060> get<00:02:42.269> out<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.390> that

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
suppose the only way to get out of that

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.449 
suppose the only way to get out of that
room<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.170> go<00:02:43.290> down<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.950> elevator<00:02:44.099> shaft

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
room is to go down the elevator shaft

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.670 
room is to go down the elevator shaft
right<00:02:44.819> here<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.720> wanted<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:45.989> be<00:02:46.049> very<00:02:46.109> careful

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
won't jump down one at a time just

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.119 
won't jump down one at a time just
because<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.540> go<00:02:48.629> down<00:02:48.810> very<00:02:49.650> very<00:02:49.920> easily

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
because you can go down very very easily

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.729 
because you can go down very very easily
from<00:02:50.370> falling<00:02:50.730> damage<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.379> there<00:02:52.379> are<00:02:52.500> parts

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
you will slide down but that is how the

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.030 
you will slide down but that is how the
map<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.959> intended<00:02:55.349> to<00:02:55.409> be<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.310> do<00:02:57.239> not<00:02:57.390> worry

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
you decide to lone-wolf it even though

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.879 
you decide to lone-wolf it even though
like<00:05:15.540> I<00:05:15.570> said<00:05:15.780> earlier<00:05:16.020> it's<00:05:16.200> not<00:05:16.380> recommended

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
like I said earlier it's not recommended

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:18.890 
like I said earlier it's not recommended
okay<00:05:17.760> now<00:05:17.850> right<00:05:18.000> here<00:05:18.150> I<00:05:18.210> won't<00:05:18.419> be<00:05:18.539> jumping

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
okay now right here I won't be jumping

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.500 
okay now right here I won't be jumping
onto<00:05:19.050> an<00:05:19.260> elevator<00:05:19.700> you<00:05:20.700> can't<00:05:21.210> jump<00:05:21.360> onto

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
onto an elevator you can't jump onto

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.850 
onto an elevator you can't jump onto
that<00:05:21.690> one<00:05:21.840> down<00:05:21.930> there<00:05:22.110> but<00:05:22.289> you<00:05:22.320> will<00:05:22.530> take

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
that one down there but you will take

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.070 
that one down there but you will take
some<00:05:23.039> damage<00:05:23.190> or<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.330> can<00:05:24.479> take<00:05:24.780> one<00:05:24.990> that's

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
some damage or you can take one that's

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.100 
some damage or you can take one that's
going<00:05:25.380> up<00:05:25.680> which<00:05:26.130> I<00:05:26.340> happen<00:05:26.640> to<00:05:26.669> do<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.270> there

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
going up which I happen to do and there

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.650 
going up which I happen to do and there
are<00:05:28.200> two<00:05:28.320> levels<00:05:28.650> above<00:05:28.979> the<00:05:29.160> second<00:05:29.550> floor

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
are two levels above the second floor

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.630 
are two levels above the second floor
there<00:05:30.660> is<00:05:30.840> kind<00:05:31.350> of<00:05:31.380> like<00:05:31.500> a<00:05:31.560> random<00:05:31.919> level<00:05:32.610> I

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
there is kind of like a random level I

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.820 
there is kind of like a random level I
suppose<00:05:32.940> that<00:05:33.630> has<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:33.930> staircase<00:05:34.470> which<00:05:34.650> leads

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
suppose that has a staircase which leads

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.170 
suppose that has a staircase which leads
up<00:05:35.010> to<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.250> roof<00:05:36.140> no<00:05:37.430> way<00:05:38.430> that<00:05:38.580> this<00:05:38.669> works<00:05:38.940> is

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
up to the roof no way that this works is

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.100 
up to the roof no way that this works is
I<00:05:39.450> believe<00:05:39.919> you<00:05:40.919> go<00:05:41.100> from<00:05:41.340> bottom<00:05:41.669> to<00:05:42.210> the

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
I believe you go from bottom to the

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.810 
I believe you go from bottom to the
second<00:05:43.470> floor<00:05:44.479> to<00:05:45.479> the<00:05:45.510> bottom<00:05:46.250> to<00:05:47.250> the<00:05:47.430> third

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
second floor to the bottom to the third

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.969 
second floor to the bottom to the third
floor<00:05:48.060> and<00:05:49.039> then<00:05:50.039> to<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.460> bottom<00:05:50.850> to<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.479> roof

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
floor and then to the bottom to the roof

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.070 
floor and then to the bottom to the roof
and<00:05:52.979> then<00:05:53.280> after<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:53.880> I'm<00:05:54.270> not<00:05:54.479> sure<00:05:54.780> exactly

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
and then after that I'm not sure exactly

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.140 
and then after that I'm not sure exactly
but<00:05:56.270> there<00:05:57.270> will<00:05:57.419> be<00:05:57.450> a<00:05:57.539> noise<00:05:59.000> that<00:06:00.000> will

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
but there will be a noise that will

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.029 
but there will be a noise that will
notify<00:06:00.510> you<00:06:00.690> that<00:06:00.840> that<00:06:01.139> you're<00:06:01.620> basically

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
notify you that that you're basically

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.310 
notify you that that you're basically
about<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.490> crash<00:06:02.729> it<00:06:03.720> will<00:06:03.780> just<00:06:03.930> be<00:06:04.080> a<00:06:04.110> very

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
about the crash it will just be a very

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.650 
about the crash it will just be a very
light<00:06:04.590> beeping<00:06:04.979> sounds<00:06:05.370> very<00:06:05.970> rapid<00:06:06.389> beeping

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
light beeping sounds very rapid beeping

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.560 
light beeping sounds very rapid beeping

elevator

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.580 
elevator
now<00:06:22.890> even<00:06:23.700> though

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
now even though

of<00:06:27.080> how<00:06:27.170> you<00:06:27.230> can<00:06:27.410> tell<00:06:27.620> whether<00:06:27.950> or<00:06:28.070> not

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
of how you can tell whether or not

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.480 
of how you can tell whether or not
you're<00:06:29.270> going<00:06:29.360> to<00:06:29.420> be<00:06:29.480> going<00:06:29.720> up<00:06:30.020> or<00:06:30.260> down<00:06:30.490> or

you're going to be going up or down or

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.010 
you're going to be going up or down or
whether<00:06:31.790> you'll<00:06:32.000> be<00:06:32.060> crashing<00:06:32.540> up<00:06:32.720> or<00:06:32.900> down

whether you'll be crashing up or down

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.070 
whether you'll be crashing up or down
rather<00:06:33.460> if<00:06:34.460> you<00:06:35.000> are<00:06:35.150> in<00:06:35.240> the<00:06:35.390> situation<00:06:35.660> so

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
rather if you are in the situation so

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.040 
rather if you are in the situation so
basically<00:06:36.890> if<00:06:37.580> you<00:06:37.640> can<00:06:37.820> see<00:06:38.060> on<00:06:38.330> the<00:06:38.540> elevator

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
basically if you can see on the elevator

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.530 
basically if you can see on the elevator
door<00:06:39.350> right<00:06:39.860> there<00:06:40.040> right<00:06:40.640> above<00:06:40.820> it<00:06:40.970> there

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
door right there right above it there

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.390 
door right there right above it there
are<00:06:41.660> the<00:06:41.750> two<00:06:41.900> arrows<00:06:42.200> once<00:06:42.500> pointing<00:06:42.860> up<00:06:42.980> once

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
are the two arrows once pointing up once

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.130 
are the two arrows once pointing up once
pointing<00:06:43.790> down<00:06:43.940> obviously

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.140 
pointing down obviously

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.370 
pointing down obviously
whichever<00:06:45.740> one's<00:06:45.950> illuminated<00:06:46.550> means<00:06:47.380> which

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
whichever one's illuminated means which

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.560 
whichever one's illuminated means which
direction<00:06:48.740> the<00:06:49.190> elevator<00:06:49.580> is<00:06:49.820> moving<00:06:49.850> in<00:06:50.390> or

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
direction the elevator is moving in or

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.350 
direction the elevator is moving in or
which<00:06:50.720> direction<00:06:51.020> it<00:06:51.290> will<00:06:51.560> move<00:06:52.220> in<00:06:52.370> it

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
which direction it will move in it

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.580 
which direction it will move in it
doesn't<00:06:53.630> necessarily<00:06:54.140> mean<00:06:54.290> that<00:06:54.350> the

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
doesn't necessarily mean that the

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.440 
doesn't necessarily mean that the
elevator<00:06:54.980> is<00:06:55.190> always<00:06:55.550> in<00:06:55.670> motion<00:06:55.820> so<00:06:56.270> just

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450 
elevator is always in motion so just

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.450 
elevator is always in motion so just
keep<00:06:56.600> that<00:06:56.750> in<00:06:56.810> mind<00:06:57.110> and<00:06:57.890> sometimes<00:06:58.280> the

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
keep that in mind and sometimes the

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.040 
keep that in mind and sometimes the
elevator<00:06:58.790> won't<00:06:58.940> even<00:06:59.120> be<00:06:59.240> there<00:06:59.450> I<00:06:59.660> think<00:06:59.840> it

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
elevator won't even be there I think it

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.570 
elevator won't even be there I think it
won't<00:07:00.170> even<00:07:00.350> be<00:07:00.590> rendered<00:07:00.950> so<00:07:01.160> you'll<00:07:01.310> just<00:07:01.400> be

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
won't even be rendered so you'll just be

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.180 
won't even be rendered so you'll just be
jumping<00:07:01.940> down<00:07:02.060> into<00:07:02.270> a<00:07:02.300> pit<00:07:02.510> of<00:07:02.570> nothingness

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
jumping down into a pit of nothingness

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:24.980 
I'm gonna play this very slowly just so

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.220 
I'm gonna play this very slowly just so
you<00:07:25.100> can<00:07:25.220> see<00:07:25.430> the<00:07:26.030> pack<00:07:26.210> lunch<00:07:26.450> is<00:07:26.690> in<00:07:26.840> fact<00:07:27.050> in

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.230 
you can see the pack lunch is in fact in

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.370 
you can see the pack lunch is in fact in
the<00:07:27.320> elevator<00:07:27.680> on<00:07:27.860> the<00:07:27.980> left<00:07:28.570> it'll<00:07:29.570> go<00:07:29.870> around

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:30.380 
the elevator on the left it'll go around

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.410 
the elevator on the left it'll go around
to<00:07:30.650> random<00:07:31.010> elevators<00:07:31.550> just<00:07:31.880> like<00:07:32.240> you<00:07:32.330> have

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:32.420 
to random elevators just like you have

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.930 
to random elevators just like you have
the<00:07:32.510> perks<00:07:32.750> too<00:07:32.980> so<00:07:33.980> it's<00:07:34.400> very<00:07:34.550> hard<00:07:34.820> to

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:34.940 
the perks too so it's very hard to

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.570 
the perks too so it's very hard to
predict<00:07:35.240> where<00:07:35.690> each<00:07:36.620> perk<00:07:36.890> will<00:07:37.040> be<00:07:37.160> or<00:07:37.430> where

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:37.580 
predict where each perk will be or where

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.250 
predict where each perk will be or where
the<00:07:37.700> pack<00:07:37.850> a<00:07:37.880> punch<00:07:38.150> will<00:07:38.300> be<00:07:38.420> okay<00:07:38.870> so<00:07:38.930> right

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:39.260 
the pack a punch will be okay so right

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.900 
the pack a punch will be okay so right
here<00:07:39.440> I<00:07:39.470> am<00:07:39.770> kind<00:07:40.250> of<00:07:40.340> running<00:07:40.520> a<00:07:40.580> little<00:07:40.700> bit

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:40.910 
here I am kind of running a little bit

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.790 
here I am kind of running a little bit
of<00:07:40.970> a<00:07:41.030> circle<00:07:41.300> routes<00:07:41.600> this<00:07:42.170> is<00:07:42.320> on<00:07:42.440> top<00:07:42.620> of<00:07:42.650> the

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 
of a circle routes this is on top of the

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.980 
of a circle routes this is on top of the
roof<00:07:43.010> and<00:07:43.850> there's<00:07:44.120> only<00:07:44.210> one<00:07:44.510> window<00:07:44.690> behind

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:44.990 
roof and there's only one window behind

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.420 
roof and there's only one window behind
you<00:07:45.230> so<00:07:45.500> if<00:07:45.740> you<00:07:45.830> would<00:07:45.950> get<00:07:46.040> three<00:07:46.250> people

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:46.430 
you so if you would get three people

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.400 
you so if you would get three people
watch<00:07:47.150> the<00:07:47.330> front<00:07:47.540> in<00:07:47.660> one<00:07:47.810> person<00:07:48.080> watch<00:07:48.230> the

watch the front in one person watch the

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.500 
watch the front in one person watch the
back<00:07:48.530> window<00:07:48.830> actually<00:07:49.700> be<00:07:49.790> a<00:07:49.820> decent<00:07:49.850> spot<00:07:50.360> if

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.510 
back window actually be a decent spot if

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.200 
back window actually be a decent spot if
you<00:07:50.600> would<00:07:50.720> like<00:07:50.870> to<00:07:50.990> camp<00:07:51.200> there<00:07:51.470> and<00:07:52.090> this<00:07:53.090> is
