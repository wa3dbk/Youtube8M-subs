coming<00:00:32.850> our<00:00:33.059> way<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.630> know<00:00:33.750> maybe<00:00:33.960> being

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
coming our way but you know maybe being

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.479 
coming our way but you know maybe being
pessimistic<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> good<00:00:34.980> way<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.130> come<00:00:35.370> into

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
pessimistic is a good way to come into

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.430 
pessimistic is a good way to come into
this<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.270> will<00:00:36.420> pick<00:00:36.630> something<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.170> so

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
this and we will pick something up so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.740 
this and we will pick something up so
there<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:37.649> go<00:00:38.030> nothing<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.239> pack<00:00:39.510> can't

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
there we go nothing in this pack can't

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.209 
there we go nothing in this pack can't
be<00:00:39.840> asked<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.110> keep<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> managed<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> contract

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
be asked to keep the managed to contract

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.760 
be asked to keep the managed to contract
so<00:00:41.340> we'll<00:00:41.460> keep<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:42.000> though<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:43.230> then

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
so we'll keep that one though and then

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.080 
so we'll keep that one though and then
I'm<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> discard<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.820> because

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
I'm just going to discard this because

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
I'm just going to discard this because
it's<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.260> worth<00:00:46.440> while

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it's really really not worth while

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.770 
it's really really not worth while

is<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.620> shabby<00:02:17.010> Alonso<00:02:17.610> or<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.240> a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
is that the shabby Alonso or is it a

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.300 
is that the shabby Alonso or is it a
different<00:02:18.780> one<00:02:19.080> fortunately<00:02:20.070> it's<00:02:20.250> not

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
different one fortunately it's not

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.920 
different one fortunately it's not
shabby<00:02:20.700> Alonso<00:02:21.240> he's<00:02:21.420> probably<00:02:21.660> actually

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
shabby Alonso he's probably actually

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.840 
shabby Alonso he's probably actually
better<00:02:22.380> than<00:02:22.560> Alonso<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.190> play<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.610> if<00:02:23.760> you

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
better than Alonso to play with if you

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.180 
better than Alonso to play with if you
look<00:02:24.000> at<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.120> 82<00:02:24.510> pace<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.870> 79<00:02:25.260> defending<00:02:25.710> be

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
look at the 82 pace and 79 defending be

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.000 
look at the 82 pace and 79 defending be
a<00:02:26.220> much<00:02:26.400> better<00:02:26.430> CDN<00:02:27.090> down<00:02:27.450> Alonso<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
a much better CDN down Alonso and the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.310 
a much better CDN down Alonso and the
one<00:02:29.190> from<00:02:29.550> real<00:02:29.910> madrid<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.570> they<00:02:31.050> go

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
one from real madrid so they go

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.040 
one from real madrid so they go
unfortunately<00:02:32.510> again<00:02:33.510> he's<00:02:33.660> not<00:02:33.840> worth

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
unfortunately again he's not worth

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.780 
unfortunately again he's not worth
anything<00:02:34.320> but<00:02:34.590> probably<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.100> other<00:02:35.310> better

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
anything but probably the other better

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.190 
anything but probably the other better
play<00:02:35.970> maybe<00:02:36.210> I'll<00:02:36.420> try<00:02:36.600> them<00:02:36.780> out<00:02:36.840> at<00:02:37.020> some

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
play maybe I'll try them out at some

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.900 
play maybe I'll try them out at some

annoying I believe that there's another

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.850 
annoying I believe that there's another
play<00:05:06.880> that's<00:05:06.910> got<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.270> similar<00:05:07.660> name<00:05:07.840> Tim<00:05:08.110> that

may have been in form of silver or

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.140 
may have been in form of silver or
something<00:05:10.930> so<00:05:11.200> oh<00:05:11.380> well<00:05:12.280> there<00:05:12.580> you<00:05:12.670> go<00:05:12.700> we've

also<00:05:13.330> got<00:05:13.510> rafinha<00:05:13.990> he's<00:05:14.440> worth<00:05:14.620> keeping

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
also got rafinha he's worth keeping

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.430 
also got rafinha he's worth keeping
because<00:05:15.220> these<00:05:15.570> non-res<00:05:16.570> often<00:05:17.020> sell<00:05:17.230> more

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
because these non-res often sell more

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.230 
because these non-res often sell more
than<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.860> discard<00:05:18.280> price<00:05:18.550> and<00:05:18.970> he's

than the discard price and he's

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.760 
than the discard price and he's
definitely<00:05:19.450> one<00:05:19.720> of<00:05:19.780> them<00:05:19.930> especially<00:05:20.140> in<00:05:20.680> a

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
definitely one of them especially in a

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.040 
definitely one of them especially in a
4-1<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.250> aunty<00:05:21.580> so<00:05:21.880> there<00:05:22.060> we<00:05:22.120> go<00:05:22.150> quick<00:05:22.900> sell
