00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the outside vessel into the space you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.810 
the outside vessel into the space you

wanted to be showing the other time zone
let's<00:00:44.820> say<00:00:45.030> now<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.480> sixteen<00:00:46.170> hour<00:00:46.760> in<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
let's say now it's sixteen hour in a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.819 
let's say now it's sixteen hour in a
different<00:00:48.390> time<00:00:48.629> zone<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.379> put<00:00:49.739> it

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
different time zone so you put it

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.119 
different time zone so you put it
against<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> 16<00:00:50.760> x<00:00:51.090> 16<00:00:51.390> hour<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.829> shows

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
against the 16 x 16 hour and this shows

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.000 
against the 16 x 16 hour and this shows
you<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:54.120> more<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:57.500> relates<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.890> other

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
you one more how it relates to the other

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.779 
you one more how it relates to the other
times<00:00:59.430> they<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.379> hour<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
times they have one one hour and and

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.119 
times they have one one hour and and
this<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.270> other<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.899> our<00:01:04.080> hand<00:01:04.409> the

this is the other out of our hand the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.859 
this is the other out of our hand the
minutes<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.760> seconds<00:01:06.240> would<00:01:06.450> stay<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
minutes and the seconds would stay the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.330 
minutes and the seconds would stay the
same<00:01:06.900> many<00:01:07.380> times<00:01:09.229> GMT<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.500> actually<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.310> a

same many times GMT this actually is a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.940 
same many times GMT this actually is a
newer<00:01:11.760> model<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.540> GMT<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.590> not<00:01:13.799> the

here<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.110> new<00:04:19.290> movement<00:04:20.480> this<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.750> old

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
here is the new movement this the old

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.230 
here is the new movement this the old
moves<00:04:22.320> there's<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.680> new<00:04:22.920> moment<00:04:23.220> new<00:04:23.520> as<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:24.090> the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
moves there's a new moment new as is the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:36.470 

this<00:04:28.620> movement<00:04:29.010> is<00:04:30.740> 3075<00:04:34.700> that's<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.910> chianti

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
this movement is 3075 that's the chianti

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.650 
this movement is 3075 that's the chianti
movement

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.920 

the<00:04:44.660> movement<00:04:45.080> is<00:04:45.259> a<00:04:46.690> five<00:04:47.690> position

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
the movement is a five position

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:55.990 
the movement is a five position
adjustable<00:04:49.930> and<00:04:51.940> 27<00:04:52.940> choose<00:04:54.729> very<00:04:55.729> nice

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
adjustable and 27 choose very nice

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:08.019 
adjustable and 27 choose very nice
durable<00:04:56.570> movement<00:04:57.820> it's<00:04:58.820> based<00:04:59.120> on<00:04:59.360> the<00:05:01.900> 3035

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:08.029 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:14.639 

this<00:05:08.599> movement<00:05:08.899> is<00:05:10.029> 25<00:05:11.029> Joules<00:05:12.579> this<00:05:13.579> Jules

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:14.649 
this movement is 25 Joules this Jules

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:26.279 
this movement is 25 Joules this Jules
and<00:05:18.189> also<00:05:19.189> five<00:05:19.459> position<00:05:20.139> as<00:05:21.139> you<00:05:21.319> can<00:05:21.559> see

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.519 

see<00:05:27.289> how<00:05:27.379> the<00:05:27.439> whole<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:28.729> rotor<00:05:28.939> here<00:05:29.529> this

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:30.529 
see how the whole the rotor here this

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:39.600 
see how the whole the rotor here this
clap<00:05:33.369> it's<00:05:34.369> very<00:05:34.699> neat<00:05:35.029> way<00:05:35.059> they<00:05:35.329> roll<00:05:35.749> excuse

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.749 

so<00:05:40.610> that's<00:05:40.879> how<00:05:41.029> it<00:05:41.179> goes<00:05:41.360> from<00:05:41.599> the<00:05:41.839> inside

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
so that's how it goes from the inside

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.159 
so that's how it goes from the inside
highly<00:05:43.759> collected<00:05:44.239> a<00:05:44.360> lot<00:05:44.539> is<00:05:44.719> good<00:05:44.929> movement

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
highly collected a lot is good movement

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.059 
highly collected a lot is good movement
in<00:05:45.529> the<00:05:45.709> newer<00:05:45.949> one<00:05:47.679> that's<00:05:48.679> highly

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
in the newer one that's highly

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:57.399 
in the newer one that's highly
collectible<00:05:54.249> as<00:05:55.249> you<00:05:55.429> can<00:05:55.639> see<00:05:55.909> in<00:05:56.329> the<00:05:57.169> newer

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
collectible as you can see in the newer

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.489 
collectible as you can see in the newer
one<00:05:57.709> you<00:05:57.889> have<00:05:58.099> a<00:05:58.129> place<00:05:58.549> here<00:05:59.110> where<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.319> gas

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:00.499 
one you have a place here where the gas

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:05.429 
one you have a place here where the gas
will<00:06:00.769> comes<00:06:01.039> in<00:06:03.069> in<00:06:04.069> the<00:06:04.369> older<00:06:04.759> one<00:06:04.969> the

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:05.439 
will comes in in the older one the

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:10.439 
will comes in in the older one the
gasket<00:06:06.439> comes<00:06:06.739> around<00:06:07.610> the<00:06:08.360> case<00:06:08.629> base<00:06:09.339> and

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
gasket comes around the case base and

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.569 
gasket comes around the case base and
then<00:06:11.449> you<00:06:11.629> when<00:06:12.469> you<00:06:12.589> close<00:06:12.889> it<00:06:12.919> is<00:06:13.249> press<00:06:13.550> it

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:13.579 
then you when you close it is press it

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:21.160 
then you when you close it is press it
against<00:06:14.269> the<00:06:14.539> body

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.840 

it's<00:06:22.170> not<00:06:22.350> an<00:06:22.500> everyday<00:06:22.860> watch<00:06:24.230> cause<00:06:25.230> it's
