00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 Welcome to our gameplay 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.529
 video of our patch 1.07 on equipment 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.139
 just under seven minutes awaits you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.269
 again a cut video in the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.719
 I short play scenes 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.719
 comment 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.210
 and here it starts right away 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.930
 and you also see that we accordingly 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.770
 henceforth the video finally 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.770
 was filmed 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.680
 we can see is the resistance 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.989
 contingent and the life contingent 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.010
 slightly upwards compared to the last g 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.140
 screwed 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.600
 Of course the damage, too 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.090
 the better values have easy 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.400
 background for the monster on it 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.400
 wanted to drive six effectively 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.830
 Finally, since patch 1.07 the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.809
 experience for the higher level 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.150
 been screwed up significantly the 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.540
 Finally, it also makes sense 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.040
 stop the monster leveling listen 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.040
 colors or at least more sense than 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.040
 before 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.120
 So hammer just before played there I had 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.480
 also briefly the alternative identifier 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.220
 Seen that I still use here 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.380
 rather unconventional I'm still there 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.990
 the opinion that in connection with the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.480
 critical mass of those with pipe and that 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.030
 magic bullets are relatively useful 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.950
 around the iphone again quickly 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.240
 the downtime and downgrades are 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.550
 correspondingly fast again in the idle 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.700
 mode is run through the dungeon 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.700
 can 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.900
 so and now i will be the base yet 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.570
 time to skillen on blood magic because 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.580
 finally since patch 1.07 you can do this 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.460
 skill also reasonable use if he like 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.570
 reasonably calculated and correspond 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.770
 that would work just fine the match 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.740
 It will be a bit reduced here 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.480
 looks but is not bad because 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.570
 Blood becomes life 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.420
 continent again considerably faster 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.160
 recharged and that it is here too 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.420
 ever quite good and rudimentary too 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.800
 recognize and she belongs like that 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.660
 life concept repeatedly charged 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.540
 is despite incoming hits of 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.510
 I would recommend blood 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.580
 magic from now on in the region skillung 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.060
 every case of the mighty weapon 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.060
 preferable 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.660
 that's how I'll be doing here relatively well 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.410
 Luckily, there are two more 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.110
 Alcohol just lying around there and 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.580
 now you can see that with the 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.260
 alternatively succeeded actually quite well 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.540
 can play when the scissors splitters 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.780
 So fast is relatively daily 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.890
 for a farmer in this case nothing 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.760
 the more you can hold it very well 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.830
 could 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.370
 the meteors and the magical shot 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.420
 the fans will soon be on their feet as well 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.160
 and here you can even see the 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.530
 Borussia is also a relatively good remedy 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.520
 creates and does not really work for anyone 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.520
 may be missing 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.560
 one can 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.190
 yes and again ship that you can see 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.720
 always good at some places that 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.389
 it freezes with the opponent borussia 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.310
 this is true for both normal opponents 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.350
 also for the elite packs and that helps 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.000
 Of course, a rich and magic tremendous 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.940
 if the opponents kept at a distance 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.530
 and accordingly that is 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.580
 Of course, very recommendable often with 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.389
 to equip this weapon 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.370
 because that has the blog opponents 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.430
 the best way to use them is to freeze 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.780
 one with a relatively high chance of 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.770
 freeze and a good one 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.660
 impact so that 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.669
 accordingly the arrows also the 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.020
 penetrate opponents and accordingly 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.020
 more adversaries can be hit 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.900
 his neighbor 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.210
 and here we are already at 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.190
 the last song effect has arrived 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.590
 is laid relatively quickly and quickly 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.070
 and then the video tends already in the 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.669
