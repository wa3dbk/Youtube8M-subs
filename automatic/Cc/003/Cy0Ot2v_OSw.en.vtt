needles in the black the cylinder is

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:41.619 
needles in the black the cylinder is
empty<00:00:38.110> now<00:00:39.110> you'll<00:00:39.470> see<00:00:39.769> here<00:00:40.370> what<00:00:41.030> happens

empty now you'll see here what happens
is<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:43.190> cylinder<00:00:43.670> has<00:00:43.850> been<00:00:44.059> punctured<00:00:44.750> the

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
is the cylinder has been punctured the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.850 
is the cylinder has been punctured the
burst<00:00:45.799> disc<00:00:46.220> is<00:00:46.549> has<00:00:47.330> a<00:00:47.360> hole<00:00:47.750> in<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:48.140> and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
burst disc is has a hole in it and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.280 
burst disc is has a hole in it and
there's<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.940> needle<00:00:50.390> that<00:00:50.570> punctured<00:00:51.140> the

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
there's the needle that punctured the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.890 
there's the needle that punctured the
burst<00:00:51.530> disc<00:00:51.830> now<00:00:52.670> what<00:00:52.909> happens<00:00:53.360> is<00:00:53.570> there's<00:00:53.809> a

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
burst disc now what happens is there's a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.799 
burst disc now what happens is there's a
red<00:00:54.320> gate<00:00:54.710> that<00:00:54.979> has<00:00:55.190> come<00:00:55.400> across<00:00:55.809> which

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
red gate that has come across which

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.479 
red gate that has come across which
inhibits<00:00:57.320> you<00:00:57.470> from<00:00:57.500> putting<00:00:57.979> in<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.250> full

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
inhibits you from putting in a full

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.910 
inhibits you from putting in a full
cylinder<00:00:59.000> with<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.449> needle<00:00:59.989> in<00:01:00.140> a<00:01:00.440> puncture

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
cylinder with the needle in a puncture

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.759 
cylinder with the needle in a puncture
position<00:01:01.369> so<00:01:01.909> what<00:01:02.089> you<00:01:02.210> have<00:01:02.360> to<00:01:02.540> do<00:01:02.720> is<00:01:02.960> reset

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:13.179 
position so what you have to do is reset
the<00:01:04.159> cylinder<00:01:08.859> with<00:01:09.859> the<00:01:10.280> reset<00:01:11.210> tool<00:01:12.189> so

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
the cylinder with the reset tool so

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.529 
the cylinder with the reset tool so
you're<00:01:13.369> gonna<00:01:13.460> reset<00:01:14.329> with<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.960> reset<00:01:15.380> tool

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
you're gonna reset with the reset tool

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.139 
you're gonna reset with the reset tool
each<00:01:17.539> pack<00:01:17.930> comes<00:01:18.229> with<00:01:18.409> one<00:01:18.679> of<00:01:18.710> these<00:01:19.149> I'm

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
each pack comes with one of these I'm

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.669 
each pack comes with one of these I'm
going<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:20.509> place<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:21.560> in<00:01:21.890> and<00:01:23.109> then<00:01:24.109> begin<00:01:24.649> to

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
going to place it in and then begin to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:32.770 
going to place it in and then begin to
twist<00:01:25.219> it<00:01:25.490> up<00:01:30.609> you<00:01:31.609> do<00:01:31.820> need<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:32.299> get<00:01:32.450> this

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
twist it up you do need to get this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.260 
twist it up you do need to get this
threaded<00:01:33.229> all<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.520> way<00:01:34.670> in<00:01:35.259> and<00:01:36.999> make<00:01:37.999> sure

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
threaded all the way in and make sure

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.719 
threaded all the way in and make sure
that<00:01:38.479> there's<00:01:38.749> no<00:01:39.049> pressure<00:01:39.530> on<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.189> handle

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
that there's no pressure on the handle

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:53.830 
that there's no pressure on the handle
on<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:40.999> other<00:01:41.329> side<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:44.200> then<00:01:45.200> out<00:01:52.689> there<00:01:53.689> you

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
on the other side and then out there you

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.380 
on the other side and then out there you
go<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.229> system<00:01:54.619> has<00:01:54.799> been<00:01:55.009> reset<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.909> it's

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
go the system has been reset and it's

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.429 
go the system has been reset and it's
ready<00:01:56.689> to<00:01:56.929> receive<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.409> full<00:01:57.829> cylinder
