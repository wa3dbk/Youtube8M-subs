these first and then we'll go to the
other<00:01:07.590> ones<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:15.270> we'll<00:01:15.600> go<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.470> don't

other ones so we'll go here what I don't
have<00:01:17.009> yet<00:01:17.869> pretty<00:01:18.869> simple<00:01:20.210> easy<00:01:21.210> enough<00:01:21.570> i've

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
have yet pretty simple easy enough i've

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.359 
have yet pretty simple easy enough i've
already<00:01:21.930> got<00:01:22.229> 21<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.220> them<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.409> there's<00:01:25.409> 46

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
already got 21 of them so there's 46

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.450 
already got 21 of them so there's 46
total<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.509> there's<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.290> 446<00:01:29.040> once<00:01:29.280> again

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
total so there's that one 446 once again

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.920 
total so there's that one 446 once again
i'll<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.759> go<00:01:29.850> ahead<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.299> uneasy

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.780 

that<00:01:33.930> shouldn't<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.470> problem<00:01:34.829> same<00:01:35.520> thing

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that shouldn't be a problem same thing

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.050 
that shouldn't be a problem same thing
shouldn't<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.270> too<00:01:36.450> big<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.869> problem<00:01:38.060> all

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
shouldn't be too big of a problem all

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.560 
shouldn't be too big of a problem all
these<00:01:39.360> because<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.140> will<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> checkpoints<00:01:41.310> I

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
these because it will be a checkpoints I

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.700 
these because it will be a checkpoints I
just<00:01:42.570> didn't<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:42.930> care<00:01:43.200> while<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.470> was

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
just didn't really care while I was

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.240 
just didn't really care while I was
doing<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> time<00:01:49.130> secret<00:01:50.130> achievement

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
doing it at the time secret achievement

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460 
doing it at the time secret achievement
I<00:01:50.729> don't<00:01:50.970> know<00:01:51.180> what<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.750> yet<00:01:52.259> I'm

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
I don't know what this one is yet I'm

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.010 
I don't know what this one is yet I'm
going<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.799> assume<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.210> first<00:01:54.780> level

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
going to assume it will be first level

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.240 
going to assume it will be first level
prestige<00:01:56.299> I<00:01:57.299> don't<00:01:58.049> really<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.799> doesn't

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
prestige I don't really know it doesn't

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.580 
prestige I don't really know it doesn't
have<00:01:59.430> any<00:01:59.790> gamer<00:02:00.180> points<00:02:00.479> associated<00:02:00.869> with<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
have any gamer points associated with it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.490 
have any gamer points associated with it
so<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.219> probably<00:02:02.310> going<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.540> gamer

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
so it's probably going to be a gamer

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.670 
so it's probably going to be a gamer
picture<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.600> could<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.719> wrong<00:02:06.899> that's<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.439> my

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
picture I could be wrong that's just my

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.030 
picture I could be wrong that's just my
hunch

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.800 

and<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:15.420> one<00:02:15.650> I'm<00:02:16.650> not<00:02:16.860> really<00:02:17.070> sure<00:02:17.810> how

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and that one I'm not really sure how

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.190 
and that one I'm not really sure how
easy<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.350> one's<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.800> be<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.630> guess<00:02:21.630> just

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
easy that one's going to be I guess just

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.470 
easy that one's going to be I guess just
carefully<00:02:22.740> done<00:02:25.340> these<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:27.120> won't<00:02:27.300> be<00:02:27.420> able

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
carefully done these you won't be able

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.870 
carefully done these you won't be able
to<00:02:27.630> get<00:02:27.780> till<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.020> level<00:02:28.470> up<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.980> spec<00:02:29.640> ops

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
to get till you level up in spec ops

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.140 
to get till you level up in spec ops
because<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.950> unlocks<00:02:32.340> become<00:02:32.880> available

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
because the the unlocks become available

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
because the the unlocks become available
as<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.690> level<00:02:33.900> up<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:36.330> you'll<00:02:36.600> have<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.810> get

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
as you level up so you'll have to get

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.610 
as you level up so you'll have to get
pretty<00:02:37.380> high<00:02:37.560> up<00:02:37.590> I'm<00:02:37.920> like<00:02:38.870> level<00:02:39.870> 18<00:02:40.260> or

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
pretty high up I'm like level 18 or

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.670 
pretty high up I'm like level 18 or
actually<00:02:41.070> think<00:02:41.220> I'm<00:02:41.310> into<00:02:41.490> 20s<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.470> spec<00:02:43.470> ops

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
actually think I'm into 20s on spec ops

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.830 
actually think I'm into 20s on spec ops
now<00:02:44.960> so<00:02:45.960> there's<00:02:46.170> three<00:02:46.440> different<00:02:47.840> boxes

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
now so there's three different boxes

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.720 
now so there's three different boxes
that<00:02:48.990> you<00:02:49.020> can<00:02:49.170> go<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.260> 12<00:02:49.710> weapon<00:02:50.040> armory<00:02:50.460> ones

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
that you can go to 12 weapon armory ones

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.400 
that you can go to 12 weapon armory ones
and<00:02:50.910> air<00:02:51.000> support<00:02:51.150> armory<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.960> one's<00:02:52.260> an

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
and air support armory and one's an

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.710 
and air support armory and one's an
equipment<00:02:52.710> armory<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:55.890> one<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:57.210> going<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.630> be

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
equipment armory that one is going to be

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.360 
equipment armory that one is going to be
a<00:02:57.750> little<00:02:57.930> tricky<00:02:58.350> cuz<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.590> was<00:02:58.740> trying<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.190> do

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
a little tricky cuz I was trying to do

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.900 
a little tricky cuz I was trying to do
that<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.920> like<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.010> couldn't<00:03:02.220> get<00:03:02.430> past<00:03:02.580> like

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
that and like I couldn't get past like

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.440 
that and like I couldn't get past like
20,000<00:03:03.690> before<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.440> need<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.860> buy<00:03:05.010> shit<00:03:05.450> but

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
20,000 before I need it to buy shit but

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.950 
20,000 before I need it to buy shit but
I'm<00:03:06.690> sure<00:03:06.900> I'll<00:03:07.020> figure<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.350> out<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:09.660> should

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
I'm sure I'll figure it out that should

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.070 
I'm sure I'll figure it out that should
be<00:03:10.080> fairly<00:03:10.290> simple<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.640> get<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.420> level<00:03:12.600> 15

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
be fairly simple I can get to level 15

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.960 
be fairly simple I can get to level 15
on<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.320> no<00:03:13.590> problems<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.460> just<00:03:14.730> haven't

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
on the no problems so I just haven't

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.480 
on the no problems so I just haven't
done<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.120> on<00:03:15.300> all<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.570> maps<00:03:15.870> yet<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:20.280> one

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
done it on all the maps yet and that one

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.400 
done it on all the maps yet and that one
will<00:03:20.700> be<00:03:20.760> tricky<00:03:21.210> because<00:03:21.330> as<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:22.200> unlock

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
will be tricky because as you unlock

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.690 
will be tricky because as you unlock
levels<00:03:24.410> they<00:03:25.410> are<00:03:25.590> harder<00:03:26.160> like<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.490> first

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
levels they are harder like the first

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.720 
levels they are harder like the first
four<00:03:27.000> levels<00:03:27.390> are<00:03:27.600> easy<00:03:28.050> next<00:03:28.950> one's<00:03:29.130> get<00:03:29.340> next

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
four levels are easy next one's get next

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.220 
four levels are easy next one's get next
set<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:29.850> four<00:03:30.060> get<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.300> little<00:03:30.570> harder<00:03:30.960> and<00:03:31.200> a

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
set of four get a little harder and a

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.990 
set of four get a little harder and a
little<00:03:31.260> harder<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.070> little<00:03:32.100> hard<00:03:32.490> and<00:03:32.820> so

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
little harder and a little hard and so

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.520 
little harder and a little hard and so
on<00:03:36.710> and<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:39.120> one<00:03:39.420> I'm<00:03:40.140> going<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.350> have<00:03:40.500> to

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
on and that one I'm going to have to

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.220 
on and that one I'm going to have to
obviously<00:03:40.800> try<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:42.990> that

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
obviously try that is and like that

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.790 
obviously try that is and like that
campaign<00:03:43.800> spec<00:03:44.250> ops<00:03:44.750> it's<00:03:45.750> not<00:03:46.140> in<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.500> one

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
campaign spec ops it's not in the one

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.510 
campaign spec ops it's not in the one
that<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.010> like<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.880> other<00:03:47.910> one<00:03:48.150> but<00:03:48.510> whatever

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
that I like the other one but whatever

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.720 
that I like the other one but whatever
and<00:03:51.230> forty-eight<00:03:52.230> stars<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:53.130> will<00:03:53.340> be<00:03:53.459> all

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
and forty-eight stars that will be all

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.320 
and forty-eight stars that will be all
of<00:03:54.120> them<00:03:54.330> so<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.080> means<00:03:55.730> doing<00:03:56.730> them<00:03:56.940> all<00:03:57.090> in

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
of them so that means doing them all in

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.890 
of them so that means doing them all in
veteran<00:03:57.720> it's<00:03:58.440> going<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.650> be<00:03:58.740> a<00:03:58.770> tricky<00:03:59.130> one

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
veteran it's going to be a tricky one

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.050 
veteran it's going to be a tricky one
that<00:04:00.900> obviously<00:04:01.380> will<00:04:01.620> be<00:04:01.830> easy<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:05.430> for

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
that obviously will be easy and so for

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.020 
that obviously will be easy and so for
total<00:04:07.050> right<00:04:07.200> now<00:04:07.410> I've<00:04:07.680> got<00:04:07.709> 29<00:04:08.430> or<00:04:08.580> 50
