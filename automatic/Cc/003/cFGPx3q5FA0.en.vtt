00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 hey people what was on the stand and today 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.370
 finally the new magix extra series is 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.769
 appeared and I have the same time 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.590
 start-up corner for you at the start namely 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.980
 the data pack of gitex extra 3 510 510 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.779
 series the whole costs 7 euro 99 is off 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.880
 now in the trade so look for buys 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.039
 buy it and come naturally 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.830
 also booster after that will still be 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.170
 Followed by a small packaging subscription 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.090
 the channel that you hold the opening 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.320
 not missed and my other videos 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.600
 not in any case catch the same 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.820
 time to open here the startup eck as 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.680
 then four cards hold an ex 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.480
 let in limited edition the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.870
 collection folder of course a collector 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.610
 magazine playing field and the rules of the game 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.399
 because the whole time on where 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.879
 we get it on here we do it 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.879
 just because 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:00.740
 So we want to get out of it all the time 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.760
 album the magazine and of course 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.860
 still the cards are wrong 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.170
 so that others do not throw away 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.580
 I would be the first to the cards 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.600
 let's say we make the small package 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.810
 Always up and there we have first 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.780
 card a bremen defender and it 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.260
 is captain clemens fritz very much 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.360
 beautiful 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.680
 so his hardtops have nothing 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.080
 changed so but I think that the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.700
 I have to say designer top of pot 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.130

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.259

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.940

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.780
 card number 470 again a bremer 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.690

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.729
 limited card namely one 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.000

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.780

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.310

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.530
