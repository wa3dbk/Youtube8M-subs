year Oh feel good yeah we came a long
way<00:00:22.360> as<00:00:23.110> a<00:00:23.140> team<00:00:23.440> the<00:00:23.470> spring<00:00:23.980> the<00:00:24.100> summer<00:00:24.310> and

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610

I

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.330 
I
that<00:00:26.870> we're<00:00:27.080> all<00:00:27.110> on<00:00:27.260> the<00:00:27.410> same<00:00:27.530> page<00:00:27.830> going<00:00:28.160> to

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
that we're all on the same page going to

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.580 
that we're all on the same page going to
see<00:00:28.520> it<00:00:29.390> talks<00:00:29.600> about<00:00:29.690> how<00:00:29.960> important<00:00:30.380> that<00:00:30.530> is

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
see it talks about how important that is

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.160 
see it talks about how important that is
obviously<00:00:31.520> another<00:00:32.150> transition<00:00:32.720> this<00:00:32.960> year

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
obviously another transition this year

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.660 
obviously another transition this year
but<00:00:33.320> seems<00:00:33.530> like<00:00:33.650> everybody<00:00:34.070> is<00:00:34.190> really

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
but seems like everybody is really

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.120 
but seems like everybody is really
number<00:00:35.540> one<00:00:35.690> body<00:00:35.930> into<00:00:36.260> everything<00:00:36.620> coach

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
number one body into everything coach

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.520 
number one body into everything coach
francona<00:00:37.790> stock<00:00:38.150> Noah<00:00:38.360> and<00:00:38.630> in<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:38.900> way<00:00:39.020> how

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
francona stock Noah and in the way how

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.640 
francona stock Noah and in the way how
does<00:00:39.650> that<00:00:39.739> help<00:00:39.950> determine<00:00:40.489> chemistry<00:00:41.239> Oh<00:00:41.650> as

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
does that help determine chemistry Oh as

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.220 
does that help determine chemistry Oh as
long<00:00:42.710> as<00:00:43.010> we're<00:00:43.129> all<00:00:43.220> in<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.430> same<00:00:43.460> page<00:00:43.850> I

to get going I think we've done a great
job<00:01:59.950> building<00:02:00.280> some<00:02:00.580> chemistry<00:02:01.000> this<00:02:01.210> summer

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
job building some chemistry this summer

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.150 
job building some chemistry this summer
we're<00:02:02.259> just<00:02:02.410> really<00:02:02.530> excited<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.950> put<00:02:03.039> the

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
we're just really excited to put the

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.910 
mentality of kicking yeah that's a big
thing<00:03:55.799> that<00:03:56.010> I've<00:03:56.220> tried<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.489> focus<00:03:56.670> on

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
thing that I've tried to focus on

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.110 
thing that I've tried to focus on
approaching<00:03:58.920> every<00:03:59.129> cake<00:03:59.370> like<00:03:59.819> it's<00:04:00.000> an

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
approaching every cake like it's an

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.869 
approaching every cake like it's an
extra<00:04:00.360> point<00:04:00.709> obviously<00:04:01.709> if<00:04:02.459> you<00:04:02.640> hit<00:04:02.790> an

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
extra point obviously if you hit an

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.580 
extra point obviously if you hit an
extra<00:04:03.000> point<00:04:03.329> eight<00:04:03.450> if<00:04:03.660> there<00:04:04.019> was<00:04:04.170> no<00:04:04.349> net

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
extra point eight if there was no net

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.180 
extra point eight if there was no net
there<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:04.980> probably<00:04:05.099> go<00:04:05.400> about<00:04:05.579> 50<00:04:05.940> 55<00:04:06.299> yards

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
there and probably go about 50 55 yards

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.190 
there and probably go about 50 55 yards
so<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.370> approach<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.420> every<00:04:09.660> kick<00:04:09.900> will

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
so that approach and every kick will

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.110 
so that approach and every kick will
definitely<00:04:10.620> help<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.829> be<00:04:11.579> more<00:04:11.610> consistent

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
definitely help you be more consistent

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.640 
definitely help you be more consistent

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
important is is being relaxed we being

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.060 
important is is being relaxed we being
confident<00:04:29.940> in<00:04:30.030> yourself<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.750> abilities<00:04:31.200> I'm

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
switching things up every kick you're

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.330 
switching things up every kick you're
not<00:04:44.610> going<00:04:44.730> to<00:04:44.790> be<00:04:44.880> a<00:04:44.910> successful<00:04:45.919> so<00:04:46.919> like<00:04:47.310> I

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340
