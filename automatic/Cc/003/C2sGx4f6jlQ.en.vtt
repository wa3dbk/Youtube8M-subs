very useful in your survival world you
could<00:00:10.050> go<00:00:10.139> into<00:00:10.349> your<00:00:10.440> base<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.920> get<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> quick

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
could go into your base and get a quick

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.150 
could go into your base and get a quick
top-up<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> item<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.290> need<00:00:13.530> so

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
top-up of the item that you need so

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.740 
top-up of the item that you need so
there<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> certain<00:00:14.880> amount<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.120> flexibility

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
there is a certain amount of flexibility

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.450 
there is a certain amount of flexibility
as<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.049> how<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.289> can<00:00:16.529> set<00:00:16.770> these<00:00:16.890> up<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.310> can

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
as to how you can set these up you can

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.279 
as to how you can set these up you can
have<00:00:17.580> up<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.850> four<00:00:18.240> different<00:00:18.270> droppers<00:00:19.020> and

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
have up to four different droppers and

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.599 
have up to four different droppers and
you<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> droppers<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.250> display

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
you can have the droppers on display

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.490 
you can have the droppers on display
like<00:00:20.640> these<00:00:21.060> too<00:00:21.330> or<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.320> them

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
like these too or you can have them

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.109 
like these too or you can have them
hidden<00:00:22.650> away<00:00:22.859> behind<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.400> blocks<00:00:23.640> like<00:00:23.850> these

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
hidden away behind the blocks like these

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.390 
hidden away behind the blocks like these
two<00:00:24.359> over<00:00:24.600> here<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.439> depending<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.010> what<00:00:26.160> items

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
two over here so depending on what items

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.890 
two over here so depending on what items
you<00:00:26.580> need<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:26.939> walk<00:00:27.210> up<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.420> them<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
you need you just walk up to them and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.410 
you need you just walk up to them and
you'll<00:00:28.590> get<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.769> top<00:00:28.980> off<00:00:29.130> items<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.179> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
you'll get a top off items like this and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.240 
you'll get a top off items like this and
because<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.230> customize<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.920> amount<00:00:32.189> of

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
because you can customize the amount of

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.410 
because you can customize the amount of
droppers<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.790> you're<00:00:32.880> going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.180> using

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
droppers that you're going to be using

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.510 
droppers that you're going to be using
you<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.290> items<00:00:34.649> at<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> different<00:00:35.190> rate<00:00:35.309> so

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
you can get items at a different rate so

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.770 
you can get items at a different rate so
you<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.760> see<00:00:35.940> over<00:00:36.180> here<00:00:36.210> we're<00:00:36.480> gonna<00:00:36.540> get

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
you can see over here we're gonna get

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.049 
you can see over here we're gonna get
our<00:00:36.930> iron<00:00:37.260> faster<00:00:38.040> than<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.460> our<00:00:38.610> diamond

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
our iron faster than we do our diamond

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.970 
our iron faster than we do our diamond
and<00:00:39.210> then<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.110> over<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.469> actually<00:00:40.649> has

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and then this one over here actually has

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.069 
and then this one over here actually has
free<00:00:41.280> droppers<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.059> get<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.210> top-up<00:00:42.600> of

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
free droppers so we can get a top-up of

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.529 
free droppers so we can get a top-up of
redstone<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:44.789> quickly<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
redstone like that really quickly and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.049 
redstone like that really quickly and
then<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.620> one<00:00:46.829> over<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.250> has<00:00:47.399> four<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:47.969> we

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
then this one over here has four so we

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.910 
then this one over here has four so we
can<00:00:48.180> simply<00:00:48.510> walk<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.020> hit<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> lever

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
can simply walk up to it hit the lever

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.439 
can simply walk up to it hit the lever
and<00:00:50.190> we'll<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.430> tons<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.789> arrows<00:00:51.090> really

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
and we'll get tons of arrows really

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.200 
and we'll get tons of arrows really
quickly<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:55.500> rapid<00:00:55.829> item<00:00:56.129> dispenser<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.940> very

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
quickly the rapid item dispenser is very

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.790 
quickly the rapid item dispenser is very
simple<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.719> build<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.199> very<00:00:58.410> resource

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
simple to build it's very resource

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.920 
simple to build it's very resource
efficient<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.489> easy<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.149> understand<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.750> well

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
efficient and easy to understand as well

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.420 
efficient and easy to understand as well
we<00:01:01.440> go<00:01:01.559> around<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.890> back<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.309> you're

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
we go around the back here you're

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.650 
we go around the back here you're
probably<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.940> able<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.210> tell<00:01:03.480> how

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
probably going to be able to tell how

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.119 
probably going to be able to tell how
this<00:01:03.840> works<00:01:04.110> although<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.830> don't<00:01:05.040> know

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
this works although if you don't know

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.310 
this works although if you don't know
about<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.489> torch<00:01:05.790> burnout<00:01:06.270> mechanic<00:01:06.720> then

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
about the torch burnout mechanic then

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.690 
about the torch burnout mechanic then
you<00:01:07.439> might<00:01:07.619> not<00:01:07.740> understand<00:01:08.250> how<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.520> works

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
you might not understand how this works

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.859 
you might not understand how this works
just<00:01:09.000> by<00:01:09.119> looking<00:01:09.540> at

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
just by looking at

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.480 
just by looking at
so<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.470> torch<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:11.340> it's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
so this torch right here when it's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.160 
so this torch right here when it's
turned<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.909> will<00:01:12.119> power<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.540> block<00:01:12.720> above<00:01:13.020> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
turned on will power the block above it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.960 
turned on will power the block above it
which<00:01:13.590> will<00:01:13.740> power<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.130> redstone<00:01:14.549> here<00:01:14.580> which

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
which will power the redstone here which

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.700 
which will power the redstone here which
is<00:01:15.150> attached<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> same<00:01:16.080> block<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
is attached to the same block that the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.740 
is attached to the same block that the
torch<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.100> attached<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.210> it'll<00:01:18.360> cause<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
torch is attached to so it'll cause it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
torch is attached to so it'll cause it
to<00:01:18.900> turn<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.500> off<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.830> quickly<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
to turn on and off really quickly and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.550 
to turn on and off really quickly and
then<00:01:21.119> after<00:01:21.509> doing<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.140> while<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
then after doing that for a while it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.980 
then after doing that for a while it
will<00:01:22.710> turn<00:01:22.950> off<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.430> burn<00:01:23.790> out<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.900> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
will turn off and burn out and if you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.390 
will turn off and burn out and if you
have<00:01:25.020> two<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.409> them<00:01:25.500> attached<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> same

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
have two of them attached to the same

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.130 
have two of them attached to the same
block<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> same<00:01:27.180> piece<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.509> redstone<00:01:27.689> on

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
block with the same piece of redstone on

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
block with the same piece of redstone on
top<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.890> they're<00:01:29.070> powering<00:01:29.490> then<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:30.240> one

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
top that they're powering then when one

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.120 
top that they're powering then when one
burnout<00:01:30.810> happens<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> torch<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> other

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
burnout happens the torch on the other

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.280 
burnout happens the torch on the other
side<00:01:32.430> will<00:01:32.640> take<00:01:32.850> over<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.780> let's<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.200> turn

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
side will take over so let's go and turn

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.190 
side will take over so let's go and turn
this<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.579> action<00:01:36.200> so

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
this on so we can see that in action so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.690 
this on so we can see that in action so
if<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.409> look<00:01:37.560> up<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:37.740> at<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> Redstone<00:01:38.490> that

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
if we look up here at the Redstone that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.670 
if we look up here at the Redstone that
it's<00:01:38.820> powering<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> block<00:01:39.689> when<00:01:40.500> one

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
it's powering on the block when one

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.590 
it's powering on the block when one
slide<00:01:40.950> burns<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> other<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:41.970> takes<00:01:42.240> over

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
slide burns out the other one takes over

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.789 
slide burns out the other one takes over
so<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> goes<00:01:43.140> over<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> other

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
so you see it goes over to the other

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.830 
so you see it goes over to the other
side<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.850> both<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.210> these<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.600> powering

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
side and then both of these are powering

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.319 
side and then both of these are powering
the<00:01:46.079> dispenser<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> middle<00:01:47.329> so

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the dispenser there in the middle so

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.350 
the dispenser there in the middle so
let's<00:01:48.570> do<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.500> other<00:01:49.619> side<00:01:50.360> so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
let's do the one on the other side so

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.700 
let's do the one on the other side so
the<00:01:51.479> same<00:01:51.689> thing<00:01:51.869> happens<00:01:52.229> here<00:01:52.320> when<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the same thing happens here when the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.889 
the same thing happens here when the
burnout<00:01:53.100> happens<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:54.060> side<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:54.720> on

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
burnout happens on one side the one on

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.230 
burnout happens on one side the one on
the<00:01:54.990> other<00:01:55.140> side<00:01:55.259> takes<00:01:55.740> over<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.030> trick

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the other side takes over but the trick

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.060 
the other side takes over but the trick
here<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:58.079> redstone<00:01:58.469> when<00:01:58.770> powering

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
here is that this redstone when powering

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.670 
here is that this redstone when powering
this<00:01:59.399> dispenser<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.119> also<00:02:00.540> powering<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.500> one

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
this dispenser is also powering the one

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.319 
this dispenser is also powering the one
next<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.460> both<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.670> them<00:02:02.880> are<00:02:03.030> always

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
next to it so both of them are always

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.310 
next to it so both of them are always
firing<00:02:03.630> at<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> same<00:02:04.770> time<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.930> let's<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.229> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
firing at the same time so let's have a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.380 
firing at the same time so let's have a
look<00:02:07.469> at<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.740> designs<00:02:08.160> over<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.879> side<00:02:09.149> as

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
look at the designs over on this side as

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.969 
look at the designs over on this side as
well<00:02:09.569> as<00:02:09.720> looking<00:02:10.110> different<00:02:10.530> they<00:02:10.649> actually

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
well as looking different they actually

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.890 
well as looking different they actually
operate<00:02:11.400> differently<00:02:11.849> from<00:02:12.209> these<00:02:12.360> two<00:02:12.629> as

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
operate differently from these two as

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.190 
operate differently from these two as
well

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
well

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.809 
well
and<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.190> first<00:02:14.400> thing<00:02:14.610> you'll<00:02:14.730> notice

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
and so the first thing you'll notice

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.520 
and so the first thing you'll notice
about<00:02:15.060> them<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.690> they're<00:02:15.840> all<00:02:15.990> boxed<00:02:16.349> in

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
about them is that they're all boxed in

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.410 
about them is that they're all boxed in
and<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:17.130> reason<00:02:17.459> for<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.970> because<00:02:18.000> we're

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
and the reason for this is because we're

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.809 
and the reason for this is because we're
dropping<00:02:18.630> items<00:02:19.170> directly<00:02:19.410> into<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.099> block<00:02:20.400> and

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
dropping items directly into a block and

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.220 
dropping items directly into a block and
when<00:02:21.120> we<00:02:21.209> do<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.660> going<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.840> look<00:02:22.020> for

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
when we do that it's going to look for

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.630 
when we do that it's going to look for
the<00:02:22.319> nearest<00:02:22.500> air<00:02:22.890> block<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.310> send<00:02:23.550> those

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
the nearest air block to send those

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.550 
the nearest air block to send those
items<00:02:24.090> into<00:02:24.450> which<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.780> at<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.050> front<00:02:25.080> here

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
items into which is at the front here

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.530 
items into which is at the front here
now<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.160> could<00:02:26.400> probably<00:02:26.520> get<00:02:26.940> away<00:02:27.060> with<00:02:27.209> not

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
now you could probably get away with not

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.240 
now you could probably get away with not
having<00:02:27.810> these<00:02:27.989> blocks<00:02:28.319> here<00:02:28.590> however<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.010> have

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
having these blocks here however I have

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.580 
having these blocks here however I have
seen<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:29.610> behave<00:02:29.910> funny<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.840> sometimes<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
seen it behave funny and sometimes the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.590 
seen it behave funny and sometimes the
items<00:02:31.920> do<00:02:32.100> come<00:02:32.340> out<00:02:32.489> at<00:02:32.610> an<00:02:32.730> angle<00:02:33.090> like<00:02:33.239> this

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
items do come out at an angle like this

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.120 
items do come out at an angle like this
so<00:02:34.050> that's<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.380> reason<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.709> they're<00:02:34.980> all

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
so that's the reason that they're all

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.970 
so that's the reason that they're all
boxed<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.120> now<00:02:36.690> these<00:02:36.870> ones<00:02:37.140> actually<00:02:37.860> have

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
boxed in now these ones actually have

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.680 
boxed in now these ones actually have
more<00:02:38.220> droppers<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:38.819> they<00:02:38.940> don't<00:02:39.120> dispense<00:02:39.510> a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
more droppers but they don't dispense a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.540 
more droppers but they don't dispense a
faster<00:02:40.200> rate<00:02:40.350> because<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.310> one

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
faster rate because of that so this one

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.460 
faster rate because of that so this one
has<00:02:41.940> free<00:02:42.330> droppers<00:02:42.780> have<00:02:42.930> got<00:02:43.050> one<00:02:43.230> on<00:02:43.260> either

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
has free droppers have got one on either

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.440 
has free droppers have got one on either
side<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.130> one<00:02:44.640> at<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.790> back<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.300> actually

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
side and one at the back and actually

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.870 
side and one at the back and actually
dispenses<00:02:46.350> items<00:02:46.709> at<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> same<00:02:47.340> rate<00:02:47.580> as<00:02:47.700> this

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
dispenses items at the same rate as this

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.850 
dispenses items at the same rate as this
one<00:02:48.090> over<00:02:48.330> here<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.290> reason<00:02:49.620> why<00:02:49.800> is

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
one over here and the reason why is

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.370 
one over here and the reason why is
because<00:02:50.069> we're<00:02:50.670> powering<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.380> dispensers

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
because we're powering the dispensers

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.170 
because we're powering the dispensers
directly<00:02:52.920> from<00:02:53.100> this<00:02:53.310> block<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:53.880> we<00:02:53.910> don't

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
directly from this block so we don't

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.490 
directly from this block so we don't
have<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.480> piece<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.780> redstone<00:02:54.989> on<00:02:55.350> either

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
have the piece of redstone on either

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.039 
have the piece of redstone on either
side<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.130> both<00:02:56.819> of<00:02:56.850> these<00:02:57.090> are<00:02:57.150> constantly

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
side so both of these are constantly

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.590 
side so both of these are constantly
powered<00:02:58.530> by<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.830> torch<00:02:59.640> burnouts<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.420> either

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
powered by the torch burnouts on either

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.660 
powered by the torch burnouts on either
side<00:03:00.959> whereas<00:03:01.319> these<00:03:01.470> ones<00:03:01.530> are<00:03:01.980> individually

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
side whereas these ones are individually

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.570 
side whereas these ones are individually
powered<00:03:03.330> by<00:03:03.569> each<00:03:03.750> torch<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:04.860> when<00:03:05.130> one<00:03:05.310> torch

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
powered by each torch so when one torch

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.090 
powered by each torch so when one torch
burnout<00:03:06.120> happens<00:03:06.600> another<00:03:07.319> one<00:03:07.470> takes<00:03:07.739> over

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
burnout happens another one takes over

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.530 
burnout happens another one takes over
so<00:03:08.250> there's<00:03:08.430> always<00:03:08.580> going<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.819> be<00:03:08.910> one<00:03:09.209> torch

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
so there's always going to be one torch

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.440 
so there's always going to be one torch
that<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.500> burnt<00:03:11.040> out<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.640> means<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:11.970> only

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
that is burnt out so it means that only

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.059 
that is burnt out so it means that only
over<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.350> droppers<00:03:13.680> are<00:03:13.799> going<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.980> be

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
over to the droppers are going to be

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.130 
over to the droppers are going to be
fired<00:03:14.370> at<00:03:14.549> once<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.090> then<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.690> same<00:03:15.900> thing

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
fired at once and then the same thing

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.229 
fired at once and then the same thing
happens<00:03:16.500> over<00:03:16.650> here<00:03:16.799> except<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:17.700> we're<00:03:17.910> free

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
happens over here except is we're free

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.810 
happens over here except is we're free
and<00:03:18.540> if<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.290> remove<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.769> block<00:03:20.070> at<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.549> front

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
and if I remove this block at the front

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.400 
and if I remove this block at the front
here<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.269> see<00:03:21.480> it's<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.720> same<00:03:21.750> thing<00:03:22.200> as

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
here you can see it's the same thing as

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.770 
here you can see it's the same thing as
before<00:03:22.650> because<00:03:23.640> we're<00:03:23.970> powering<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:24.510> block

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
before because we're powering that block

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.140 
before because we're powering that block
it's<00:03:25.470> powering<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.040> Redstone<00:03:26.459> behind<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
it's powering the Redstone behind it and

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.030 
it's powering the Redstone behind it and
same<00:03:27.420> thing<00:03:27.450> over<00:03:27.810> here<00:03:28.109> as<00:03:28.200> well<00:03:30.859> so<00:03:31.859> another

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
same thing over here as well so another

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.560 
same thing over here as well so another
interesting<00:03:32.280> thing<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.940> can<00:03:33.209> do<00:03:33.359> with<00:03:33.480> these

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
interesting thing you can do with these

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.780 
interesting thing you can do with these
rapid<00:03:33.959> item<00:03:34.350> dispensers<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.220> hook<00:03:35.430> them<00:03:35.609> up<00:03:35.730> to

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
rapid item dispensers is hook them up to

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.569 
rapid item dispensers is hook them up to
a<00:03:36.000> hopper<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.900> chest<00:03:37.170> like<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.459> but<00:03:38.459> what

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
a hopper and a chest like this but what

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:39.949 
a hopper and a chest like this but what
I've<00:03:38.700> done<00:03:38.820> with<00:03:39.000> these<00:03:39.180> two<00:03:39.209> over<00:03:39.630> here<00:03:39.870> is

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
I've done with these two over here is

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.660 
I've done with these two over here is
I've<00:03:40.109> added<00:03:40.290> stair<00:03:40.680> blocks<00:03:40.920> at<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.190> front<00:03:41.459> so

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
I've added stair blocks at the front so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.800 
I've added stair blocks at the front so
when<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.880> walk<00:03:42.060> up<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.390> them<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.660> can

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
when you walk up to them you can

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.080 
when you walk up to them you can
actually<00:03:42.989> access<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:44.250> chest<00:03:44.579> that's<00:03:44.820> there

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
actually access the chest that's there

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.640 
actually access the chest that's there
so<00:03:45.329> sometimes<00:03:45.570> you're<00:03:45.959> coming<00:03:46.200> up<00:03:46.320> here<00:03:46.500> to

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
so sometimes you're coming up here to

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.650 
so sometimes you're coming up here to
get<00:03:46.799> items<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.489> then<00:03:47.940> sometimes<00:03:48.420> you'll<00:03:48.630> be

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
get items and then sometimes you'll be

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.509 
get items and then sometimes you'll be
coming<00:03:49.049> over<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.380> refill<00:03:49.739> these<00:03:49.890> up<00:03:50.100> so<00:03:50.370> then

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
coming over to refill these up so then

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.310 
coming over to refill these up so then
rather<00:03:51.150> than<00:03:51.299> having<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.720> go<00:03:51.840> through<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:52.140> door

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
rather than having to go through a door

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.870 
rather than having to go through a door
and<00:03:52.530> going<00:03:52.739> behind<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.220> scenes<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.640> can

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
and going behind the scenes you can

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.000 
and going behind the scenes you can
actually<00:03:54.030> just<00:03:54.510> walk<00:03:54.810> right<00:03:55.530> up<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.890> have

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
actually just walk right up to it have

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.590 
actually just walk right up to it have
this<00:03:56.130> gap<00:03:56.370> here<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:56.700> put<00:03:56.910> your<00:03:57.030> items<00:03:57.359> into

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
this gap here and put your items into

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.599 
this gap here and put your items into
the<00:03:57.810> chest<00:03:58.109> and<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:58.890> can<00:03:59.010> do<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.430> this

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
the chest and so you can do that on this

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.120 
the chest and so you can do that on this
one<00:03:59.819> as<00:04:00.000> well<00:04:00.209> over<00:04:00.480> here<00:04:00.739> however<00:04:01.739> it's<00:04:02.069> going

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
one as well over here however it's going

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.500 
one as well over here however it's going
to<00:04:02.250> be<00:04:02.340> slightly<00:04:02.579> different<00:04:02.880> for<00:04:03.120> these<00:04:03.239> ones

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
to be slightly different for these ones

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.180 
to be slightly different for these ones
over<00:04:03.780> here<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:04.079> would<00:04:04.140> simply<00:04:04.380> attach<00:04:04.890> a

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
over here you would simply attach a

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.640 
over here you would simply attach a
hopper<00:04:06.030> on<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.299> outside<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.049> a<00:04:07.109> chest<00:04:07.350> above

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
hopper on the outside and a chest above

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.590 
hopper on the outside and a chest above
it<00:04:07.769> so<00:04:07.920> you'd<00:04:08.040> have<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.220> go<00:04:08.600> behind-the-scenes

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
it so you'd have to go behind-the-scenes

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.069 
it so you'd have to go behind-the-scenes
to<00:04:10.139> refill<00:04:10.470> these<00:04:10.680> ones<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.870> from<00:04:12.870> what<00:04:12.989> I've

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
to refill these ones so from what I've

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.569 
to refill these ones so from what I've
shown<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.350> so<00:04:13.470> far<00:04:13.680> you've<00:04:14.160> probably<00:04:14.400> been

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
shown you so far you've probably been

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:15.800 
shown you so far you've probably been
able<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.940> figure<00:04:15.269> out<00:04:15.389> how<00:04:15.540> you're<00:04:15.720> gonna

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
able to figure out how you're gonna

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.690 
able to figure out how you're gonna
build<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.320> however<00:04:16.620> if<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.070> haven't<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.579> will

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
build this however if you haven't I will

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.819 
build this however if you haven't I will
give<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.000> quick<00:04:18.329> demonstration<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:19.440> so

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
give you a quick demonstration and so

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.469 
give you a quick demonstration and so
imagine<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.789> wall<00:04:21.030> in<00:04:21.180> your<00:04:21.299> base

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
imagine that this is a wall in your base

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.330 
imagine that this is a wall in your base
just<00:04:21.870> break<00:04:22.109> a<00:04:22.140> block<00:04:22.530> where<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.010> want<00:04:23.220> your

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
just break a block where you want your
