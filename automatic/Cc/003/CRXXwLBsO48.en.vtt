they have to be connected with these

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.990 
they have to be connected with these
down<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> LEDs<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.640> I'm<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
down here for the LEDs and I'm going to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.939 
down here for the LEDs and I'm going to
connect<00:00:54.239> them<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.570> my<00:00:54.719> parking<00:00:55.199> lights<00:00:57.949> okay

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
connect them to my parking lights okay

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.900 
connect them to my parking lights okay
so<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.250> I'm<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.730> is<00:01:01.670> these<00:01:02.670> two

going to crimp those two together using

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.640 
going to crimp those two together using
these<00:01:20.430> splice<00:01:20.909> connectors<00:01:21.420> I'll<00:01:22.170> show<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.409> as

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
these splice connectors I'll show you as

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:31.440 
these splice connectors I'll show you as
I<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.430> them

headlight<00:02:40.290> I've<00:02:40.470> got<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.830> out<00:02:41.070> see<00:02:42.030> the

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
headlight I've got it out see the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
headlight I've got it out see the
distance<00:02:42.660> between<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.500> star<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.250> this

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
distance between this star and this

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.700 
distance between this star and this
white<00:02:46.230> clip<00:02:47.870> looks<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:49.050> about<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.530> little

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
white clip looks like about a little

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.500 
white clip looks like about a little
over<00:02:49.860> an<00:02:50.040> inch<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:50.850> got<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.090> be<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.270> same

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
over an inch it's got to be the same

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.420 
over an inch it's got to be the same
distance<00:02:52.020> on<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.200> new<00:02:52.440> one<00:02:52.680> which<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.190> right

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
distance on the new one which is right

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.800 
distance on the new one which is right
here<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:55.050> it's<00:02:55.980> not<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:57.000> have<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.300> crank<00:02:57.570> this

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
here so it's not you have to crank this

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.400 
here so it's not you have to crank this
down<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> little<00:02:58.890> bit<00:02:59.780> you<00:03:00.780> have<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.960> hold<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
down a little bit you have to hold the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.020 
down a little bit you have to hold the
you<00:03:01.740> have<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:01.920> hold<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.190> end<00:03:02.520> with<00:03:02.760> pliers

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
you have to hold this end with pliers

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.920 
you have to hold this end with pliers
and<00:03:03.390> then<00:03:03.810> crank<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.890> down<00:03:05.750> till<00:03:06.750> they're

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
and then crank this down till they're

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.400 
and then crank this down till they're
just<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.310> same<00:03:08.550> amount<00:03:08.840> as<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:10.080> one<00:03:12.410> I'm

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
just the same amount as that one I'm

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.250 
just the same amount as that one I'm
even<00:03:13.770> going<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> measure<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.780> see<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
even going to measure it see the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.710 
even going to measure it see the
difference<00:03:16.650> right<00:03:16.710> there<00:03:17.030> that<00:03:18.030> that's<00:03:18.420> about

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
difference right there that that's about

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.520 
difference right there that that's about
a<00:03:18.780> quarter-inch

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
a quarter-inch

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.960 
a quarter-inch
I<00:03:23.660> know<00:03:24.660> it's<00:03:24.900> blurry<00:03:25.200> sorry<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:26.550> but<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:26.940> can
