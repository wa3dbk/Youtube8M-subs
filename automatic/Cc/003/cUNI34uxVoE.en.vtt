 like to burn on dvd or on 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.080
 a computer wants to save it 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.830
 also secured for eternity eternity 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.490
 then you are exactly right here 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.519
 I'll show you now like you 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.609
 for example, videos of the 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:30.779
 video cassettes on a pc or on 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.590
 a dvd dvd gets her needed 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.850
 a video recorder 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.399
 you need a pc 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.460
 Connecting cable with so-called change 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.930
 mountain boost these are the yellow and red 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.949
 white plug and you need one 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:57.510
 such video capture the the video 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.600
 Signals converted for the computer with 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.769
 which you can use then and 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.869
 then of course you need one too 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:14.280
 Program the signal next to it or 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.070
 converts to digital signals and that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.490
 either it is already at the video 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.750
 capture the plug in there or 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.340
 I have now I have such a 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.350
 program that means magix and that can 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.030
 you for 30 days I believe for free 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.710
 download 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.810
 if you want to continue using it 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.960
 you have to pay something but that's one 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.299
 very good program that I now here 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.200
 then also need 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:53.520
 So let's start first 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.840
 we connect the connection cable with 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.030
 our video recorder and depending on 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.329
 what a video recorder needs 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.649
 you still like me as an adapter 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:11.250
 and that's what we close at 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.069
 black stronger here so here 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.819
 once again 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:20.909
 the name now connects the 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:24.999
 plug in here with the video recorder and 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:31.329
 then we connect the other end with 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:33.730
 our video capture turns yellow to yellow red 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:37.030
 red means white so actually knew 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:41.260
 Do not do anything wrong and this one 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:45.819
 then it would still be video cable though 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.889
 minutes we do not need and now 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.889
 good last we connect the whole then 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:58.209
 still with our pc and that with help 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:03:05.489
 Although the USB plug is her 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:07.569
 will suspect it in the usb slot 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.409
 of course we still need that 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:18.189
 video insert what on the pc have 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:22.239
 want to tackle so now on the pc and 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:26.590
 I got the program magix here 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:29.680
 that you can download for free 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:37.659
 can and then you have a test phase 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:42.299
 from somehow 30 days to yours now 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:44.620
 getting video on the computer print 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.579
 would like to new video projects 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:53.370
 could create my name 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.370
 I'll call it that 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:04.430
 and then you could get the choice here 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.030
 either videos from their digital cameras 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.370
 import videos from camera 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.220
 to select files on the computer 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.459
 not everything now and educator bios 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.680
 from analog sources for example 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:22.400
 import a video recorder 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.340
 we can choose from this here we can 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.669
 one more choose whether this is just the composite 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:33.110
 what you have on or s video that i have 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:34.640
 not in composite composite now 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:41.120
 I do not know what that is like when you do that 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:44.030
 pronounce on further here you can 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.770
 then you select the recording quality 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.020
 high or very high 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:57.919
 but just needs more space 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:05:02.960
 very much and thank you for video 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:09.650
 Click on computer and then click 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:18.910
 pick it up and at the same time you have to 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:18.910
 still on your recorder press play 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.599
 keep it up 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:31.949
 and then the video should be a book 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.949
 be recorded 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:44.750
 you can live a whole lifetime 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:48.669
 finish resume and then click 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.669
 with records 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:06:01.490
 you push on so you have one here 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.710
 You can still watch the recording 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.750
 and if you are satisfied then time and up 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.930
 dvd wants to burn or just on the 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:16.500
 computer is the bottom right here 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:18.470
 start video editing then you come 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.330
 here 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.940
 here could still settings 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.850
 make the video still edit 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.810
 trim 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:32.510
 there you can still do it yourself 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:34.650
 time to try and if you talk 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:38.030
 you get the green button here 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.030
 finish the film 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:50.729
 and here you can go out with them 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:53.639
 if your video on dvd burn on disc 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:55.710

 not a few other choices 

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:03.629
 say on the computer could secure 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:10.969
 choose the format 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:14.909
 The quality becomes the case of quality 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:17.219
 and then you can save on video 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:19.530
 choose the place where you want to save it 

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:24.919
