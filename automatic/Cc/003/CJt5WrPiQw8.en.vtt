they<00:01:36.750> give<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.799> description<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
they give you a little description of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.359 
they give you a little description of
why<00:01:39.000> she<00:01:39.390> chose<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.320> patterns<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.070> are<00:01:41.130> in

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
why she chose the patterns that are in

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.219 
why she chose the patterns that are in
here<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:41.850> well<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> description<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.079> is

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
here as well as a description of what is

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.010 
here as well as a description of what is
inside<00:01:43.700> but<00:01:44.700> let's<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:44.939> take<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> peek<00:01:45.780> for

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
inside but let's just take a peek for

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.289 
inside but let's just take a peek for
ourselves<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.310> open<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.210> looks

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
ourselves so we open it up and it looks

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.719 
ourselves so we open it up and it looks
like<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.710> let's<00:01:50.159> look<00:01:50.310> at<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> nail

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
like this so let's look at the nail

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.880 
like this so let's look at the nail
wraps<00:01:50.970> first<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.049> get<00:01:52.320> three<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.619> them

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
wraps first so you get three of them

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.880 
wraps first so you get three of them
like<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> said<00:01:53.610> um<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.360> first<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:54.960> these

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
like I said um the first one these

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.770 
like I said um the first one these
actually<00:01:56.130> don't<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.610> no<00:01:56.820> names<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> back

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
actually don't have no names on the back

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.480 
actually don't have no names on the back
of<00:01:57.810> them<00:01:58.079> which<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.409> would<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.950> nice<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
of them which it would be nice with the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.090 
of them which it would be nice with the
names<00:01:59.670> are<00:01:59.850> on<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.090> card<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.439> first<00:02:01.740> one

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
names are on the card so the first one

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.639 
names are on the card so the first one
is<00:02:02.369> prismatic<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.659> I'm<00:02:03.719> assuming<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.320> this

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
is prismatic and I'm assuming it's this

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.620 
is prismatic and I'm assuming it's this
one<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.430> one<00:02:05.610> looks<00:02:05.790> really<00:02:06.030> fun<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.540> a

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
one this one looks really fun it's a

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.749 
one this one looks really fun it's a
nice<00:02:06.750> kind<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.110> geometric<00:02:07.920> pattern<00:02:08.310> from<00:02:08.489> far

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
nice kind of geometric pattern from far

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460 
nice kind of geometric pattern from far
away<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.000> almost<00:02:09.330> looks<00:02:09.629> kind<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.379> like

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
away it almost looks kind of like

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.200 
away it almost looks kind of like
stained<00:02:11.039> glass<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.599> really<00:02:12.780> fun

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
stained glass so this is really fun

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.260 
stained glass so this is really fun
exciting<00:02:13.690> very<00:02:13.870> bright<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.620> colorful<00:02:15.270> great

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
exciting very bright and colorful great

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.910 
exciting very bright and colorful great
for<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.600> summer<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:17.110> think<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.740> will<00:02:17.860> be

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
for the summer I think this will be

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.490 
for the summer I think this will be
really<00:02:18.010> really<00:02:18.310> nice<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:19.540> do<00:02:19.720> get<00:02:19.870> one<00:02:20.170> two

really really nice you do get one two

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.430 
really really nice you do get one two
three<00:02:20.950> four<00:02:21.340> five<00:02:21.400> six<00:02:22.390> seven<00:02:22.690> eight

three four five six seven eight

can<00:02:38.620> definitely<00:02:39.010> try<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.310> film<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.600> next

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
can definitely try to film that the next

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.360 
can definitely try to film that the next
one<00:02:40.960> in<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.140> box<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.650> I'm<00:02:41.830> assuming<00:02:42.280> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
one in the box is I'm assuming the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.880 
one in the box is I'm assuming the
reptilian<00:02:43.000> one<00:02:43.210> because<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:44.290> has<00:02:44.470> kind<00:02:44.800> of

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
reptilian one because it has kind of

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.100 
reptilian one because it has kind of
like<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.100> snakeskin<00:02:45.730> pattern<00:02:46.150> this<00:02:46.660> one<00:02:46.840> really

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
like a snakeskin pattern this one really

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.960 
like a snakeskin pattern this one really
caught<00:02:47.440> my<00:02:47.590> eye<00:02:47.620> when<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:47.980> first<00:02:48.310> saw<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.670> it's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
caught my eye when I first saw it it's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.210 
caught my eye when I first saw it it's
really<00:02:49.150> pretty<00:02:49.420> it's<00:02:49.690> gold<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.380> teal<00:02:50.770> and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
really pretty it's gold and teal and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.460 
really pretty it's gold and teal and
white<00:02:51.280> or<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.090> might<00:02:52.210> be<00:02:52.270> clear<00:02:52.630> actually<00:02:52.870> so

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
white or it might be clear actually so

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.080 
white or it might be clear actually so
another<00:02:53.830> thing<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.190> love<00:02:54.430> about<00:02:54.490> these<00:02:54.880> nail

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
another thing I love about these nail

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.760 
another thing I love about these nail
wraps<00:02:55.330> is<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.690> they're<00:02:55.840> not<00:02:55.990> all<00:02:56.290> identical

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
wraps is that they're not all identical

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.830 
wraps is that they're not all identical
so<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.340> think<00:02:57.460> that's<00:02:57.850> really<00:02:58.060> neat<00:02:58.390> sometimes

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
so I think that's really neat sometimes

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.360 
so I think that's really neat sometimes
when<00:02:59.020> you<00:02:59.110> have<00:02:59.320> like<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.530> bold<00:02:59.830> pattern<00:03:00.220> like

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
when you have like a bold pattern like

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.610 
when you have like a bold pattern like
this<00:03:00.400> it's<00:03:00.820> not<00:03:01.330> as<00:03:01.600> nice<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.900> see<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.410> all<00:03:02.590> over

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
this it's not as nice to see it all over

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.560 
this it's not as nice to see it all over
the<00:03:03.100> nail<00:03:03.310> it's<00:03:03.550> nice<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.940> just<00:03:04.000> get<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.330> few

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
the nail it's nice to just get a few

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.300 
the nail it's nice to just get a few
accents<00:03:05.050> or<00:03:05.290> kind<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.590> like<00:03:05.740> switch<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.100> up<00:03:06.160> a

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
accents or kind of like switch it up a

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.660 
accents or kind of like switch it up a
little<00:03:06.430> bit<00:03:06.550> so<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.790> love<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:08.230> get

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
little bit so I love that you get

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.190 
little bit so I love that you get
different<00:03:09.670> patterns<00:03:10.330> they're<00:03:10.630> not<00:03:10.840> all<00:03:11.170> like

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
different patterns they're not all like

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.710 
different patterns they're not all like
cookie<00:03:11.800> cutter<00:03:12.150> decals<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.420> this<00:03:13.540> one

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
cookie cutter decals and this one

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.390 
cookie cutter decals and this one
actually<00:03:13.870> looks<00:03:14.080> like<00:03:14.350> some<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:14.710> them<00:03:14.830> have<00:03:15.130> a

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
actually looks like some of them have a

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.190 
actually looks like some of them have a
clear<00:03:15.820> background<00:03:16.150> which<00:03:16.600> is<00:03:16.720> really<00:03:16.930> cool

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
clear background which is really cool

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.200 
clear background which is really cool
I've<00:03:17.650> never<00:03:17.980> tried<00:03:18.280> now<00:03:18.490> wraps<00:03:18.730> with<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.970> clear

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
I've never tried now wraps with a clear

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.240 
I've never tried now wraps with a clear
background<00:03:19.450> before<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:20.500> think<00:03:20.650> that's<00:03:21.010> fun

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
background before so I think that's fun

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.280 
background before so I think that's fun
you<00:03:21.430> can<00:03:21.550> either<00:03:21.670> leave<00:03:21.910> your<00:03:22.120> nails<00:03:22.270> bear<00:03:22.960> and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
you can either leave your nails bear and

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.440 
you can either leave your nails bear and
then<00:03:23.470> put<00:03:23.740> these<00:03:23.920> on<00:03:24.160> right<00:03:24.670> on<00:03:24.820> top<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.330> then

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
then put these on right on top and then

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.360 
then put these on right on top and then
you'll<00:03:25.600> see<00:03:25.840> like<00:03:26.080> your<00:03:26.590> name<00:03:26.800> your<00:03:27.040> natural

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
you'll see like your name your natural

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.220 
you'll see like your name your natural
nail<00:03:27.550> underneath<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.210> nail<00:03:28.360> wrap<00:03:28.600> or<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.080> can

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
nail underneath the nail wrap or you can

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.720 
nail underneath the nail wrap or you can
actually<00:03:29.530> paint<00:03:29.710> your<00:03:29.890> nail<00:03:30.040> another<00:03:30.430> color

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
actually paint your nail another color

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.730 
actually paint your nail another color
and<00:03:31.090> then<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.570> can<00:03:31.720> see<00:03:31.960> it<00:03:32.110> through<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.590> nail

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
and then you can see it through the nail

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.590 
and then you can see it through the nail
wrap<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.100> I<00:03:33.130> think<00:03:33.310> that's<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.700> lot<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:34.000> fun<00:03:34.300> so

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
wrap and I think that's a lot of fun so

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.470 
wrap and I think that's a lot of fun so
I<00:03:34.780> am<00:03:35.140> excited<00:03:35.230> about<00:03:35.800> that<00:03:36.100> one<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.700> then<00:03:37.090> the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
I am excited about that one and then the

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.560 
I am excited about that one and then the
third<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.380> final<00:03:39.040> nail<00:03:39.430> wrap<00:03:39.670> in<00:03:39.850> here<00:03:40.210> this

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
third and final nail wrap in here this

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.710 
third and final nail wrap in here this
one<00:03:40.840> is<00:03:41.050> called<00:03:41.500> check<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.220> out<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:43.360> don't

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720

one is called check it out and I don't
really<00:03:44.110> know<00:03:44.530> what<00:03:45.130> exactly<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.850> pattern<00:03:46.000> is

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
really know what exactly the pattern is

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.970 
really know what exactly the pattern is
supposed<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.750> be<00:03:46.900> but<00:03:47.080> it<00:03:47.200> looks<00:03:47.410> like<00:03:47.530> it's<00:03:47.860> a

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
supposed to be but it looks like it's a

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.830 
supposed to be but it looks like it's a
lot<00:03:48.130> of<00:03:48.160> fun<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:48.760> definitely<00:03:49.120> unique<00:03:49.300> almost

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840

as well I think it's really cute this
one<00:03:57.910> also<00:03:58.120> has<00:03:58.330> a<00:03:58.510> clear<00:03:58.840> base<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.680> just

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
one also has a clear base and it just

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
has a really fun unique pattern as you

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.410 
has a really fun unique pattern as you
can<00:04:02.350> see<00:04:02.590> each<00:04:02.890> one<00:04:03.430> is<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:03.790> little<00:04:04.330> bit

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
can see each one is a little bit

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.480 
can see each one is a little bit
different<00:04:04.900> which<00:04:05.050> i<00:04:05.170> think<00:04:05.230> is<00:04:05.590> really<00:04:06.130> fun<00:04:06.310> so

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
different which i think is really fun so

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.640 
different which i think is really fun so
you<00:04:06.580> can<00:04:06.730> use<00:04:06.910> these<00:04:07.120> just<00:04:07.720> as<00:04:07.930> accent<00:04:08.470> nails

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
you can use these just as accent nails

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.680 
you can use these just as accent nails
or<00:04:08.860> put<00:04:09.100> them<00:04:09.220> on<00:04:09.460> all<00:04:09.850> your<00:04:10.030> nails<00:04:10.270> and<00:04:10.570> all

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
or put them on all your nails and all

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.930 
or put them on all your nails and all
your<00:04:10.900> nails<00:04:11.050> won't<00:04:11.380> look<00:04:11.670> exactly<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.700> same

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
your nails won't look exactly the same

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.510 
your nails won't look exactly the same
so<00:04:13.360> I<00:04:13.390> do<00:04:13.510> like<00:04:13.990> that<00:04:14.500> about<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:15.130> I<00:04:15.160> think<00:04:15.400> it's

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
so I do like that about it I think it's

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.789 
so I do like that about it I think it's
a<00:04:15.610> lot<00:04:15.730> of<00:04:15.760> fun<00:04:15.880> and<00:04:16.330> since<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:17.020> do<00:04:17.230> get<00:04:17.560> eight

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
a lot of fun and since you do get eight

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.950 
a lot of fun and since you do get eight
different<00:04:18.549> sizes<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.420> do<00:04:19.600> get<00:04:19.720> two

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:19.960 
different sizes and you do get two

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.330 
different sizes and you do get two
sheets<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.410> these<00:04:20.590> so<00:04:20.739> one<00:04:20.890> for<00:04:21.070> your<00:04:21.130> left

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
sheets of these so one for your left

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.040 
sheets of these so one for your left
hand<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.669> one<00:04:21.820> for<00:04:21.970> your<00:04:22.090> right<00:04:22.300> hand<00:04:22.570> so

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
hand and one for your right hand so

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.270 
hand and one for your right hand so
you're<00:04:23.169> definitely<00:04:23.350> going<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.680> have<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.830> couple

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
you're definitely going to have a couple

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.080 
you're definitely going to have a couple
extra<00:04:24.400> left<00:04:24.820> over<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.540> would

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
extra left over so I would

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.790 
extra left over so I would
I save<00:04:26.389> those<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:26.840> use<00:04:27.020> them<00:04:27.260> as<00:04:27.290> accent

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
I save those and use them as accent

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.220 
I save those and use them as accent
nails<00:04:27.980> for<00:04:28.220> future<00:04:28.610> manicures<00:04:29.210> so<00:04:29.540> those<00:04:29.960> were

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
nails for future manicures so those were

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.810 
nails for future manicures so those were
the<00:04:30.350> three<00:04:30.530> nail<00:04:30.830> wraps<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.430> again<00:04:31.699> I'll

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
the three nail wraps and again I'll

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.520 
the three nail wraps and again I'll
probably<00:04:32.030> use<00:04:32.240> one<00:04:32.750> of<00:04:32.780> these<00:04:32.960> tonight<00:04:33.350> it's

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
probably use one of these tonight it's

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.930 
probably use one of these tonight it's
going<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.740> be<00:04:33.800> hard<00:04:34.040> deciding<00:04:34.400> which<00:04:34.729> one<00:04:34.910> I

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940
