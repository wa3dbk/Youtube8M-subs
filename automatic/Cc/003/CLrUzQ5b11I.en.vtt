job of packaging things it was somewhat

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.170 
job of packaging things it was somewhat
difficult<00:00:36.960> because<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.860> was<00:00:38.010> kind<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.219> shaky<00:00:38.640> so

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
difficult because I was kind of shaky so

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.010 
difficult because I was kind of shaky so
excited<00:00:40.190> yeah<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.239> course<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.570> designed

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
excited yeah and of course it's designed

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.130 
excited yeah and of course it's designed
by<00:00:43.200> Apple<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.649> California

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.130 

I<00:00:47.370> freaked<00:00:48.370> out<00:00:48.489> when<00:00:48.640> i<00:00:48.700> saw<00:00:48.790> this<00:00:49.090> because<00:00:49.600> it

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
I freaked out when i saw this because it

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.869 
I freaked out when i saw this because it
was<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.290> French<00:00:50.530> I<00:00:50.770> know<00:00:51.010> French<00:00:51.220> but<00:00:51.430> I<00:00:51.460> miss

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
was a French I know French but I miss

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.869 
was a French I know French but I miss
Canada<00:00:52.210> right<00:00:52.390> so<00:00:53.110> I<00:00:53.500> think<00:00:53.649> it's<00:00:54.489> required<00:00:54.820> by

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
Canada right so I think it's required by

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.869 
Canada right so I think it's required by
law<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:55.480> have<00:00:55.809> things<00:00:56.220> in<00:00:57.220> english<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:57.760> french

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
law to have things in english and french

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.310 
law to have things in english and french
but<00:00:58.360> i'm<00:00:58.480> not<00:00:58.540> sure<00:00:58.600> about<00:00:58.809> that<00:00:59.050> for

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
get it off I had to figure out a bit and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.520 
get it off I had to figure out a bit and
yeah<00:01:37.210> this<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.660> the<00:01:37.750> aid<00:01:37.929> gigabyte<00:01:38.380> model

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
yeah this is the aid gigabyte model

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.859 
yeah this is the aid gigabyte model
again<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.160> I<00:01:39.850> wasn't<00:01:40.240> really<00:01:40.390> expecting<00:01:40.509> use

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
again and I wasn't really expecting use

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.719 
again and I wasn't really expecting use
that<00:01:40.990> much<00:01:41.140> cuz<00:01:42.009> I<00:01:42.100> don't<00:01:42.190> believe<00:01:42.399> this<00:01:42.550> in<00:01:42.670> a

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
that much cuz I don't believe this in a

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.040 
that much cuz I don't believe this in a
music<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.119> much<00:01:43.270> well<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:43.509> listen<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:43.780> music<00:01:43.869> a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
music that much well I listen to music a

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.380 
music that much well I listen to music a
lot<00:01:44.200> but<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:44.590> was<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:44.830> his<00:01:44.950> same<00:01:45.670> songs<00:01:45.940> over<00:01:46.240> and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
lot but I was in his same songs over and

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.820 
lot but I was in his same songs over and
over<00:01:46.479> again<00:01:46.750> for<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.020> little<00:01:47.140> while<00:01:47.259> I<00:01:47.470> ended<00:01:47.740> up

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
over again for a little while I ended up

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.029 
over again for a little while I ended up
putting<00:01:48.009> a<00:01:48.130> lot<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.250> apps<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:49.090> movies<00:01:49.720> on<00:01:49.960> it

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
putting a lot of apps and movies on it

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.260 
putting a lot of apps and movies on it
so<00:01:51.039> a<00:01:51.070> gigabytes<00:01:51.610> is<00:01:51.759> similarly<00:01:52.030> enough

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
so a gigabytes is similarly enough

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.440 
so a gigabytes is similarly enough
because<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.600> truly<00:01:53.590> have<00:01:53.860> about<00:01:54.159> six<00:01:54.820> point

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
because you truly have about six point

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.230 
because you truly have about six point
five<00:01:55.630> gigabytes<00:01:55.960> usable<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:58.000> you<00:01:58.060> should

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
five gigabytes usable so you should

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.120 
five gigabytes usable so you should
probably<00:01:58.270> pick<00:01:58.540> up<00:01:58.689> the<00:01:58.840> 32<00:01:59.500> gigabyte<00:01:59.979> model

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
probably pick up the 32 gigabyte model

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.190 
probably pick up the 32 gigabyte model
we're<00:02:00.850> bigger<00:02:01.060> if<00:02:01.360> you're<00:02:01.479> expecting<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:02.049> do<00:02:02.170> a

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200
