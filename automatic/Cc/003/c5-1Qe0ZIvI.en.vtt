size<00:02:02.630> about<00:02:03.630> 12<00:02:04.590> inches<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.490> will<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.820> made<00:02:06.030> out

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
size about 12 inches it will be made out

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.600 
size about 12 inches it will be made out
of<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.540> single<00:02:06.719> piece<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.140> pouch<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:08.009> Scottish

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
of a single piece of pouch a Scottish

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.930 
of a single piece of pouch a Scottish
pistol<00:02:09.090> would<00:02:09.360> really

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
pistol would really

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.150 
pistol would really
self<00:02:10.180> around<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.660> handle<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.650> core<00:02:11.920> will

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
self around the handle and the core will

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.200 
self around the handle and the core will
be<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.370> single<00:02:12.760> hair<00:02:12.970> from<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.540> ginger<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:16.030> this

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
be a single hair from a ginger like this

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.100 
be a single hair from a ginger like this
one<00:02:16.530> only<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:18.280> not<00:02:18.550> from<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:19.030> same<00:02:19.450> ginger

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
one only it's not from the same ginger

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.310 
one only it's not from the same ginger
so<00:02:20.500> they<00:02:21.070> can't<00:02:21.340> fight<00:02:21.610> each<00:02:21.790> other<00:02:22.320> it's

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
so they can't fight each other it's

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.370 
so they can't fight each other it's
