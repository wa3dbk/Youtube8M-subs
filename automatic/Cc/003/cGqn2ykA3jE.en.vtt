00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
this isn't this freaking cool so

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.799 
this isn't this freaking cool so
basically<00:00:11.910> what<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.210> mod<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.509> going<00:00:12.719> to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
basically what this mod is going to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.839 
basically what this mod is going to
allow<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> believe<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.639> early

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
allow you to do I believe it is in early

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.519 
allow you to do I believe it is in early
development<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.839> not<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> hundred<00:00:16.379> percent

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
development it's not a hundred percent

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.400 
development it's not a hundred percent
accomplished<00:00:17.369> or<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.930> hundred<00:00:18.930> percent<00:00:19.020> done

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
accomplished or a hundred percent done

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.380 
accomplished or a hundred percent done
the<00:00:19.560> way<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.710> know<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.279> because<00:00:20.310> if<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.359> go

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the way I know that is because if you go

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.599 
the way I know that is because if you go
into<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> nether<00:00:21.960> or<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.320> end<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:23.279> looks<00:00:23.490> like

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
into the nether or the end it looks like

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.950 
into the nether or the end it looks like
a<00:00:23.640> normal<00:00:23.820> nether<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> end<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.869> I'm

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
a normal nether in the end so I'm

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.320 
a normal nether in the end so I'm
assuming<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.500> guy<00:00:25.680> wants<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.580> put<00:00:27.060> these<00:00:27.300> I

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
assuming the guy wants to put these I

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.759 
assuming the guy wants to put these I
don't<00:00:27.689> know<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.990> don't<00:00:28.050> know<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:28.289> he's<00:00:28.380> gonna<00:00:28.470> do

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
don't know I don't know if he's gonna do

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.990 
don't know I don't know if he's gonna do
the<00:00:28.949> nether<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.609> too

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the nether like this too

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.759 
the nether like this too
or<00:00:30.060> I'm<00:00:30.599> not<00:00:30.779> really<00:00:30.990> sure<00:00:31.199> but<00:00:31.230> I'm<00:00:31.560> pretty

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
or I'm not really sure but I'm pretty

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.880 
or I'm not really sure but I'm pretty
sure<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.780> early<00:00:33.780> development<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.739> is

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
sure this is early development but it is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.340 
sure this is early development but it is
freaking<00:00:35.579> awesome<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:37.020> look<00:00:37.260> at

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and if you notice each different little

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.979 
and if you notice each different little
planet<00:00:49.079> or<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> ball<00:00:49.670> is<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> different<00:00:51.629> biome

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
planet or a ball is a different biome

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.810 
planet or a ball is a different biome
and<00:00:52.199> that's<00:00:52.320> what<00:00:52.559> he<00:00:52.770> tried<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.489> when<00:00:53.640> he

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and that's what he tried to do when he

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.630 
and that's what he tried to do when he
made<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.480> yeah<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.079> was<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.260> lava<00:00:55.739> spill

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
made this and yeah that was a lava spill

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.160 
made this and yeah that was a lava spill
looks<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> happened<00:00:57.539> over<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:57.899> when<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
looks like it happened over there when I

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.630 
looks like it happened over there when I
started<00:00:58.500> generating<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.129> world<00:00:59.340> there<00:00:59.550> was

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
started generating this world there was

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.189 
started generating this world there was
a<00:00:59.699> low<00:00:59.969> lava<00:01:00.270> thing<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:00.719> here<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.079> it's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
a low lava thing right here and it's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.799 
a low lava thing right here and it's
just<00:01:01.350> kind<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.730> overfilled<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.030> went<00:01:03.600> there

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
just kind of overfilled and went there

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.479 
just kind of overfilled and went there
and<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.080> there's<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> leaf<00:01:04.589> bomb<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.250> then<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and then there's a leaf bomb and then it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.920 
and then there's a leaf bomb and then it
gets<00:01:05.610> doll<00:01:05.880> leaves<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.330> fire<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.840> that's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
gets doll leaves on fire so that's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
gets doll leaves on fire so that's
pretty<00:01:07.260> interesting<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.950> let's<00:01:08.400> go<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.610> take

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
pretty interesting so let's go and take

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.820 
pretty interesting so let's go and take
a<00:01:08.790> look<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.150> some<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.900> biomes<00:01:10.500> now<00:01:10.650> when

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
a look it's some of the biomes now when

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.370 
a look it's some of the biomes now when
you<00:01:10.979> render<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.760> your<00:01:12.060> first<00:01:12.450> world<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.260> this

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
might notice a lot of lag because there

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.380 
might notice a lot of lag because there
is<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.979> quite<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> bit<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.729> lag<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.180> you're<00:01:21.299> gonna

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
is a quite a bit of lag so you're gonna

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.390 
is a quite a bit of lag so you're gonna
need<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.600> pretty<00:01:21.840> hefty<00:01:22.020> computer<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.130> run<00:01:23.280> this

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
need a pretty hefty computer to run this

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.480 
need a pretty hefty computer to run this
cuz<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> was<00:01:24.000> even<00:01:24.270> lagging<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:25.020> lot<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.680> you

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
cuz I was even lagging like a lot so you

cuz I was even lagging like a lot so you
can<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.090> some<00:01:27.360> sand<00:01:27.659> biomes

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
can see here we have some sand biomes

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.050 
can see here we have some sand biomes
and<00:01:28.619> they<00:01:29.009> are<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.369> didn't<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.729> sandstone

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and they are they didn't have sandstone

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.490 
and they are they didn't have sandstone
on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> bottom<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.900> don't<00:01:31.259> worry<00:01:31.380> about

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
on the bottom so don't worry about

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.780 
on the bottom so don't worry about
following<00:01:31.890> unless<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.430> destroy<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
following unless you destroy the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.280 
following unless you destroy the
sandstone<00:01:33.119> you're<00:01:33.390> kind<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.600> done<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.079> then

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
sandstone you're kind of done and then

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.929 
sandstone you're kind of done and then
we<00:01:34.350> got<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.799> leaf<00:01:35.189> biome<00:01:35.610> which<00:01:35.759> is

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
we got like this leaf biome which is

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.359 
we got like this leaf biome which is
actually<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.750> tree<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> middle<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.250> can

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
actually a tree in the middle so you can

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.039 
actually a tree in the middle so you can
see<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:38.939> tree<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> middle<00:01:39.930> so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
see that we have tree in the middle so

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.510 
see that we have tree in the middle so
that<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> lot<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.829> wood<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:40.979> there<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.430> got

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that is a lot of wood right there we got

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.700 
that is a lot of wood right there we got
some<00:01:41.729> stone<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.509> course<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.170> all<00:01:43.470> your

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
some stone of course you have all your

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.020 
some stone of course you have all your
normal<00:01:43.920> ores<00:01:44.189> you'll<00:01:44.430> be<00:01:44.610> able<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.850> find

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
normal ores you'll be able to find

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.639 
normal ores you'll be able to find
diamonds<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.899> all<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.170> stuff<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
diamonds and all that stuff and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.730 
diamonds and all that stuff and
apparently<00:01:47.399> there<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.439> special<00:01:49.439> block

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
apparently there is a special block

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.499 
apparently there is a special block
somewhere<00:01:50.670> out<00:01:50.759> there<00:01:50.790> see<00:01:51.090> I'm<00:01:51.210> starting<00:01:51.299> to

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
somewhere out there see I'm starting to

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.819 
somewhere out there see I'm starting to
get<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> little<00:01:51.720> bit<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.500> there's<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
get a little bit of a like there's a

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.530 
get a little bit of a like there's a
special<00:01:53.579> block<00:01:53.790> out<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.149> I'm<00:01:54.210> gonna<00:01:54.299> leave

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
special block out there I'm gonna leave

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.270 
special block out there I'm gonna leave
that<00:01:54.570> up<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.110> guys<00:01:55.140> let<00:01:55.890> me<00:01:55.979> know<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.189> you

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
that up to you guys let me know if you

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.440 
that up to you guys let me know if you
can<00:01:56.399> find<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.000> let<00:01:57.119> me<00:01:57.180> know<00:01:57.240> what<00:01:57.420> that

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
can find it and let me know what that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.030 
can find it and let me know what that
special<00:01:57.840> block<00:01:58.110> has<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.380> offer

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
special block has to offer

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.160 
special block has to offer
but<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.549> notice<00:01:59.909> at<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.210> bottom<00:02:00.420> there<00:02:01.140> is

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
but if you notice at the bottom there is

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.100 
but if you notice at the bottom there is
water<00:02:01.950> down<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.759> if<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.969> fall<00:02:03.360> then

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
water down here so if you fall then

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.810 
water down here so if you fall then
you'll<00:02:04.649> be<00:02:04.799> good<00:02:05.009> which<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.490> actually<00:02:05.790> a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
you'll be good which is actually a

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.730 
you'll be good which is actually a
really<00:02:06.420> good<00:02:06.630> thing<00:02:06.689> because<00:02:06.990> usually<00:02:07.350> in

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
really good thing because usually in

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.650 
really good thing because usually in
mods<00:02:08.220> where<00:02:08.550> they<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.849> World<00:02:09.149> generations

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
mods where they have World generations

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.089 
mods where they have World generations
like<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> biosphere<00:02:10.619> mod<00:02:10.950> or

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
like this like a biosphere mod or

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.800 
like this like a biosphere mod or
something<00:02:11.400> they<00:02:11.849> just<00:02:11.879> have<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> void<00:02:12.540> down

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
something they just have a void down

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.190 
something they just have a void down
there

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
there

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.869 
there
don't<00:02:13.319> have<00:02:13.500> something<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.370> let's

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
don't have something like that so let's

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.460 
don't have something like that so let's
say<00:02:15.030> you're<00:02:15.209> all<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.569> way<00:02:15.599> up<00:02:15.750> here<00:02:15.780> mining<00:02:16.349> or

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
say you're all the way up here mining or

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.000 
say you're all the way up here mining or
something

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
something

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.559 
something
you<00:02:17.190> accidentally<00:02:17.610> mine<00:02:17.879> out<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.360> block

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
you accidentally mine out of the block

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.390 
you accidentally mine out of the block
and<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.870> just<00:02:19.080> fall<00:02:19.379> hope<00:02:19.920> you're<00:02:20.220> good

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
and you just fall hope you're good

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.100 
and you just fall hope you're good
you're<00:02:20.760> good<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.269> mean<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.629> build<00:02:21.750> back<00:02:21.959> up

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
you're good I mean you can build back up

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.449 
you're good I mean you can build back up
to<00:02:22.260> another<00:02:22.440> planet<00:02:22.920> but<00:02:22.950> like<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.370> the

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
to another planet but like in the

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.740 
to another planet but like in the
biosphere<00:02:23.910> mod<00:02:24.239> or<00:02:24.360> something<00:02:24.599> like<00:02:24.690> that

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
biosphere mod or something like that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.780 
biosphere mod or something like that
you'd<00:02:25.590> be<00:02:25.830> dead<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.489> would<00:02:26.610> lose

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
you'd be dead and you would lose

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.640 
you'd be dead and you would lose
anything<00:02:27.120> everything<00:02:27.930> because<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.410> fall

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
anything everything because you fall

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.440 
anything everything because you fall
into<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.400> void<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:29.880> guess<00:02:30.090> that's<00:02:30.269> kind<00:02:30.300> of

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
into the void so I guess that's kind of

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.850 
into the void so I guess that's kind of
a<00:02:30.540> bad<00:02:30.690> thing<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.959> can<00:02:31.110> see<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> generating

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
a bad thing you can see the generating

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.650 
a bad thing you can see the generating
and<00:02:32.010> rendering<00:02:32.400> problems<00:02:32.819> are<00:02:33.090> pretty

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
and rendering problems are pretty

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.330 
and rendering problems are pretty
they're<00:02:34.380> pretty<00:02:34.440> bad<00:02:34.830> they<00:02:34.980> kind<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.220> take<00:02:35.310> a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
they're pretty bad they kind of take a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.830 
they're pretty bad they kind of take a
while<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.580> generate<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.209> render<00:02:36.510> I'm<00:02:36.599> not

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
while to generate and render I'm not

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.540 
while to generate and render I'm not
sure<00:02:37.110> why<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.530> mean<00:02:38.010> they're<00:02:38.160> just<00:02:38.340> like<00:02:38.459> the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
sure why I mean they're just like the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.789 
sure why I mean they're just like the
planets<00:02:38.819> but<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.510> am<00:02:40.110> experienced<00:02:40.620> some

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
planets but I am experienced some

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.320 
planets but I am experienced some
serious<00:02:41.250> lag<00:02:41.489> so<00:02:41.700> that's<00:02:41.849> pretty<00:02:42.030> much<00:02:42.120> what

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
serious lag so that's pretty much what

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.850 
serious lag so that's pretty much what
the<00:02:42.480> mod<00:02:42.660> does<00:02:42.930> let's<00:02:43.410> go<00:02:43.500> ahead<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.769> check

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
the mod does let's go ahead and check

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.100 
the mod does let's go ahead and check
out<00:02:44.040> how<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.730> generate<00:02:45.090> your<00:02:45.150> own<00:02:45.510> world

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
out how you can generate your own world
