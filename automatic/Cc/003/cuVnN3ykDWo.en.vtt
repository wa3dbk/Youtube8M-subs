00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:42.030
her take her first steps towards schooling
and now she's going to college and it feels

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.170
like it happened really, really fast.

is like, uh, you know, a big, a big thing,

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.069

&gt;&gt;I'm about to cry!

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.400
&gt;&gt;It's up that way? Wait, It's, I think it's
this building.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.541
&gt;&gt;You can see the whole city! There's Broad
Street! Oh my goodness.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.209
&gt;&gt;I think I can get used to staying here. It's
a little high up but I'll be okay.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.730
&gt;&gt;It's definitely a very different environment,
uh I started out, in uh, with lots of grass

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.530
around me and now I'm in a city, so it's definitely
a big change but, uh, I'm ready.
