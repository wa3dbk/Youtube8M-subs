00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.809
 of the island in straight and the expected 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.639
 sequel to one of the titles of more 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.220
 success reached this week in 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.410
 stores for xbox pc platforms 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.300
 360 and playstation3 and how we had you 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.750
 promised here we bring you our 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.750
 analysis 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.310
 it's not funny 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.430
 true 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.740
 starting with its plot the story 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.450
 continues the same point where it had 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.010
 stayed after the four 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.200
 protagonists of the game were 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.120
 rescued by helicopter from the island 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.770
 of vanity put away safely on a ship 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.989
 military after having lived an authentic 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.300
 nightmare in what we might consider 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.300
 as the beginning of the zombie apocalypse 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.989
 however once on the boat they will 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.030
 realize that they are not really guests 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.979
 but prisoners that are going to be used 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.840
 to discover the reason for your immunity 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.700
 of the epidemic that everything will give a 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.619
 unexpected turn when the ship also 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.330
 suffer a zombie outbreak end 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.220
 shipwrecked on another of the islands of 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.990
 archipelago called for wool and the 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.680
 that again we should try to 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.680
 escape alive 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.820
 for it the beginning we will be able to choose 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.350
 one of the five playable characters already 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.840
 that together with the protagonists of the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.880
 previous episode is to say logan take turns 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.220
 since nissan now joins a new 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.930
 survivor named joan affecting 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.850
 our decision to experience the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.140
 game since everyone has certain 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.140
 unique bonuses 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.240
 in this way to give an example logan 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.100
 is an expert on throwing weapons urn 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.079
 is the one who best dominates firearms 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.850
 whereas Jon is a teacher and the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.860
 melee attacks knowing that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.780
 add to all of them that every person that 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.759
 You can gain experience level up 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.439
 in addition to unlocking new 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.479
 skills through a tree 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.500
 divided into grass plus fury the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.500
 combat and survival 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.330
 good 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.280
 Regarding the gameplay this is a 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.140
 broadly almost identical to the one that already 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.300
 we could see in the first episode of the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.280
 saga dealing with a survival horror 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.750
 that gives us a good freedom when it comes to 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.900
 explore the island with hardly 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.610
 descriptions can be played both in 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.010
 lonely as an online multiplayer 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.780
 cooperative for up to 4 players with the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.400
 possibility will have to leave a 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.500
 starting already started in any 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.240
 moment being its mechanics to simple 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.160
 view very similar to that of a cube 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.700
 action in the first person but having 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.650
 in it a strong rpg component so much 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.780
 so even enemies have 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.730
 their level of experience something 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.080
 that we should pay attention before 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.590
 face them in a way 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.590
 hasty 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.319
 in this sense another detail to have 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.120
 present is that our character has 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.340
 a resistance bar that will go 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.260
 consuming when it occurs use a weapon or 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.150
 perform any other type of action 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.159
 that requires an effort so 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.670
 it is very important not to lose 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.670
 view 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.849
 we will have to go back in many 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.160
 occasions to give time to be 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.500
 recover even more knowing that health 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.660
 of the character does not regenerate on its own 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.519
 which will force us to look for food or 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.519
 medicine cabinets with which you can heal us 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.840
 likewise one of the most 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.999
 striking of the juice is the large number of 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.980
 weapons that we can use since almost 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.989
 any sharp or blunt object 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.969
 can serve to defend us from the 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.920
 zombies and while there are also diverse 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:56.689
 firearms in the ammunition of these 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.689
 They are not very abundant 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.790
 also as usual in the cobos of 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.770
 combis all weapons wear out with 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.840
 its use so it is very important 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.670
 look for new objects with which 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.500
 defend ourselves also being possible 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.360
 repair and improve the weapons that already 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.610
 we have in our power and even 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.650
 create new weapons even more effective if 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.040
 we get the necessary materials 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.040
 for it 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.490
 for its part regarding the development of 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.560
 the adventure the game system is based 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.090
 mainly in going overcoming missions 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.979
 that will be proposed by others 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.930
 survivors of the island although it will be 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.330
 The player's decision to help them 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.889
 to not ignore since many 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.889
 of the missions are optional 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.500
 and also next to the inclusion of new 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.270
 types of zombies new weapons and new 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.250
 vehicles that we can drive by 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.380
 land and now also by water one of 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.330
 the most interesting novelties are the 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.010
 new defensive missions in which 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.810
 we will have to protect an area of ​​a 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.000
 imminent zombie attack having to 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.350
 place explosive traps fences 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.780
 containment and even machine guns 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.790
 fixed strategically making 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.050
 these missions precisely the ones that 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.050
 We have fun like 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.150
 active 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.229
 and before concluding in what concerns 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.000
 to the technical section again we are 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.949
 before a title that stands out for the 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.870
 Great recreation of the island in the 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.840
 that all the painting and the 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.669
 great extent that this offers us 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.050
 to mention also the high variety 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.300
 of zombies that we will find 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.520
 having this is a behavior and a 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.410
 damage system very accomplished that always 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.419
 will respond realistically in our 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.440
 attacks according to what part of the body 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.440
 we have hit 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.340
 although in the negative part we have to 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.230
 say that the graphic engine has not 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.330
 evolved too much and regarding 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.010
 previous game not seeing us surprised 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.470
 as much as in his day he did his 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.660
 predecessor the same we can say of the 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.730
 Sound section, staying in the 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.680
 same line with the same dubbing of the 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.900
 lights only in English while the 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.170
 game counts once again with subtitles 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.170
 in Spanish 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.110
 do not 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.090
 marley walmart in conclusion we are 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.560
 convinced that this is the line that 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.630
 would like to all those who already 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.310
 enjoyed at the time with the first 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.200
 delivery being an anti game is very 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.060
 easy to get hooked and that thanks to 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.100
 Zanetti news is now for you 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.900
 even much more fun especially 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.310
 if you play cooperatively in 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.310
 together with three marx users 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:50.629
 although on the other hand it does not support too many 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:52.639
 face elements attract new 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:54.770
 players throwing themselves also in lack 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.839
 something more innovation in some of its 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.029
 sections leaving us some sensations 

00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:02.050
 of the game has been oriented mainly to 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:02.050
 expansion mode
