00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
little too high I really want something

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.650 
little too high I really want something
where<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.740> horizon<00:01:30.250> line<00:01:30.910> is<00:01:31.090> a<00:01:31.119> little<00:01:31.360> lower

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
where the horizon line is a little lower

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.070 
where the horizon line is a little lower
in<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.259> image<00:01:32.649> so<00:01:33.149> probably<00:01:34.149> something<00:01:34.840> like

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
in the image so probably something like

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.680 
in the image so probably something like
this<00:01:35.380> one<00:01:35.619> will<00:01:35.860> work<00:01:36.009> well<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.360> when<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.479> find

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
this one will work well so when you find

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.670 
this one will work well so when you find
the<00:01:37.750> one<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:37.960> want<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.140> just<00:01:38.200> click<00:01:38.500> on<00:01:38.619> it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
the one you want you just click on it

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.650 
the one you want you just click on it
and<00:01:38.920> it's<00:01:39.250> going<00:01:39.399> to<00:01:39.550> automatically<00:01:40.149> add<00:01:40.390> that

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
and it's going to automatically add that

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.719 
and it's going to automatically add that
as<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:40.930> new<00:01:41.200> layer<00:01:41.409> here<00:01:42.040> inside<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.430> perfect

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
as a new layer here inside of perfect

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.210 
as a new layer here inside of perfect
layers<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.780> I'm<00:01:44.380> just<00:01:44.500> gonna<00:01:44.620> use<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.010> free

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
layers and I'm just gonna use the free

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.910 
layers and I'm just gonna use the free
transform<00:01:45.490> tool<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:46.540> position<00:01:46.870> it<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.530> size

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
transform tool to position it and size

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.560 
transform tool to position it and size
it<00:01:48.190> so<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.729> want<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.060> make<00:01:49.210> sure<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:49.420> the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
it so I want to make sure that the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.560 
it so I want to make sure that the
bottom<00:01:50.110> of<00:01:50.260> my<00:01:50.799> sky<00:01:51.190> is<00:01:51.729> just<00:01:52.180> below<00:01:52.420> the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
bottom of my sky is just below the

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.930 
bottom of my sky is just below the
horizon<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:53.560> my<00:01:53.890> image<00:01:54.280> so<00:01:54.610> I'm<00:01:54.670> going<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.820> go

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
horizon in my image so I'm going to go

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.390 
horizon in my image so I'm going to go
right<00:01:55.119> about<00:01:55.270> there<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:56.080> let's<00:01:56.860> just<00:01:56.920> stretch

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
right about there and let's just stretch

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.460 
right about there and let's just stretch
it<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:57.760> say<00:01:58.030> about<00:01:58.180> skies<00:01:58.540> is<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:58.900> can<00:01:59.049> stretch

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
it I say about skies is you can stretch

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.660 
it I say about skies is you can stretch
them<00:01:59.619> around<00:01:59.770> quite<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.070> bit<00:02:00.159> and<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.430> can't

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
them around quite a bit and you can't

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.700 
them around quite a bit and you can't
really<00:02:00.790> tell<00:02:01.260> so<00:02:02.260> there<00:02:02.409> we<00:02:02.470> go

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
really tell so there we go

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.399 
really tell so there we go
you've<00:02:03.040> got<00:02:03.190> our<00:02:03.430> new<00:02:03.909> sky<00:02:04.180> positioned<00:02:04.840> I'm

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
you've got our new sky positioned I'm

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.530 
you've got our new sky positioned I'm
going<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.920> drag<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.520> underneath<00:02:07.360> my

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
going to drag it underneath my

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.289 
going to drag it underneath my
foreground<00:02:08.170> layer<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:09.369> hides<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.910> it's<00:02:10.090> just

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
foreground layer that hides it it's just

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.210 
foreground layer that hides it it's just
sitting<00:02:10.630> behind<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:11.260> boring<00:02:11.650> looking<00:02:11.920> sky

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
sitting behind this boring looking sky

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.340 
sitting behind this boring looking sky
now<00:02:12.910> I'll<00:02:13.030> use<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.299> masking<00:02:13.750> brush<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.170> paint

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
now I'll use the masking brush to paint

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.130 
now I'll use the masking brush to paint
the<00:02:14.470> sky<00:02:14.830> away<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.459> reveal<00:02:15.880> our<00:02:15.910> new<00:02:16.209> sky<00:02:16.450> so

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the sky away and reveal our new sky so

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.539 
the sky away and reveal our new sky so
I'm<00:02:17.200> just<00:02:17.290> gonna<00:02:17.380> grab<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.920> masking<00:02:18.310> brush

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
I'm just gonna grab the masking brush

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.449 
I'm just gonna grab the masking brush
tool<00:02:18.880> right<00:02:19.269> here<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.010> see<00:02:21.130> as<00:02:21.280> I

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
tool right here so you can see as I

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.500 
tool right here so you can see as I
paint<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.910> reveals<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:23.730> much<00:02:24.730> better<00:02:25.030> much

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
paint it reveals that much better much

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.300 
paint it reveals that much better much
more<00:02:25.660> interesting<00:02:26.170> looking<00:02:26.410> sky<00:02:26.739> now<00:02:27.190> the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
more interesting looking sky now the

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.610 
more interesting looking sky now the
problem<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:28.120> when<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.780> get<00:02:29.019> down<00:02:29.140> here<00:02:29.200> to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
problem that is when I get down here to

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.979 
problem that is when I get down here to
the<00:02:29.650> edge<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.549> would<00:02:31.180> have<00:02:31.299> to<00:02:31.420> zoom<00:02:31.660> in<00:02:31.810> really

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
the edge I would have to zoom in really

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.250 
the edge I would have to zoom in really
close<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.739> paint<00:02:33.100> incredibly<00:02:33.850> accurately<00:02:34.630> to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
close and paint incredibly accurately to

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.110 
close and paint incredibly accurately to
be<00:02:35.410> able<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.650> get<00:02:35.829> a<00:02:35.860> good<00:02:36.250> transition<00:02:36.760> and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
be able to get a good transition and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.819 
be able to get a good transition and
especially<00:02:37.690> for<00:02:37.989> something<00:02:38.260> like<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.560> tree

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
especially for something like the tree

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.160 
especially for something like the tree
it<00:02:39.370> would<00:02:39.489> be<00:02:39.610> almost<00:02:39.790> impossible<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:40.930> really

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
it would be almost impossible you really

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.440 
it would be almost impossible you really
have<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.410> create<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.829> very<00:02:42.250> complex<00:02:42.730> mask<00:02:43.060> now

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
have to create a very complex mask now

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.420 
have to create a very complex mask now
you<00:02:44.230> could<00:02:44.410> go<00:02:44.530> in<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.829> if<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.130> have<00:02:45.160> the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
you could go in and if you have the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.470 
you could go in and if you have the
perfect<00:02:45.700> photo<00:02:45.819> suite<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.180> could<00:02:46.360> use

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
perfect photo suite you could use

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.990 
perfect photo suite you could use
perfect<00:02:46.780> mass<00:02:47.200> which<00:02:47.500> really<00:02:47.800> excels<00:02:48.190> at<00:02:48.489> this

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
perfect mass which really excels at this

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.940 
perfect mass which really excels at this
type<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.319> complex<00:02:50.319> masking

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
type of complex masking

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.610 
type of complex masking
but<00:02:51.459> for<00:02:51.790> something<00:02:52.060> on<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.450> fairly<00:02:53.319> simple

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
but for something on a fairly simple

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.949 
but for something on a fairly simple
background<00:02:54.069> like<00:02:54.190> this<00:02:54.370> solid<00:02:54.670> blue<00:02:55.060> sky<00:02:55.360> you

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
background like this solid blue sky you

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.479 
background like this solid blue sky you
can<00:02:56.080> actually<00:02:56.410> use<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.709> built-in<00:02:57.099> perfect

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
can actually use the built-in perfect

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.180 
can actually use the built-in perfect
brush<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:59.290> turn<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.560> on<00:02:59.650> you<00:02:59.709> just<00:02:59.980> toggle

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
brush and to turn it on you just toggle

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.940 
brush and to turn it on you just toggle
a<00:03:00.370> little<00:03:00.550> perfect<00:03:00.849> checkbox<00:03:01.540> right<00:03:01.900> here<00:03:02.170> you

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
a little perfect checkbox right here you

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.880 
a little perfect checkbox right here you
can<00:03:03.099> also<00:03:03.250> use<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.760> new<00:03:03.940> command<00:03:04.540> R<00:03:04.750> or<00:03:05.110> ctrl<00:03:05.680> R

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
can also use the new command R or ctrl R

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.740 
can also use the new command R or ctrl R
keyboard<00:03:06.400> shortcut<00:03:06.819> which<00:03:07.300> allows<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.660> to

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
keyboard shortcut which allows you to

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.210 
keyboard shortcut which allows you to
turn<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:07.959> on<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.319> off<00:03:08.560> quickly<00:03:09.069> while

turn that on and off quickly while

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.670 
turn that on and off quickly while
you're<00:03:09.370> brushing<00:03:09.550> there<00:03:10.420> we<00:03:10.510> go<00:03:10.630> now<00:03:11.380> I'm<00:03:11.530> just

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
you're brushing there we go now I'm just

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.240 
you're brushing there we go now I'm just
going<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:12.540> brush<00:03:13.540> with<00:03:14.260> my<00:03:14.410> brush<00:03:14.680> all<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:14.950> way

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
going to brush with my brush all the way

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.030 
going to brush with my brush all the way
into<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.720> horizon<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.440> notice<00:03:17.739> how<00:03:17.860> it's

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
into the horizon and you notice how it's

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.570 
into the horizon and you notice how it's
stopping

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
stopping

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.479 
stopping
automatically<00:03:19.360> at<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.690> trees<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.489> hitting

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
automatically at the trees and hitting

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.390 
automatically at the trees and hitting
that<00:03:21.610> sky<00:03:22.030> away<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.620> I<00:03:23.650> can<00:03:23.830> just<00:03:23.920> paint<00:03:24.190> right

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
that sky away so I can just paint right

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.070 
that sky away so I can just paint right
along<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.700> edge<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:25.269> it<00:03:25.540> automatically

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
along the edge and it automatically

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.710 
along the edge and it automatically
creates<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.620> mask<00:03:26.950> for<00:03:27.340> me<00:03:27.370> even<00:03:28.120> when<00:03:28.390> I<00:03:28.480> come

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
creates the mask for me even when I come

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.509 
creates the mask for me even when I come
into<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.019> tree<00:03:29.260> with<00:03:29.290> those<00:03:29.620> little<00:03:29.860> branches

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
into the tree with those little branches

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.210 
into the tree with those little branches
and<00:03:30.910> needles<00:03:31.269> it's<00:03:32.110> gonna<00:03:32.260> automatically

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
and needles it's gonna automatically

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.580 
and needles it's gonna automatically
remove<00:03:33.940> just<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.540> color<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.989> blue<00:03:35.230> in<00:03:35.349> the<00:03:35.380> sky

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
remove just the color of blue in the sky

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.330 
remove just the color of blue in the sky
and<00:03:36.099> leave<00:03:36.760> all<00:03:37.060> of<00:03:37.120> those<00:03:37.599> green<00:03:38.140> needles<00:03:39.040> and

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
and leave all of those green needles and

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.729 
and leave all of those green needles and
the<00:03:39.489> brown<00:03:39.760> branches<00:03:40.480> behind<00:03:40.900> because

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
the brown branches behind because

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.990 
the brown branches behind because
they're<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:41.920> different<00:03:42.130> color

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
they're a different color

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.150 
they're a different color
so<00:03:44.810> I'm<00:03:44.870> just<00:03:45.020> gonna<00:03:45.110> brush<00:03:45.470> along<00:03:45.740> the<00:03:45.950> edge

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
so I'm just gonna brush along the edge

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.930 
so I'm just gonna brush along the edge
here<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.730> we'll<00:03:46.910> kind<00:03:47.150> of<00:03:47.240> finish<00:03:47.840> this<00:03:48.020> up

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
here and we'll kind of finish this up

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.940 
here and we'll kind of finish this up
now<00:03:49.940> that's<00:03:50.060> done<00:03:50.210> a<00:03:50.270> pretty<00:03:50.540> good<00:03:50.660> job<00:03:50.810> so<00:03:51.050> far

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
now that's done a pretty good job so far

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.400 
now that's done a pretty good job so far
but<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.340> notice<00:03:52.520> there's<00:03:52.910> a<00:03:53.120> lot<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.810> area<00:03:54.230> on

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
but you notice there's a lot of area on

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.380 
but you notice there's a lot of area on
the<00:03:54.650> inside<00:03:55.190> of<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.430> tree<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.090> wasn't

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
the inside of the tree that I wasn't

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.900 
the inside of the tree that I wasn't
able<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.870> get<00:03:57.080> if<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:57.710> was<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:58.010> just<00:03:58.070> brush

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
able to get if I was to just brush

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.000 
able to get if I was to just brush
straight<00:03:59.540> across<00:03:59.810> the<00:04:00.140> tree<00:04:00.350> it<00:04:00.710> would<00:04:00.830> start

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
straight across the tree it would start

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.800 
straight across the tree it would start
to<00:04:01.100> paint<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.580> tree<00:04:01.820> away<00:04:01.940> we<00:04:02.210> don't<00:04:02.390> want<00:04:02.720> to

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
to paint the tree away we don't want to

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.050 
to paint the tree away we don't want to
do<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:03.050> we<00:04:03.200> want<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:03.470> maintain<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.980> tree<00:04:04.250> so

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
do that we want to maintain the tree so

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.880 
do that we want to maintain the tree so
there's<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:05.600> great<00:04:05.900> new<00:04:06.050> feature<00:04:06.230> in<00:04:06.710> the

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
there's a great new feature in the

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.100 
there's a great new feature in the
perfect<00:04:07.280> brush<00:04:07.520> which<00:04:07.760> allows<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.210> to<00:04:08.240> hold

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
perfect brush which allows you to hold

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.510 
perfect brush which allows you to hold
the<00:04:09.350> color<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:10.010> can<00:04:10.100> remember<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.430> way<00:04:10.490> the

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
the color you can remember the way the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.280 
the color you can remember the way the
perfect<00:04:10.970> brush<00:04:11.150> works<00:04:11.360> is<00:04:11.570> by<00:04:11.690> sampling<00:04:12.140> the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
perfect brush works is by sampling the

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.040 
perfect brush works is by sampling the
color<00:04:12.530> underneath<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:13.130> center<00:04:13.520> of<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:14.050> so

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
color underneath the center of it so

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.390 
color underneath the center of it so
what<00:04:15.170> you<00:04:15.260> do<00:04:15.380> is<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.620> start<00:04:15.800> to<00:04:15.980> paint<00:04:16.190> where

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
what you do is you start to paint where

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.280 
what you do is you start to paint where
you<00:04:16.489> don't<00:04:16.670> want<00:04:16.880> then<00:04:17.600> hold<00:04:17.989> down<00:04:18.140> the

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
you don't want then hold down the

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.349 
you don't want then hold down the
command<00:04:18.470> key<00:04:18.980> on<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.160> Mac<00:04:19.400> or<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.700> control<00:04:20.120> key

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
command key on a Mac or the control key

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.990 
command key on a Mac or the control key
on<00:04:20.540> Windows<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.230> it<00:04:21.830> stops<00:04:22.310> sampling<00:04:22.880> the

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
on Windows and it stops sampling the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.760 
on Windows and it stops sampling the
colors<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.540> whatever<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.960> last<00:04:24.260> color<00:04:24.620> is

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
colors that whatever the last color is

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.920 
colors that whatever the last color is
you<00:04:24.860> work<00:04:25.010> on<00:04:25.190> so<00:04:25.400> right<00:04:25.610> now<00:04:25.850> I've<00:04:26.300> sampled<00:04:26.690> a

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
you work on so right now I've sampled a

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.480 
you work on so right now I've sampled a
color<00:04:27.140> from<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.440> sky<00:04:27.650> I'm<00:04:27.950> holding<00:04:28.340> down<00:04:28.430> my

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
color from the sky I'm holding down my

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.910 
color from the sky I'm holding down my
command<00:04:29.000> key<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.390> now<00:04:29.900> it'll<00:04:30.170> only<00:04:30.620> paint

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
command key and now it'll only paint

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.550 
command key and now it'll only paint
away<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.370> particular<00:04:32.120> color<00:04:32.630> as<00:04:33.170> I<00:04:33.320> paint

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
away that particular color as I paint

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.140 
away that particular color as I paint
through<00:04:33.800> so<00:04:34.040> now<00:04:34.070> I<00:04:34.220> can<00:04:34.430> brush<00:04:34.730> right<00:04:35.090> through

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
through so now I can brush right through

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.659 
through so now I can brush right through
the<00:04:35.419> middle<00:04:35.660> of<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.930> tree<00:04:36.230> and<00:04:36.560> get<00:04:37.460> rid<00:04:37.640> of

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
the middle of the tree and get rid of

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.180 
the middle of the tree and get rid of
all<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.360> color<00:04:38.690> of<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.110> sky<00:04:39.410> in<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.860> middle

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
all the color of the sky in the middle

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.820 
all the color of the sky in the middle
without<00:04:40.640> having<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.330> have<00:04:41.870> it<00:04:41.990> automatically

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
without having to have it automatically

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.760 
without having to have it automatically
or<00:04:43.030> accidentally<00:04:44.030> remove<00:04:44.750> any<00:04:45.020> other<00:04:45.380> color

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
or accidentally remove any other color

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.030 
or accidentally remove any other color
so<00:04:46.700> this<00:04:46.850> gives<00:04:47.030> me<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.450> nice<00:04:47.990> clean<00:04:48.560> looking

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
so this gives me a nice clean looking

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.040 
so this gives me a nice clean looking
mask<00:04:49.310> let's<00:04:50.210> go<00:04:50.390> ahead<00:04:50.450> and<00:04:50.600> take<00:04:50.690> a<00:04:50.720> look<00:04:50.930> at

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
mask let's go ahead and take a look at

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.720
