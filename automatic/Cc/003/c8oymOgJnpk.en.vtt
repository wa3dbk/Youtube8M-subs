00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
hey guys welcome to 11:59 videos we've

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.340 
hey guys welcome to 11:59 videos we've
got<00:00:09.270> a<00:00:09.300> 2002<00:00:10.110> BMW<00:00:10.880> 325i<00:00:11.880> right<00:00:12.210> here<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.630> we're

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350 
got a 2002 BMW 325i right here and we're

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.690 
got a 2002 BMW 325i right here and we're
having<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.590> little<00:00:13.770> bit<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.980> problems<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:14.550> we're

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
having a little bit of problems so we're

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.369 
having a little bit of problems so we're
going<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.850> be<00:00:14.940> troubleshooting<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:16.139> one

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
going to be troubleshooting it this one

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.840 
going to be troubleshooting it this one
will<00:00:16.530> actually<00:00:16.560> start<00:00:17.160> up<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.640> shuts

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
will actually start up but it shuts

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.330 
will actually start up but it shuts
right<00:00:18.030> back<00:00:18.210> off<00:00:18.450> and<00:00:19.039> so<00:00:20.039> we've<00:00:20.190> already

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
right back off and so we've already

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.830 
right back off and so we've already
changed<00:00:20.550> out<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> throttle<00:00:21.270> body<00:00:21.450> it

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
changed out the throttle body it

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.390 
changed out the throttle body it
actually<00:00:22.140> had<00:00:22.440> a<00:00:22.500> problem<00:00:22.680> with<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.039> fly<00:00:23.190> by

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
actually had a problem with the fly by

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.400 
actually had a problem with the fly by
wire<00:00:23.550> throttle<00:00:23.910> body<00:00:24.270> it<00:00:24.539> was<00:00:24.630> pulsing<00:00:25.260> and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
wire throttle body it was pulsing and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
wire throttle body it was pulsing and
stuff<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:25.890> once<00:00:26.100> I<00:00:26.220> was<00:00:26.250> changed<00:00:26.730> out<00:00:26.910> we've

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
stuff so once I was changed out we've

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.880 
stuff so once I was changed out we've
already<00:00:27.270> put<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> new<00:00:27.810> fuel<00:00:27.990> filter<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> what

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
already put a new fuel filter on it what

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.040 
already put a new fuel filter on it what
she's<00:00:29.039> got<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.400> pressure<00:00:30.210> regulator<00:00:30.600> built

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
she's got the pressure regulator built

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.950 
she's got the pressure regulator built
into<00:00:31.440> it<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.740> pretty<00:00:32.310> much<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:33.510> running<00:00:33.840> out

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
into it so pretty much it's running out

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.620 
into it so pretty much it's running out
of<00:00:33.989> fuel<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.470> it<00:00:34.590> fires<00:00:34.829> up<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.520> next<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.450> is

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
of fuel as it fires up so next up is

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.060 
of fuel as it fires up so next up is
going<00:00:36.810> to<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> fuel<00:00:37.260> pump<00:00:37.410> swap<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.890> this

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
going to be a fuel pump swap in this

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.530 
going to be a fuel pump swap in this
thing

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
thing

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.370 
thing
anyways<00:00:39.540> I'm<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> show<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.079> what<00:00:40.260> it

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
anyways I'm going to show you what it

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.670 
anyways I'm going to show you what it
does<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.710> go<00:00:40.800> fire<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.160> up<00:00:41.250> which<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:42.680> right

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
does we go fire it up which here right

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.080 
does we go fire it up which here right
now<00:00:43.829> we're<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> go<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.430> fire<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
now we're going to go and fire it up and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.580 
now we're going to go and fire it up and
I'm<00:00:45.239> gonna<00:00:45.390> let<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.600> hear<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.230> doing

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
I'm gonna let you hear what it's doing

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.560 
I'm gonna let you hear what it's doing
so<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.250> kind<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.579> get<00:00:47.700> an<00:00:47.790> idea<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.390> see

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
so you can kind of get an idea and see

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.810 
so you can kind of get an idea and see
what<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.870> dumb<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:50.130> know<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> problem

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
what it's dumb you know what the problem

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.139 
what it's dumb you know what the problem
is<00:00:51.110> consists<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.200> and<00:00:52.640> from<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:53.850> we're

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
is consists of and from there we're

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.760 
is consists of and from there we're

going to show you we'll come back after

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.340 
going to show you we'll come back after
the<00:00:55.890> problems<00:00:56.190> been<00:00:56.370> fixed<00:00:56.790> and<00:00:57.140> explain<00:00:58.140> what

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the problems been fixed and explain what

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.950 
the problems been fixed and explain what
was<00:00:58.440> done<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.950> what<00:00:59.700> was<00:00:59.730> fixed<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.840> I've

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
was done and what was fixed now I've

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.779 
was done and what was fixed now I've
already<00:01:01.110> done<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.680> pressure<00:01:02.100> reading<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.640> this

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
already done a pressure reading on this

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.210 
already done a pressure reading on this
it<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.239> pulling<00:01:03.570> off<00:01:03.690> about<00:01:03.930> 22<00:01:04.619> pounds<00:01:05.100> of

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it was pulling off about 22 pounds of

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.810 
it was pulling off about 22 pounds of
pressure<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.780> fuel<00:01:07.260> rail<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
pressure up on the fuel rail here so and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.039 
pressure up on the fuel rail here so and
it<00:01:08.909> should<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.180> quite<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> bit<00:01:09.630> more<00:01:09.659> than<00:01:09.869> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
it should be quite a bit more than that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:50.360 
it should be quite a bit more than that
so<00:01:11.010> anyways<00:01:11.310> when<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.580> fire<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.940> up<00:01:12.030> let's<00:01:12.270> hear

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.580 

as<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.090> see<00:01:51.300> after<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.810> builds<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.200> little<00:01:52.500> bit

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
as you see after it builds a little bit

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.200 
as you see after it builds a little bit
of<00:01:52.680> pressure<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.130> actually<00:01:53.580> finally<00:01:53.970> stay

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
of pressure it actually finally stay

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.540 
of pressure it actually finally stay
running<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.650> actually<00:01:55.830> put<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.430> into

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
running but if you actually put it into

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.490 
running but if you actually put it into
drive<00:01:56.790> right<00:01:57.180> now<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.780> all<00:01:58.050> right<00:01:58.290> out

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
drive right now it is all right out

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.490 
drive right now it is all right out
installation

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.620 

go<00:02:01.590> fix<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.550> dog<00:02:02.730> will<00:02:03.030> come<00:02:03.210> back<00:02:03.360> with
