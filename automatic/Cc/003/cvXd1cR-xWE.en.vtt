00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.080
 flipa colleague when he was 5 years as 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.119

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.439
 You know neither Windows nor pricks in vinegar 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.390
 I used a thing called ms 2 you could 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.610
 say it was kind of nerdy but it was not 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.619
 because he did not record glasses he never has 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.450
 many consoles but they gave me 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.270
 the nintendo the one that had 300,000 the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.429

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.190
 guilty as always was money not 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.740
 We were left over for that reason I never left 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.810

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.479

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.759
 I have never seen snow nor have I ever 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.439
 played with it the truth is that it matures 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.060
 very fast on this issue he did not even 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.829
 the communion for the economic issue all 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.720
 the days for the fucking bastard gifts 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.149
 I already knew that don whiskers and dona 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.650
 men did the best for me although I did not 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.989
 They could make me many gifts 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.730
 materials and that's why I've loved them and 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.099
 I will always love them and they have made me so 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.400
 Happy the school subject as some 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.530
 other people that I have been able to see because no no 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.050
 I was very much with the rest of the world 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.970
 I was with his little group and I was a 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.549
 little more secluded ever had a 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.010
 companion but rarely endured 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.500
 everyone played soccer and I was 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.910
 I did not like a poop either 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.130
 that injured me with ease 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.720
 incredible on the subject of the notes then 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.540
 in sciences I 've always done well in 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.370
 not so much everything that is not 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.400
 my imagination inspires me 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.500
 I liked and took notes even though 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.890
 he can never touch a book at home or 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.860
 study neither 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.900
 to look like him and I owe that to him 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.319
 domigo test that seems to have had a 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.410
 pretty good brain and I inherited it 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.170
 I was a gifted and I did not like 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.730
 neither too much television until 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.250
 that one day I met a channel called k 3 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.200
 a Catalan-speaking channel where I was 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.110
 redim is unstoppable and is that 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.260
 they loved that kind of stories this 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.630
 encouraged to search the internet that it was not 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.260
 very common at that time places where 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.970
 buy animes and good other things 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.010
 also there was when it became fashionable 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.739
 of counter-strike and later the inei 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.250
 2 and soon appeared the great machine 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.100
 playstation 2 thanks to her I was inspired 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.680
 very much I met a lot of 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.650
 videogames and some that I 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.850
 they influenced a lot to this day 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.410
 thanks the video games can learn 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.350
 the English that they do not teach me in the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.550
 school then the school change came 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.870
 to the Institute 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.810
 here I inwardly suffer a great 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.100
 change are still others and I 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.490
 they kept seeing the same person me 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.920
 I kept going quite alone but for me 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.220
 I had an increase in manal an increase 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.870
 moral that allowed me to realize the 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.120
 person that was and be comfortable with me 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.430
 same stop underestimating me and that 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.220
 it meant a lot to others for my 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.990
 fellow I am is in the same but 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.739
 for the little ones I was a kind 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.440
 of hero 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.550
 That encouraged me because despite the fact that 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.470
 I liked the comments so much 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.720
 negative but I needed some kind 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.670
 of recognition to gain confidence 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.890
 with myself, he defined me a lot 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.890
 eye person should not be confused with 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.840
 being an egomaniac I realized that's why 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.210
 the girls started to notice me and 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.360
 well I in them the truth that sometimes 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.530
 It was even a shameless, do not you believe 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.660
 that has been a fucking video like 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.320
 many think I would define myself more as 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.320
 romantic 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.360
 and I could not tell you exactly when 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.580
 I met my best friend we did many 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.110
 nonsense and we had fun 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.000
 incredibly well no matter how old 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.949
 what happened or how much we have 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.740
 distanced has always remained the 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.600
 same relationship as the whole world the 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.520
 course of life kept going and I went 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.500
 losing relatives who on the contrary 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.750
 that on this board will never be deleted 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.820
 of my life and will always belong to her 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.470
 today I play lol, I have friends 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.229
 here and there including on the internet 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.060
 I have an incredible job but true 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.979
 I still have my family and also a 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.600
 special person and now have a 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.360
 youtube channel and I do not know about you but 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.669
 I am very happy 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.069
 and also my lifelong dream that has 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.229
 been to make others laugh it could be 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.960
 say that I have fulfilled it to a lesser extent 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.270
 thanks to youtube there any riise 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.500
 of me or you laugh with me and it does not matter if 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.560
 We are 100 or 10,000 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.479
 I am even happier at the end and 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.430
 finally we are all selfish 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.139
 we seek our own happiness but 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.819
 according to my point of view I think that the 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.530
 consequences of what this implies to the 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.919
 doing it is what defines us as 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.919
 people
