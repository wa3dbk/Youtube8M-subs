00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.870
 you are welcome 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.520
 very happy to come to Monaco to 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.799
 this club that is one of the biggest 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.020
 from france and good to do the best 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:24.279
 possible to win a place within the 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.279
 court and between the sea 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.450
 tn superheroes 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.150
 and I spoke very little because everything was given very 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.530
 fast but I did talk with don david me 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.330
 I said let me explain how it was more or less the 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.970
 club that he had lived in Carmona with 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.700
 all their parents and their children live here 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.190
 so talk very little but what I talked about 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.350
 it was almost the whole club not like either 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.200
 facilities professionalism the 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.580
 change everything that is Argentine to 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.230
 france so good happy and 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.230
 hoping to be the best possible 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.050
 and difficult is not going to be a change too 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.720
 very big to what is Argentina here 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.810
 but I do not think it's so difficult is what 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.220
 The only thing I have is to get on par with 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 my classmates and well after being 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.520
 what I have been doing in Argentina for 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.520
 be within the court 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.130
 messi maradona was my idol not as a boy 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.409
 so I always do not know if he tried 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.479
 imitate it but something more or less the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.789
 things that he does not will not leave me 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.789
 same but I get pretty similar 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.259
 If I really want to start 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.610
 train and good to play is not what 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.110
 I want to make barely any idea that 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.570
 France did not want to start 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.310
 train to play 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:57.750
 up inside this court that is very 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:02:00.930
 cute and put on my shirt if it comes 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.119
 comes willing to that knowing that it's going to 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.040
 be like that and well I know it will not be easy 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.890
 but we will do everything possible to 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.250
 for Monaco to return the first one to the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.290
 first division and we will be I think 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:20.100
 from my part to at least give the best 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:23.400
 possible for that to happen first that 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.960
 thanks for the welcome is the cute 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.060
 that you receive just arrivals and good 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.440
 wait until when I am inside 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.940
 the court should do their best 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.350
 so good that they leave 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.060
 happy about this court that is very 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.060
 pretty and it serves us all 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.650
 just play and have fun and take it with 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.620
 the greatest possible responsibility does not 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.940
 always serious on the court and that 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.940
 when to win for the team's good 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.850
 and he still told me no
