bring it around that creates a kind of a

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.780 
bring it around that creates a kind of a
loop<00:02:10.640> so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
loop so

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.940 
loop so
you<00:02:11.909> put<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> needle<00:02:12.840> into<00:02:13.079> that<00:02:13.349> loop<00:02:13.590> you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
you put the needle into that loop you

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.479 
you put the needle into that loop you
take<00:02:14.640> your<00:02:15.030> index<00:02:15.239> finger<00:02:15.680> rock<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.950> long

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
end around the needle lift the loop off

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.709

you're<00:02:24.840> pulling<00:02:25.140> back<00:02:25.290> with<00:02:25.469> your<00:02:25.620> thumb<00:02:25.829> if

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
you're pulling back with your thumb if

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.619 
you're pulling back with your thumb if
you<00:02:26.099> just<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:26.519> your<00:02:26.700> thumb<00:02:26.909> forward<00:02:27.390> again

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
you just have your thumb forward again

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.960 
you just have your thumb forward again
you're<00:02:27.870> ready<00:02:28.079> for<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.379> next<00:02:28.409> one<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.730> go

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
you're ready for the next one so you go

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.690 
you're ready for the next one so you go
in<00:02:30.239> with<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.480> needle<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.109> rock<00:02:32.069> your<00:02:32.310> index

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
in with a needle you rock your index

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.119 
in with a needle you rock your index
finger<00:02:33.090> string<00:02:33.359> around<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:34.560> lift<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:34.950> loop

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
finger string around you lift the loop

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.020 
finger string around you lift the loop
off<00:02:35.340> with<00:02:35.549> your<00:02:35.670> thumb<00:02:35.939> and<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.989> pull<00:02:37.290> back

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
off with your thumb and you pull back

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.420 
off with your thumb and you pull back
this<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.239> nice<00:02:39.829> method<00:02:40.829> of<00:02:41.420> casting<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:43.430> once

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
this is a nice method of casting on once

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:52.839 
this is a nice method of casting on once
you<00:02:44.579> get<00:02:44.760> used<00:02:44.939> to<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.389> goes<00:02:45.569> much<00:02:45.870> faster

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.920 

even<00:02:53.849> much<00:02:54.030> faster<00:02:54.480> than<00:02:54.599> this<00:02:56.780> we're<00:02:57.780> trying

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
even much faster than this we're trying

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.780 
even much faster than this we're trying
to<00:02:58.079> do<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.530> can<00:02:58.769> see<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.280> rhythmically

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
to do it so you can see it rhythmically

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.009 
to do it so you can see it rhythmically
and<00:03:01.579> then<00:03:02.579> we<00:03:02.970> will<00:03:03.180> start<00:03:03.450> over<00:03:05.870> with<00:03:06.870> our

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
and then we will start over with our

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.619 
and then we will start over with our
hands<00:03:07.470> just<00:03:07.739> so<00:03:07.889> you<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:08.220> see<00:03:08.549> getting<00:03:09.359> used

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
hands just so you can see getting used

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.479 
hands just so you can see getting used
to<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.900> again<00:03:09.989> so<00:03:10.439> say<00:03:10.859> you<00:03:10.919> had<00:03:11.159> to<00:03:11.280> put<00:03:11.459> your

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
to it again so say you had to put your

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.270 
to it again so say you had to put your
casting<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.209> down<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:13.590> had<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.769> get<00:03:13.889> up<00:03:13.919> answer

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
casting on down you had to get up answer

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.860 
casting on down you had to get up answer
the<00:03:14.370> phone<00:03:14.549> or<00:03:14.579> something<00:03:14.909> here<00:03:15.389> we<00:03:15.540> go

the triangle creates pull down and twist
out<00:03:34.729> we<00:03:35.729> go<00:03:35.879> into<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:37.109> loop<00:03:37.319> with<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.970> needle

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
out we go into the loop with the needle

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.659 
out we go into the loop with the needle
we<00:03:40.169> wrap<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.709> string<00:03:40.949> around<00:03:40.979> our<00:03:41.310> index

we wrap the string around our index

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.969 
we wrap the string around our index
finger<00:03:42.090> around<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:43.019> needle<00:03:43.260> we<00:03:43.590> lift<00:03:43.829> the

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:43.979 
finger around the needle we lift the

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:45.800 
finger around the needle we lift the
loop<00:03:44.129> off<00:03:44.340> with<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.699> thumb<00:03:44.909> then<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.629> use

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
loop off with the thumb then you use

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.149 
loop off with the thumb then you use
your<00:03:45.989> thumb<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.620> pull<00:03:47.159> this<00:03:47.849> short<00:03:48.540> end<00:03:48.780> and

that tightens it and creates your

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.750 
that tightens it and creates your
triangle<00:03:52.500> again<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.829> just<00:03:52.979> flip<00:03:53.280> your<00:03:53.489> thumb

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
triangle again you just flip your thumb

there we go

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.710 
there we go
so<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.310> is<00:04:22.490> casting<00:04:22.970> on<00:04:24.310> I<00:04:25.310> also<00:04:25.940> have<00:04:26.390> this

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
so that is casting on I also have this

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.190 
so that is casting on I also have this
on<00:04:27.200> my<00:04:27.680> polymer<00:04:28.100> clay<00:04:28.130> Channel<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.970> did<00:04:29.210> a<00:04:29.780> few

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
on my polymer clay Channel I did a few

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.640 
on my polymer clay Channel I did a few
of<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.440> basic<00:04:30.830> knitting<00:04:31.130> stitches<00:04:31.690> there<00:04:32.690> so

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
of the basic knitting stitches there so

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.580 
of the basic knitting stitches there so
you<00:04:34.550> could<00:04:34.670> always<00:04:34.880> watch<00:04:35.210> those<00:04:35.570> before<00:04:36.260> I

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
you could always watch those before I

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.340 
you could always watch those before I
get<00:04:37.310> this<00:04:37.850> channel<00:04:38.330> really<00:04:38.600> started<00:04:39.140> if<00:04:39.260> you

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
get this channel really started if you

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:46.480 
get this channel really started if you
wish<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:40.090> in<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.240> background<00:04:41.780> here<00:04:45.280> we<00:04:46.280> will

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
wish to in the background here we will

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.370 
wish to in the background here we will
be<00:04:46.670> getting<00:04:46.910> into<00:04:47.150> stockinette<00:04:47.930> stitch<00:04:48.080> in

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
be getting into stockinette stitch in

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.990 
be getting into stockinette stitch in
ribbing<00:04:48.740> that's<00:04:48.980> what<00:04:49.190> this<00:04:49.340> is<00:04:51.850> we'll<00:04:52.850> do

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
ribbing that's what this is we'll do

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.220 
ribbing that's what this is we'll do
garter<00:04:53.330> stitch<00:04:53.540> first<00:04:53.930> which<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:54.530> this<00:04:54.740> Ridge

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
garter stitch first which is this Ridge

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.080 
garter stitch first which is this Ridge
Ruggiero<00:04:57.230> looking<00:04:57.770> pattern<00:04:58.040> it's<00:04:58.550> basically

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
Ruggiero looking pattern it's basically

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.940 
Ruggiero looking pattern it's basically
knitting<00:04:59.510> every<00:04:59.810> single<00:05:00.140> row<00:05:00.350> so<00:05:00.590> you<00:05:00.650> see<00:05:00.830> the

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
knitting every single row so you see the
