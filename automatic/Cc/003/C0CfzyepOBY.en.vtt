00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:14.899
 euros 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:18.369
 the keeper 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.909
 ms 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:24.069
 a million euros 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.689
 the dogs 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.020
 one of them 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.120
 London 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120
 below 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.170
 the man who already said that are 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.420
 compete with the chest and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.730
 and forest 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.830
 for example, the enormous vastness in this piece of forest, a very spatial piece 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.930
 forest it 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.930
 and by keeping the landing bets to stick to a tie 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 d 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 yesterday the dancers are actually out and growing up 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.040
 make it work very well 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.680
 and that visitors can see that and ask questions like that and simply 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.060
 sit down for a while and see how they work 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.090
 and because you have 70 then you will get a lot of lessons learned and the three points 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.870
 his painters to be doing carvers are those lazy who miss chainsaws and through 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.280
 enter his tree trunks 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.400
 and you get figurative art to get abstract art and you get one 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.560
 project like this 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.560
 and it is mainly about showing nature 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.990
 collaborate with nature 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.970
 it's a bit of a theme 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.229
 of the cda hence he 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.990
 cooperation is thereby killed 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.510
 to do 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.510
 the 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.639
 what does ask the question about freedom what is actually freedom 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:19.259
 because actually got a very small sign to leak the oil over a lot 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:20.959
 I enjoy watching him 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.959
 but manipulated for you by those tires 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.980
 yes that says something about van about this society 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.919
 that you grow up in this society 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.719
 become the president 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.839
 actually I think that is also a bit of courage because no one can fully 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:37.669
 being free 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.129
 exceptions 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.269
 most people need structure 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.510
 And it is funny though people respond that the structure indeed appears 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.689
 more the freedom of the forest last 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.539
 yes I was inspired by 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:17.349
 after the forest especially by saying wisdom of breasts 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.349
 very spacious and due to the height differences 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.739
 and because of architecture I'm just an architecture lover and those two 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.269
 things come together here I really had when they reinforce each other and that they do 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.639
 collaborate 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.779
 it is also a bit of a plea for that if not this time 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:37.509
 rucksichlos everything plant walstein no longer takes into account 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.309
 the environment with the world 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:43.189
 but that 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.839
 do you have that you can work together 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:48.379
 and that leaves me a surprise here, too, through those very white walls of to lisse met 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.629
 very contrast with the chest 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.620
 and despite the enormous contrast you can nevertheless reinforce each other 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.029
 I can just do it myself again 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.199
 schellebelle and architects 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.590
 a 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.819
 an artist 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.039
 the sexy brunette faces and the beautiful green space and with 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.270
 what are the vertical lines the ring 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.270
 and then you get a discount image of paintings 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.610
 a division of the surface in competition 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.639
 And maybe that was different to catch other people 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:43.699
 And then I would have built up that ten countries relative to each other 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.949
 and 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.039
 something unique for me in relation to each other 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.809
 it's I also determine the differences and how they jump in depth 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:56.979
 long jump people appear real different city 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.610
 and 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.339
 I already found it for you 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:05.309
 and I like that if you walk around a bit then 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:09.419
 the player free country of galilei the dutchman relative to each other 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.680
 I can really enjoy that 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.680
 so just really awful 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.689
 region 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.869
 to show that that man is a structure within and freedom 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:36.149
 the structure can therefore emphasize that freedom and show it better 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:39.020
 as here in nl always go together 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.780
 so you can't experience freedom if you don't structure the head or none 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.820
 bondage or a little forced he tastes manipulations 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.260
 and 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.640
 I ask them to think as they walk around here on the theme of freedom 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.789
 freedom and 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:55.900
 or they lock that up in a book 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.270
 and those texts terribly I put someone in the world 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.060
 because then you have another one 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.060
 within the structure of the countries within the imf 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.169
 look 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:24.760
 the judge said 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.890
 This works however it is an excel you will not be in one 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.789
 grouse 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.800
 can see overview and enjoy that you see nicely done aesthetically 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.529
 all but it is about the idea and the rear lights behind it 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.199
 story and and and to call upon to think that is actually the intention 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:43.889
 of this work 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:47.509
 and the and that even better composition there is with us is natural 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:52.169
 nicely taken along and I also searched for it but the beginning is and it 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.910
 the starting point is a race in the ideas and dance we show dr 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:01.610
 we do 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.610
 why 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.580
 a million euros 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.699
 the man 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:20.949
 lommel 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:23.949
 sir 

00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:33.520
 among others 9 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.399
 million euros 

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:37.909
 walk 

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:39.520
 from the hill 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.809
 although the company 

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:45.699
 do miracles 

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:48.699
 how do you mean the poor 

00:07:57.069 --> 00:07:58.019
 how how
