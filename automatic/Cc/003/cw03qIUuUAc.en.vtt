and obviously this vehicle did not have

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.260 
and obviously this vehicle did not have
one<00:01:59.590> so<00:01:59.890> we're<00:02:00.189> just<00:02:00.220> going<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.640> cut<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:01.000> off

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
one so we're just going to cut this off

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.270 
one so we're just going to cut this off
and<00:02:01.600> just<00:02:01.689> splice<00:02:02.049> it<00:02:02.229> in<00:02:02.350> direct<00:02:02.649> we're

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
and just splice it in direct we're

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.249 
and just splice it in direct we're
matching<00:02:03.429> it<00:02:03.700> up<00:02:03.880> color<00:02:04.210> for<00:02:04.450> color<00:02:04.570> your

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
matching it up color for color your

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.450 
matching it up color for color your
white<00:02:05.530> wire<00:02:05.679> is<00:02:05.710> going<00:02:05.979> we're<00:02:06.189> going<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.340> leave

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
white wire is going we're going to leave

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.490 
white wire is going we're going to leave
alone<00:02:06.729> because<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.750> bracket<00:02:08.110> comes<00:02:08.289> with<00:02:08.410> a

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
alone because the bracket comes with a

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.960 
alone because the bracket comes with a
heavier<00:02:08.769> gauge<00:02:09.099> white<00:02:09.399> wire<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:09.789> we'll

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
heavier gauge white wire and we'll

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.090 
heavier gauge white wire and we'll
connect<00:02:10.269> that<00:02:10.360> directly<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.959> frame<00:02:11.170> all

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
connect that directly to the frame all

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.440 
connect that directly to the frame all
right<00:02:12.220> let's<00:02:12.459> go<00:02:12.580> ahead<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:12.910> tape<00:02:13.209> these

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
right let's go ahead and tape these

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.920 
right let's go ahead and tape these
together<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.950> use<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.130> loom<00:02:15.430> here<00:02:15.850> next<00:02:16.450> one<00:02:16.690> do

you<00:03:25.020> can<00:03:25.170> probably<00:03:25.319> buy<00:03:25.530> from<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.860> Ford

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
you can probably buy from the Ford

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.500 
you can probably buy from the Ford
dealership<00:03:26.220> but<00:03:26.640> they're<00:03:26.790> kind<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.180> hard<00:03:27.360> to

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
dealership but they're kind of hard to

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.960 
dealership but they're kind of hard to
find<00:03:27.750> nowadays<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.920> we're<00:03:29.130> actually<00:03:29.310> going<00:03:29.850> to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
find nowadays so we're actually going to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.920 
find nowadays so we're actually going to
cut<00:03:30.180> this<00:03:30.330> off<00:03:30.569> and<00:03:30.810> splice<00:03:31.380> in<00:03:31.590> direct<00:03:32.930> these

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
cut this off and splice in direct these

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.370 
cut this off and splice in direct these
two<00:03:34.110> circuits<00:03:34.500> here<00:03:35.010> aren't<00:03:35.430> being<00:03:35.610> used<00:03:36.380> so
