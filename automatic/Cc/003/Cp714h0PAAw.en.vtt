the<00:00:00.599> third<00:00:00.810> point<00:00:01.110> is<00:00:02.720> sensitivity<00:00:04.370> now<00:00:05.370> what

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
the third point is sensitivity now what

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.080 
the third point is sensitivity now what
is<00:00:06.330> sensitivity<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.620> how<00:00:07.919> loud<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.610> headphone

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
is sensitivity is how loud the headphone

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.410 
is sensitivity is how loud the headphone
is<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:09.990> how<00:00:10.170> effectively<00:00:11.160> an<00:00:11.429> electrical

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
is that is how effectively an electrical

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.360 
is that is how effectively an electrical
signal<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:13.080> getting<00:00:13.380> converted<00:00:13.679> from<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
signal is getting converted from the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.290 
signal is getting converted from the
source<00:00:14.670> device<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.880> device

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
source device that is the the device

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.540 
source device that is the the device
where<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.810> plug<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.109> your<00:00:19.320> iPhone<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.430> is

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
where you plug in your iPhone that is

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.790 
where you plug in your iPhone that is
mobile<00:00:20.730> laptop<00:00:21.090> or<00:00:21.510> portable<00:00:22.230> mp3<00:00:22.350> players

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
mobile laptop or portable mp3 players

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.529 
mobile laptop or portable mp3 players
and<00:00:24.619> to<00:00:25.619> give<00:00:26.070> an<00:00:26.160> example<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.849> would<00:00:26.910> say<00:00:27.029> that

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and to give an example I would say that

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.580 
and to give an example I would say that
let's<00:00:28.050> say<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:29.070> give<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.990> ten<00:00:30.990> bucks

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
let's say I give you this ten bucks

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.930 
let's say I give you this ten bucks
okay<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:33.079> I<00:00:34.079> don't<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.950> tell<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.550> give<00:00:35.820> it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
okay and I don't I tell you to give it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.590 
okay and I don't I tell you to give it
to<00:00:36.059> John<00:00:36.300> okay<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.550> so<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.390> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
to John okay and so so what you do is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.840 
to John okay and so so what you do is
you<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:39.809> give<00:00:40.230> him<00:00:40.500> five<00:00:40.879> bucks<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.649> keep

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
you just give him five bucks and keep

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.180 
you just give him five bucks and keep
five<00:00:45.230> in<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.500> pocket<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:48.559> is<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
five in your pocket so is it is it

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.240 
five in your pocket so is it is it
useful<00:00:50.430> from<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.120> point<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.539> view<00:00:51.600> now

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
useful from my point of view now

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.580 
useful from my point of view now
basically<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:54.020> this<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.469> is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
basically it's this is what it is

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.729 
basically it's this is what it is
related<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.510> amplification<00:00:57.510> and

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
related to that is amplification and

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.549 
related to that is amplification and
sound<00:00:58.739> pressure<00:00:59.129> level<00:00:59.640> one<00:01:00.270> years<00:01:00.660> after<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
sound pressure level one years after the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.500 
sound pressure level one years after the
conversion<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.309> input<00:01:02.730> signal<00:01:03.180> from<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
conversion of input signal from the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.620 
conversion of input signal from the
source<00:01:03.750> device<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.610> give<00:01:05.880> us<00:01:06.210> input

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
source device so if if I give us input

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.109 
source device so if if I give us input
source<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.590> 100<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:10.070> if<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.460> output<00:01:11.909> comes

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
source of 100 and if the output comes

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.109 
source of 100 and if the output comes
out<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.540> 50<00:01:13.130> sound<00:01:14.130> pressure<00:01:14.700> level<00:01:15.180> and

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
out to 50 sound pressure level and

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.480 
out to 50 sound pressure level and
amplification<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.270> 50<00:01:18.750> percent<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.490> is

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
amplification is 50 percent that is

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.330 
amplification is 50 percent that is
minus<00:01:20.909> 50<00:01:21.240> percent<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.770> won't<00:01:23.159> be

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
minus 50 percent here so it won't be

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.399 
minus 50 percent here so it won't be
useful<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.420> should<00:01:24.750> always<00:01:24.900> look<00:01:25.200> for

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
useful so you should always look for

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.770 
useful so you should always look for
headphones<00:01:25.770> which<00:01:26.100> are<00:01:26.509> giving<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.600> high

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
headphones which are giving you high

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.859 
headphones which are giving you high
amplification<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> around<00:01:29.600> 110<00:01:30.600> plus

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
amplification that is around 110 plus

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.780 
amplification that is around 110 plus
amplification<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.750> SPL<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:34.350> derivative<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
amplification and SPL is a derivative of

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.990 
amplification and SPL is a derivative of
a<00:01:36.180> derivative<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:39.979> sensitivity<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.640> high

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
a derivative of sensitivity so high

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.210 
a derivative of sensitivity so high
sensitivity<00:01:43.070> high<00:01:44.070> sound<00:01:44.670> pressure<00:01:44.820> level

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
sensitivity high sound pressure level

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.289 
sensitivity high sound pressure level
high<00:01:47.220> volume<00:01:49.009> so<00:01:50.009> when<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.119> low<00:01:52.020> input<00:01:52.619> device

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
high volume so when and low input device

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.859 
high volume so when and low input device
like<00:01:54.299> mp3<00:01:54.840> player<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:56.479> plugged<00:01:57.479> into<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
like mp3 player is plugged into the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.399 
like mp3 player is plugged into the
headphone<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.649> will<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.189> better<00:01:59.969> output<00:02:00.409> a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
headphone you will get a better output a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.209 
headphone you will get a better output a
higher<00:02:02.189> volume<00:02:02.460> sound<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:04.219> sensitivity

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
higher volume sound if it's sensitivity

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.219 
higher volume sound if it's sensitivity
is<00:02:05.520> high

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.740 

so<00:02:09.229> now<00:02:09.679> let's<00:02:10.280> say<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.239> haven't

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
so now let's say that you haven't

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.070 
so now let's say that you haven't
watched<00:02:11.959> this<00:02:12.200> video<00:02:13.000> before<00:02:14.000> your<00:02:14.630> purchase

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
watched this video before your purchase

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.520 
watched this video before your purchase
and<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.349> gotten<00:02:15.709> hurt<00:02:15.890> form<00:02:16.750> which<00:02:17.750> has<00:02:18.110> low

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
and you gotten hurt form which has low

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.210 
and you gotten hurt form which has low
sensitivity<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:20.630> can't<00:02:20.900> hear<00:02:21.220> loud

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
sensitivity and you can't hear loud

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.630 
sensitivity and you can't hear loud
volume<00:02:22.519> on<00:02:22.819> your<00:02:22.849> mp3<00:02:23.330> players<00:02:23.959> or<00:02:24.640> laptops

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
volume on your mp3 players or laptops

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.580 
volume on your mp3 players or laptops
because<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.540> high<00:02:27.290> impedance<00:02:27.620> about<00:02:28.330> 60<00:02:29.330> or<00:02:29.590> so

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
because of high impedance about 60 or so

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.270 
because of high impedance about 60 or so
now<00:02:30.950> what<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.190> can<00:02:31.340> do<00:02:31.459> is<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.790> can<00:02:31.970> buy<00:02:32.239> and
