00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
knife the same as he does and I use just

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.639 
knife the same as he does and I use just
a<00:00:59.550> single<00:00:59.879> blade<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.989> kind<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.289> gets<00:01:01.469> out

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
a single blade and it kind of gets out

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.189 
a single blade and it kind of gets out
of<00:01:01.710> track<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> few<00:01:02.460> times<00:01:02.730> there<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:03.960> made

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
of track a few times there but I made

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.820 
of track a few times there but I made
this<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.720> use<00:01:06.720> would<00:01:07.200> be<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> combat

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
this one this is a use would be a combat

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.130 
this one this is a use would be a combat
airplane<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:09.540> only<00:01:09.750> difference<00:01:10.049> between

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
airplane the only difference between

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
airplane the only difference between
this<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.710> some<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> others<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.640> see

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
this and some of the others that you see

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.170 
this and some of the others that you see
is<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:14.700> has<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.720> third<00:01:16.110> pin<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.950> center

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
is it has this third pin in the center

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
is it has this third pin in the center
now<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.479> find<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.229> flies<00:01:19.409> better<00:01:19.710> with

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
now I do find that it flies better with

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.149 
now I do find that it flies better with
the<00:01:20.130> third<00:01:20.540> pin<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> center<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.350> begin<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the third pin in the center I begin to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.249 
the third pin in the center I begin to
wonder<00:01:23.280> maybe<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.729> could<00:01:24.000> make<00:01:24.150> these<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.720> little

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
wonder maybe I could make these a little

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.649 
wonder maybe I could make these a little
smaller<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.799> fact<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.189> one<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.580> will<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:27.000> if

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
smaller in fact this one here will be if

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.899 
smaller in fact this one here will be if
smaller<00:01:27.990> fins<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> outside<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
smaller fins on the outside it and a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.499 
smaller fins on the outside it and a
major<00:01:30.119> fin<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.200> center<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:32.240> it's<00:01:33.240> more

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
major fin in the center here it's more

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.480 
major fin in the center here it's more
deliberate<00:01:33.990> because<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> doesn't

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
deliberate because you know it doesn't

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.999 
deliberate because you know it doesn't
wishy-washy<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.810> me<00:01:36.990> when<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.200> as<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.500> flying<00:01:37.770> I

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
wishy-washy on me when I as I'm flying I

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.010 
wishy-washy on me when I as I'm flying I
like<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.430> better<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:39.150> flies<00:01:39.420> very<00:01:39.450> well

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
like that better this flies very well

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.190 
like that better this flies very well
but<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> solid<00:01:41.820> hinge<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.509> with

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
but I do have a solid hinge here with

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.109 
but I do have a solid hinge here with
just<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> relief<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> bottom<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.909> it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
just the relief on the bottom and it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.050 
just the relief on the bottom and it
works<00:01:45.360> out<00:01:45.540> all<00:01:45.659> right<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> about<00:01:47.729> 8

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
works out all right this is a about 8

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.819 
works out all right this is a about 8
inches<00:01:48.299> these<00:01:48.689> motors<00:01:49.049> about<00:01:49.259> eight<00:01:49.470> inches

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
inches these motors about eight inches

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.950 
inches these motors about eight inches
from<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:51.140> front<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.540> arrow<00:01:54.540> shaft

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
from the front and I have a arrow shaft

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.370 
from the front and I have a arrow shaft
I<00:01:55.399> believe<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.659> guess<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.140> must<00:01:58.320> be

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
I believe that so I guess that must be

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.200 
I believe that so I guess that must be
about<00:01:58.649> twelve<00:01:59.460> inches<00:01:59.759> back<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:01.969> of<00:02:02.969> course

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
about twelve inches back and of course

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.600 
about twelve inches back and of course
the<00:02:03.390> slot<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.560> motor<00:02:04.829> everything<00:02:05.399> is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the slot for the motor everything is

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.880 
the slot for the motor everything is
pretty<00:02:06.240> much<00:02:06.329> same<00:02:06.899> as<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.200> see<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.649> lot<00:02:07.860> of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
pretty much same as you see in a lot of

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.390 
pretty much same as you see in a lot of
a<00:02:08.340> lot<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.879> different<00:02:09.179> pizza<00:02:09.450> box<00:02:09.690> airplanes

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
a lot of different pizza box airplanes

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.700 
a lot of different pizza box airplanes
okay<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.580> only<00:02:11.670> problem<00:02:12.239> I'm<00:02:12.330> having<00:02:12.660> now<00:02:12.810> is

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
okay the only problem I'm having now is

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.010 
okay the only problem I'm having now is
is<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.430> went<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.700> build<00:02:14.970> another<00:02:15.270> one<00:02:15.480> that

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
is that I went to build another one that

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.820 
is that I went to build another one that
I<00:02:16.080> was<00:02:16.290> gonna<00:02:16.590> give<00:02:16.830> away<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:18.260> after<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.560> cut

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
I was gonna give away and after I cut

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:29.120 
I was gonna give away and after I cut
the<00:02:23.150> cut<00:02:24.150> out<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.450> back<00:02:25.340> for<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:27.740> hinge<00:02:28.740> I

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
the cut out the back for the hinge I

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.180 
the cut out the back for the hinge I
found<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.180> still<00:02:30.480> pretty<00:02:30.660> stiff

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
found that this is still pretty stiff

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.390 
found that this is still pretty stiff
now<00:02:32.190> if<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.390> have<00:02:33.660> too<00:02:34.410> much<00:02:34.560> pressure<00:02:34.920> here

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
now if you have too much pressure here

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.100 
now if you have too much pressure here
in<00:02:35.730> order<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.450> make<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.840> operate<00:02:38.930> you're<00:02:39.930> going

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
in order to make it operate you're going

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.960 
in order to make it operate you're going
to<00:02:40.170> cause<00:02:40.440> your<00:02:40.680> servo<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.310> draw<00:02:41.490> too<00:02:41.790> much

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
to cause your servo to draw too much

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.750 
to cause your servo to draw too much
current<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.740> next<00:02:44.010> thing<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.280> know<00:02:44.460> it

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
current and the next thing you know it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
current and the next thing you know it
cause<00:02:45.000> calls<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.600> current<00:02:45.930> down<00:02:46.080> in<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
cause calls the current down in the the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.670 
cause calls the current down in the the
voltage<00:02:47.340> down<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.000> receiver<00:02:48.930> if<00:02:49.410> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
voltage down in the receiver if the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.530 
voltage down in the receiver if the
reportage<00:02:50.130> goes<00:02:50.340> down<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.760> receiver<00:02:51.180> far

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
reportage goes down and receiver far

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.390 
reportage goes down and receiver far
enough<00:02:51.750> it'll<00:02:51.990> cut<00:02:52.200> Brown<00:02:52.410> out<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.980> shove<00:02:53.220> off

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
enough it'll cut Brown out and shove off

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.060 
enough it'll cut Brown out and shove off
and<00:02:53.870> it'll<00:02:54.870> take<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.080> certain<00:02:55.560> amount<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.830> time

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
and it'll take a certain amount of time

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.120 
and it'll take a certain amount of time
for<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.550> read<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> link<00:02:57.060> now<00:02:57.740> years<00:02:58.740> gone<00:02:58.980> by

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
for it to read a link now years gone by

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.190 
for it to read a link now years gone by
I've<00:02:59.520> had<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> same<00:03:00.240> trouble<00:03:00.660> with<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:01.170> old

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
I've had the same trouble with the old

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.230 
I've had the same trouble with the old
strikers<00:03:01.950> when<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.220> hop<00:03:02.430> up<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:02.730> striker<00:03:03.060> and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
strikers when you hop up a striker and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.180 
strikers when you hop up a striker and
you<00:03:03.450> hit<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.600> lot<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.810> pressure<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:05.070> would

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
you hit a lot of pressure on it it would

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.840 
you hit a lot of pressure on it it would
cause<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> brown<00:03:05.730> out<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:07.650> found<00:03:08.190> out<00:03:08.370> then

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
cause a brown out and I found out then

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.560 
cause a brown out and I found out then
is<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.570> if<00:03:10.080> there<00:03:10.380> was<00:03:10.470> any<00:03:10.680> binding<00:03:11.280> on<00:03:11.570> the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
is that if there was any binding on the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.830 
is that if there was any binding on the
elements<00:03:13.500> at<00:03:13.680> all<00:03:14.240> you<00:03:15.240> could<00:03:15.420> get<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.570> brown

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
elements at all you could get a brown

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.380 
elements at all you could get a brown
out<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.340> usually<00:03:17.340> ended<00:03:17.820> up<00:03:17.940> in<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.180> crash

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
out and usually ended up in a crash

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.110 
out and usually ended up in a crash
unless<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.050> were<00:03:19.770> smart<00:03:20.160> enough<00:03:20.250> some<00:03:20.700> people

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
unless you were smart enough some people

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.850 
unless you were smart enough some people
would<00:03:21.480> turn<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.810> transmitter<00:03:22.320> off<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.740> turn

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
would turn the transmitter off and turn

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.800 
would turn the transmitter off and turn
it<00:03:22.890> back<00:03:23.100> on<00:03:23.280> again<00:03:23.460> and<00:03:23.670> get<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.210> relink<00:03:24.600> I

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
it back on again and get it to relink I

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.380 
it back on again and get it to relink I
never<00:03:25.020> was<00:03:25.230> able<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.560> do<00:03:25.710> that<00:03:25.920> but<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:27.180> never

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
never was able to do that but I never

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.510 
never was able to do that but I never
really<00:03:28.080> had<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.290> total<00:03:28.680> crash<00:03:28.920> but<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.310> come

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
really had a total crash but I come

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.120 
really had a total crash but I come
close<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.060> have<00:03:30.210> had<00:03:30.390> brown<00:03:30.630> outs<00:03:30.870> before

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
close and I have had brown outs before

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.340 
close and I have had brown outs before
so<00:03:32.130> it's<00:03:32.370> just<00:03:32.520> something<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.940> know<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.390> you

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
so it's just something to know that you

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.950 
so it's just something to know that you
can<00:03:34.620> have<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:34.920> brown<00:03:35.250> if<00:03:35.550> your<00:03:35.760> hinges<00:03:36.630> are<00:03:36.810> too

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
can have a brown if your hinges are too

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.890 
can have a brown if your hinges are too
stiff<00:03:37.200> now<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.430> order<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.150> try<00:03:39.360> to<00:03:39.420> relieve

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
stiff now in order to try to relieve

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.630 
stiff now in order to try to relieve
some<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.410> pressure<00:03:40.680> on<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:40.950> hinges<00:03:41.460> I

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
some of the pressure on the hinges I

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.710 
some of the pressure on the hinges I
just<00:03:42.300> use<00:03:42.480> part<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.140> hinge<00:03:43.800> here<00:03:44.100> and

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
just use part of the hinge here and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.100 
just use part of the hinge here and
honestly<00:03:46.310> it's<00:03:47.310> still<00:03:47.610> not<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:47.880> still<00:03:48.540> got<00:03:48.960> too

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
honestly it's still not I still got too

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.850 
honestly it's still not I still got too
much<00:03:49.290> pressure<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:49.800> it<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:51.030> hear<00:03:51.240> that<00:03:51.620> boy<00:03:52.620> it

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
much pressure on it you hear that boy it

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.430 
much pressure on it you hear that boy it
you<00:03:53.610> know<00:03:53.730> takes<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.120> little<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.570> little<00:03:55.110> bit<00:03:55.290> of

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
you know takes a little a little bit of

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.020 
you know takes a little a little bit of
current<00:03:55.740> there<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.070> push<00:03:56.280> one<00:03:56.490> down<00:03:56.700> pull<00:03:57.000> the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
current there to push one down pull the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.570 
current there to push one down pull the
other<00:03:57.240> one<00:03:57.450> up<00:03:57.600> or<00:03:57.930> pull<00:03:58.200> them<00:03:58.260> both<00:03:58.470> up<00:03:58.710> that's

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
other one up or pull them both up that's

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.430 
other one up or pull them both up that's
gonna<00:03:59.850> that's<00:04:00.210> that<00:04:00.540> could<00:04:00.720> cause<00:04:00.930> me<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.200> Brown

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
gonna that's that could cause me a Brown

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.950 
gonna that's that could cause me a Brown
that<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:02.310> I'm<00:04:02.850> probably<00:04:03.150> going<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:03.690> make<00:04:03.780> these

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
that so I'm probably going to make these

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.160 
that so I'm probably going to make these
hinges<00:04:04.500> here<00:04:04.710> a<00:04:04.950> little<00:04:05.940> smaller<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.810> try

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
hinges here a little smaller and try

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.920 
hinges here a little smaller and try
that<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.710> could<00:04:08.490> probably<00:04:08.730> cut<00:04:09.210> the<00:04:09.390> pressure

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
that I could probably cut the pressure

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.460 
that I could probably cut the pressure
down<00:04:10.260> maybe<00:04:10.620> by<00:04:10.890> half<00:04:11.220> if<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:11.730> made<00:04:11.940> them<00:04:12.470> half

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
down maybe by half if I made them half

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.400 
down maybe by half if I made them half
