think that's really the priority at the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.650 
think that's really the priority at the
moment<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.670> know<00:01:44.789> to<00:01:44.850> get<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> testing<00:01:45.509> going

we<00:02:17.819> cannot<00:02:18.030> guarantee<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:19.050> we<00:02:19.740> can<00:02:19.950> repeat

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
we cannot guarantee that we can repeat

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.040 
we cannot guarantee that we can repeat
it<00:02:20.460> but<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:20.760> work<00:02:20.940> very<00:02:20.970> hard<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.780> that's

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
it but we work very hard on it that's

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.460 
it but we work very hard on it that's
for<00:02:22.230> sure

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
for sure

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.770 
for sure
I<00:02:22.740> think<00:02:23.700> we<00:02:23.790> have<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.970> very<00:02:24.120> good<00:02:24.300> we<00:02:24.630> have<00:02:24.750> a

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
I think we have a very good we have a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.950 
I think we have a very good we have a
very<00:02:25.080> good<00:02:25.319> baseline<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.860> do<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:26.910> having<00:02:27.600> said

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
very good baseline to do so having said

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.100 
very good baseline to do so having said
that<00:02:27.990> we<00:02:28.620> need<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.010> realise<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.930> more<00:02:30.930> than

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
that we need to realise that more than

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.590 
that we need to realise that more than
half<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.280> field<00:02:32.550> more<00:02:32.850> than<00:02:32.910> half<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.420> the

half of the field more than half of the

half of the field more than half of the
10<00:02:33.810> teams<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.770> definitely<00:02:35.490> in<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.670> position<00:02:35.700> to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
10 teams is definitely in a position to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.300 
10 teams is definitely in a position to
build<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.510> winning<00:02:36.690> car<00:02:36.990> that's<00:02:37.500> my<00:02:37.740> judgment

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
build a winning car that's my judgment

races we
remember<00:02:50.560> last<00:02:50.799> year<00:02:51.189> we<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.579> had<00:02:51.609> I<00:02:52.120> think

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
remember last year we have had I think

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.089 
remember last year we have had I think
five<00:02:52.540> different<00:02:52.810> constructors<00:02:53.530> already<00:02:53.890> that

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
five different constructors already that

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.459 
five different constructors already that
one<00:02:54.280> raises<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.909> probably<00:02:55.810> these<00:02:56.049> will<00:02:56.290> be

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:56.469 
one raises and probably these will be

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.410 
one raises and probably these will be
more<00:02:56.849> this<00:02:57.849> year

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
more this year

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.080 
more this year
for<00:02:59.109> the<00:02:59.200> first<00:02:59.439> time<00:02:59.709> since<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.250> 2000<00:03:00.879> season

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.270 

Lewis<00:03:10.080> Hamilton<00:03:10.319> will<00:03:10.739> do<00:03:10.860> everything

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
Lewis Hamilton will do everything

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530

year<00:03:13.860> -<00:03:14.129> I<00:03:14.370> want<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.209> win<00:03:15.330> again<00:03:15.569> so<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
year - I want to win again so the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.330 
year - I want to win again so the
pressures<00:03:17.069> that<00:03:17.340> come<00:03:17.849> from<00:03:18.090> within

pressures that come from within

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.440 
pressures that come from within
gonna<00:03:20.340> be<00:03:20.489> different<00:03:20.909> I<00:03:21.000> think<00:03:21.239> they're<00:03:21.360> gonna

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
gonna be different I think they're gonna

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.960 
gonna be different I think they're gonna
be<00:03:21.709> similar<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.159> point<00:03:23.670> where<00:03:23.790> I'm<00:03:23.849> gonna

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
be similar to the point where I'm gonna

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.619 
be similar to the point where I'm gonna
push<00:03:24.150> myself<00:03:24.180> even<00:03:24.660> harder<00:03:25.080> but<00:03:26.360> last<00:03:27.360> year

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
push myself even harder but last year

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.680 
push myself even harder but last year
was<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.840> was<00:03:28.140> very<00:03:28.170> serious<00:03:28.950> very<00:03:29.190> focused
