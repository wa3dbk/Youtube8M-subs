00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.509

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.090
 name is the carrie co and i want to 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.889
 show you today like your no2 like that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.730
 it could reset nothing 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.259
 more is left 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.809
 We have two options 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.750
 either via the settings menu on 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.039
 phone or via the operating system 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.050
 there we are already at the first 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.029
 possibility is a reset 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.070
 and that reset per 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.199
 Setting menu for this we just go 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.900
 in the settings in the menu could 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.910
 and in the sub- item data backup 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.770
 Save and reset options 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.690
 There we go on 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.230
 Reset factory settings and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.660
 read us that here by yes you 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.920
 can do it so I know that 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.930
 after that we go back to the device 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.239
 confirm that one last time and 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.800
 everything has already happened because it will 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.149
 sit back now by itself 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.949
 delete everything and then automatically 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.780
 restart and you can do it again 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.129
 set up 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.840
 for the second possibility that must 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.160
 Handy first off because we want 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.559
 start it in bios 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.359
 for that we press the start button the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.619
 Volume up button and the home button 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.299
 at the same time and if that appears to you 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.100
 Let's leave the start button for the first time 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.420
 Come on 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.210
 then it will be with us after 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.070
 few seconds open and we are already 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.390
 in the menu 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.820
 we can go up here with volume 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.790
 switch volume down and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.049

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:33.600

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.820
 on the leto user data now everything becomes 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.340
 deleted as before and the phone 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.240
 will restart 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.590
 that was it with yours 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.490
 possibilities that two more 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.500

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.270
