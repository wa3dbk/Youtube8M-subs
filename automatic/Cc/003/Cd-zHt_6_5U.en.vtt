00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.330
 the laying of the main structure is the 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.550
 its realization will depend in great 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.310
 part from the characteristics of the plant 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.619
 choice to cover it in fact depending on 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.750
 of its method of anchoring and 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.130
 growth will need one 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.780
 particular geometric conformation 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.970
 in fact if we are dealing with species e 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.030
 twists we are going to position in 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.010
 vertical some strained metal cables that 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.850
 if necessary inter if we create with 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.559
 bonds that at least at an early stage 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.160
 I also veil the plant in the direction 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.670
 horizontal position the supports 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.120
 vertical at a distance of 20 40 cm between 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.100
 of them 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.690
 always bearing in mind development 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.059
 of the plant 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.339
 if it grows vigorously separated i 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.339
 uprights even of 80 centimeters 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.830
 as for plants that instead 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.600
 they grow thanks to tendrils or in a manner 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.660
 braided you will have to use 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.230
 supports that provide for development 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.580
 vertical and one horizontal you will be able to 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.430
 get this effect 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.650
 by combining taut cables ti or by 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.800
 the use of metal structures o 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.140
 grilling you can use the materials 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.980
 more diverse than the amateur networks 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.540
 metallic or polymeric up to those 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.130
 electrowelded construction site with one 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.980
 width of the mesh that can reach 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.790
 up to 60 centimeters depending on the 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.620
 foliage and length of the mythical vi 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.020
 some are also on the market 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.810
 products specifically designed for 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.760
 these needs that you can use i 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.780
 lay according to the instructions provided 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.909
 on the package 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.330
 among them there are also panels 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.100
 usually self-supporting modular systems 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.170
 can be provided with a jacket 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.170
 vegetation or to be filled
