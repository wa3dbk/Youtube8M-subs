00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
want to be spoiled uh he grows those

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.339 
want to be spoiled uh he grows those
eyes<00:02:58.760> right<00:02:59.209> those<00:02:59.780> of<00:02:59.870> ultimate<00:03:00.200> that

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
eyes right those of ultimate that

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.990 
eyes right those of ultimate that
supposed<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.590> make<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.709> more<00:03:00.890> powerful<00:03:01.459> again

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
supposed to make it more powerful again

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.030 
supposed to make it more powerful again
those<00:03:02.180> are<00:03:02.209> his<00:03:02.420> weak<00:03:02.629> spot<00:03:02.870> Swiss<00:03:03.170> elite<00:03:03.470> he

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
those are his weak spot Swiss elite he

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.399 
those are his weak spot Swiss elite he
so<00:03:04.849> obviously<00:03:04.879> he's<00:03:05.360> like<00:03:05.569> it's<00:03:06.110> like<00:03:06.290> he

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
so obviously he's like it's like he

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.830 
so obviously he's like it's like he
absorbs<00:03:06.920> him<00:03:07.069> and<00:03:07.340> it's<00:03:07.730> like<00:03:07.849> and<00:03:08.030> thus<00:03:08.569> he

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
absorbs him and it's like and thus he

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.160 
absorbs him and it's like and thus he
gains<00:03:09.170> his<00:03:09.349> weak<00:03:09.709> spots<00:03:10.129> that<00:03:10.459> makes<00:03:10.640> no<00:03:10.819> sense

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
gains his weak spots that makes no sense

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.640 
gains his weak spots that makes no sense
so<00:03:12.170> yeah<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:13.129> more<00:03:13.549> meteors<00:03:13.879> this<00:03:14.090> time<00:03:14.650> still

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
so yeah the more meteors this time still

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:30.960 
so yeah the more meteors this time still
pretty<00:03:15.739> easy<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.069> punch<00:03:16.250> out

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.880 

we're

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
before you blast it back but I wasn't

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.550 
before you blast it back but I wasn't
gone<00:07:02.610> because<00:07:02.880> the<00:07:03.540> speed<00:07:03.840> of<00:07:03.990> chips<00:07:04.320> attend

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
gone because the speed of chips attend

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.590 
gone because the speed of chips attend
the<00:07:04.770> speed<00:07:04.980> of<00:07:05.100> what<00:07:05.340> ship<00:07:05.790> a<00:07:05.940> que<00:07:06.150> like<00:07:06.419> guys

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
the speed of what ship a que like guys

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.120 
the speed of what ship a que like guys
attack<00:07:07.080> is<00:07:07.430> very<00:07:08.430> unpredictable<00:07:09.919> is<00:07:10.919> very

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.130 
attack is very unpredictable is very

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.409 
attack is very unpredictable is very
unpredictable<00:07:11.310> it<00:07:11.730> can<00:07:11.850> be<00:07:11.940> really<00:07:12.180> fast

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 
unpredictable it can be really fast

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:14.480 
unpredictable it can be really fast
really<00:07:12.690> slow<00:07:13.050> and<00:07:13.380> you<00:07:14.040> don't<00:07:14.190> want<00:07:14.310> to<00:07:14.370> take

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
really slow and you don't want to take

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.920 
really slow and you don't want to take
the<00:07:14.520> risks<00:07:14.940> so<00:07:15.120> just<00:07:15.300> get<00:07:15.600> it<00:07:15.720> right<00:07:15.810> the<00:07:15.900> first

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
the risks so just get it right the first

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:35.760 
the risks so just get it right the first
time

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:35.770 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.780 

shit

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:39.790 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.950 

alright<00:07:40.420> so<00:07:40.480> this<00:07:40.570> has<00:07:40.690> been<00:07:40.780> more

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 
alright so this has been more

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.760 
alright so this has been more
challenging<00:07:41.760> but<00:07:42.760> here<00:07:42.910> we<00:07:43.000> go<00:07:43.120> okay<00:07:43.870> so<00:07:44.470> yeah

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:44.770 
challenging but here we go okay so yeah

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.350 
challenging but here we go okay so yeah
go<00:07:44.980> on<00:07:45.010> the<00:07:45.130> left<00:07:45.520> when<00:07:45.610> I<00:07:45.670> get<00:07:45.820> a<00:07:45.850> one<00:07:46.030> up<00:07:46.150> and

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 
go on the left when I get a one up and

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.700 
go on the left when I get a one up and
let's<00:07:47.290> start<00:07:47.500> wall<00:07:47.920> right<00:07:49.350> this<00:07:50.350> can<00:07:50.530> be<00:07:50.590> a<00:07:50.620> bit

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:50.710 
let's start wall right this can be a bit

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.690 
let's start wall right this can be a bit
more<00:07:50.800> difficult<00:07:50.860> to<00:07:51.190> master<00:07:52.500> Jim<00:07:53.500> the<00:07:54.400> person

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:54.700 
more difficult to master Jim the person

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.400 
more difficult to master Jim the person
we<00:07:54.760> will<00:07:54.850> find<00:07:55.000> yourself<00:07:55.270> running<00:07:55.390> into<00:07:55.960> the

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:56.410 
we will find yourself running into the

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.810 
we will find yourself running into the
tentacles<00:07:56.860> and<00:07:57.100> then<00:07:57.280> you<00:07:57.370> won't<00:07:57.520> make<00:07:57.610> it<00:07:57.730> in

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:57.820 
tentacles and then you won't make it in

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.340 
tentacles and then you won't make it in
time<00:07:57.850> so<00:07:58.000> we<00:07:58.360> just<00:07:58.630> gonna<00:07:58.720> be<00:07:58.840> surprised<00:07:59.200> I've

00:07:59.340 --> 00:07:59.350 
time so we just gonna be surprised I've

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:09.279 
time so we just gonna be surprised I've
ever<00:08:01.770> all<00:08:02.770> right<00:08:02.920> let's<00:08:03.070> finish<00:08:03.310> him<00:08:03.460> off

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:09.289 

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:12.329 

let's<00:08:10.189> go

00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:12.339 
let's go

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:14.919 
let's go
and<00:08:13.339> somehow<00:08:13.639> sonic<00:08:14.059> every<00:08:14.449> time<00:08:14.689> lands

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:14.929 
and somehow sonic every time lands

00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:18.969 
and somehow sonic every time lands
safely<00:08:15.379> back<00:08:15.559> on<00:08:15.619> the<00:08:16.249> guy<00:08:16.399> at<00:08:16.549> Colossus
