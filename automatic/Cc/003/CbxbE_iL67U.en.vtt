something here to keep my tape from
sticking<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.260> itself<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.720> a<00:00:18.720> tongue<00:00:19.289> depressor

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
sticking to itself so a tongue depressor

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.410 
sticking to itself so a tongue depressor
works<00:00:19.890> really<00:00:20.100> well<00:00:20.310> but<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.000> don't<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.240> time

roll and see how it's set up so that the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.370 
roll and see how it's set up so that the
roll<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.670> rolling<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.270> direction<00:00:36.510> I'm

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
roll is rolling in this direction I'm

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.229 
roll is rolling in this direction I'm
going<00:00:37.560> to<00:00:37.620> lay<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.040> flat<00:00:38.310> part<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.880> the<00:00:39.030> foot

want to make sure I'm going to start to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.869 
want to make sure I'm going to start to
triangle<00:00:45.809> for<00:00:45.960> about<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> 50%<00:00:46.620> overlap<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.820> I

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
triangle for about a 50% overlap and I

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.820 
triangle for about a 50% overlap and I
don't<00:00:47.940> want<00:00:48.239> any<00:00:48.420> wrinkles<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:49.650> that's

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
don't want any wrinkles because that's

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.410 
don't want any wrinkles because that's
going<00:00:50.040> to<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.220> pressure<00:00:50.520> point<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.270> we're

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
going to be a pressure point that we're

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.210 
going to be a pressure point that we're
going<00:00:51.540> to<00:00:51.600> get<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.200> it<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.290> definitely<00:00:52.920> go

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
going to get to and it can definitely go

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.430 
going to get to and it can definitely go
up<00:00:53.370> here<00:00:53.730> we're<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> continue<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
up here we're going to continue to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.170 
up here we're going to continue to
advance<00:00:57.860> so<00:00:58.860> yeah<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.699> an<00:00:59.790> open

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
advance so yeah if this was an open

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.569 
advance so yeah if this was an open
wound<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.720> might<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.379> put<00:01:01.620> some<00:01:02.070> sort<00:01:02.400> of

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
wound I might have put some sort of

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.790 
wound I might have put some sort of
dressing<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.720> it<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.530> would<00:01:04.680> go

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
dressing on it and that would go

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.880 
dressing on it and that would go
underneath<00:01:05.190> my<00:01:05.850> bandage<00:01:06.300> here<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.440> we<00:01:07.470> say

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
underneath my bandage here but if we say

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.219 
underneath my bandage here but if we say
that<00:01:08.399> this<00:01:08.550> is<00:01:08.610> not<00:01:09.479> an<00:01:09.630> open<00:01:09.869> wound<00:01:10.020> we're

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that this is not an open wound we're

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.400 
that this is not an open wound we're
just<00:01:10.410> protecting<00:01:11.190> something<00:01:12.090> else<00:01:12.450> then

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
just protecting something else then

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.780 
just protecting something else then
we're<00:01:13.649> going<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.830> go<00:01:13.950> ahead<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.310> bandaged<00:01:14.640> up

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
we're going to go ahead and bandaged up

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.510 
we're going to go ahead and bandaged up
and<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.780> injury<00:01:16.440> was<00:01:16.590> at<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.800> hotend<00:01:17.250> I'm

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and the injury was at the hotend I'm

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.969 
and the injury was at the hotend I'm
going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> go<00:01:17.910> beyond<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> hock<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.020> actually

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
going to go beyond the hock and actually

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.260 
going to go beyond the hock and actually
what<00:01:20.070> I'm<00:01:20.160> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.340> try<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:20.880> because

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
what I'm going to try and do because

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.850 
what I'm going to try and do because
once<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.660> go<00:01:21.810> beyond<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> hop<00:01:22.410> we<00:01:22.619> want<00:01:22.800> to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
once you go beyond the hop we want to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.749 
once you go beyond the hop we want to
make<00:01:22.979> sure<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.250> doesn't<00:01:23.399> slide<00:01:23.759> down<00:01:23.960> and

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
make sure it doesn't slide down and

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.800 
make sure it doesn't slide down and
we're<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.940> go<00:01:27.060> ahead<00:01:27.149> and<00:01:27.420> try<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.690> go

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
we're going to go ahead and try and go

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.020 
we're going to go ahead and try and go
up<00:01:27.840> all<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.290> way<00:01:28.560> above<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.580> knee<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.970> it

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
up all the way above the knee and it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.559 
up all the way above the knee and it
seems<00:01:30.270> excessive<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:32.090> we're<00:01:33.090> better<00:01:33.300> off

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
seems excessive but we're better off

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.380 
seems excessive but we're better off
trying<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.289> get<00:01:34.470> more<00:01:35.190> coverage<00:01:35.490> than<00:01:36.000> risk

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
trying to get more coverage than risk

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.490 
trying to get more coverage than risk
losing

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
losing

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.390 
losing
bandaged<00:01:38.570> alright<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.290> real<00:01:40.500> scenario<00:01:40.740> I

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
bandaged alright so in a real scenario I

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.880 
bandaged alright so in a real scenario I
would<00:01:42.000> probably<00:01:42.240> put<00:01:42.660> a<00:01:42.690> couple<00:01:43.080> of<00:01:43.140> layers<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
would probably put a couple of layers of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.210 
would probably put a couple of layers of
this<00:01:44.820> cotton<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.870> and<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.680> scenario<00:01:46.890> I'm

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
this cotton on and in this scenario I'm

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.830 
this cotton on and in this scenario I'm
still<00:01:47.490> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> put<00:01:47.850> another<00:01:48.120> layer<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.690> this

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
still going to put another layer of this

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.680 
still going to put another layer of this
cotton<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.470> because<00:01:49.890> what<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> want<00:01:50.400> to<00:01:50.490> do<00:01:50.690> see

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
cotton on because what I want to do see

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.360 
cotton on because what I want to do see
how<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> cone<00:01:52.410> down<00:01:52.710> I'm<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
how it's going to cone down I'm going to

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.450 
how it's going to cone down I'm going to
try<00:01:53.580> and<00:01:53.730> build<00:01:53.910> up<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.840> lower<00:01:55.080> part<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.860> it's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
try and build up the lower part so it's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.430 
try and build up the lower part so it's
just<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:57.150> little<00:01:57.510> bit<00:01:57.720> less<00:01:57.930> likely<00:01:58.260> to

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
just a little bit less likely to

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.220 
just a little bit less likely to
telescope<00:01:59.160> down<00:01:59.600> and<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:00.870> want<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.080> make

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
telescope down and they want to make

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.040 
telescope down and they want to make
sure<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.560> area<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.980> our<00:02:02.100> injury<00:02:02.610> or<00:02:02.820> wound<00:02:03.120> is

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
sure the area of our injury or wound is

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.999 
sure the area of our injury or wound is
well<00:02:04.260> covered<00:02:06.650> we<00:02:07.650> don't<00:02:07.800> want<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
well covered we don't want to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.180 
well covered we don't want to
incorporate<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> tail

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.920 

and<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:13.730> we've<00:02:13.850> got<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.180> build<00:02:14.480> up<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.780> little

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
and so we've got this build up a little

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.680 
and so we've got this build up a little
bit<00:02:15.140> more<00:02:15.320> than<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.650> thicker<00:02:15.920> area<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:17.450> now

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
bit more than that thicker area and now

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.790 
bit more than that thicker area and now
I'm<00:02:17.870> going<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.110> go<00:02:18.230> ahead<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.560> I'm<00:02:18.620> going<00:02:18.650> to

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.040 
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to
take<00:02:18.950> my<00:02:19.100> more<00:02:19.280> stretchy<00:02:19.640> stuff<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.840> I'm

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
take my more stretchy stuff and I'm

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.540 
take my more stretchy stuff and I'm
going<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.290> lie<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.830> on<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.280> same

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
going to lie that on in the same

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.360 
going to lie that on in the same
direction<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:24.410> I'm<00:02:24.500> going<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.710> lie<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.220> I'm

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
direction and I'm going to lie it on I'm

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.160 
direction and I'm going to lie it on I'm
not<00:02:25.490> going<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.790> pull<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.180> if<00:02:26.630> they<00:02:26.810> work<00:02:26.930> this

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
not going to pull it if they work this

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.930 
not going to pull it if they work this
where<00:02:27.440> Robert<00:02:27.800> Jones<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.220> would<00:02:28.370> crank<00:02:28.700> this

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
where Robert Jones I would crank this

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.330 
where Robert Jones I would crank this
down<00:02:29.000> but<00:02:29.450> here<00:02:29.690> I'm<00:02:29.840> just<00:02:30.020> lying<00:02:30.320> it<00:02:30.560> on<00:02:30.740> so

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
down but here I'm just lying it on so

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.310 
down but here I'm just lying it on so
that<00:02:31.580> there's<00:02:31.760> just<00:02:32.180> enough<00:02:32.480> tension<00:02:32.750> on<00:02:33.080> it

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
that there's just enough tension on it

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.290 
that there's just enough tension on it
that<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:33.620> going<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:33.800> hold<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.910> it's<00:02:35.060> not

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
that it's going to hold and it's not

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.610 
that it's going to hold and it's not
you're<00:02:35.480> going<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.690> help<00:02:36.140> prevent<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
you're going to help prevent the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:50.140 
you're going to help prevent the
slippage<00:02:37.810> here<00:02:38.810> we've<00:02:38.960> got<00:02:39.140> that

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.369 

we're<00:02:50.450> going<00:02:50.599> to<00:02:50.660> take<00:02:50.810> your<00:02:50.989> scissors<00:02:51.200> and

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
we're going to take your scissors and

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.710 
we're going to take your scissors and
we're<00:02:51.620> going<00:02:51.769> to<00:02:51.830> cut<00:02:52.010> that

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.410 

okay<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:57.680> now<00:02:58.040> we're<00:02:58.280> ready<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.610> separate<00:02:59.180> our

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
okay so now we're ready to separate our

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.690 
okay so now we're ready to separate our
tape<00:02:59.660> stirrups<00:03:03.160> we're<00:03:04.160> going<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.370> flip<00:03:04.520> them

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
tape stirrups we're going to flip them

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.900 
tape stirrups we're going to flip them
so<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:05.000> sticky<00:03:05.270> sides<00:03:05.600> on<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.290> bandage

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.660 

alright<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.120> now<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:14.540> stuff<00:03:15.340> I'm<00:03:16.340> going<00:03:16.580> to

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
alright and now this stuff I'm going to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.780 
alright and now this stuff I'm going to
go<00:03:16.760> ahead<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.210> unroll<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.590> re-roll<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.310> so

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
go ahead and unroll it and re-roll it so

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.880 
go ahead and unroll it and re-roll it so
that<00:03:20.000> there's<00:03:20.540> less<00:03:20.840> chance<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:21.500> me<00:03:21.680> getting

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
that there's less chance of me getting

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.340 
that there's less chance of me getting
it<00:03:22.130> too<00:03:22.370> tight<00:03:22.640> because<00:03:22.850> this<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.360> really

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
it too tight because this is really

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.800 
it too tight because this is really
stretchy<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:25.040> really<00:03:25.810> potentially

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
stretchy and really potentially

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.380 
stretchy and really potentially
dangerous<00:03:27.250> for<00:03:28.250> causing<00:03:28.640> too<00:03:28.880> much<00:03:29.060> pressure

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
dangerous for causing too much pressure

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.090 
dangerous for causing too much pressure
so<00:03:29.540> again<00:03:29.900> I'm<00:03:30.350> going<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.650> pretty<00:03:30.920> much<00:03:31.040> just

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
so again I'm going to pretty much just

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.090 
so again I'm going to pretty much just
lay<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:32.050> with<00:03:33.050> just<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.380> slightest<00:03:33.890> amount

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
lay it on with just the slightest amount

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.770 
lay it on with just the slightest amount
of<00:03:34.310> tension<00:03:34.550> so<00:03:34.940> it's<00:03:35.210> not<00:03:35.360> going<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.600> cause

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
of tension so it's not going to cause

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.160 
of tension so it's not going to cause
any<00:03:35.810> kind<00:03:36.200> of<00:03:36.350> constriction<00:03:37.450> 50%<00:03:38.450> overlap<00:03:38.930> as

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
any kind of constriction 50% overlap as

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:54.160 
any kind of constriction 50% overlap as
we<00:03:39.290> go<00:03:39.470> up<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:46.730> like<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:52.330> and<00:03:53.330> so<00:03:53.750> now<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:53.960> ran

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
we go up you like it and so now I ran

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.450 
we go up you like it and so now I ran
out<00:03:54.320> of<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.500> part<00:03:54.710> that<00:03:54.830> I'd<00:03:54.950> already<00:03:55.220> pre

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
out of the part that I'd already pre

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.550 
out of the part that I'd already pre
stretched<00:03:55.820> so<00:03:56.000> I'm<00:03:56.060> going<00:03:56.240> to<00:03:56.270> go<00:03:57.170> ahead<00:03:57.290> and

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
stretched so I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.940 
stretched so I'm going to go ahead and
reroll<00:03:58.220> that<00:04:01.780> if<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:03.020> keep<00:04:03.200> this<00:04:03.440> stuff<00:04:03.709> in

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
reroll that if you keep this stuff in

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.790 
reroll that if you keep this stuff in
your<00:04:04.070> car<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.760> it<00:04:05.420> gets<00:04:05.630> exposed<00:04:06.020> to<00:04:06.320> heat<00:04:06.560> and

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
your car and it gets exposed to heat and

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.100 
your car and it gets exposed to heat and
it<00:04:07.130> gets<00:04:07.310> squished<00:04:07.700> it's<00:04:08.510> virtually

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
it gets squished it's virtually

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.630 
it gets squished it's virtually
impossible<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:10.070> unroll<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:12.130> it's<00:04:13.130> one<00:04:13.459> of<00:04:13.550> the

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
impossible to unroll so it's one of the

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.090 
impossible to unroll so it's one of the
best<00:04:13.940> things<00:04:14.270> ever<00:04:14.510> but<00:04:15.140> it<00:04:15.320> does<00:04:15.590> have<00:04:15.890> its

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
best things ever but it does have its

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:37.350 
best things ever but it does have its
little<00:04:16.310> once's

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.149 

all<00:04:38.360> right<00:04:38.599> and<00:04:38.810> so<00:04:39.909> sometimes<00:04:40.909> I<00:04:41.780> will<00:04:42.530> put<00:04:42.830> a

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
all right and so sometimes I will put a

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.180 
all right and so sometimes I will put a
sticky<00:04:43.669> type<00:04:44.569> of<00:04:44.750> tape<00:04:45.020> up<00:04:45.229> at<00:04:45.379> the<00:04:45.500> top<00:04:45.710> to

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
sticky type of tape up at the top to

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.860 
sticky type of tape up at the top to
actually<00:04:46.759> for<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.060> extra<00:04:47.449> holding<00:04:47.750> but

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
actually for the extra holding but

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.600 
actually for the extra holding but
that's<00:04:48.020> only<00:04:48.169> because<00:04:48.379> I<00:04:48.650> don't<00:04:49.250> believe<00:04:49.430> in

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
that's only because I don't believe in

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.610 
that's only because I don't believe in
myself<00:04:49.849> and<00:04:50.240> not<00:04:50.569> confident<00:04:51.080> them<00:04:51.169> like<00:04:51.319> my

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
myself and not confident them like my

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.540 
myself and not confident them like my
bandage<00:04:52.009> is<00:04:52.159> secure<00:04:53.050> so<00:04:54.050> you<00:04:54.530> know<00:04:54.979> especially

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
bandage is secure so you know especially

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.640 
bandage is secure so you know especially
they're<00:04:55.909> moving<00:04:56.300> a<00:04:56.389> lot<00:04:56.569> that<00:04:56.960> extra<00:04:57.470> piece

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
they're moving a lot that extra piece

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.080 
they're moving a lot that extra piece
that's<00:04:57.889> got<00:04:58.039> the<00:04:58.129> sticky<00:04:58.460> stuff<00:04:58.610> on<00:04:58.759> it<00:04:58.909> may

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
that's got the sticky stuff on it may

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.480 
that's got the sticky stuff on it may
help<00:04:59.300> up<00:04:59.509> at<00:04:59.659> the<00:04:59.750> top<00:04:59.960> but<00:05:00.469> it<00:05:00.740> really<00:05:00.949> if<00:05:01.310> I'm

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
help up at the top but it really if I'm

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.459 
help up at the top but it really if I'm
doing<00:05:01.849> it<00:05:01.969> right<00:05:02.270> then<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:02.960> should<00:05:02.990> actually

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
doing it right then it should actually

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.800 
doing it right then it should actually
stay<00:05:03.949> on<00:05:04.159> this<00:05:04.819> one<00:05:05.030> is<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.210> little<00:05:05.389> bit<00:05:05.629> loose

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
stay on this one is a little bit loose

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.689 
stay on this one is a little bit loose
and<00:05:06.050> it'll<00:05:06.530> probably<00:05:06.740> slip<00:05:07.099> a<00:05:07.190> little<00:05:07.430> bit<00:05:07.520> so

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
and it'll probably slip a little bit so

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:08.830 
and it'll probably slip a little bit so
I<00:05:07.729> could<00:05:08.000> have<00:05:08.120> put<00:05:08.300> a<00:05:08.330> little<00:05:08.509> bit<00:05:08.690> more

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
I could have put a little bit more

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.080 
I could have put a little bit more
tension<00:05:09.110> on<00:05:09.379> it<00:05:09.590> but<00:05:10.310> I<00:05:10.340> want<00:05:10.550> it<00:05:10.639> to<00:05:10.759> be<00:05:10.879> really

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
tension on it but I want it to be really

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.149 
tension on it but I want it to be really
sure<00:05:11.389> that<00:05:11.419> we<00:05:11.629> didn't<00:05:11.870> overdo<00:05:12.530> it<00:05:12.560> because

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
sure that we didn't overdo it because

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:15.640 
sure that we didn't overdo it because
that<00:05:13.759> is<00:05:14.030> going<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.240> be<00:05:14.389> an<00:05:14.659> issue<00:05:14.780> notice

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
that is going to be an issue notice

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.529 
that is going to be an issue notice
