Haven what we're going to show you today
is<00:00:09.030> our<00:00:09.300> cryo<00:00:09.599> stem-cell<00:00:10.110> therapy<00:00:10.639> what<00:00:11.639> this

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
is our cryo stem-cell therapy what this

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.369 
is our cryo stem-cell therapy what this
is<00:00:11.969> going<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.240> do<00:00:12.419> it's<00:00:12.599> going<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.839> tighten<00:00:13.139> and

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
is going to do it's going to tighten and

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.490 
is going to do it's going to tighten and
firm<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.889> skin<00:00:14.030> the<00:00:15.030> stem<00:00:15.389> cells<00:00:15.780> are<00:00:16.020> bovine

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
firm the skin the stem cells are bovine

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.850 
firm the skin the stem cells are bovine
stem<00:00:16.890> cells<00:00:17.220> they<00:00:17.580> come<00:00:17.880> frozen<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.810> us<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
stem cells they come frozen to us and

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.380 
stem cells they come frozen to us and
what<00:00:20.010> we're<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.460> do<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.270> our

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
what we're going to do is this is our

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.910 
what we're going to do is this is our
plain<00:00:21.630> Krispies<00:00:22.110> we're<00:00:22.290> going<00:00:22.440> to<00:00:22.530> have<00:00:22.710> her

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
plain Krispies we're going to have her

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.910 
plain Krispies we're going to have her
hold<00:00:23.550> those<00:00:23.880> frozen<00:00:24.240> stem<00:00:24.810> cells<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.470> that's

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
hold those frozen stem cells and that's

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.980 
hold those frozen stem cells and that's
going<00:00:26.190> to<00:00:26.280> be<00:00:26.460> enough<00:00:26.940> time<00:00:27.330> just<00:00:27.720> as<00:00:27.870> I

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
going to be enough time just as I

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.530 
going to be enough time just as I
cleanse<00:00:28.290> her<00:00:28.410> skin<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.310> defrost<00:00:29.760> those<00:00:30.180> cells

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
cleanse her skin to defrost those cells

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.229 
cleanse her skin to defrost those cells
so<00:00:30.870> as<00:00:31.320> I'm<00:00:31.560> cleansing<00:00:31.830> her<00:00:32.189> right<00:00:32.430> now<00:00:32.610> what

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
so as I'm cleansing her right now what

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.580 
so as I'm cleansing her right now what
I'm<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:34.110> I'm<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.290> going<00:00:34.559> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
I'm going to do is I'm just going to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
talk<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.039> little<00:00:35.460> bit<00:00:35.670> about<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.359> stem

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
talk to you a little bit about the stem

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.189 
talk to you a little bit about the stem
cell<00:00:36.839> therapy<00:00:37.379> these<00:00:38.160> cells<00:00:38.640> are<00:00:39.120> from<00:00:39.690> bovine

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
cell therapy these cells are from bovine

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.759 
cell therapy these cells are from bovine
that<00:00:40.739> are<00:00:40.890> raised<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.370> France<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.659> what<00:00:43.589> that

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
that are raised in France and what that

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.610 
that are raised in France and what that
means<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.249> that<00:00:44.280> they<00:00:44.519> are<00:00:44.550> cow<00:00:45.059> cells<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.079> as

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
means is that they are cow cells and as

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.619 
means is that they are cow cells and as
a<00:00:46.649> lot<00:00:46.949> of<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.219> probably<00:00:47.460> know<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.300> pig

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
a lot of you probably know we use pig

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.689 
a lot of you probably know we use pig
valves<00:00:49.050> for<00:00:49.199> heart<00:00:49.469> surgery<00:00:49.949> and<00:00:50.190> all<00:00:50.309> kinds

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
valves for heart surgery and all kinds

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.630 
valves for heart surgery and all kinds
of<00:00:50.760> animal<00:00:51.480> stuff<00:00:51.749> and<00:00:52.019> the<00:00:52.620> bovine<00:00:53.069> cells<00:00:53.399> are

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
of animal stuff and the bovine cells are

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.759 
of animal stuff and the bovine cells are
the<00:00:53.730> closest<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.359> human<00:00:54.539> cells<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.559> when

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
the closest to human cells but when

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.669 
the closest to human cells but when
these<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.149> extracted<00:00:57.149> what<00:00:58.019> they<00:00:58.229> do<00:00:58.289> is

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
these are extracted what they do is

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.979 
these are extracted what they do is
basically<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.640> an<00:00:59.819> amniocentesis<00:01:00.210> for

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
basically it's like an amniocentesis for

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.049 
basically it's like an amniocentesis for
the<00:01:01.079> cow<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.589> taking<00:01:01.979> that<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.579> early

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the cow it's taking that very early

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.479 
the cow it's taking that very early
stages<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.600> pregnancy<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.800> those<00:01:05.010> cells<00:01:05.309> that

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
stages of pregnancy so those cells that

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.480 
stages of pregnancy so those cells that
are<00:01:05.700> extracted<00:01:06.390> do<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.619> bovine<00:01:07.979> DNA

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
are extracted do not have the bovine DNA

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.120 
are extracted do not have the bovine DNA
yet<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.719> taken<00:01:10.140> before<00:01:10.649> that<00:01:10.920> even

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
yet so it's taken before that even

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.020 
yet so it's taken before that even
develops<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.299> they're<00:01:12.450> very<00:01:13.070> baby<00:01:14.070> infant

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
develops so they're very baby infant

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
develops so they're very baby infant
infant<00:01:15.600> cells<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.890> they're

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
infant cells and then they're

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
infant cells and then they're
flash-frozen<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:18.689> go<00:01:18.869> through<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
flash-frozen and they go through a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.929 
flash-frozen and they go through a
process<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.829> they<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.100> put<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.369> these<00:01:20.490> vials

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
process and they get put in these vials

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.690 
process and they get put in these vials
and<00:01:21.090> they<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.360> shipped<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.750> us<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.950> what<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.399> do

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and they get shipped to us so what we do

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.149 
and they get shipped to us so what we do
with<00:01:23.939> them<00:01:24.149> is<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.420> apply<00:01:24.899> them<00:01:25.140> topically<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
with them is we apply them topically to

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.330 
with them is we apply them topically to
the<00:01:26.340> skin<00:01:26.700> any<00:01:27.479> time<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.409> you're<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:29.039> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the skin any time that you're going to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.109 
the skin any time that you're going to
add<00:01:29.549> those<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.380> skin<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.549> you're<00:01:32.729> going

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
add those to the skin what you're going

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.569 
add those to the skin what you're going
to<00:01:33.149> do<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.570> increase<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.350> tissue<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:35.189> that

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
to do is increase the tissue of that

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.270 
to do is increase the tissue of that
skin<00:01:35.969> so<00:01:36.539> everything<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.829> work

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
skin so everything is going to work

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.700 
skin so everything is going to work
better<00:01:38.549> work<00:01:39.000> faster<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:40.200> other<00:01:40.409> thing

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
better work faster the other thing

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.679 
better work faster the other thing
that's<00:01:40.829> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.189> happen<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.060> also<00:01:42.329> been

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
that's going to happen is it's also been

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.770 
that's going to happen is it's also been
proven<00:01:42.719> that<00:01:43.350> you're<00:01:43.920> more<00:01:44.219> mature<00:01:44.460> cells<00:01:45.149> are

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
proven that you're more mature cells are

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.980 
proven that you're more mature cells are
going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> actually<00:01:47.420> increase<00:01:48.420> their

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
going to actually increase their

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.679 
going to actually increase their
activity<00:01:49.490> because<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.670> kind<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.270> think

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
activity because it's kind of like think

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.060 
activity because it's kind of like think
about<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.109> you<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> room<00:01:52.710> full<00:01:53.009> of

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
about it if you have a room full of

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.160 
about it if you have a room full of
people<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:54.899> boring

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
people and it's just a really boring
