00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
pretty strong actually here's where i

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.960 
pretty strong actually here's where i
catch<00:01:14.760> everything<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.890> obviously<00:01:17.700> i<00:01:19.970> can

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
catch everything you obviously i can

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:30.260

hear<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.330> closer<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.720> closer<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:29.150> then<00:01:30.150> he

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
hear get closer and closer and then he

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.130 
hear get closer and closer and then he
said<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:31.400> since<00:01:32.400> zombies<00:01:33.390> don't<00:01:33.750> give<00:01:33.990> off

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
said but since zombies don't give off

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.800 
said but since zombies don't give off
anything<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> minecraft<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.630> give

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
anything like like a minecraft they give

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.700 
anything like like a minecraft they give
off<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.340> rotten<00:01:38.340> flesh<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.380> here<00:01:40.380> they<00:01:40.530> don't

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
off a rotten flesh and here they don't

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.210 
off a rotten flesh and here they don't
so<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> sucks<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.320> killing<00:01:43.320> zombies<00:01:43.770> has<00:01:44.009> no

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
so it sucks so killing zombies has no

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.240 
so it sucks so killing zombies has no

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
ocean they are actually taking up space

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.730 
ocean they are actually taking up space
on<00:01:57.799> just<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.189> little<00:01:59.460> knob<00:01:59.729> area<00:02:00.740> so

here<00:03:02.440> actually<00:03:03.010> there's<00:03:03.220> practice<00:03:03.700> um<00:03:04.120> a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
here actually there's practice um a

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.030 
here actually there's practice um a
passageway<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.770> water<00:03:06.160> comes<00:03:06.610> over<00:03:06.850> here<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
passageway of water comes over here the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.400 
passageway of water comes over here the
amount<00:03:09.850> of<00:03:10.090> power<00:03:10.450> having<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.380> water<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:13.410> just

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
amount of power having the water I just

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.430 
amount of power having the water I just
covered<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.770> up<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:16.060> light<00:03:16.440> pretty

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
covered it up so that the light pretty

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.850 
covered it up so that the light pretty
crappy<00:03:17.770> covering<00:03:18.130> coverage<00:03:19.530> yeah<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.560> can<00:03:20.740> hear

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
crappy covering coverage yeah I can hear

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.740 
crappy covering coverage yeah I can hear
a<00:03:20.920> spider<00:03:21.250> already<00:03:21.700> um<00:03:22.150> i<00:03:24.060> have<00:03:25.060> no<00:03:25.090> idea<00:03:25.360> there
