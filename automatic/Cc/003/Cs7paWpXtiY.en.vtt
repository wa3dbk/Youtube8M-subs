00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello pupils welcome to chair 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 Play the section where you will learn 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.769
 about board games as per art of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.769
 Magic 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.450
 this will undoubtedly be the most 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.580
 important of the channel because 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.310
 mysteriously insults and thinks that the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.540
 people are born knowing and this is not the case 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.160
 many of you who do not know 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.960
 basic concepts about games of 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.849
 table so here I am for 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.610
 fix it for this first delivery 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.370
 let's start at the beginning by the 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.130
 types of game there 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.440
 and here on this board we have the guys 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.360
 of the basic game the best known the 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.390
 most important forgiveness 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.550
 let's start with the files or parties 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.220
 the files or parties are simple games 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.410
 to explain simple to learn short 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.420
 of duration and that usually also 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.000
 they have few components are games 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.250
 tiny ones and they are usually games that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.680
 we can say of stuffed games for 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.870
 play between bigger games though 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.110
 to say that I played whole afternoons 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.729
 the fillers with the students of first 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.380
 we went to the second category the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.570
 eurogames you've heard a lot of 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.090
 sometimes true the eurogames are games in 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.800
 which gives priority to mechanics 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.259
 The important thing is that I have some 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.110
 good playable mechanics the theme is 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.970
 something secondary are also games that in 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.680
 components is not that they usually emphasize 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.000
 often have wooden components 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.530
 sure you have seen in a lot of 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.899
 tables of games or cubes scattered 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.270
 by the table that will be neuro gamers are 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.310
 games that have little chance normally 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.590
 you will not see dice in euro game and it will link 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.030
 is little or even null to the eurogames 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.040
 they like to have the situation controlled 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.530
 Eurogames are games with a 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.300
 average duration usually hover between 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.010
 hour or half hour of course there's 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.120
 exceptions in longer games and more 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.340
 short but they tend to haunt those 100 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.050
 they are games with simple rules with 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.280
 simple manuals I also go back to 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.900
 say there are exceptions but 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.420
 They are usually few manuals 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.250
 pages and simple ways to win 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.690
 the games are usually with points of 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.190
 victory we usually win 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.080
 Victory points throughout the 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.060
 game and at the end the player who more 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.190
 victory points has wins and by 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.750
 last there is usually no eliminations something 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.430
 very rare that in a euro game there 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.140
 elimination we all play in peace and 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.140
 harmony until the end of the game 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.390
 Sorry , the students just left 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.310
 of 1ยบ we continue with the summer and after 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.960
 Americans are the complete opposite of 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.790
 the eurogames in the ministers what 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.820
 important is the subject that the mechanics 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.920
 and the subject are perfectly merged 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.480
 and that this set makes us able 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.280
 feel the theme that we feel of 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.560
 true in the universe on which it is based 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.850
 that game on the other hand the components 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.410
 They are usually quite spectacular 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.940
 when you play a game with many 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.520
 many plastic figurines many 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.980
 miniatures will surely be a game to 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.690
 Mary back or otherwise thematic 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.040
 because I did not say it but to mary back 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.600
 it's a slightly derogatory way of 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.760
 say it a term with which the 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.520
 heartless eurogamer began to call 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.680
 to the 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.080
 of American games but good today in 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.700
 day is not taken as a contempt but 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.470
 On the contrary, although they are also 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.510
 can qualify as thematic games 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.550
 continuous in addition to the components 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.110
 showy are also games with a lot 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.730
 interaction a lot of interaction between 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.650
 players something that eurogames do not 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.570
 often happens on the other side are games that 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.430
 they have a fairly high chance too 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.170
 depends a bit on the type of game 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.330
 thematic but they usually have 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.310
 quite a lot of doing 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.840
 other side are long games with a 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.670
 long duration that usually pass the two 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.130
 hours and complex games with manuals 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.860
 huge that can exceed 30 at 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.930
 50 pages follow we also have 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.520
 elimination of players not all but 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.530
 It is something that is usual in this 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.450
 kind of games and there are different 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.010
 victory conditions depending on the 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.290
 game are not all with points of 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.210
 victory can be for a goal by 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.890
 eliminate the other players and so on 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.570
 and to know the three types of games 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.850
 basic the three types of games that more 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.740
 you will see in the channel and that if it falls you will not 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.570
 I have deigned to explain you I do not know why 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.830
 but to finish we have three types of 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.110
 more games I 'm going to explain a little bit of 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.030
 passed on the one hand the abstract games 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.890
 that are games without theme games where 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.030
 mechanics prevail over everything 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.740
 important is to have a good 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.390
 but they are games that do not have any 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.550
 theme games that will move fichitas 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.200
 and touch the little things without knowing why 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.700
 are you doing on the other hand we have the 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.560
 world games games that recreate battles 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.569
 historical and they try to make the 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.730
 as reliable as possible with manuals 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.560
 extensive there are all kinds of battles 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.269
 historical battles fantastic battles 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.459
 future space battles what 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.470
 you want and to finish we have the euro 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.990
 after a term coined here the analysis 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.000
 paralysis for games that mix a 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.740
 little what is a euro game and a mary 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.450
 back lately they are coming out a lot 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.340
 this kind of games like can be a 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.960
 cycle of that as can be a kemet or 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.450
 even a general state we can say 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.130
 games that do not leave the subject aside but 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.660
 they have more similar mechanics to 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.760
 eurogames although also with its dot 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.770
 of chance but with good components but 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.630
 sometimes with good elimination let's say 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.190
 that mix the best of both worlds and 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.650
 makes all players live in 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.030
 peace and harmony and they love each other and with 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.530
 this we finish today's lesson that 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.669
 so I'm listening to the students 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.400
 first they are already climbing the ladder 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.970
 and I have to take a look See 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.970
 in the next 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.890
 ah 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.139
 one
