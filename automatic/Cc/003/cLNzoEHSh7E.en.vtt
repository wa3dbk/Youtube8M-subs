00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.570 
I'm going to do is this is the best
place<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.230> glee<00:03:36.380> want<00:03:36.710> the<00:03:37.130> maintenance<00:03:37.490> or

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
place to glee want the maintenance or

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.500 
place to glee want the maintenance or
you<00:03:37.640> can<00:03:37.790> take<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:37.940> knife<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.180> try<00:03:38.420> and

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
you can take the knife and try and

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.640 
you can take the knife and try and
smooth<00:03:38.720> out<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:38.900> little<00:03:39.050> bit<00:03:39.230> so<00:03:39.410> it's<00:03:39.530> not

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
smooth out a little bit so it's not

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.280 
smooth out a little bit so it's not
quite<00:03:39.860> so<00:03:40.100> curved<00:03:40.810> without<00:03:41.810> cutting<00:03:42.050> through

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
quite so curved without cutting through

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.890 
quite so curved without cutting through
it<00:03:42.470> we<00:03:43.460> have<00:03:43.550> a<00:03:43.610> slightly<00:03:43.910> flatter<00:03:44.300> area<00:03:44.690> for

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
it we have a slightly flatter area for

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:58.470 
it we have a slightly flatter area for
the<00:03:44.930> magnitude<00:03:45.530> blue<00:03:45.770> on

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.500 

he's<00:03:58.690> going<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.959> take<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.290> some<00:03:59.950> super<00:04:00.220> glue

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.809 

i'm<00:04:06.349> using<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.680> pretty<00:04:06.860> big<00:04:07.010> names<00:04:07.129> this<00:04:07.310> is<00:04:07.489> 16

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
i'm using a pretty big names this is 16

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.240 
i'm using a pretty big names this is 16
millimeter<00:04:08.209> by<00:04:08.420> one<00:04:08.599> and<00:04:08.659> a<00:04:08.720> half<00:04:08.750> millimeter

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
millimeter by one and a half millimeter

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.319 
millimeter by one and a half millimeter
end<00:04:10.250> up<00:04:10.549> with<00:04:10.700> this<00:04:10.760> size<00:04:10.939> because<00:04:11.150> they<00:04:11.209> were

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
end up with this size because they were

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.949 
end up with this size because they were
surplus<00:04:11.750> J&amp;J<00:04:12.620> has<00:04:13.209> KJ<00:04:14.209> magnetics<00:04:14.659> they<00:04:14.780> have<00:04:14.930> a

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
surplus J&amp;J has KJ magnetics they have a

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.039 
surplus J&amp;J has KJ magnetics they have a
surplus<00:04:15.260> area<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:17.150> i<00:04:17.180> was<00:04:17.389> able<00:04:17.479> get<00:04:17.630> these<00:04:17.810> for

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
surplus area so i was able get these for

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.539 
surplus area so i was able get these for
cheap<00:04:18.260> and<00:04:18.949> they're<00:04:19.040> really<00:04:19.190> big<00:04:19.400> and

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
cheap and they're really big and

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.580 
cheap and they're really big and
powerful<00:04:19.729> it<00:04:20.269> should<00:04:20.419> only<00:04:20.449> take<00:04:20.600> one<00:04:20.900> pull

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
powerful it should only take one pull

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.010 
powerful it should only take one pull
this<00:04:21.739> on<00:04:21.889> them<00:04:22.100> and<00:04:22.310> do<00:04:22.490> is<00:04:22.669> put<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.660> finger<00:04:23.840> on

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
this on them and do is put a finger on

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.000 
this on them and do is put a finger on
the<00:04:24.169> inside<00:04:24.470> of<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.650> door<00:04:26.650> as<00:04:27.650> close<00:04:27.889> as

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
the inside of the door as close as

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.710 
the inside of the door as close as
possible<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.520> exact<00:04:28.970> right<00:04:29.150> spots<00:04:29.479> we're

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
possible the exact right spots we're

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.680 
possible the exact right spots we're
just<00:04:29.840> going<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:31.000> eyeball<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.330> middle<00:04:32.570> of<00:04:32.630> the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
just going to eyeball the middle of the

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.150 
just going to eyeball the middle of the
magnet

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.070 

so<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:38.760> get<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:38.910> pretty<00:04:39.060> good<00:04:39.180> idea<00:04:39.330> but<00:04:39.900> where

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
so you get a pretty good idea but where

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.960 
so you get a pretty good idea but where
the<00:04:40.200> magnet<00:04:40.470> is<00:04:41.150> so<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.210> blew<00:04:42.600> it<00:04:42.750> on<00:04:43.970> it's

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
the magnet is so you blew it on it's

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.380 
the magnet is so you blew it on it's
just<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.210> same<00:04:45.480> side

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.610 

this<00:04:50.750> is<00:04:50.840> going<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:51.020> be<00:04:51.110> going<00:04:51.200> through<00:04:51.350> the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
this is going to be going through the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:59.690 
this is going to be going through the
door

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.510 

okay<00:05:00.270> that's<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:00.990> there<00:05:01.110> for<00:05:01.140> 30<00:05:01.980> seconds<00:05:02.310> so

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
okay that's it there for 30 seconds so

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.790 
okay that's it there for 30 seconds so
that<00:05:02.750> solidify<00:05:03.750> make<00:05:04.320> sure<00:05:04.350> we<00:05:04.590> got<00:05:04.680> the

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
that solidify make sure we got the

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.200 
that solidify make sure we got the
polarity<00:05:05.160> correct

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
polarity correct

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.890 
polarity correct
we<00:05:08.210> do

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
we do

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.540 
we do

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
Harrigan Boulder just snapped under the

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.850 
Harrigan Boulder just snapped under the
door

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.129 

take<00:05:16.159> plastic<00:05:16.430> cool<00:05:16.729> pingu<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.479> door<00:05:17.629> into

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
take plastic cool pingu the door into

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:27.999 
take plastic cool pingu the door into
the<00:05:18.169> storm<00:05:18.740> raven
