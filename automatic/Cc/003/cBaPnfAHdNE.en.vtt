just downright overpowered I'm actually
inclined<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.539> agree<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.019> second<00:00:25.410> group

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
inclined to agree with the second group

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.200 
inclined to agree with the second group
because<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.039> gun<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.279> clearly<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.029> best

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
because this gun is clearly the best

because this gun is clearly the best
bolt-action<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> game<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.619> actually

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
bolt-action in the game and it actually

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.679 
bolt-action in the game and it actually
makes<00:00:29.220> other<00:00:29.490> weapons<00:00:29.849> irrelevant<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.539> an

already imbalanced class but anyway

already imbalanced class but anyway
let's<00:00:33.180> take<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> look<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> stats<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.260> see

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
let's take a look at the stats and see

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.950 
let's take a look at the stats and see
why<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.700> GOL<00:00:35.910> magnum<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.480> standard

why the GOL magnum is a standard

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.510 
why the GOL magnum is a standard

you<00:03:11.670> take<00:03:11.849> advantage<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.569> tie<00:03:12.750> rate<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.109> fire

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
you take advantage of a tie rate of fire

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.020 
you take advantage of a tie rate of fire
by<00:03:13.530> eliminating<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.220> need<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.549> zoom<00:03:14.760> out<00:03:14.939> to

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
by eliminating the need to zoom out to

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.270 
by eliminating the need to zoom out to
reach<00:03:15.329> aim<00:03:15.569> /<00:03:15.720> around<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.440> as<00:03:16.889> for<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.129> rest

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.159

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
of the attachments on this gun I'm not

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.599 
of the attachments on this gun I'm not
really<00:03:19.379> a<00:03:19.500> fan<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:20.010> candidate<00:03:20.370> iron

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
sights or the rangefinder I'd probably

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.470 
sights or the rangefinder I'd probably
prefer<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:23.190> run<00:03:23.340> with<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.579> variable<00:03:23.940> zoom<00:03:24.239> on

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
prefer to run with a variable zoom on

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.629 
prefer to run with a variable zoom on
this<00:03:24.629> gun<00:03:24.810> instead<00:03:25.079> a<00:03:25.500> good<00:03:25.889> secondary<00:03:26.370> and

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
this gun instead a good secondary and

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.610 
this gun instead a good secondary and
the<00:03:26.760> pld<00:03:27.209> will<00:03:27.419> do<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.690> job<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.139> other<00:03:28.379> two

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the pld will do the job of the other two

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.170 
the pld will do the job of the other two
attachments<00:03:29.159> anyway<00:03:29.549> so<00:03:29.609> they're<00:03:29.879> not<00:03:29.970> really

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
attachments anyway so they're not really

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.330 
attachments anyway so they're not really
that<00:03:30.419> necessary<00:03:30.599> to<00:03:31.169> begin<00:03:31.290> with<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.129> tack

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
that necessary to begin with the tack

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.189 
that necessary to begin with the tack
light<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:32.819> laser<00:03:33.060> will<00:03:33.449> also<00:03:33.750> do<00:03:33.870> very<00:03:34.109> little

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
light and laser will also do very little

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.689 
light and laser will also do very little
except<00:03:34.769> give<00:03:34.889> your<00:03:35.040> position<00:03:35.430> away<00:03:35.639> so

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
except give your position away so

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.189 
except give your position away so
honestly<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.359> don't<00:03:36.569> think<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.019> worth

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
honestly I don't think it's worth

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.860 
honestly I don't think it's worth
running<00:03:37.440> with<00:03:37.680> any<00:03:37.949> of<00:03:38.099> them<00:03:38.299> but<00:03:39.299> anyway<00:03:39.659> my

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
running with any of them but anyway my

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.689 
running with any of them but anyway my
final<00:03:40.230> thoughts<00:03:40.440> on<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.709> GOL<00:03:40.889> magnum<00:03:40.919> is<00:03:41.519> that

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
final thoughts on the GOL magnum is that

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.789 
final thoughts on the GOL magnum is that
this<00:03:41.879> is<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> good<00:03:42.269> gun<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:42.959> enjoy<00:03:43.229> using<00:03:43.530> it

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
this is a good gun and I enjoy using it

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.740 
this is a good gun and I enjoy using it
but<00:03:43.949> it's<00:03:44.129> probably<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.639> little<00:03:44.909> too<00:03:45.209> good<00:03:45.479> I

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
but it's probably a little too good I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.780 
but it's probably a little too good I
don't<00:03:46.290> like<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.620> idea<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:47.010> any<00:03:47.340> weapon<00:03:47.669> which

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
don't like the idea of any weapon which

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.339 
don't like the idea of any weapon which
completely<00:03:48.209> trumps<00:03:48.599> another<00:03:48.840> weapon<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.229> the

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
completely trumps another weapon in the

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.990 
completely trumps another weapon in the
game<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.829> surely<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.400> definition<00:03:50.940> of

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
game and surely the definition of

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.759 
game and surely the definition of
overpowered<00:03:51.750> would<00:03:51.930> be<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.109> gun<00:03:52.349> that<00:03:52.379> trumps

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
overpowered would be a gun that trumps

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.460 
overpowered would be a gun that trumps
almost<00:03:53.129> every<00:03:53.459> other<00:03:53.489> weapon<00:03:53.940> in<00:03:54.060> its<00:03:54.209> class

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470

everyone was calling for the ace23 to be

everyone was calling for the ace23 to be
nerfed<00:03:57.329> in<00:03:57.659> the<00:03:57.750> first<00:03:57.959> few<00:03:58.229> months<00:03:58.409> after

launch and it has quite a few

ours<00:04:02.729> I'm<00:04:03.120> actually<00:04:03.659> really<00:04:04.019> surprised<00:04:04.590> more

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889

nerfed yet because if anything it's a

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.339 
nerfed yet because if anything it's a
bit<00:04:08.489> like<00:04:08.639> if<00:04:08.879> an<00:04:09.030> AE<00:04:09.269> k<00:04:09.569> had<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.959> recoil

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
bit like if an AE k had the recoil

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
just be stuck with it how it is if so
