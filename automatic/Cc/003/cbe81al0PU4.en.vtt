00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello everyone we continue our turn 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.470
 face exploration 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 after the ears we will do the nose 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.700
 so as usual I'm going to do a 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.500
 little bit a little theoretical about 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.929
 what is the nose after we 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.360
 will try to see how the stylized so 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.949
 it's gone to your pencils 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.840
 so I started by doing you for 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.500
 explain yourself a little bit in these days 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.390
 important to know 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.539
 so when we compose so gave and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.369
 his two parts there in fact he's bones is 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.800
 in fact the nose comes to extend on 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.320
 this bone base is actually there is any 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.000
 the bottom part because I'm on 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.520
 your soft nose is actually 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.730
 cartilage and so that's what will create 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.059
 the structure of the nose so suddenly when 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.379
 you know that actually if your part 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.719
 bony imagining that they are a 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.690
 little more a little higher 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.239
 that's what sometimes creates the fact that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.059
 the nose is going to be a little hunchbacked etc 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.780
 and after at the cartilage level creates 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.280
 so the wings of the nose 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.170
 that's what these parts are with 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.030
 nostrils so to remember for there for you 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.520
 this part acquired and bony and this 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.750
 part there that is cartilage so a 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.000
 a little softer and who can have 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.869
 structures of different structures 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 so I made a little guy in 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.600
 underneath to show you a little bit 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.880
 the structure 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.619
 that's how it can be so 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.229
 it's a given version and that's what 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.119
 is great when you do drawing 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.430
 we can look a little bit 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.170
 all the ways to make year so 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.040
 we will try to see that in a few 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.409
 small steps 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.240
 knowing that obviously things that 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.560
 those that are common to all men 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.579
 it's the nostrils 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.979
 after obviously the nose more or less 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.110
 more or less flattered more or less big 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.380
 more or less hungry we always have this 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.280
 structure this given structure or more 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.979
 or less pointed cetera 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.090
 we all had the same structure after this 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.820
 which differs is the size the width 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.710
 and so once we understand 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.659
 it's shameful 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.790
 hurry to do a little better there I 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.180
 do a little bit realistic for that done 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.530
 a little overview here are the 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.270
 nostrils rather hidden or rather visible 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.940
 so sometimes and noses where we know we 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.470
 can see other nostrils well a little 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.660
 like this one really wanted the nose 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.489
 fell a little you have to know a little 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.739
 thing is that kind of like the 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.019
 ears the nose has grown in function 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.670
 of late it grew with the young or older 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:32.830
 older the more we are on the contrary 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.300
 more and more young people more is the 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.209
 small nose when you want to give 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.459
 the appearance of a child in general the nose 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.200
 is close enough to the eyes so if 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.150
 it is an adult 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.620
 I caricature but the nose a little more 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.190
 long good there it is a small and a small 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.519
 detail so the nose the nostrils the wings 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.850
 of the nose 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.959
 how once we know that the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.340
 stylized because we do not care what 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.840
 I'm interested in making cardboard 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.940
 mangas etc 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.680
 so we'll try to do that on a 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.480
 other drawing after I made you a 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.459
 perso and we will try to see precisely 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.350
 what is the pressure does according to 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.090
 different is we can do so 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.220
 there is the neo classic finland and asik 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.739
 no but there is one that consists of 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.200
 to make a shadow just remember 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.290
 so after that it's up to you as 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.450
 draftsman and sarah to see what 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.000
 style do you like it that's it 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.760
 really the interest without teeth when we 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.470
 creates his style know low from a 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.480
 and realistic what question want 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.930
 give so we have this way of doing 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.579
 which is just the shade we have then if we 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.359
 can no longer be manga or it's just a 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:46.269
 a little bit like that we have what 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.489
 else we have full dad game I do not see 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.280
 to do everything we have just the small point there 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.320
 who is really more manga for the shot 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.330
 it can be just as 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.050
 something like that 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:03.550
 it can be the trait it can be 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:05.350
 simply is from only the donna 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.670
 reed with why not the shadow in 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.520
 below you see that it changes 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.880
 really the the bet preview of the 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.520
 fellow 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.140
 so that's the nose it's a detail 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.000
 but ultimately in function as it is 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.290
 does it really go to change sides on 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.400
 can do one here you have if I do 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.340
 a big state changes totally his 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.920
 face it can be a very big train 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.330
 nose a little more comic so that's okay 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.210
 it does not work 3 that the style so it's 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.460
 also depending on the style that is 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.310
 what else can we do 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.170
 we are a little like that here is full 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.760
 full full there is a multitude given this 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.770
 to know is how he is 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.690
 done at the base and after to you from the 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.470
 stylized your way and it's the same 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.150
 thing for girls 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:49.870
 if he takes feminine perceives that so we 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.730
 has the classic nose with just the 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.040
 point that's what's great in drawing 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.500
 it 's nothing like a trait 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.300
 like that it's not a nose but if it's 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.410
 stylized in a village here we give 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.000
 the impression of a nose thanks to a small 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.000
 trait c'est ça ça c'est ça c'est magique 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.840
 it can be something like that it can 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.180
 to be some designers do too 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.430
 the shadow is a racing car nose by 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.360
 the shadow that is on the side 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.639
 what is it really when the light 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.910
 come from here we have shade on the face 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.910
 of the nose 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.969
 what else yes but again 

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:23.369
 the shadow underneath so here I did 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.109
 many right hfe the shadow underneath 

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:27.879
 the nostrils 

00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:30.429
 it's all up to you to see what you 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:32.439
 please it can be something like that 

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:35.259
 you see that there are multi of 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:37.599
 possibilities if we were in quarters all 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.559
 in comics we see here I made him the guy 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.119
 are on time but he's really going to 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:42.099
 good side it does not work that a girl the 

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:43.689
 big round nose purse after you had 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.879
 but if we miss it 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:47.259
 it's very ugly right then 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:51.489
 that by just doing a little 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:53.739
 relate to it works what so here's 

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:55.689
 for this little preview of the nose euros here 

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:56.739
 it was fast but it was 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.969
 explain to you a little bit about it 

00:05:56.739 --> 00:06:00.799
 could work 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:03.259
 I hope you enjoyed it do not hesitate 

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:04.909
 to share this is the case you say in 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.279
 comment if I have things to see in 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:10.309
 more of that I tell you very soon 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:11.479
 for the next correction and to 

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:14.229
 next saturday for a new video 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.229
 lease
