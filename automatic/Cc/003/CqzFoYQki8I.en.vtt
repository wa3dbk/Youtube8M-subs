 it is worth noting that the calculations that will be presented below use 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.550
 credits for plans of 120 months and probability of contemplation by 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.549
 draw in the middle of the plan or in the parcel of number 60 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.930

 group life insurance already included in the 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.170
 our investment simulation 'begins with the acquisition of an account 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:35.049
 of real estate in the amount of 95 thousand reais with installments of 990 reais and twenty-two 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.680
 cents during the first five years the consortium will make an investment 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.650
 in the middle of the plan that will have to prohibit the age of the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.489
 contemplation and the credit of 95 thousand will be used to acquire a 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.190
 immobile 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.440
 average rent says 665 reais corresponding to the 07 percent of the 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.760
 value of the asset in the same period, the consortium will continue to invest in 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.240
 consortium acquiring a second quota this time for a loan of 60 thousand 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.620
 in this case the installment will be 625 reais and forty cents 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.790
 in the next 60 months the consortium will invest 990 reais and twenty-two 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.510
 cent of the first quota plus 625 reais and forty cents the second 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.220
 will receive revenue from the receipt of 665 reais from the rent of the first property 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.319
 acquired 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.259
 at the end with monthly investments about 950 reais and sixty-two cents 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:47.469
 maintaining the pre-determined value at the beginning guaranteeing the tranquility of the 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:48.629
 your future 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.719
 the first quota already contemplated will be removed. 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:58.759
 at the same time, it is likely that contemplation of the 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:03.109
 second quota and you can also count on the rent of this property 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.299
 in the average amount of 420 reais each month 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.750
 again will be made a new investment in a property account 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:20.790
 this time in the amount of 140 thousand with monthly installments of 1459 reais in 27 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.730
 cents 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.930
 this amount will be added to the portion of 625 reais and forty cents of the second 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.520
 quota not yet removed 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.500
 this way he will receive the rent of the two properties acquired and 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.889
 in the end the amount to be paid will be 999 reais and sixty seven cents 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.610
 after 60 months, the second quota shall be paid and the third 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.290
 be contemplated generating a property with average rent of 980 reais 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.090
 fifteen years after the first investment 'he will already have a prescription 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.379
 monthly rate of 605 reais and 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:10.139
 I tried three cents in 20 years with the result could not be better because 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.559
 he will have taken out his third quota and the income of the three properties acquired all 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:20.470
 lizarazu in the amount of two thousand and 65 reais per month 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.920
 besides the patrimony dir 295 thousand 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.480
 with this demonstration that we have just seen 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.900
 it is evident that the consumer, if he or she already plans to use the 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.139
 advantages of having 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.439
 created a future equity and have a monthly lifetime income 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:38.500
 that the consortium 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.540
 differs from other retirement options 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.750
 because the income generated by the properties acquired through a 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.360
 bruises does not stop with his life and not for a 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.110
 what about these other options so remember you have to go 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.490

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.360
 a portion that will allow you in the future 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.159
