00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.400
 very good to all and welcome to this 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.380
 new video during photo online in 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.540
 cost and ministry in reference to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.950
 grand theft auto 4 and something that happened to 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.720
 principle the campaign and is that in this 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.640
 new game grand theft auto 5 we can 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.930
 see that reference but before that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.250
 start the video I would like to ask you 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.720
 Do not forget to hit like if you 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.790
 like with nothing more to add 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.700
 we begin well then of list and what 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.110
 we can find on the pier south of 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.189
 the saints if we turn to the 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.320
 location that you are seeing the same 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.390
 in the video we can see a ship a 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.880
 boat is called octopus and puts under 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.949
 liberty city as it turns out that this boat 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.989
 is the same exactly good if it is not 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.120
 exactly is very similar to the one in the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.399
 that come and cobelli to the city in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.590
 grand theft auto 4 if we remember that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.480
 boat was called platypus the liberty 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.890
 city ​​they also put under the name is 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.140
 different but the ship is exactly 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.910
 they do not have any difference and for 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.160
 Of course the name is so similar that 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.809
 not to leave no doubt that it is 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.030
 the same that they have reused the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.800
 model but not in the most sense that 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.120
 they let him work but in the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.890
 sense that they have wanted to do that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.370
 nod to grand theft auto 4 this is a 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.530
 boat that three immigrants from countries of 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.360
 this normally towards the liberty city 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.650
 but in this case it is also docked 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.380
 the saints we do not know if it's because 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.720
 brought immigrants to big to grand 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.100
 theft auto 5 to the saints we go and this 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.710
 it can be related to the fact that 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.570
 we can choose niko bellic as 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.890
 in the character creator good not 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.560
 can do it in a normal way but it 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.720
 can create niko bellic in the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.460
 creator of characters and we could play 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.470
 with him and this makes like a reference 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.330
 not even though that fact is likely maybe 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.030
 that the medical child has traveled to 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.130
 the saints do not know if there are going 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.560
 shots I would like you to tell me yours 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.720
 why do you think this boat 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.520
 is also docked in the saints 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.410
 within being the same although the name 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.840
 have changed the boat slightly is 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.910
 exactly the same has the same 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.100
 shape and has the same strings all 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.840
 everything is exactly the same as what was said 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.729
 why do you think this boat is here 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.380
 maybe by niko bellic or maybe by 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.300
 some other thing without more I hope that 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.310
 you liked it you do not know how to leave your 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.729
 comment and greetings and even the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.479
 next 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.479
 goodbye
