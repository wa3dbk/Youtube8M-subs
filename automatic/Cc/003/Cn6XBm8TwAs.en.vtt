00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.650 

right<00:02:01.280> now<00:02:01.460> they're<00:02:01.670> running<00:02:01.820> just<00:02:02.270> over

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
right now they're running just over

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.560 
right now they're running just over
30-minute<00:02:03.470> 10-kilometer<00:02:04.400> pace<00:02:04.670> on<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.060> course

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
30-minute 10-kilometer pace on a course

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.480 
30-minute 10-kilometer pace on a course
that<00:02:05.630> has<00:02:05.810> an<00:02:06.080> uphill<00:02:06.290> section<00:02:06.920> on<00:02:07.040> each<00:02:07.160> loop

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
that has an uphill section on each loop

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.270 
that has an uphill section on each loop
so<00:02:07.730> this<00:02:08.179> is<00:02:08.390> not<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.660> flat<00:02:09.020> course<00:02:09.320> on<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.100> run

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
so this is not a flat course on the run

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.070 
so this is not a flat course on the run
and<00:02:10.520> we<00:02:10.580> know<00:02:10.789> how<00:02:11.030> ridiculously<00:02:11.840> difficult
