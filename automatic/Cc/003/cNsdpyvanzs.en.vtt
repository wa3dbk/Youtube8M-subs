Serge master so twice it has an on/off
switch<00:02:56.000> I've<00:02:56.570> heard<00:02:56.780> it's<00:02:56.959> quite<00:02:57.709> easy<00:02:58.160> to

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
switch I've heard it's quite easy to

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.270 
switch I've heard it's quite easy to
knock<00:02:58.670> off<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.180> might<00:02:59.680> maybe<00:03:00.680> just<00:03:00.980> put<00:03:01.130> some

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
knock off so I might maybe just put some

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.949

blue<00:03:01.610> tack<00:03:01.880> over<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:02.480> make<00:03:02.660> sure<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.810> don't

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
blue tack over that to make sure I don't

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.979 
blue tack over that to make sure I don't
accidentally<00:03:03.680> turn<00:03:04.040> off<00:03:04.220> 80<00:03:04.970> devices<00:03:05.720> on<00:03:05.870> my

accidentally turn off 80 devices on my
desk<00:03:06.230> all<00:03:06.470> at<00:03:06.590> once<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:06.980> may<00:03:07.580> be<00:03:07.640> buying<00:03:07.970> a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
desk all at once I may be buying a

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.020 
desk all at once I may be buying a
second<00:03:08.600> one<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.810> these<00:03:08.989> if<00:03:09.200> if<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:09.739> like<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.220> my

second one of these if if I like this my

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.509 
second one of these if if I like this my
plan<00:03:11.330> is<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.540> actually<00:03:11.870> mount<00:03:12.290> two<00:03:14.769> on<00:03:15.769> the

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
plan is to actually mount two on the

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.759 
plan is to actually mount two on the
wall<00:03:16.790> behind<00:03:17.269> my<00:03:17.750> desk<00:03:17.810> because<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.470> back<00:03:18.620> of

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
wall behind my desk because the back of

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.080 
wall behind my desk because the back of
my<00:03:18.860> desk<00:03:19.100> has<00:03:19.280> this<00:03:19.430> panel<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:19.880> wood<00:03:20.060> that

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
my desk has this panel of wood that

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.180 
my desk has this panel of wood that
comes<00:03:20.510> down<00:03:20.690> which<00:03:20.930> would<00:03:21.080> hide<00:03:21.350> them<00:03:21.620> along

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
comes down which would hide them along

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.460 
comes down which would hide them along
with<00:03:22.340> all<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.820> plugs<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.330> all<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:24.019> cables

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
with all of the plugs and all the cables

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.310 
with all of the plugs and all the cables
off<00:03:24.620> those<00:03:25.070> particular<00:03:25.730> plugs<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.200> would

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
off those particular plugs so it would

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.870 
off those particular plugs so it would
look<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.620> lot<00:03:27.890> neater<00:03:28.070> than<00:03:28.250> having<00:03:28.640> them<00:03:28.760> all

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
look a lot neater than having them all

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.620 
look a lot neater than having them all
hanging<00:03:29.269> down<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.510> coming<00:03:30.080> out<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:31.630> like

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
hanging down and coming out to like

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.569 
hanging down and coming out to like
surge<00:03:32.840> protectors<00:03:33.410> that<00:03:33.440> would<00:03:33.799> otherwise

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
surge protectors that would otherwise

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.640 
surge protectors that would otherwise
sit<00:03:34.910> on<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.150> floor<00:03:37.329> so<00:03:38.329> I<00:03:38.360> can't<00:03:38.870> think<00:03:39.200> of<00:03:39.440> any

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
sit on the floor so I can't think of any

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.890 
sit on the floor so I can't think of any
other<00:03:39.739> features<00:03:40.459> this<00:03:40.670> has<00:03:40.730> got<00:03:41.180> so<00:03:41.480> I'm<00:03:41.630> going

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
other features this has got so I'm going

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.640 
other features this has got so I'm going
I'll<00:03:42.500> just<00:03:42.709> go<00:03:42.980> ahead<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.340> open<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:45.530> can

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
I'll just go ahead and open it you can

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.650 
I'll just go ahead and open it you can
find<00:03:45.920> out<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.760> exact<00:03:47.150> specs<00:03:47.569> on<00:03:47.900> the

the Amazon's website all unwelcomed
website<00:03:54.560> okay<00:03:55.560> there's<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.310> switch<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:57.060> is

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
website okay there's the switch that is

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.790 
website okay there's the switch that is
easy<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:58.020> knock<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.820> suppose<00:03:59.820> a<00:03:59.850> cable<00:04:00.740> if<00:04:01.740> you

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
easy to knock I suppose a cable if you

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.280 
easy to knock I suppose a cable if you
if<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.310> like<00:04:03.440> move<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.560> cable<00:04:04.980> pasta<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.490> could

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
if you like move a cable pasta to could

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:14.260 
if you like move a cable pasta to could
potentially<00:04:07.290> switch<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.130> up<00:04:12.020> right<00:04:13.020> so

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
potentially switch that up right so

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.270 
potentially switch that up right so
quite<00:04:15.270> big<00:04:15.510> looks<00:04:16.230> quite<00:04:16.470> nice<00:04:16.680> though<00:04:19.280> I'm

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
quite big looks quite nice though I'm

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.990 
quite big looks quite nice though I'm
flicking<00:04:20.610> the<00:04:20.820> switch<00:04:20.850> again<00:04:21.180> by<00:04:21.959> accident<00:04:23.000> so

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
flicking the switch again by accident so

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.030 
flicking the switch again by accident so
whatever<00:04:24.300> got<00:04:24.750> edged<00:04:25.110> white<00:04:25.500> on<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.830> front

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
whatever got edged white on the front

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.340 
whatever got edged white on the front
and<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.730> rest<00:04:26.880> is<00:04:27.150> great<00:04:27.510> including<00:04:28.230> the

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
and the rest is great including the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.190 
and the rest is great including the
cable<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:29.010> don't<00:04:29.580> know<00:04:29.700> why<00:04:29.880> them<00:04:30.200> Balcon

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
cable I don't know why them Balcon

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.660 
cable I don't know why them Balcon
insist<00:04:31.620> on<00:04:31.830> great<00:04:32.790> cables<00:04:33.360> rather<00:04:33.600> than<00:04:33.870> white

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
insist on great cables rather than white

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.490 
insist on great cables rather than white
well<00:04:35.670> here's<00:04:35.970> another<00:04:36.030> nice<00:04:36.390> feature<00:04:36.690> cable

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
well here's another nice feature cable

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.720 
well here's another nice feature cable
management<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:40.380> suppose<00:04:40.800> you<00:04:41.160> pull<00:04:41.580> this

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
management and suppose you pull this

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.250 
management and suppose you pull this
little<00:04:41.970> flap<00:04:42.660> up<00:04:42.840> at<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.140> end<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:45.260> somehow

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
little flap up at the end and somehow

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.790 
little flap up at the end and somehow
then<00:04:47.040> I<00:04:47.720> assume<00:04:48.720> it<00:04:48.870> comes<00:04:49.080> off<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:49.530> you<00:04:49.590> can

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
then I assume it comes off and you can

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.280 
then I assume it comes off and you can
put<00:04:50.340> all<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.550> cables<00:04:50.970> through<00:04:51.240> there<00:04:51.480> so<00:04:52.080> that

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
put all the cables through there so that

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.710 
put all the cables through there so that
all<00:04:52.440> just<00:04:52.800> come<00:04:52.980> at<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.280> end<00:04:53.310> which<00:04:53.970> should

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
all just come at the end which should

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.270 
all just come at the end which should
keep<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.080> meter<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:55.590> it's<00:04:55.680> got<00:04:55.800> two<00:04:56.010> lights

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
keep the meter so it's got two lights

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.810 
keep the meter so it's got two lights
one<00:04:57.020> which<00:04:58.020> tells<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.590> if<00:04:58.710> it's<00:04:58.860> powered<00:04:59.670> on

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
one which tells you if it's powered on

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.760 
one which tells you if it's powered on
one<00:05:00.180> which<00:05:00.570> tells<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:01.080> if<00:05:01.230> everything<00:05:01.560> is

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
one which tells you if everything is

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.050 
one which tells you if everything is
protected<00:05:04.010> here<00:05:05.010> are<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.280> swiveling<00:05:06.150> sockets

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
protected here are the swiveling sockets

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.690 
protected here are the swiveling sockets
I<00:05:09.060> think<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.170> have<00:05:10.350> to<00:05:10.500> plug<00:05:11.040> something<00:05:11.310> in<00:05:11.580> to

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
I think I have to plug something in to

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.640 
I think I have to plug something in to
be<00:05:11.820> able<00:05:11.910> to<00:05:12.030> swivel<00:05:12.270> them<00:05:12.510> but<00:05:12.720> those<00:05:13.380> ones

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
be able to swivel them but those ones

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.850 
be able to swivel them but those ones
the<00:05:14.280> two<00:05:14.490> at<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:14.760> end<00:05:14.910> can<00:05:15.210> turn<00:05:15.480> around<00:05:15.860> 180

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
the two at the end can turn around 180

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.740 
the two at the end can turn around 180
degrees<00:05:18.530> which<00:05:19.530> is<00:05:19.890> great<00:05:20.700> if<00:05:20.910> you<00:05:21.060> have<00:05:21.090> some

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
degrees which is great if you have some

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.310 
degrees which is great if you have some
old<00:05:22.020> shaped<00:05:22.620> plugs<00:05:23.400> often<00:05:24.390> you<00:05:24.480> get<00:05:24.660> big

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
old shaped plugs often you get big

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.370 
old shaped plugs often you get big
chunky<00:05:25.950> ones<00:05:26.600> with<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:27.720> cable<00:05:28.050> that<00:05:28.110> comes

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
chunky ones with the cable that comes

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.130 
chunky ones with the cable that comes
out<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:28.620> top<00:05:28.650> instead<00:05:29.160> of<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.340> bottom<00:05:29.480> so<00:05:30.480> you

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
out the top instead of the bottom so you

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.600 
out the top instead of the bottom so you
can<00:05:31.170> turn<00:05:31.620> them<00:05:31.830> around<00:05:31.920> to<00:05:32.220> make<00:05:32.370> sure<00:05:32.400> you

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
can turn them around to make sure you

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.390 
can turn them around to make sure you
can<00:05:32.790> fit<00:05:33.000> everything<00:05:33.330> in<00:05:33.630> and<00:05:34.250> they're<00:05:35.250> also

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
can fit everything in and they're also

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.600 
can fit everything in and they're also
kind<00:05:36.210> of<00:05:36.390> staggered<00:05:36.960> like<00:05:37.110> that<00:05:37.320> so<00:05:37.680> there's

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
kind of staggered like that so there's

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.650 
kind of staggered like that so there's
less<00:05:39.450> chance<00:05:39.900> of<00:05:40.490> plugs<00:05:41.490> and<00:05:41.760> cables<00:05:41.790> getting

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
less chance of plugs and cables getting

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.269 
less chance of plugs and cables getting
in<00:05:42.780> the<00:05:43.770> way<00:05:43.950> of<00:05:44.070> other<00:05:44.280> ones

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:46.279 
in the way of other ones

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:49.899 
in the way of other ones
so<00:05:46.909> that's<00:05:47.119> all<00:05:47.419> there<00:05:47.599> is<00:05:47.749> to<00:05:48.169> this<00:05:48.519> as<00:05:49.519> I<00:05:49.849> said

so that's all there is to this as I said

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:53.799 
so that's all there is to this as I said
I<00:05:50.179> may<00:05:50.539> get<00:05:50.779> another<00:05:50.899> one<00:05:51.199> Oh<00:05:52.029> see<00:05:53.029> how<00:05:53.599> this
