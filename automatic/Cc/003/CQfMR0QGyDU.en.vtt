00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.290
 and than my mission here on this 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.510
 sinful earth sit back or 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.849
 melt like a relay increasingly 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.040
 nightmares excite the moon long sleep 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.240
 Thunderbirds in a mask if 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.400
 buy a picasso 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.950
 where would I be there you would be 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.770
 conventional vials of poison well that there was a 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.510
 at least some incense for whom these words 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.360
 just empty ronnie sounds 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.510
 when that we say the faces of the saints 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.120
 threaded 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.489
 horse and in response to the silence of the gruel shaped like 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.920
 not far away the voice inside me says 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.800
 with me who is louder who was quieter with everyone 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.109
 kick duty still hear the call exit 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.570
 always even where the flash is being smoked 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.940
 split probably now a cut you to 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.249
 Volga tires dam our god sculpted us not 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.859
 for river sand beliefs from time to clay 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:04.559
 take hold of mind did not let go 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.559
 summing up all their world they are different 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.110
 foot and how they talked 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.320
 look there you will see your way not 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.540
 retreats 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.270
 hurt who could not 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.720
 and their fate 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.010
 we never said 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.900
 sarah there you will see your way 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.650
 we enter wet 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.800
 they can 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.070
 i don't have i won't show pantomime 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.660
 I want to be faceless I want others not 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.510
 such as one big 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.510
 gloomy herd who doesn't understand what's from 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.060
 life and generally do not care what now 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.750
 time of year the weather is not terrible to me any 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.130
 on the path of adversity any manifestations of these 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.530
 gray coming days where 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.680
 because the heart beats every day 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.670
 All the bitterness I do not know what changes treason 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.010
 waiting for us I think about that light of us still 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.310
 wait for the world can be different or 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.490
 Otherwise, how do we solve others absolutely here. 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.300
 the challenge is becoming what we wanted 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.910
 become and there in heaven must be about it 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.670
 know exactly going through life do not throw on 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:29.310
 nobody looked back only their whole 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:31.010
 life is a piece where their fate and never 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.380
 do not say 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.560
 where will you see your way 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.700
 joining neither special but little 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.210
 its fate 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.010
 for meat on 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:48.010
 go as they spoke and again 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.409
 paradise there you will see your way not 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.409
 I enter with you yes but I could not 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.629
