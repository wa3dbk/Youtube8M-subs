say you know God he's too busy for
things<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.899> he<00:01:01.500> takes<00:01:01.829> care<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
things like this he takes care of the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.060

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
schedule so to speak for the little ones

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.760 
schedule so to speak for the little ones
i<00:01:07.170> think<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.400> absurd<00:01:09.299> because<00:01:09.680> first<00:01:10.680> of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
i think that is absurd because first of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.100 
i think that is absurd because first of
all<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.010> fundamentally<00:01:11.850> wrong

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
all it's fundamentally wrong

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.660 
all it's fundamentally wrong
fundamentally<00:01:13.110> wrong<00:01:13.320> means<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:14.130> God<00:01:14.340> has

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
fundamentally wrong means that God has

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.570 
fundamentally wrong means that God has
no<00:01:14.970> schedule<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.750> fills<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.320> God<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.310> does

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
no schedule that fills up God just does

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.609 
no schedule that fills up God just does
whatever<00:01:17.880> he<00:01:18.270> wants<00:01:18.450> has<00:01:19.229> room<00:01:19.590> for

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
whatever he wants has room for
