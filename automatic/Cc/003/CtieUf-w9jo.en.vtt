00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
the maggots come to the surface and then

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.599 
the maggots come to the surface and then
rinse<00:03:10.919> off<00:03:11.159> in<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:12.389> sieve<00:03:13.040> hope<00:03:14.040> my<00:03:14.189> lenses

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
rinse off in a sieve hope my lenses

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.659 
rinse off in a sieve hope my lenses
steaming<00:03:15.030> up<00:03:15.120> here<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:19.219> then<00:03:20.219> I've<00:03:20.430> got<00:03:20.579> to

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
steaming up here and then I've got to

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.390 
steaming up here and then I've got to
leave<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.909> for<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.090> day<00:03:21.299> add<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.290> peptic<00:03:22.980> enzyme

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
leave it for a day add the peptic enzyme

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.659 
leave it for a day add the peptic enzyme
or<00:03:23.909> peptidase<00:03:24.419> and<00:03:25.319> some<00:03:25.500> might<00:03:25.949> call<00:03:26.129> it<00:03:26.719> so<00:03:27.719> I

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
or peptidase and some might call it so I

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:36.999 
or peptidase and some might call it so I
measure<00:03:29.669> up<00:03:29.760> my<00:03:30.419> water<00:03:32.629> and<00:03:33.629> a<00:03:33.689> half<00:03:35.239> again

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:37.009 
measure up my water and a half again

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:39.890 
measure up my water and a half again
no<00:03:38.009> point<00:03:38.340> good<00:03:38.849> point<00:03:38.879> sunny<00:03:39.389> tonight

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
no point good point sunny tonight

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.479 
no point good point sunny tonight
so<00:03:40.409> I<00:03:40.439> measure<00:03:40.680> that's<00:03:40.859> worth<00:03:41.069> points<00:03:43.489> now

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
so I measure that's worth points now

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:54.740 
so I measure that's worth points now
that<00:03:44.639> that<00:03:44.819> one<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.509> another<00:03:45.810> point<00:03:46.049> again

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.270

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
watch lens don't steam up although I

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.450 
watch lens don't steam up although I
don't<00:03:57.490> be<00:03:57.670> seen<00:03:57.880> nothing<00:04:01.920> right<00:04:02.920> that's<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.370> 8

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
don't be seen nothing right that's the 8

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:14.280 
don't be seen nothing right that's the 8
points<00:04:03.880> I<00:04:04.000> did<00:04:04.210> no<00:04:05.550> cattle<00:04:06.550> back<00:04:10.740> and<00:04:13.290> better

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
points I did no cattle back and better

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.170 
points I did no cattle back and better
stir<00:04:14.530> this<00:04:14.680> now<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:15.690> got<00:04:16.690> no<00:04:16.810> this<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.140> cool<00:04:18.180> then

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
stir this now I got no this to cool then

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.670 
stir this now I got no this to cool then
I<00:04:19.299> add<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.750> hectare<00:04:20.650> lace<00:04:20.799> leave<00:04:21.370> for<00:04:21.610> a<00:04:21.670> date

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
I add the hectare lace leave for a date

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.850 
I add the hectare lace leave for a date
then<00:04:23.680> I<00:04:24.130> add<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.640> Easter<00:04:25.390> nutrient<00:04:25.860> and

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
then I add the Easter nutrient and

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.510 
then I add the Easter nutrient and
ferment<00:04:27.340> out<00:04:27.550> for<00:04:27.790> 4<00:04:27.940> or<00:04:27.970> 5<00:04:28.060> days<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:30.370> after

that period rack off while strain off

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.880 
that period rack off while strain off
then<00:04:34.810> should<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.080> say<00:04:35.260> into<00:04:35.970> into<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.890> demijohn

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
that there it's region about 120 degrees

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.030 
that there it's region about 120 degrees
and<00:06:39.500> drop<00:06:39.680> in<00:06:39.890> 110<00:06:40.930> it's<00:06:41.930> going<00:06:42.170> down<00:06:42.410> as<00:06:42.950> you

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.040

can see with the temperature of the
water<00:06:45.920> at<00:06:46.190> the<00:06:46.250> moment<00:06:46.310> today<00:06:46.700> is<00:06:46.930> 120<00:06:50.890> so<00:06:51.890> I

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:51.920 
water at the moment today is 120 so I

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.670 
water at the moment today is 120 so I
need<00:06:52.340> to<00:06:52.520> get<00:06:52.670> that<00:06:52.850> back<00:06:53.150> down<00:06:53.360> to<00:06:53.690> about<00:06:53.930> 70

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
need to get that back down to about 70

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:03.040 
need to get that back down to about 70
degrees<00:06:57.250> Fahrenheit<00:06:59.080> 21<00:07:00.080> degrees<00:07:00.380> Celsius<00:07:02.050> so

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
degrees Fahrenheit 21 degrees Celsius so

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.660 
degrees Fahrenheit 21 degrees Celsius so
