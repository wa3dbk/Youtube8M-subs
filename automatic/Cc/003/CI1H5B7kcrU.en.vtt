00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
fast you lose almost all your references

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.259 
fast you lose almost all your references
and<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.799> just<00:02:33.220> sort<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.489> drive<00:02:33.730> blind<00:02:34.030> at<00:02:34.180> that

and you just sort of drive blind at that

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.860 
and you just sort of drive blind at that
point
