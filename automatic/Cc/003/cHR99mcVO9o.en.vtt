00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.229 
yep now all right so this is an
all-inclusive<00:03:13.080> test<00:03:13.620> here<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.250> mean<00:03:14.850> we're<00:03:15.209> not

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
all-inclusive test here I mean we're not

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.759 
all-inclusive test here I mean we're not
really<00:03:15.360> looking<00:03:15.780> at<00:03:15.900> accuracy<00:03:16.260> or<00:03:16.590> anything

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
really looking at accuracy or anything

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.140 
really looking at accuracy or anything
like<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.040> because<00:03:17.370> we've<00:03:17.610> both<00:03:17.760> made<00:03:17.970> our

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
like that because we've both made our

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.289 
like that because we've both made our
mistakes<00:03:18.650> but<00:03:19.650> yeah<00:03:22.190> both<00:03:23.190> tons<00:03:23.580> real<00:03:24.060> good

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
mistakes but yeah both tons real good

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.530 
mistakes but yeah both tons real good
guns<00:03:24.560> highly<00:03:25.560> recommended<00:03:27.769> by<00:03:28.769> both

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
guns highly recommended by both

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:42.140 
guns highly recommended by both
5x8<00:03:30.540> both<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.989> us<00:03:36.680> okay

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.050 

now<00:03:43.410> he's<00:03:44.410> big<00:03:44.710> argument<00:03:45.160> ever<00:03:45.250> since<00:03:45.460> 2003

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
now he's big argument ever since 2003

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.120 
now he's big argument ever since 2003
when<00:03:46.240> this<00:03:46.450> when<00:03:46.840> this<00:03:46.990> kind<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.770> round<00:03:47.950> was

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
when this when this kind of round was

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.630 
when this when this kind of round was
made<00:03:48.340> has<00:03:49.240> been<00:03:49.270> oh<00:03:49.750> wait<00:03:50.140> like<00:03:50.920> hey<00:03:51.430> when<00:03:51.610> I

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
made has been oh wait like hey when I

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.370 
made has been oh wait like hey when I
hit<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.940> market<00:03:52.300> people<00:03:52.480> were<00:03:52.660> worrying<00:03:53.230> that

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
hit the market people were worrying that

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.220 
hit the market people were worrying that
the<00:03:53.530> 22<00:03:54.030> what's<00:03:55.030> gonna<00:03:55.150> look<00:03:55.300> inferior<00:03:55.840> but

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
the 22 what's gonna look inferior but

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.170 
the 22 what's gonna look inferior but
that's<00:03:56.500> only<00:03:56.709> because<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:57.220> 22lr<00:03:57.880> does

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
that's only because the 22lr does

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.810 
that's only because the 22lr does
because<00:03:58.690> this<00:03:58.900> round<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.490> pretty<00:04:00.490> big

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
because this round is pretty big

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.490 
because this round is pretty big
compared<00:04:01.240> to<00:04:01.270> a<00:04:01.390> 22lr<00:04:02.100> but<00:04:03.100> it<00:04:03.760> was<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:05.260> was

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
compared to a 22lr but it was it was

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.410 
compared to a 22lr but it was it was
pretty<00:04:05.680> much<00:04:05.860> in<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.459> offspring<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.060> 22

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
pretty much in the offspring of the 22

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.620 
pretty much in the offspring of the 22
Magnum<00:04:08.100> they're<00:04:09.100> not<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.430> different<00:04:09.700> at<00:04:10.330> all

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
Magnum they're not that different at all

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.530 
Magnum they're not that different at all
no<00:04:11.260> pretty<00:04:11.650> much<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:12.550> breaks<00:04:12.730> pretty<00:04:13.150> similar

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
no pretty much it breaks pretty similar

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.060 
no pretty much it breaks pretty similar
velocity<00:04:14.050> wise<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:14.560> mean<00:04:14.739> there<00:04:14.890> are<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:14.980> little

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
velocity wise I mean there are a little

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.470 
velocity wise I mean there are a little
different<00:04:15.370> terms<00:04:15.820> when<00:04:16.090> you're<00:04:16.209> looking<00:04:16.390> at

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
different terms when you're looking at

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.289 
different terms when you're looking at
like<00:04:16.600> power<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.530> accuracy<00:04:18.400> like<00:04:18.910> seventeen

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
like power and accuracy like seventeen

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.099 
like power and accuracy like seventeen
supposed<00:04:19.570> to<00:04:19.630> be<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.720> little<00:04:19.870> bit<00:04:20.019> more

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
supposed to be a little bit more

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.860 
supposed to be a little bit more
accurate<00:04:20.560> at<00:04:20.709> longer<00:04:21.100> ranges<00:04:21.669> twenty<00:04:22.630> mags

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
accurate at longer ranges twenty mags

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.840 
accurate at longer ranges twenty mags
supposed<00:04:23.350> to<00:04:23.500> be<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.650> little<00:04:24.100> powerful<00:04:24.640> with

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
supposed to be a little powerful with

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.360 
supposed to be a little powerful with
shorter<00:04:25.210> ranges<00:04:25.630> you<00:04:25.780> know<00:04:25.900> it's<00:04:26.050> just<00:04:26.169> like

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
shorter ranges you know it's just like

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.030 
shorter ranges you know it's just like
it's<00:04:27.370> like<00:04:27.430> Ford<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.000> Chevy<00:04:28.240> guys<00:04:28.480> it's<00:04:28.810> just

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
the lever-action 22 mag is probably the

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:32.430 
the lever-action 22 mag is probably the
best<00:05:29.190> -<00:05:30.190> is<00:05:30.370> 17<00:05:30.820> or<00:05:31.690> you<00:05:31.840> can<00:05:31.990> talk<00:05:32.140> about<00:05:32.350> the
