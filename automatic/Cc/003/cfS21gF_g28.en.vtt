00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
that I got a few more bulbs in off of

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.570 
that I got a few more bulbs in off of
ebay<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:23.949> noticed<00:00:24.949> a<00:00:25.039> couple<00:00:25.339> of<00:00:25.400> things

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580

ebay and noticed a couple of things
about<00:00:25.759> them<00:00:26.119> that<00:00:26.179> actually<00:00:26.570> didn't<00:00:26.960> really

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
about them that actually didn't really

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.290 
about them that actually didn't really
like<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:28.009> figured<00:00:28.310> I'd<00:00:28.400> share<00:00:28.730> them<00:00:28.880> with<00:00:28.939> you

bulb<00:00:44.329> replacements<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:46.879> ordered<00:00:47.629> 6

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
bulb replacements and I ordered 6

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.260 
bulb replacements and I ordered 6
initially<00:00:48.440> from<00:00:48.559> one<00:00:48.800> company<00:00:49.070> off<00:00:49.789> of<00:00:50.120> ebay

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
initially from one company off of ebay

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.910 
initially from one company off of ebay
and<00:00:50.690> then<00:00:50.780> I<00:00:50.809> ordered<00:00:51.079> another<00:00:51.170> 6<00:00:51.620> because<00:00:51.829> I

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
and then I ordered another 6 because I

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.049 
and then I ordered another 6 because I
wasn't<00:00:52.129> quite<00:00:52.399> sure<00:00:52.430> if<00:00:52.609> they're<00:00:52.789> gonna<00:00:52.910> be

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
wasn't quite sure if they're gonna be

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.110 
wasn't quite sure if they're gonna be
differences<00:00:53.510> between<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.960> two<00:00:54.430> one<00:00:55.430> of<00:00:55.940> the

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
differences between the two one of the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.180 
differences between the two one of the
bulb<00:00:56.359> style<00:00:57.370> had<00:00:58.370> 5<00:00:59.170> diodes<00:01:00.170> on<00:01:00.379> it<00:01:00.530> five<00:01:00.739> LEDs

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
bulb style had 5 diodes on it five LEDs

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.299 
bulb style had 5 diodes on it five LEDs
on<00:01:01.460> it<00:01:01.640> but<00:01:02.539> they<00:01:02.629> were<00:01:02.719> bigger<00:01:02.960> on<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.040> fan

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
on it but they were bigger on the fan

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.240 
on it but they were bigger on the fan
the<00:01:04.519> first<00:01:04.760> set<00:01:05.059> I<00:01:05.089> got<00:01:05.210> actually<00:01:05.780> had<00:01:05.930> 10<00:01:06.470> but

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
the first set I got actually had 10 but

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.760 
the first set I got actually had 10 but
they<00:01:07.340> were<00:01:07.400> smaller<00:01:08.110> so<00:01:09.110> let<00:01:09.260> me<00:01:09.350> go<00:01:09.500> over<00:01:09.620> a

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
they were smaller so let me go over a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.320 
they were smaller so let me go over a
couple<00:01:10.040> of<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.310> differences<00:01:10.820> actually<00:01:11.090> there

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
couple of the differences actually there

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.080 
couple of the differences actually there
really<00:01:11.510> is<00:01:11.750> only<00:01:11.930> one<00:01:12.610> but<00:01:13.610> it's<00:01:13.850> fairly

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
really is only one but it's fairly

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.670 
really is only one but it's fairly
important<00:01:14.600> for<00:01:14.750> me<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:14.870> I<00:01:15.080> figured<00:01:15.380> I'd<00:01:15.470> share

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
important for me so I figured I'd share

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.460 
important for me so I figured I'd share
it<00:01:15.770> for<00:01:15.980> you<00:01:17.410> so<00:01:18.410> we'll<00:01:18.530> start<00:01:18.770> with<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:21.050> bulbs

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
it for you so we'll start with the bulbs

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.790 
it for you so we'll start with the bulbs
here<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:22.900> you<00:01:23.900> can<00:01:24.050> see<00:01:24.230> this<00:01:24.380> one<00:01:24.620> is<00:01:24.650> the

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
here and you can see this one is the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.210 
here and you can see this one is the
first<00:01:25.040> one<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.550> got<00:01:25.730> it<00:01:26.330> um<00:01:26.630> it's<00:01:27.590> got<00:01:27.830> 10

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
first one that I got it um it's got 10

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.550 
first one that I got it um it's got 10
diodes<00:01:28.670> on<00:01:28.910> it<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.840> build<00:01:30.050> quality<00:01:30.200> is

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
diodes on it the build quality is

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.340 
diodes on it the build quality is
average<00:01:31.010> some<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.400> them<00:01:31.520> were<00:01:32.230> kind<00:01:33.230> of

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
average some of them were kind of

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.200 
average some of them were kind of
cockeyed<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:33.890> little<00:01:34.100> bit<00:01:34.220> this<00:01:34.370> this<00:01:34.610> top<00:01:34.820> PC

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
cockeyed a little bit this this top PC

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.000 
cockeyed a little bit this this top PC
over<00:01:35.450> just<00:01:35.570> kind<00:01:35.720> of<00:01:35.780> tilted<00:01:36.170> off<00:01:36.290> just

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
over just kind of tilted off just

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.130 
over just kind of tilted off just
slightly<00:01:37.340> just<00:01:38.030> little<00:01:38.300> annoyances<00:01:38.810> but<00:01:38.870> they

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
slightly just little annoyances but they

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.350 
slightly just little annoyances but they
all<00:01:39.230> worked<00:01:39.500> straight<00:01:40.370> out<00:01:40.640> of<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.790> package<00:01:40.940> I

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
all worked straight out of the package I

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.540 
all worked straight out of the package I
had<00:01:41.510> no<00:01:41.660> problems<00:01:42.320> with<00:01:42.470> them<00:01:42.650> this<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.430> the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
had no problems with them this is the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.520 
had no problems with them this is the
second<00:01:43.940> type<00:01:44.120> of<00:01:44.240> bulb<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.540> I<00:01:44.660> got<00:01:44.870> in<00:01:45.050> it's

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
second type of bulb that I got in it's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.800 
second type of bulb that I got in it's
got<00:01:45.710> five<00:01:46.400> diodes<00:01:46.940> on<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.210> however<00:01:47.630> they're<00:01:47.780> a

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
got five diodes on it however they're a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.330 
got five diodes on it however they're a
little<00:01:48.050> bit<00:01:48.170> bigger<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.530> can<00:01:48.830> see<00:01:49.040> you<00:01:49.190> can

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
little bit bigger you can see you can

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.330 
little bit bigger you can see you can
compare<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.820> two<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.690> two<00:01:51.500> sizes<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:52.040> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
compare the two the two sizes of the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.160 
compare the two the two sizes of the
diodes<00:01:52.670> there<00:01:53.320> so<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:55.210> installed<00:01:56.210> them<00:01:56.390> in<00:01:56.450> I

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
diodes there so I installed them in I

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.050 
diodes there so I installed them in I
installed<00:01:57.980> them<00:01:58.100> in<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.310> van<00:01:58.520> in<00:01:58.730> the<00:01:58.820> rear

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
installed them in the van in the rear

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.600 
installed them in the van in the rear
and<00:01:59.360> I<00:02:00.110> quickly<00:02:00.560> noticed<00:02:01.070> something<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.550> I'm

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
and I quickly noticed something and I'm

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.050 
and I quickly noticed something and I'm
gonna<00:02:01.700> share<00:02:01.910> with<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:02.180> now<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:03.250> while<00:02:04.250> this

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
gonna share with you now and while this

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.530 
gonna share with you now and while this
this<00:02:05.900> vehicle<00:02:06.440> isn't<00:02:06.890> mine<00:02:07.280> it's<00:02:07.730> a<00:02:08.209> Toyota

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
this vehicle isn't mine it's a Toyota

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.600 
this vehicle isn't mine it's a Toyota
it's<00:02:11.540> got<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.840> same<00:02:12.020> dome<00:02:12.680> lights<00:02:12.950> here<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.580> I

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
it's got the same dome lights here so I

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.979 
it's got the same dome lights here so I
figured<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.030> would<00:02:14.080> install<00:02:15.080> them<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:16.989> show

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
figured I would install them and show

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.160 
figured I would install them and show
you<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.230> differences<00:02:18.620> between<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:19.069> two<00:02:19.220> so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
you the differences between the two so

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.410 
you the differences between the two so
here<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.680> original<00:02:22.220> one<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.819> I<00:02:22.970> got<00:02:23.150> off

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
here is the original one that I got off

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.220 
here is the original one that I got off
of<00:02:23.569> ebay<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:23.959> is<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.260> 10<00:02:24.670> LED<00:02:25.900> wedge<00:02:26.900> style

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
of ebay this is the 10 LED wedge style

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.180 
of ebay this is the 10 LED wedge style
bulb<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.090> it's<00:02:29.090> pretty<00:02:29.269> bright<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.620> color<00:02:30.860> is

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
bulb and it's pretty bright the color is

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.979 
bulb and it's pretty bright the color is
probably<00:02:31.550> some<00:02:31.849> of<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.090> widest<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.569> have<00:02:32.690> seen

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
probably some of the widest I have seen

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.180 
probably some of the widest I have seen
out<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.760> LED<00:02:35.599> bulbs<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.769> I've<00:02:36.950> purchased

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
out of the LED bulbs that I've purchased

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.580 
out of the LED bulbs that I've purchased
from<00:02:37.430> eBay<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.970> then<00:02:38.720> here<00:02:39.050> is<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.380> five

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
from eBay and then here is the five

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.090 
from eBay and then here is the five
diode<00:02:40.130> one<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.550> I<00:02:40.610> purchased<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.420> don't<00:02:42.170> I'm

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
diode one that I purchased I don't I'm

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.210 
diode one that I purchased I don't I'm
not<00:02:43.280> sure<00:02:43.459> if<00:02:43.580> you<00:02:43.730> can<00:02:43.910> tell<00:02:44.860> with<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:45.980> light

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
not sure if you can tell with this light

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.090 
not sure if you can tell with this light
here<00:02:46.519> but<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.720> five<00:02:47.930> out<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.319> five<00:02:48.530> diode<00:02:48.950> LED

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
here but the five out the five diode LED

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.190 
here but the five out the five diode LED
is<00:02:49.870> much<00:02:50.870> bluer<00:02:51.260> than<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.640> 10<00:02:52.880> LED<00:02:53.510> diode<00:02:53.989> and

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
is much bluer than the 10 LED diode and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
is much bluer than the 10 LED diode and
actually<00:02:54.980> if<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.849> had<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.239> if<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.290> had<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.560> guess<00:02:57.830> I

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
actually if I had to if I had to guess I

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.309 
actually if I had to if I had to guess I
would<00:02:58.430> say<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.849> the<00:02:59.480> white<00:02:59.660> one<00:02:59.870> is<00:02:59.900> actually

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
would say that the white one is actually

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.650 
would say that the white one is actually
a<00:03:00.380> little<00:03:00.530> bit<00:03:00.680> brighter<00:03:01.090> it's<00:03:02.090> hard<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:02.480> tell

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
a little bit brighter it's hard to tell

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.170 
a little bit brighter it's hard to tell
I<00:03:02.720> can't<00:03:03.170> quite<00:03:03.470> yeah<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.580> tried<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.000> take<00:03:05.150> a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
I can't quite yeah I tried to take a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.199 
I can't quite yeah I tried to take a
guess<00:03:05.510> because<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:06.049> in<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.620> back<00:03:06.769> of<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.010> van

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
guess because I in the back of the van

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.690 
guess because I in the back of the van
they<00:03:08.209> were<00:03:08.269> spaced<00:03:08.630> out<00:03:08.780> further<00:03:09.049> from<00:03:09.700> each

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
they were spaced out further from each

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.250 
they were spaced out further from each
other<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.599> I<00:03:11.989> was<00:03:12.230> able<00:03:12.349> to<00:03:13.660> take<00:03:14.660> a<00:03:14.690> guess<00:03:14.959> as

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
other so I was able to take a guess as

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.220 
other so I was able to take a guess as
to<00:03:15.290> whether<00:03:15.920> or<00:03:16.070> not<00:03:16.780> one<00:03:17.780> was<00:03:17.930> putting<00:03:18.140> out

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
to whether or not one was putting out

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.699 
to whether or not one was putting out
more<00:03:18.470> light<00:03:18.680> than<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:18.890> other<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:21.260> really

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
more light than the other so it really

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.770 
more light than the other so it really
the<00:03:22.130> blue<00:03:22.340> is<00:03:22.519> kind<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.790> an<00:03:22.910> annoyance<00:03:23.329> for<00:03:23.630> me

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
the blue is kind of an annoyance for me

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.750 
the blue is kind of an annoyance for me
it's<00:03:24.140> it's<00:03:24.350> more<00:03:24.620> of<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.739> harsher<00:03:25.190> light<00:03:25.459> I

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
it's it's more of a harsher light I

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.430 
it's it's more of a harsher light I
wouldn't<00:03:26.090> want<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.359> spend<00:03:26.720> much<00:03:26.870> time<00:03:26.900> under

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
wouldn't want to spend much time under

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.199 
wouldn't want to spend much time under
it<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.680> think<00:03:28.069> they're<00:03:28.190> fine<00:03:28.400> for<00:03:28.430> for<00:03:29.000> MEP

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
it I think they're fine for for MEP

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.460 
it I think they're fine for for MEP
lights<00:03:29.480> if<00:03:29.630> you're<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:29.900> gonna<00:03:29.989> be<00:03:30.140> using<00:03:30.290> it

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
lights if you're just gonna be using it

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.990 
lights if you're just gonna be using it
for<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.680> short<00:03:30.829> period<00:03:31.160> of<00:03:31.280> time<00:03:31.480> but<00:03:32.480> in<00:03:33.350> my<00:03:33.410> van

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
for a short period of time but in my van

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000 
for a short period of time but in my van
my<00:03:35.000> choice<00:03:35.209> is<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.859> 10<00:03:36.859> LED<00:03:37.750> wedge<00:03:38.750> style<00:03:39.049> bulb

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
my choice is the 10 LED wedge style bulb

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.860 
my choice is the 10 LED wedge style bulb
replacement<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:41.060> I'll<00:03:41.180> put<00:03:41.359> links<00:03:41.540> at<00:03:41.840> the

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
replacement and I'll put links at the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.379 
replacement and I'll put links at the
bottom<00:03:41.989> just<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.950> point<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.060> towards

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
bottom just to point you towards

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.440 
bottom just to point you towards
whichever<00:03:44.870> bulb<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.410> would<00:03:45.560> want<00:03:46.420> but<00:03:47.420> just

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
whichever bulb you would want but just

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.849 
whichever bulb you would want but just
to<00:03:47.690> wrap<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:48.049> up<00:03:48.139> the<00:03:49.329> 5/5<00:03:50.329> LED<00:03:50.840> diode<00:03:52.060> bulb<00:03:53.060> is

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
to wrap it up the 5/5 LED diode bulb is

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.610 
to wrap it up the 5/5 LED diode bulb is
slightly<00:03:54.859> it's<00:03:55.579> not<00:03:55.850> quite<00:03:56.299> as<00:03:56.450> bright<00:03:56.690> it's<00:03:57.530> a

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
slightly it's not quite as bright it's a

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.349 
slightly it's not quite as bright it's a
little<00:03:57.950> bit<00:03:58.040> bluer<00:03:58.340> in<00:03:58.549> color<00:03:58.819> in<00:03:59.030> color

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
little bit bluer in color in color

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.990 
little bit bluer in color in color
temperature<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.519> 10<00:04:02.120> LED<00:04:03.190> bulb<00:04:04.190> diode

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
temperature and the 10 LED bulb diode

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.280 
temperature and the 10 LED bulb diode
bulb<00:04:05.269> is<00:04:06.170> a<00:04:06.230> little<00:04:06.620> bit<00:04:06.739> brighter<00:04:07.510> and<00:04:08.510> it's

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
bulb is a little bit brighter and it's

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.129 
bulb is a little bit brighter and it's
much<00:04:10.040> closer<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.609> the<00:04:10.730> color<00:04:10.880> white<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:11.720> would

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
much closer to the color white I would

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.330 
much closer to the color white I would
say<00:04:13.299> but<00:04:14.470> yeah<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:15.769> that's<00:04:15.920> just<00:04:15.980> my<00:04:16.220> opinion

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
say but yeah so that's just my opinion

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.120 
say but yeah so that's just my opinion
just<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.840> little<00:04:18.019> mini<00:04:18.169> product<00:04:18.500> review<00:04:18.769> so<00:04:18.830> far
