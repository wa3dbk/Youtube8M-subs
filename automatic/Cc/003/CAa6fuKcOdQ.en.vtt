 being rally is another very thing 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.450

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.380
 you have to put your favorite role 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.420
 then co-pilot once you have 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.860
 put these roles so you have to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.630
 be the copilot while your mi 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.250
 your friend will be the pilot 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.899
 by simply starting the business 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.610
 and once you guys started 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.799
 the activity will only be enough 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.990
 confirm all settings e 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.759
 then start the business 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.470
 in the lower right corner guys are down to 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.750
 right if there will be written that record 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.459
 world-wide is practically indescribable there 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.130
 wrote dash dash dot 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.049
 dash let's say and bottom right e 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.850
 glitch worked and so now you 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.769
 guys will just tell your 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.319
 friend where to go because as you know 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.549
 well being a rally race 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.499
 and your friend will not see the 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.260
 checkpoint so you have to indicate the 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:32.239
 you have to indicate let's say via voice chat 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.489
 or and via arrows so you have to 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.609
 put you and left arrow to the right e 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.590
 then drive it let's say and complete 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.659
 in short the boys race I tell you immediately 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.069
 to make the first few laps depends on how many 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.719
 you have set the advice to do 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.519
 the first few laps very slowly because of it 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.010
 to be able to earn you rp 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.659
 you have to practically beat every time 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.790
 your friend will have to beat every time 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.680
 the world record and therefore not 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.939
 having trouble breaking world records 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.069
 in the next rounds 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.599
 it's enough to do the first ones is always a lot 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.120
 slowly so you don't have problems 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.010
 then to beat world record and without 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.139
 problems in short and therefore every time 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.120
