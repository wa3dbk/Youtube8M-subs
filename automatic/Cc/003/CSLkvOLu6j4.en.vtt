Oh lyrically correct but besides all
that<00:01:35.490> that's<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:36.899> this<00:01:37.080> video<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.470> about

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
that that's not what this video is about

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.219 
that that's not what this video is about
it<00:01:38.850> will<00:01:39.030> only<00:01:39.149> make<00:01:39.330> sense<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.990> mix

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it will only make sense that if I mix

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.680 
it will only make sense that if I mix
music<00:01:40.649> why<00:01:41.100> wouldn't<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.520> mix<00:01:41.759> food

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
music why wouldn't I mix food

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.350 
music why wouldn't I mix food
so<00:01:43.190> anyways<00:01:44.190> I'm<00:01:44.490> back<00:01:45.030> when<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.240> was<00:01:45.300> a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
so anyways I'm back when I was a

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.210 
so anyways I'm back when I was a
teenager<00:01:45.690> I<00:01:45.840> had<00:01:45.990> idea<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:46.800> if<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> mix

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
teenager I had idea of what if you mix

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.560 
teenager I had idea of what if you mix
mayonnaise<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.759> syrup<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.060> thought<00:01:48.240> about<00:01:48.330> it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
mayonnaise and syrup I thought about it

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.469 
mayonnaise and syrup I thought about it
in<00:01:48.659> my<00:01:48.780> head<00:01:48.960> first<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:50.090> tried<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.270> in

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
in my head first and then I tried it in

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.330 
in my head first and then I tried it in
reality<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.800> tasted<00:01:53.100> pretty<00:01:53.130> good

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
reality and then it tasted pretty good

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.900 
reality and then it tasted pretty good
so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.789> figured<00:01:55.160> if<00:01:56.160> it<00:01:56.250> takes<00:01:56.460> get<00:01:56.580> on<00:01:56.670> my<00:01:56.759> head

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
so I figured if it takes get on my head

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.930 
so I figured if it takes get on my head
I<00:01:56.940> must<00:01:57.149> hiss<00:01:57.330> get<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.600> reality<00:01:58.050> so<00:01:58.850> recently<00:01:59.850> I

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
I must hiss get in reality so recently I

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.389 
I must hiss get in reality so recently I
got<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.360> idea<00:02:00.600> -<00:02:01.170> what<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.220> made<00:02:02.369> a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.710 
him that when I do try it I would film
it<00:02:31.560> just<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.489> they<00:02:32.610> could<00:02:32.760> see<00:02:32.970> if<00:02:33.450> it's

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
it just so that they could see if it's

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.120 
it just so that they could see if it's
good<00:02:33.930> or<00:02:33.959> not<00:02:34.049> cuz<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.500> haven't<00:02:34.799> tried<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.010> yet

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
good or not cuz I haven't tried it yet

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.670 
good or not cuz I haven't tried it yet
in<00:02:35.700> my<00:02:36.000> mind<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.540> think<00:02:36.600> it'll<00:02:36.930> taste<00:02:37.140> good<00:02:37.410> but

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
in my mind I think it'll taste good but

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.490 
in my mind I think it'll taste good but
in<00:02:37.950> reality<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.549> might<00:02:38.730> not<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:40.110> without

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
in reality it might not so without

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.590 
in reality it might not so without
further<00:02:40.709> ado<00:02:41.100> let's<00:02:41.579> get<00:02:42.030> into<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.420> video

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
further ado let's get into this video

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.259 
further ado let's get into this video
and<00:02:43.370> see<00:02:44.370> if<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.549> tastes<00:02:44.730> good<00:02:44.790> or<00:02:44.970> not<00:02:45.150> because

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
and see if it tastes good or not because

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.470 
and see if it tastes good or not because
I<00:02:45.630> guess<00:02:45.959> it's<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.200> reaction<00:02:46.620> video<00:02:46.739> but<00:02:47.480> it's
