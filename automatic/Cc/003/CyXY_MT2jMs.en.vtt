00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
possibilities and I figured that would

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.560 
possibilities and I figured that would
be<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.130> pretty<00:03:54.280> decent<00:03:54.790> topic<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.180> talk<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.480> you

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
be a pretty decent topic to talk to you

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.660
