00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
these pieces here on the mounting

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.320 
these pieces here on the mounting
bracket<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.550> let's<00:02:17.730> try<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.120> other

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
bracket so let's try it on the other

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.000 
bracket so let's try it on the other
side<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:20.310> match<00:02:20.610> up<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> peg<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.330> square

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
side so match up the peg in the square

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.960 
side so match up the peg in the square
put<00:02:23.010> your<00:02:23.160> thumb<00:02:23.310> at<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.550> back<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.810> pull<00:02:28.970> so

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
so as you can see you have a circle part

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.160 
so as you can see you have a circle part
here<00:02:38.220> with<00:02:38.400> two<00:02:38.550> long<00:02:38.790> legs<00:02:39.030> we<00:02:39.810> need<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.050> make

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
here with two long legs we need to make

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.810 
here with two long legs we need to make
sure<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.470> those<00:02:40.650> are<00:02:40.950> going<00:02:41.100> up<00:02:41.370> underneath
