centimeter<00:03:26.180> ski<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:27.350> think<00:03:27.739> this<00:03:27.830> is<00:03:27.890> an

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
centimeter ski I think this is an

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.160 
centimeter ski I think this is an
awesome<00:03:28.190> ski<00:03:28.640> especially<00:03:29.120> just<00:03:29.360> for<00:03:29.540> someone

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
awesome ski especially just for someone

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.530 
awesome ski especially just for someone
that<00:03:30.320> wants<00:03:30.739> ultimate<00:03:31.640> stability<00:03:31.820> and<00:03:32.269> crud

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
that wants ultimate stability and crud

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.080 
that wants ultimate stability and crud
and<00:03:32.810> just<00:03:33.320> something<00:03:33.830> that's<00:03:34.010> able<00:03:34.910> to

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
and just something that's able to

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.120 
and just something that's able to
demolish<00:03:35.510> everything<00:03:36.050> amount<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.560> condition

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
demolish everything amount and condition

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.759 
demolish everything amount and condition
for<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:38.180> lot<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.959> fun<00:03:39.110> too<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.320> despite<00:03:39.739> the

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
for it a lot of fun too and despite the

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.160 
for it a lot of fun too and despite the
fact<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:40.310> 120<00:03:40.910> millimeters<00:03:41.420> again<00:03:42.019> our

IQ<00:03:42.620> system<00:03:43.040> allows<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.790> ski<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.120> bend<00:03:44.299> really

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
IQ system allows the ski to bend really

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.240 
IQ system allows the ski to bend really
nicely<00:03:44.750> under<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.200> foot<00:03:45.440> which<00:03:45.920> is<00:03:46.040> going<00:03:46.190> to

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
nicely under the foot which is going to

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.920 
nicely under the foot which is going to
make<00:03:46.310> something<00:03:46.640> like<00:03:46.730> this<00:03:46.940> which<00:03:47.269> seems

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
make something like this which seems

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.160 
make something like this which seems
almost<00:03:48.799> intimidating<00:03:49.610> a<00:03:49.790> lot<00:03:50.510> easier<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:51.019> use

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
almost intimidating a lot easier to use

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.660 
almost intimidating a lot easier to use
than<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.470> think<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:51.799> would<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.220> got<00:03:52.459> power

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
than you think it would it's got power

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.370 
than you think it would it's got power
when<00:03:53.000> you<00:03:53.120> need<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.420> but<00:03:53.780> at<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:53.959> same<00:03:54.140> time

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
when you need it but at the same time

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.990 
when you need it but at the same time
it's<00:03:54.620> able<00:03:54.890> to<00:03:54.920> be<00:03:55.070> finessed<00:03:55.519> at<00:03:55.760> slower

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
it's able to be finessed at slower

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.360 
it's able to be finessed at slower
speeds<00:03:56.090> because<00:03:56.840> of<00:03:57.170> this<00:03:57.260> revolutionary<00:03:57.920> IQ

quiver<00:04:21.770> something<00:04:22.400> that's<00:04:22.550> able<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:23.150> you<00:04:23.630> know

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
quiver something that's able to you know

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.810

handle<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.200> crowd<00:04:24.470> and<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.830> bumps<00:04:25.220> but<00:04:25.640> all

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
handle the crowd and the bumps but all

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.760 
handle the crowd and the bumps but all
a<00:04:25.850> really<00:04:26.150> nice<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.540> fresh<00:04:26.780> snow<00:04:27.020> and<00:04:27.290> what<00:04:27.740> I

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
a really nice and fresh snow and what I

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.010 
a really nice and fresh snow and what I
think<00:04:27.950> is<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:29.030> most<00:04:29.420> versatile<00:04:29.870> feature

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
think is the the most versatile feature

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.920 
think is the the most versatile feature
about<00:04:30.350> this<00:04:30.590> if<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.670> fact<00:04:31.910> that<00:04:32.030> our<00:04:32.270> system

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
about this if the fact that our system

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.870 
about this if the fact that our system
on<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.200> ski<00:04:33.470> makes<00:04:34.190> something<00:04:34.430> like<00:04:34.700> this

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
on the ski makes something like this

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.730 
on the ski makes something like this
feel<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.210> lot<00:04:35.480> narrower<00:04:35.780> than<00:04:36.020> it<00:04:36.260> actually<00:04:36.440> is

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
feel a lot narrower than it actually is

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.280 
feel a lot narrower than it actually is
you<00:04:37.460> know<00:04:37.580> it's<00:04:37.880> 94<00:04:38.360> millimeters<00:04:38.840> underfoot

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
you know it's 94 millimeters underfoot

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.930 
you know it's 94 millimeters underfoot
but<00:04:39.530> this<00:04:39.980> is<00:04:40.160> becoming<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.640> new

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
but this is becoming the new

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.180 
but this is becoming the new
all-mountain<00:04:41.660> ski<00:04:42.140> that<00:04:42.500> this<00:04:42.710> waist<00:04:42.950> with

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
all-mountain ski that this waist with

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
something like this is going to blow you

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.140 
something like this is going to blow you
away<00:04:44.990> as<00:04:45.530> far<00:04:45.770> as<00:04:45.800> edge<00:04:46.040> grip<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.520> versatility
