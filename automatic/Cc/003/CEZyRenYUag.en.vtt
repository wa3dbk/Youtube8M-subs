now<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.350> already<00:00:34.829> pre-cut<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.120> because

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
now I already pre-cut this one because

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.660 
now I already pre-cut this one because
when<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.140> felt<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.500> package<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> felt<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
when I felt the package it felt like it

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.790 
when I felt the package it felt like it
was<00:00:38.760> really<00:00:39.210> close<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.260> edge<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.739> I

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
was really close to the edge and I

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.170 
was really close to the edge and I
didn't<00:00:41.010> want<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.160> damage<00:00:41.399> anything<00:00:41.910> by

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
didn't want to damage anything by

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.380 
didn't want to damage anything by
cutting<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> already<00:00:43.350> pre-cut<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.980> open

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
cutting it so I already pre-cut it open

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.340 
cutting it so I already pre-cut it open
but<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.450> didn't<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:45.809> make<00:00:45.989> much<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
but it didn't really make much of a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.100 
but it didn't really make much of a
difference<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.640> all<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.840> bubble

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
difference because it's all in a bubble

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.380 
difference because it's all in a bubble
map<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.070> bubble<00:00:50.309> wrap<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.850> there<00:00:51.270> is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
map in this bubble wrap and there is

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.529 
map in this bubble wrap and there is
nothing<00:00:51.750> else<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.350> envelope<00:00:53.480> now<00:00:54.480> she

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539
