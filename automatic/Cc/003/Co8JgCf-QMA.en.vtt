00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
welcome to this tutorial today that I'm

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.770 
welcome to this tutorial today that I'm
going<00:00:12.169> to<00:00:12.709> be<00:00:12.829> doing<00:00:13.039> with<00:00:13.309> you<00:00:13.549> on<00:00:13.789> fibrous

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
going to be doing with you on fibrous

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.950 
going to be doing with you on fibrous
joints<00:00:15.679> over<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.610> last<00:00:16.760> few<00:00:17.090> videos<00:00:17.240> we<00:00:17.510> have

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
joints over the last few videos we have

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.470 
joints over the last few videos we have
discussed<00:00:18.380> joints<00:00:18.980> and<00:00:19.190> taken<00:00:19.610> a<00:00:19.700> deeper<00:00:20.180> look

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
discussed joints and taken a deeper look

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.410 
discussed joints and taken a deeper look
into<00:00:20.540> synovial<00:00:21.350> joints<00:00:22.040> but<00:00:22.640> what<00:00:22.940> about<00:00:23.180> our

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
into synovial joints but what about our

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.350 
into synovial joints but what about our
fibrous<00:00:23.750> joints<00:00:24.560> well<00:00:25.340> fibrous<00:00:25.940> joints

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
fibrous joints well fibrous joints

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.090 
fibrous joints well fibrous joints
within<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:26.720> body<00:00:26.900> are<00:00:26.990> classified<00:00:27.800> by<00:00:28.070> a

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
within the body are classified by a

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.529 
within the body are classified by a
joint<00:00:28.610> that<00:00:28.850> is<00:00:29.060> created<00:00:29.840> by<00:00:30.020> fibrous<00:00:30.470> tissue

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
joint that is created by fibrous tissue

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.040 
joint that is created by fibrous tissue
namely<00:00:32.539> dense<00:00:33.140> connective<00:00:33.829> tissue<00:00:35.050> there

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
namely dense connective tissue there

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.830 
namely dense connective tissue there
will<00:00:36.170> also<00:00:36.440> be<00:00:36.710> no<00:00:37.400> cavity<00:00:37.970> like<00:00:38.360> we<00:00:38.570> see<00:00:38.810> with

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
will also be no cavity like we see with

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.650 
will also be no cavity like we see with
our<00:00:39.079> synovial<00:00:39.560> joints<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:41.150> movement

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
our synovial joints and the movement

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.069 
our synovial joints and the movement
allowed<00:00:42.170> by<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:42.650> type<00:00:42.890> of<00:00:43.070> joint<00:00:43.370> is<00:00:43.550> very

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
allowed by this type of joint is very

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.840 
allowed by this type of joint is very
limited<00:00:45.079> and<00:00:45.320> is<00:00:45.560> determined<00:00:46.340> by<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.489> length

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
limited and is determined by the length

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.600 
limited and is determined by the length
of<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.149> connective<00:00:47.660> tissue<00:00:47.870> fibers<00:00:48.489> so<00:00:49.489> we

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
of the connective tissue fibers so we

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.380 
of the connective tissue fibers so we
have<00:00:49.790> a<00:00:49.820> mixture<00:00:50.300> of<00:00:50.800> mpr<00:00:51.800> through<00:00:52.220> C's<00:00:52.550> being

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
have a mixture of mpr through C's being

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.620 
have a mixture of mpr through C's being
able<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.690> move<00:00:53.960> just<00:00:54.530> a<00:00:54.649> little<00:00:54.920> bit<00:00:55.070> and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
able to move just a little bit and

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.049 
able to move just a little bit and
synarthrosis<00:00:57.280> predominating<00:00:58.280> actually<00:00:58.850> and

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
synarthrosis predominating actually and

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.719 
synarthrosis predominating actually and
they<00:00:59.690> cannot<00:01:00.110> move<00:01:00.320> at<00:01:00.620> all<00:01:02.770> so<00:01:03.770> there<00:01:04.280> we<00:01:04.489> have

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
they cannot move at all so there we have

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.469 
they cannot move at all so there we have
our<00:01:04.820> mix<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.479> mpr<00:01:06.260> through<00:01:06.650> C's<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.370> sin<00:01:08.180> our

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
our mix of mpr through C's and sin our

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.969 
our mix of mpr through C's and sin our
three<00:01:08.750> C's<00:01:09.040> now<00:01:10.040> of<00:01:10.280> our<00:01:10.850> fibrous<00:01:11.510> joints<00:01:12.260> we

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
three C's now of our fibrous joints we

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.760 
three C's now of our fibrous joints we
can<00:01:13.159> divide<00:01:13.580> them<00:01:13.820> into<00:01:14.060> three<00:01:14.690> groups<00:01:14.930> and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
can divide them into three groups and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.219 
can divide them into three groups and
we're<00:01:16.610> going<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:17.030> divide<00:01:17.420> them<00:01:17.659> into<00:01:18.909> sutures

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
we're going to divide them into sutures

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.180 
we're going to divide them into sutures
which<00:01:21.229> we'll<00:01:21.440> find<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.010> skull<00:01:22.430> I

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
which we'll find in the skull I

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.580 
which we'll find in the skull I
syndesmosis<00:01:25.240> or<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:27.590> gum<00:01:28.400> Phocis<00:01:29.380> now<00:01:30.380> what

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
syndesmosis or a gum Phocis now what

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.830 
syndesmosis or a gum Phocis now what
we're<00:01:30.740> going<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:30.920> do<00:01:31.130> quickly<00:01:31.700> here<00:01:32.150> is<00:01:32.390> just

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
we're going to do quickly here is just

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.250 
we're going to do quickly here is just
briefly<00:01:33.380> describe<00:01:34.299> how<00:01:35.299> these<00:01:35.540> are<00:01:35.869> three

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
briefly describe how these are three

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.789 
briefly describe how these are three
types<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.710> fibrous<00:01:37.159> joints<00:01:37.580> differ<00:01:38.409> so<00:01:39.409> if<00:01:39.619> we

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
types of fibrous joints differ so if we

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.690 
types of fibrous joints differ so if we
start<00:01:40.130> with<00:01:40.250> our<00:01:40.369> sutures<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:42.369> first<00:01:43.369> thing

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
start with our sutures the first thing

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.210 
start with our sutures the first thing
we<00:01:43.909> will<00:01:44.060> note<00:01:44.330> is<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:44.869> they<00:01:45.020> are<00:01:45.200> only<00:01:45.409> found

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
we will note is that they are only found

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.109 
we will note is that they are only found
within<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.390> skull<00:01:47.689> and<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.860> term<00:01:49.189> our<00:01:49.490> suture

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
within the skull and the term our suture

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.270 
within the skull and the term our suture
refers<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:50.720> it<00:01:50.960> appearing<00:01:51.439> almost<00:01:51.680> like<00:01:52.250> a

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
refers to it appearing almost like a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.539 
refers to it appearing almost like a
seam<00:01:52.759> between<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.600> bones<00:01:53.869> they<00:01:54.799> consist<00:01:55.369> of

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
seam between the bones they consist of

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.060 
seam between the bones they consist of
only<00:01:55.939> very<00:01:56.390> very<00:01:56.479> short<00:01:57.110> connective<00:01:57.710> tissue

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
only very very short connective tissue

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.819 
only very very short connective tissue
fibers<00:01:58.180> that<00:01:59.180> connect<00:01:59.659> to<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.869> periosteum<00:02:00.350> of

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
fibers that connect to the periosteum of

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.700 
fibers that connect to the periosteum of
the<00:02:01.009> bones<00:02:01.329> now<00:02:02.329> these<00:02:02.570> sutures<00:02:02.869> allow<00:02:03.439> for

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
the bones now these sutures allow for

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.710 
the bones now these sutures allow for
there<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:03.829> be<00:02:03.979> bone<00:02:04.369> growth<00:02:04.670> within<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.240> skull

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
there to be bone growth within the skull

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.630 
there to be bone growth within the skull
at<00:02:05.990> an<00:02:06.200> early<00:02:06.530> age<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.100> we'll<00:02:07.759> just<00:02:08.000> show<00:02:08.329> here

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
at an early age and we'll just show here

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.220 
at an early age and we'll just show here
that<00:02:10.640> they're<00:02:11.060> almost<00:02:11.330> forming<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.989> scene

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
that they're almost forming a scene

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.190 
that they're almost forming a scene
between<00:02:12.440> those<00:02:12.800> bones<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> skull

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
between those bones of the skull

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.070 
between those bones of the skull
and<00:02:15.910> just<00:02:16.910> on<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.209> full<00:02:17.480> drawing<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.989> the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
and just on this full drawing of the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.729 
and just on this full drawing of the
skull<00:02:18.349> here<00:02:18.709> we<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:19.069> see<00:02:19.250> all<00:02:19.519> these<00:02:19.730> sutures

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
skull here we can see all these sutures

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.920 
skull here we can see all these sutures
now<00:02:21.739> later<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:22.760> life<00:02:23.090> these<00:02:23.599> searches

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
now later in life these searches

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.880 
now later in life these searches
actually<00:02:24.610> ossify<00:02:25.720> becoming<00:02:26.720> solid<00:02:27.290> bone<00:02:27.560> and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
actually ossify becoming solid bone and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.130 
actually ossify becoming solid bone and
at<00:02:28.459> this<00:02:28.670> point<00:02:29.030> they're<00:02:29.239> more<00:02:29.569> accurately

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
at this point they're more accurately

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.820 
at this point they're more accurately
known<00:02:30.500> as<00:02:30.739> sin<00:02:31.459> osto<00:02:32.180> sees<00:02:32.450> now<00:02:33.319> if<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.680> get

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
known as sin osto sees now if you get

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.040 
known as sin osto sees now if you get
confused<00:02:34.040> between<00:02:34.550> those<00:02:34.940> two<00:02:35.180> terms<00:02:35.450> just

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
confused between those two terms just

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.970 
confused between those two terms just
remember<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.530> Aust<00:02:36.860> or<00:02:37.340> osteo<00:02:38.239> means<00:02:38.980> bone

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
remember that Aust or osteo means bone

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.960 
remember that Aust or osteo means bone
