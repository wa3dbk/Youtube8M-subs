nichkhun guy today I wanted to talk to
you<00:00:08.990> about<00:00:09.549> resolution<00:00:10.549> and<00:00:10.759> how<00:00:10.969> it<00:00:11.030> relates

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:11.419 
you about resolution and how it relates

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.270 
you about resolution and how it relates
to<00:00:11.599> how<00:00:11.990> big<00:00:12.230> you<00:00:12.410> can<00:00:12.589> print<00:00:12.860> your<00:00:12.919> image

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
to how big you can print your image

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.619 
to how big you can print your image
there's<00:00:13.490> a<00:00:13.580> lot<00:00:13.700> of<00:00:13.820> people<00:00:14.059> wondering<00:00:14.509> about

how you can make a fantastic enormous
print<00:00:21.710> from<00:00:22.340> a<00:00:22.400> six<00:00:22.760> megapixel<00:00:23.390> camera<00:00:23.750> if<00:00:23.900> you

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
print from a six megapixel camera if you

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.180 
print from a six megapixel camera if you
do<00:00:24.200> it<00:00:24.290> the<00:00:24.380> right<00:00:24.560> way<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:24.890> then<00:00:25.040> other

do it the right way and then other
people<00:00:25.310> saying<00:00:25.760> you<00:00:26.210> know<00:00:26.330> even<00:00:26.690> a<00:00:26.810> d4<00:00:27.710> you<00:00:27.920> can

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
people saying you know even a d4 you can

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.520 
people saying you know even a d4 you can
only<00:00:28.220> printer<00:00:28.850> a<00:00:29.150> whatever<00:00:29.720> size<00:00:29.960> print<00:00:30.380> and

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
only printer a whatever size print and

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.619 
only printer a whatever size print and
it<00:00:30.650> sounds<00:00:30.950> quite<00:00:31.160> small<00:00:31.550> so<00:00:31.820> I<00:00:32.210> just<00:00:32.360> wanted

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
it sounds quite small so I just wanted

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.049 
it sounds quite small so I just wanted
to<00:00:32.719> run<00:00:32.899> through<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.530> clarify<00:00:34.489> a<00:00:34.519> couple<00:00:34.879> of

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
to run through and clarify a couple of

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.169 
to run through and clarify a couple of
misconceptions<00:00:35.899> here<00:00:36.140> so<00:00:36.769> the<00:00:37.190> gold<00:00:37.519> standard

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:38.179 
misconceptions here so the gold standard

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:39.910 
misconceptions here so the gold standard
and<00:00:38.210> your<00:00:38.570> number<00:00:39.019> you'll<00:00:39.140> often<00:00:39.350> hear<00:00:39.620> thrown

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
and your number you'll often hear thrown

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.419 
and your number you'll often hear thrown
around<00:00:40.070> is<00:00:40.399> 300<00:00:41.329> dpi<00:00:41.719> you<00:00:41.839> need<00:00:42.170> 300<00:00:42.739> dpi<00:00:43.070> for

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:43.429 
around is 300 dpi you need 300 dpi for

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:45.549 
around is 300 dpi you need 300 dpi for
printing<00:00:43.850> now<00:00:44.420> depending<00:00:44.929> on<00:00:44.989> which<00:00:45.170> printer

you use the standard is 300 or 240 dpi

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.660 
you use the standard is 300 or 240 dpi
actually<00:00:50.300> but<00:00:50.839> that<00:00:51.050> rule<00:00:51.589> comes<00:00:51.980> from<00:00:52.339> the

it<00:01:05.570> looks<00:01:06.110> like<00:01:06.320> it's<00:01:06.939> continuous<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.210> that

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
it looks like it's continuous and that

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.420 
it looks like it's continuous and that
there's<00:01:08.509> no<00:01:08.719> gaps<00:01:09.020> in<00:01:09.259> it<00:01:09.439> it's<00:01:09.829> like<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.310> know

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
there's no gaps in it it's like you know

there's no gaps in it it's like you know
I<00:01:10.460> can't<00:01:11.299> see<00:01:11.540> below<00:01:12.469> 24<00:01:13.130> frames<00:01:13.460> per<00:01:13.579> second

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
I can't see below 24 frames per second

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.850 
I can't see below 24 frames per second
or<00:01:14.180> whatever<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:14.600> they<00:01:14.689> show<00:01:14.869> TV<00:01:15.140> at<00:01:15.439> that<00:01:15.619> rate

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
or whatever so they show TV at that rate

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.639 
or whatever so they show TV at that rate
or<00:01:16.009> faster<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.670> every<00:01:17.240> still<00:01:18.049> moving<00:01:18.530> that

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
or faster and every still moving that

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:19.090 
or faster and every still moving that
fast

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
fast

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.800 
fast
looks<00:01:19.250> like<00:01:19.430> continuous<00:01:20.000> motion<00:01:20.270> it's<00:01:20.570> kind

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
looks like continuous motion it's kind

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.499 
looks like continuous motion it's kind
of<00:01:20.930> that<00:01:21.079> theory<00:01:21.409> but<00:01:21.590> there<00:01:22.549> is<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:23.060> ratio

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
of that theory but there is a ratio

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.670 
of that theory but there is a ratio
involved<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:24.649> if<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.430> get<00:01:25.759> in<00:01:26.299> foot<00:01:26.719> away<00:01:26.840> then

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
involved so if you get in foot away then

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.800 
involved so if you get in foot away then
the<00:01:27.979> amount<00:01:28.310> of<00:01:28.520> information<00:01:28.969> that<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.539> need

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
the amount of information that you need

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.260 
the amount of information that you need
or<00:01:30.049> how<00:01:30.259> big<00:01:30.590> or<00:01:30.890> small<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.579> dots<00:01:31.789> have<00:01:31.969> to<00:01:32.149> be

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
or how big or small the dots have to be

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.200 
or how big or small the dots have to be
so<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.600> they<00:01:32.719> seem<00:01:32.960> completely<00:01:33.350> continuous

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
so that they seem completely continuous

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.340 
so that they seem completely continuous
changes<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.509> further<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:35.960> further<00:01:36.079> and

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
changes and the further and further and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.840 
changes and the further and further and
further<00:01:36.409> away<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:36.950> get<00:01:37.219> away<00:01:37.340> from<00:01:37.490> things

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
further away you get away from things

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.270 
further away you get away from things
the<00:01:38.359> amount<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.659> resolution<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.530> need<00:01:39.799> in

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
the amount of resolution you need in

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.060 
the amount of resolution you need in
terms<00:01:40.850> of<00:01:41.119> how<00:01:41.390> high-quality<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.500> files<00:01:42.770> need

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
terms of how high-quality the files need

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.130 
terms of how high-quality the files need
to<00:01:43.100> be<00:01:43.250> how<00:01:43.579> many<00:01:43.789> dots<00:01:44.030> per<00:01:44.329> inch<00:01:44.359> you<00:01:44.750> need<00:01:45.020> to

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
to be how many dots per inch you need to

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.459 
to be how many dots per inch you need to
be<00:01:45.289> supplying<00:01:46.179> drops<00:01:47.179> dramatically<00:01:47.810> for

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
be supplying drops dramatically for

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.319 
be supplying drops dramatically for
example<00:01:49.009> if<00:01:49.250> you're<00:01:49.429> shooting<00:01:50.060> for<00:01:50.270> a

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
example if you're shooting for a

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.849 
example if you're shooting for a
billboard<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:51.170> it's<00:01:51.320> only<00:01:51.469> going<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.799> be

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859

something like that away or even more

something like that away or even more
you<00:01:58.009> realistically<00:01:58.789> could<00:01:59.149> get<00:01:59.299> away

crazy like that have you ever seen one

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.230

of<00:02:06.049> those<00:02:06.200> art<00:02:06.590> books<00:02:06.950> where<00:02:07.579> it's<00:02:07.880> just<00:02:08.060> a

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
of those art books where it's just a

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.880 
of those art books where it's just a
series<00:02:08.600> of<00:02:08.630> lots<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.080> dots<00:02:09.319> but<00:02:09.560> then<00:02:09.679> when<00:02:09.800> you

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
series of lots of dots but then when you

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.619 
series of lots of dots but then when you
hold<00:02:10.039> it<00:02:10.220> far<00:02:10.429> enough<00:02:10.519> away<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:11.239> see<00:02:11.599> that

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
hold it far enough away you see that

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.210 
hold it far enough away you see that
there's<00:02:11.930> actually<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.290> picture<00:02:12.530> there<00:02:12.860> but<00:02:13.069> up

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
there's actually a picture there but up

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.920 
there's actually a picture there but up
close<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.640> can't<00:02:13.849> see<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.150> well<00:02:14.690> it's

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
close you can't see it well it's

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.349 
close you can't see it well it's
bit<00:02:15.049> like<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.290> if<00:02:15.829> something's<00:02:16.219> way<00:02:16.670> way<00:02:17.150> way

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:17.359 
bit like that if something's way way way

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.259 
bit like that if something's way way way
way<00:02:17.390> away<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:18.680> can<00:02:18.829> be<00:02:18.980> super<00:02:19.250> low<00:02:19.549> resolution

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
way away you can be super low resolution

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.030 
way away you can be super low resolution
but<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.629> just<00:02:20.930> can't<00:02:21.170> distinguish<00:02:21.769> that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
but you just can't distinguish that

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.039 
but you just can't distinguish that
detail<00:02:22.489> for<00:02:23.209> example<00:02:23.599> I<00:02:23.780> shot<00:02:24.319> last<00:02:25.189> year<00:02:25.579> a

suggest look at the image at a hundred

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
people often say is that you know

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.710 
people often say is that you know
doubling<00:03:43.250> your<00:03:43.370> resolution<00:03:43.970> double<00:03:44.329> doesn't

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
double your print size that's actually

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:48.999 
double your print size that's actually
not<00:03:47.780> true<00:03:48.019> it's<00:03:48.409> because<00:03:48.769> there's<00:03:48.949> a

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:49.009 
not true it's because there's a

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.979 
not true it's because there's a
misconception<00:03:49.579> about<00:03:49.849> what<00:03:50.209> doubling<00:03:50.750> print

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
misconception about what doubling print

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.259 
misconception about what doubling print
size<00:03:51.199> is<00:03:51.530> for<00:03:52.009> example<00:03:52.159> if<00:03:52.519> you<00:03:52.790> want<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.060> print

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
size is for example if you want to print

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.319 
size is for example if you want to print
at<00:03:53.479> 300<00:03:54.079> dpi<00:03:54.229> and<00:03:54.889> say<00:03:55.669> your<00:03:55.909> cameras

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
at 300 dpi and say your cameras

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.240 
at 300 dpi and say your cameras
resolution<00:03:56.900> just<00:03:57.199> to<00:03:57.290> make<00:03:57.409> it<00:03:57.560> super<00:03:57.769> easy<00:03:58.040> I

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.939 
resolution just to make it super easy I
know<00:03:58.400> no<00:03:58.639> camera<00:03:58.970> has<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.409> dimensions<00:04:00.409> but

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949 
know no camera has this dimensions but

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.429 
know no camera has this dimensions but
say<00:04:01.189> your<00:04:01.579> sensor<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.030> six<00:04:02.509> thousand<00:04:03.019> by<00:04:03.139> three

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 
say your sensor is six thousand by three

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.479 
say your sensor is six thousand by three
thousand<00:04:03.979> so<00:04:04.430> it's<00:04:04.639> a<00:04:04.790> panorama<00:04:05.359> type<00:04:05.689> setup

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
thousand so it's a panorama type setup

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.849 
thousand so it's a panorama type setup
so<00:04:07.489> it's<00:04:07.609> an<00:04:07.699> 18<00:04:08.030> megapixel<00:04:08.659> camera<00:04:09.079> then<00:04:09.590> at

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
so it's an 18 megapixel camera then at

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.429 
so it's an 18 megapixel camera then at
six<00:04:10.280> thousand<00:04:10.790> divided<00:04:11.030> by<00:04:11.209> 300<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:12.139> can<00:04:12.290> get

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 
six thousand divided by 300 you can get

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.619 
six thousand divided by 300 you can get
20<00:04:12.829> inches<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.430> at<00:04:13.669> three<00:04:13.879> thousand<00:04:14.359> divided

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
20 inches and at three thousand divided

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.020 
20 inches and at three thousand divided
by<00:04:14.959> 300<00:04:15.829> you<00:04:15.919> can<00:04:16.070> get<00:04:16.220> 10<00:04:16.430> inches<00:04:16.609> so<00:04:16.880> it'll

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
by 300 you can get 10 inches so it'll

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.080 
by 300 you can get 10 inches so it'll
make<00:04:17.150> a<00:04:17.209> 10<00:04:17.509> by<00:04:17.690> 20<00:04:18.049> image<00:04:18.289> perfectly<00:04:19.159> now

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
make a 10 by 20 image perfectly now

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.510 
make a 10 by 20 image perfectly now
people<00:04:20.840> say<00:04:21.019> ok<00:04:21.470> but<00:04:21.739> then<00:04:21.919> if<00:04:22.039> you<00:04:22.159> double<00:04:22.460> it

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
people say ok but then if you double it

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.820 
people say ok but then if you double it
to<00:04:22.639> a<00:04:22.699> 36<00:04:23.180> megapixel<00:04:23.990> image<00:04:24.229> that<00:04:24.469> won't<00:04:24.680> let

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
to a 36 megapixel image that won't let

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.830 
to a 36 megapixel image that won't let

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
you make a double size print it won't

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.220 
you make a double size print it won't
let<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.229> make<00:04:27.469> a

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
let you make a

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.900 
let you make a

make a 40 by 20 no it won't but that

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.940 
make a 40 by 20 no it won't but that
isn't<00:04:33.390> doubling<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.080> size<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.500> your<00:04:34.650> print

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970

by 20 just think about the surface area

so<00:05:09.270> you<00:05:09.960> know<00:05:10.050> just<00:05:10.350> think<00:05:10.500> about<00:05:10.710> if<00:05:10.830> you're

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
so you know just think about if you're

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.680

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
to be giving you six columns by 10

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.000 
to be giving you six columns by 10
centimeters<00:05:20.970> that's<00:05:21.240> four<00:05:21.540> times<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:22.020> ad<00:05:22.260> so

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
centimeters that's four times the ad so

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.590 
centimeters that's four times the ad so
yes<00:05:23.250> if<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:23.610> want<00:05:23.790> to<00:05:23.910> double<00:05:24.150> both

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
yes if you want to double both

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.080 
yes if you want to double both
parameters<00:05:24.930> then<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:25.920> need<00:05:26.070> to<00:05:26.220> quadruple

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
parameters then you need to quadruple

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.750 
parameters then you need to quadruple
your<00:05:27.350> resolution<00:05:28.350> so<00:05:28.560> going<00:05:28.890> from<00:05:29.100> a<00:05:29.220> 10

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
your resolution so going from a 10

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.300 
your resolution so going from a 10
megapixel<00:05:30.390> or<00:05:30.540> 40<00:05:30.960> megapixel<00:05:31.650> will<00:05:32.040> allow

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
megapixel or 40 megapixel will allow

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.930 
megapixel or 40 megapixel will allow
that<00:05:32.670> doubling<00:05:33.360> on<00:05:33.570> each<00:05:33.960> axis<00:05:34.680> but<00:05:35.220> to<00:05:35.550> double

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
that doubling on each axis but to double

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.870 
that doubling on each axis but to double
the<00:05:36.210> size<00:05:36.420> of<00:05:36.570> a<00:05:36.630> print<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.170> it<00:05:37.560> is<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:38.460> actual

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
the size of a print and it is the actual

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.910 
the size of a print and it is the actual
doubling<00:05:39.420> it's<00:05:39.630> doubling<00:05:40.140> your<00:05:40.320> surface<00:05:40.740> area

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
doubling it's doubling your surface area

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.100 
doubling it's doubling your surface area
the<00:05:41.550> frame<00:05:41.820> you<00:05:41.970> need<00:05:42.120> to<00:05:42.300> get<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.690> how

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
the frame you need to get the how

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.660 
the frame you need to get the how
imposing<00:05:43.710> it's<00:05:43.830> going<00:05:44.040> to<00:05:44.100> be<00:05:44.190> in<00:05:44.340> your<00:05:44.430> home

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
imposing it's going to be in your home

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.720 
imposing it's going to be in your home
is<00:05:44.970> getting<00:05:45.720> significantly<00:05:46.590> bigger<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.190> yes

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
is getting significantly bigger and yes

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.680 
is getting significantly bigger and yes
the<00:05:48.090> difference<00:05:48.270> between<00:05:48.660> a<00:05:49.110> 20<00:05:50.100> by<00:05:50.310> 20<00:05:50.630> or<00:05:51.630> a

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
the difference between a 20 by 20 or a

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.630 
the difference between a 20 by 20 or a
28<00:05:52.410> by<00:05:52.770> 28<00:05:52.830> is<00:05:54.680> significantly<00:05:55.680> bigger<00:05:55.980> you

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
28 by 28 is significantly bigger you

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.170 
28 by 28 is significantly bigger you
don't<00:05:56.880> need<00:05:57.120> to<00:05:57.330> double<00:05:57.780> on<00:05:57.960> both<00:05:58.170> axes<00:05:58.710> that's

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
don't need to double on both axes that's

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.000 
don't need to double on both axes that's
quadrupling<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.510> it's<00:06:00.870> a<00:06:01.170> huge<00:06:01.530> difference

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
quadrupling and it's a huge difference

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.670 
quadrupling and it's a huge difference
so<00:06:02.220> I<00:06:02.670> hope<00:06:03.120> that's<00:06:03.330> clear<00:06:03.540> for<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:04.050> but<00:06:04.530> that

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
so I hope that's clear for you but that

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.160 
so I hope that's clear for you but that

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
hung on the wall so people if it's a

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.130

to get up right close and check out the

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.000 
to get up right close and check out the

works going to be looked at that way I
personally<00:06:40.260> would<00:06:40.650> recommend<00:06:40.800> that<00:06:41.220> you<00:06:41.340> go

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669 
personally would recommend that you go

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.659 
personally would recommend that you go
240<00:06:42.210> dpi<00:06:42.389> or<00:06:42.840> above<00:06:43.169> if<00:06:43.590> you<00:06:43.650> can<00:06:43.860> get<00:06:43.979> to<00:06:44.099> 300

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
240 dpi or above if you can get to 300

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:46.339 
240 dpi or above if you can get to 300
great<00:06:44.909> but<00:06:45.509> don't<00:06:45.749> feel<00:06:45.960> bad<00:06:45.990> about

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
great but don't feel bad about

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:48.529 
great but don't feel bad about
interpolating<00:06:47.159> in<00:06:47.400> software<00:06:47.819> if<00:06:48.120> you've<00:06:48.360> got

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 
interpolating in software if you've got

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:50.540 
interpolating in software if you've got
a<00:06:48.569> nice<00:06:48.840> sharp<00:06:49.259> image<00:06:49.590> to<00:06:49.800> start<00:06:50.069> with<00:06:50.310> and

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
a nice sharp image to start with and

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.399 
a nice sharp image to start with and
another<00:06:50.969> little<00:06:51.240> tip<00:06:51.419> for<00:06:51.659> you<00:06:51.719> I've<00:06:52.139> done

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:52.409 
another little tip for you I've done

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:54.950 
another little tip for you I've done
some<00:06:52.680> test<00:06:52.949> myself<00:06:53.189> where<00:06:54.120> I've<00:06:54.509> looked<00:06:54.810> at

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
some test myself where I've looked at

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.100 
some test myself where I've looked at
doing<00:06:55.800> incremental<00:06:56.479> increases<00:06:57.479> by

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
doing incremental increases by

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.070 
doing incremental increases by
interpolation<00:06:58.590> or<00:06:59.099> doing<00:06:59.729> one<00:06:59.969> huge<00:07:00.479> jump<00:07:00.840> so

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
interpolation or doing one huge jump so

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.089 
interpolation or doing one huge jump so
say<00:07:01.289> going<00:07:01.590> from<00:07:01.889> a<00:07:02.159> 10<00:07:02.729> by<00:07:02.939> 10<00:07:02.969> to<00:07:03.599> 20<00:07:04.439> by<00:07:04.590> 20<00:07:04.949> so

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:05.099 
say going from a 10 by 10 to 20 by 20 so

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:07.129

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
10 percent to get to my final size or

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.489 
10 percent to get to my final size or
just<00:07:11.639> doing<00:07:11.789> it<00:07:11.969> all<00:07:12.120> in<00:07:12.300> one<00:07:12.479> go<00:07:12.539> in<00:07:12.930> Photoshop

00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:13.499 
just doing it all in one go in Photoshop

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:15.679 
just doing it all in one go in Photoshop
and<00:07:13.650> I<00:07:14.400> really<00:07:14.759> can't<00:07:15.000> see<00:07:15.180> a<00:07:15.210> difference

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:15.689 
and I really can't see a difference

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:17.839 
and I really can't see a difference
doing<00:07:15.960> it<00:07:16.169> in<00:07:16.319> one<00:07:16.500> step<00:07:16.889> to<00:07:17.099> doing<00:07:17.490> it<00:07:17.610> in<00:07:17.699> all

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:17.849 
doing it in one step to doing it in all

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:20.149 
doing it in one step to doing it in all
of<00:07:18.000> the<00:07:18.270> steps<00:07:18.539> so<00:07:18.779> I<00:07:19.110> personally<00:07:19.529> just<00:07:19.949> do<00:07:20.039> it

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:20.159 
of the steps so I personally just do it

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:21.890 
of the steps so I personally just do it
in<00:07:20.279> one<00:07:20.310> step<00:07:20.759> these<00:07:20.969> days<00:07:21.240> even<00:07:21.569> if<00:07:21.750> you've

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 
in one step these days even if you've

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.959 
in one step these days even if you've
set<00:07:22.080> up<00:07:22.139> a<00:07:22.319> macro<00:07:22.740> it<00:07:22.800> saves<00:07:23.069> a<00:07:23.219> lot<00:07:23.250> of<00:07:23.490> time<00:07:23.699> to

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:23.969 
set up a macro it saves a lot of time to

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:27.050 
set up a macro it saves a lot of time to
do<00:07:24.090> it<00:07:24.270> in<00:07:24.479> the<00:07:24.659> one<00:07:24.870> step<00:07:25.400> so<00:07:26.400> I<00:07:26.639> hope<00:07:26.849> that's

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 
do it in the one step so I hope that's

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.550 
do it in the one step so I hope that's
