large<00:01:07.780> range<00:01:08.259> level<00:01:08.800> five<00:01:09.009> you<00:01:09.880> can<00:01:10.149> do<00:01:10.420> the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
large range level five you can do the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.260 
large range level five you can do the
lrm<00:01:11.229> 10<00:01:11.440> range<00:01:11.860> it<00:01:12.789> adds<00:01:12.970> an<00:01:13.149> additional

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
lrm 10 range it adds an additional

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.889 
lrm 10 range it adds an additional
hundred<00:01:13.720> meters<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:14.860> effective<00:01:15.899> alarm

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
hundred meters to the effective alarm

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.350 
hundred meters to the effective alarm
range<00:01:17.229> but<00:01:17.649> for<00:01:18.220> this<00:01:18.340> demo<00:01:18.670> I<00:01:18.849> left<00:01:19.149> that<00:01:19.300> out

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
range but for this demo I left that out

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.300 
range but for this demo I left that out
so<00:01:20.080> let's<00:01:20.229> go<00:01:20.380> jump<00:01:20.709> in<00:01:20.800> here<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.039> show<00:01:21.220> you

so let's go jump in here and show you

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.919 
so let's go jump in here and show you
this<00:01:21.429> thing<00:01:21.610> in<00:01:21.729> action<00:01:21.789> alright<00:01:22.479> guys<00:01:22.690> so

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
this thing in action alright guys so

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.050 
this thing in action alright guys so
here<00:01:23.110> we<00:01:23.229> are<00:01:23.380> with<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.709> Hunchback<00:01:24.099> for<00:01:24.490> J<00:01:24.819> in

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
here we are with the Hunchback for J in

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.449 
here we are with the Hunchback for J in
game<00:01:25.569> let's<00:01:26.319> go<00:01:26.470> take<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.860> look<00:01:26.979> at<00:01:27.369> a<00:01:27.399> few

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:27.459 
game let's go take a look at a few

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:29.550 
game let's go take a look at a few
things<00:01:27.940> again<00:01:28.270> I've<00:01:28.390> got<00:01:28.569> the<00:01:28.690> ER<00:01:28.929> large<00:01:29.229> laser

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
things again I've got the ER large laser

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.109 
things again I've got the ER large laser
here<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:29.979> can<00:01:30.099> see<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.429> effective<00:01:30.759> range<00:01:30.940> is

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
here you can see the effective range is

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.100 
here you can see the effective range is
7<00:01:31.509> 43<00:01:31.869> meters<00:01:32.259> let's<00:01:33.069> go<00:01:33.190> do<00:01:33.399> a<00:01:33.429> quick<00:01:33.910> test<00:01:34.599> of

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
7 43 meters let's go do a quick test of

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.139 
7 43 meters let's go do a quick test of
the<00:01:35.200> cool<00:01:35.380> down<00:01:35.590> here<00:01:35.800> pull<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:36.670> trigger<00:01:36.880> as

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
the cool down here pull the trigger as

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.050 
the cool down here pull the trigger as
you<00:01:37.360> can<00:01:37.479> see<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:38.050> little<00:01:38.560> bit<00:01:38.770> quicker<00:01:39.060> cool

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
you can see a little bit quicker cool

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.850 
you can see a little bit quicker cool
down<00:01:40.270> there<00:01:40.509> for<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.750> ER<00:01:40.959> large<00:01:41.200> we're<00:01:41.770> on

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
down there for the ER large we're on

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.380 
down there for the ER large we're on
Alpine<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.640> can<00:01:42.789> see<00:01:42.940> it<00:01:43.060> doesn't<00:01:43.209> really

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
Alpine you can see it doesn't really

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.320 
Alpine you can see it doesn't really
affect<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.780> heat<00:01:44.050> at<00:01:44.349> all<00:01:44.819> and<00:01:45.819> just<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.179> prove

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
affect the heat at all and just to prove

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.120 
affect the heat at all and just to prove
that<00:01:46.450> there<00:01:46.869> is<00:01:46.989> heat<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.349> here<00:01:47.619> you<00:01:47.770> can<00:01:47.890> see

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
that there is heat on here you can see

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.460 
that there is heat on here you can see
once<00:01:48.729> i<00:01:48.849> start<00:01:49.119> firing<00:01:49.720> both<00:01:49.929> these<00:01:50.080> weapons

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
once i start firing both these weapons

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.589 
once i start firing both these weapons
systems<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:51.039> three<00:01:51.250> meads<00:01:51.459> it<00:01:52.090> starts<00:01:52.479> to

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
systems the three meads it starts to

alright as you can see engage in the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.570 
alright as you can see engage in the
target<00:02:09.720> fast<00:02:10.050> fire<00:02:10.320> right<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.890> lrm<00:02:11.280> tens

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
target fast fire right on the lrm tens

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.240 
target fast fire right on the lrm tens
here<00:02:12.350> when<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.440> use<00:02:13.560> my<00:02:13.740> speed<00:02:14.070> and

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
here when you use my speed and

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.020 
here when you use my speed and
maneuverability<00:02:15.030> here<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:16.790> outmaneuver<00:02:17.790> this

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
maneuverability here to outmaneuver this

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.660 
maneuverability here to outmaneuver this
Atlas<00:02:18.810> with<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:19.830> particular<00:02:19.980> setup<00:02:20.460> i'm

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
Atlas with this particular setup i'm

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.530 
Atlas with this particular setup i'm
going<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.910> shield<00:02:21.240> with<00:02:21.420> my<00:02:21.570> left<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:23.480> try<00:02:24.480> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
going to shield with my left and try to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.420 
going to shield with my left and try to
force<00:02:24.900> him<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.410> my<00:02:25.560> left<00:02:25.740> side<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.280> i'm<00:02:26.400> just

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
force him to my left side so i'm just

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:43.040 
force him to my left side so i'm just
going<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.700> go<00:02:26.820> ahead<00:02:26.880> maneuver<00:02:27.330> here

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050

the<00:02:57.880> high<00:02:58.090> fire<00:02:58.390> rate<00:02:58.600> allows<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.140> to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
the high fire rate allows you to

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.200 
the high fire rate allows you to

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
maximize your time while on target can

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.590 
maximize your time while on target can
