00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
top of the other stanchion this fork has

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.500 
top of the other stanchion this fork has
a<00:00:40.500> 15<00:00:41.040> millimeter<00:00:41.340> quick-release<00:00:42.030> through

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
a 15 millimeter quick-release through

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.590 
a 15 millimeter quick-release through
axle<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.190> make<00:00:44.370> sure<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.760> front<00:00:45.059> wheel<00:00:45.270> is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
axle so make sure your front wheel is

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.490 
axle so make sure your front wheel is
compatible<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:48.110> and<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.200> gives<00:00:49.350> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
compatible with that and that gives it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.830 
compatible with that and that gives it
added<00:00:49.649> stability<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.460> strength<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
added stability and strength on the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.029 
added stability and strength on the
trail<00:00:52.129> it<00:00:53.129> also<00:00:53.309> has<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.780> 1.5<00:00:54.780> inch<00:00:55.199> steer<00:00:55.739> too

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
trail it also has a 1.5 inch steer too

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.950 
trail it also has a 1.5 inch steer too
so<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.640> isn't<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> standard<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.600> 1/8

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so this isn't the standard one and 1/8

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.840 
so this isn't the standard one and 1/8
it<00:00:58.949> has<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> post<00:00:59.520> disc<00:01:00.239> brake<00:01:00.539> mount<00:01:01.670> which<00:01:02.670> is

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
it has a post disc brake mount which is

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.990 
it has a post disc brake mount which is
the<00:01:03.329> standard<00:01:03.809> width<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.199> most<00:01:04.409> Forks<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:05.850> has

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the standard width on most Forks it has

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.140 
the standard width on most Forks it has
32<00:01:06.390> millimeter<00:01:07.049> diameter<00:01:07.290> hard<00:01:07.979> anodized<00:01:08.520> 70

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
32 millimeter diameter hard anodized 70
