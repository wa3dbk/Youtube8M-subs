00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
base layout that I was using when I was

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.760 
base layout that I was using when I was
trying<00:00:17.939> to<00:00:18.029> go<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.360> that<00:00:18.570> Christmas<00:00:19.170> tree<00:00:19.650> in

but<00:02:07.800> overall<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:09.539> I've<00:02:09.840> lost<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.649> bunch

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
but overall this one I've lost a bunch

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.130 
but overall this one I've lost a bunch

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
of torque elixir from this one mainly

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.660 
of torque elixir from this one mainly

because the dark elixir you'll see in a

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.740 
because the dark elixir you'll see in a
little<00:02:14.790> bit<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.209> it's<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.450> little<00:02:15.480> bit

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
little bit that it's a little bit

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.570 
little bit that it's a little bit
exposed<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.830> there<00:02:16.950> are<00:02:17.040> times<00:02:17.220> where<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.400> lost
