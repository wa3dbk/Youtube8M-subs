00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.630
 the strong and treacherous waters of the river 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.490
 bravo claimed the life of a victim 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.890
 more authorities of new laredo 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.170
 pointed out that it appears to be a 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.180
 American center that was looking for 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.419
 to cross illegally to the states 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.730
 united- but drowned in the attempt not 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.800
 they reported this person and well 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.739
 you already saw that they have several days of 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.790
 decomposition what is the body and 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.940
 well, this person was 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.520
 totally dressed, they did not see each other 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.199
 I observed some injuries or some damage 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.420
 of consideration , however, because 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.430
 unfortunately I already had several days of 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.129
 who had died for good with this 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.800
 reaches number 32 so far this 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.160
 victim could not be identified to the 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.870
 like many others who have died 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.839
 drowned in the also called river 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.980
 big about 30 and 35 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:08.140
 years a male person 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.390
 apparently dressed of features 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.580
 Central Americans and well, those are 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.650
 the data that we have we do not have the 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.140
 his name did not bring any 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.270
 and identification to be able to know 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.920
 where it was exactly without even though the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.510
 security that there is throughout the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.870
 border by the patrol 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.420
 border which they have reinforced still 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.400
 can observe the banks of the river 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.950
 migrants who try to challenge the 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.070
 dangers because of the need in their 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.650
 countries we have here because 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.530
 nothing of work 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.830
 good and without work 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.530
 so 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.220
 why this 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.409
 we come here to see that if 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.719
 get work for her 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.539
 before this situation of elements of the 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.819
 aquatic fire rescue equipment 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.250

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.710
 months have saved his life 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.569
 ten migrants who were about to 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.880
 drowned we will be 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.709
 intensifying these operations further to 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.989
 prevent people from trying 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.330
 cross it under the risks that 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.769
 involves crossing the wild river and then 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.040
 well let's be very expectant 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.720

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.769
