00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
you can also put it higher so that if

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.600 
you can also put it higher so that if
you<00:03:00.020> need<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.290> do<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.440> need<00:03:00.530> also<00:03:01.010> higher<00:03:01.310> during

the day you Cather the Athens Italy at

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.600 
the day you Cather the Athens Italy at
the<00:03:04.100> side<00:03:05.530> you're<00:03:06.530> tuned<00:03:06.800> have<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.130> zipper<00:03:07.580> on

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
the side you're tuned have the zipper on

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.000 
the side you're tuned have the zipper on
the<00:03:07.910> side<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.840> you're<00:03:08.990> able<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.350> have<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.770> tube

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
the side so you're able to have the tube

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.190 
the side so you're able to have the tube
come<00:03:10.820> out<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.060> side<00:03:11.300> as<00:03:11.540> opposed<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.960> down

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
come out the side as opposed to down

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.140 
come out the side as opposed to down
your<00:03:12.440> leg<00:03:12.590> which<00:03:12.860> it's<00:03:13.610> not<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:13.940> attractive

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
your leg which it's not that attractive

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.900 
your leg which it's not that attractive
in<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:14.720> skirt<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:16.010> skirt<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:18.260> cut<00:03:18.910> high-waisted

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
in a skirt the skirt is cut high-waisted

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.730 
in a skirt the skirt is cut high-waisted
so<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:20.450> have<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.020> height<00:03:21.260> in<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.560> back

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
so you have that height in the back

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.060 
so you have that height in the back
while<00:03:22.070> you're<00:03:22.250> sitting<00:03:22.610> and<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:24.500> fabric<00:03:24.950> is

while you're sitting and that fabric is

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.860 
while you're sitting and that fabric is
very<00:03:25.460> stretchy<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.390> it's<00:03:26.660> very<00:03:26.930> comfortable

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
very stretchy so it's very comfortable

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.600 
very stretchy so it's very comfortable
so<00:03:29.870> here<00:03:30.080> we<00:03:30.200> have<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.530> classic<00:03:30.890> trench<00:03:31.340> coat

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610

so here we have the classic trench coat
it's<00:03:32.120> made<00:03:32.510> from<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:32.930> water<00:03:33.170> repellant<00:03:33.740> fabric

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
it's made from a water repellant fabric

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.800 
it's made from a water repellant fabric
the<00:03:35.660> back<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:37.070> cut<00:03:37.760> shorter<00:03:38.270> so<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:38.570> when

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
the back is cut shorter so that when

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.710 
the back is cut shorter so that when
you're<00:03:38.960> sitting<00:03:39.530> in<00:03:39.770> your<00:03:39.830> chair<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:41.450> back

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
you're sitting in your chair the back

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.140 
you're sitting in your chair the back
just<00:03:42.080> goes<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.310> length<00:03:43.490> that<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:43.760> require

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
just goes to the length that you require

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.480 
just goes to the length that you require
and<00:03:44.450> no<00:03:44.570> longer<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:45.320> that<00:03:45.590> you're<00:03:46.040> not<00:03:46.250> sitting

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
and no longer so that you're not sitting

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.490 
and no longer so that you're not sitting
on<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.880> or<00:03:47.030> there's<00:03:47.210> all<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:47.930> fabric<00:03:48.170> that's

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
on it or there's all this fabric that's

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.610 
on it or there's all this fabric that's
bunched<00:03:48.860> up<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:51.190> shape<00:03:52.190> of<00:03:52.460> the<00:03:52.910> coat<00:03:53.180> is

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
bunched up the shape of the coat is

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:02.530 
bunched up the shape of the coat is
drafted<00:03:54.620> in<00:03:54.710> an<00:03:54.830> L<00:03:55.160> shape<00:03:57.010> which<00:03:58.930> just<00:04:01.360> you<00:04:02.360> can

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
drafted in an L shape which just you can

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.920 
drafted in an L shape which just you can
see<00:04:02.870> here<00:04:03.740> so<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.130> back<00:04:04.250> is<00:04:04.310> shorter<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.660> side

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
see here so the back is shorter the side

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.150 
see here so the back is shorter the side
is<00:04:06.140> shorter<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:07.700> front<00:04:08.000> sits<00:04:08.540> longer<00:04:09.320> so

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
is shorter and the front sits longer so

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.440 
is shorter and the front sits longer so
that<00:04:10.400> when<00:04:10.580> you're<00:04:10.700> sitting<00:04:10.910> at<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.300> side

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
that when you're sitting at the side

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.120 
that when you're sitting at the side
again<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:12.080> don't<00:04:12.170> have<00:04:12.410> all<00:04:12.590> that<00:04:12.620> fabric

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
again you don't have all that fabric

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.860 
again you don't have all that fabric
that<00:04:13.160> can<00:04:13.430> get<00:04:13.580> caught<00:04:13.820> into<00:04:14.060> your<00:04:14.300> wheel<00:04:14.840> and

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
that can get caught into your wheel and

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.270 
that can get caught into your wheel and
also<00:04:15.440> potentially<00:04:16.280> get<00:04:16.459> dirty<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:18.140> code<00:04:19.010> in

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
also potentially get dirty the code in

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.970 
also potentially get dirty the code in
the<00:04:19.400> center<00:04:19.820> here<00:04:20.209> some<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.230> the<00:04:21.380> fabric<00:04:21.620> has

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
the center here some of the fabric has

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.680 
the center here some of the fabric has
been<00:04:22.040> eliminated<00:04:22.400> because<00:04:23.000> when<00:04:23.570> you're

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
been eliminated because when you're

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.440 
been eliminated because when you're
sitting<00:04:23.870> down<00:04:24.170> you<00:04:24.440> get<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.220> lot<00:04:25.940> of<00:04:25.970> fabric

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
sitting down you get a lot of fabric

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.410 
sitting down you get a lot of fabric
that<00:04:26.630> sits<00:04:27.050> here<00:04:27.850> so<00:04:28.850> that's<00:04:29.000> been<00:04:29.180> eliminated

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
that sits here so that's been eliminated

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.970 
that sits here so that's been eliminated
and<00:04:29.960> then<00:04:30.650> at<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.010> sleeve<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:32.090> tab<00:04:32.390> is<00:04:32.980> there

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
and then at the sleeve the tab is there

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.880 
and then at the sleeve the tab is there
to<00:04:34.610> bring<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.510> sleeve<00:04:35.780> in<00:04:36.050> so<00:04:36.260> it's<00:04:36.410> not<00:04:36.590> wide

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
to bring the sleeve in so it's not wide

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.490 
to bring the sleeve in so it's not wide
and<00:04:37.480> potentially<00:04:38.480> getting<00:04:38.630> caught<00:04:39.110> in<00:04:39.350> the

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
and potentially getting caught in the

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.100 
and potentially getting caught in the
wheel<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:40.300> those<00:04:41.300> are<00:04:41.510> all<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.690> features<00:04:42.080> of

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
wheel and those are all the features of

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.350 
wheel and those are all the features of
the<00:04:42.470> trench<00:04:42.680> coat

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360
