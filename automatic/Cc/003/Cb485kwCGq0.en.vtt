hair<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.580> straighten<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.060> but<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.930> was<00:02:37.200> always

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
told by my hairdresser that it's best to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.860 
told by my hairdresser that it's best to
quickly<00:02:41.190> run<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.730> through<00:02:42.090> your<00:02:42.239> hair<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> few

running<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.500> through<00:02:46.530> once<00:02:47.310> because<00:02:47.850> it's

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
running it through once because it's

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.110 
running it through once because it's
less<00:02:48.780> damaging<00:02:49.380> since<00:02:49.739> there<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.310> ultimately

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
less damaging since there is ultimately
