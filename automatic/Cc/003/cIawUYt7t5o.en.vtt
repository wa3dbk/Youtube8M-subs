00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
how to breathe the bronze dragon I I'm

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.090 
how to breathe the bronze dragon I I'm
pretty<00:00:16.080> sure<00:00:16.350> I've<00:00:16.470> got<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.680> like<00:00:18.800> because<00:00:19.800> I

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
pretty sure I've got it like because I

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.070 
pretty sure I've got it like because I
can't<00:00:20.130> see<00:00:20.550> any<00:00:20.760> other<00:00:21.029> dragon<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.960> would

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
can't see any other dragon that it would

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.460 
can't see any other dragon that it would
be<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.830> says<00:00:23.000> 1747<00:00:24.000> right<00:00:24.210> now<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:25.350> it's

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
be so it says 1747 right now but it's

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.490 
be so it says 1747 right now but it's
actually<00:00:25.740> 22<00:00:26.400> hours<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.060> 30<00:00:27.900> minutes<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.439> think

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
actually 22 hours and 30 minutes I think

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.339 
actually 22 hours and 30 minutes I think
it<00:00:28.710> was<00:00:29.000> when<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> got<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
it was when I got it and if you have a

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.420 
it was when I got it and if you have a
look<00:00:31.619> through<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:33.050> dark<00:00:34.050> types<00:00:34.410> mostly<00:00:35.309> all

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
look through the dark types mostly all

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.740 
look through the dark types mostly all
the<00:00:35.489> dragons<00:00:35.820> are<00:00:35.910> comment<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.570> got

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the dragons are comment and then you got

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.290 
the dragons are comment and then you got
these<00:00:37.020> epics<00:00:37.440> from<00:00:37.620> here<00:00:37.860> I've<00:00:38.640> read<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
these epics from here I've read the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.340 
these epics from here I've read the
mercury<00:00:40.140> dragon<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.670> Emperor<00:00:42.239> dragon<00:00:42.420> so

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
mercury dragon and the Emperor dragon so

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.400 
mercury dragon and the Emperor dragon so
it<00:00:43.680> would<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.890> dark<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.430> light<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:45.570> metal

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
it would be dark and light with metal

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
it would be dark and light with metal
and<00:00:46.530> water<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.340> we're<00:00:47.700> looking<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.149> something

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and water so we're looking for something

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.389 
and water so we're looking for something
that<00:00:48.539> has<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.620> got<00:00:49.739> dark<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.219> light

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
that has that so we got dark and light

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.270 
that has that so we got dark and light
and<00:00:50.700> metal<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> bronze<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and metal with the bronze and then the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.490 
and metal with the bronze and then the
others<00:00:53.550> there's<00:00:54.300> no<00:00:54.570> dark<00:00:55.379> light<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.640> water

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
others there's no dark light or water

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.770 
others there's no dark light or water
metal<00:00:58.500> combination<00:00:59.370> they<00:01:00.270> couldn't<00:01:00.719> be

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
metal combination they couldn't be

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
metal combination they couldn't be
frostbite<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.469> when<00:01:01.590> they<00:01:01.680> wind<00:01:01.980> can't<00:01:02.789> be

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
frostbite so when they wind can't be

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.609 
frostbite so when they wind can't be
Stardust<00:01:03.300> cousin<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.629> voyage<00:01:03.930> can't<00:01:04.409> be

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
Stardust cousin they voyage can't be

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.420 
Stardust cousin they voyage can't be
abyss<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.339> they<00:01:05.430> wind<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.119> heat<00:01:06.540> or<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.979> fire

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
abyss and they wind or heat or the fire

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.910 
abyss and they wind or heat or the fire
electric<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.780> has<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> bronze

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
electric it's it has to be the bronze

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.469 
electric it's it has to be the bronze
and<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.310> he's<00:01:11.430> what<00:01:11.580> double<00:01:11.820> check<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
and if he's what double check on the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.539 
and if he's what double check on the
light<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.260> sure<00:01:13.530> there's<00:01:14.189> actually<00:01:14.460> only

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
happens is as you level up they they

happens is as you level up they they

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
because it the opponents will go up to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
behind its sack so my plan is now to

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.330 
behind its sack so my plan is now to
carry<00:02:52.570> on<00:02:52.690> eleven<00:02:52.959> them<00:02:53.050> up<00:02:53.200> one<00:02:53.560> at<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.739> time<00:02:53.890> so

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
carry on eleven them up one at a time so

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.610 
carry on eleven them up one at a time so
everything<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:55.030> use<00:02:55.270> in<00:02:55.420> regular<00:02:55.989> basis

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
everything that I use in regular basis

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.100 
everything that I use in regular basis
like<00:02:56.860> get<00:02:57.640> one<00:02:57.820> two<00:02:57.940> level<00:02:58.150> 41<00:02:58.510> get<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.900> next

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
like get one two level 41 get the next

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.870 
like get one two level 41 get the next
and<00:02:59.230> level<00:02:59.440> 41<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.040> just<00:03:00.220> carry<00:03:00.430> on<00:03:00.489> that<00:03:00.730> way

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
and level 41 and just carry on that way

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.160 
and level 41 and just carry on that way
and<00:03:01.090> then<00:03:01.270> no<00:03:01.660> 42<00:03:02.020> 42<00:03:02.770> 42<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:06.810> think<00:03:07.810> we're

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
and then no 42 42 42 and I think we're

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.979 
and then no 42 42 42 and I think we're
either<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:09.100> best<00:03:09.340> way<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.580> go<00:03:09.760> about<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.270> but

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
either the best way to go about it but

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.170 
either the best way to go about it but
actually<00:03:11.680> I'm<00:03:11.890> not<00:03:11.980> completely<00:03:12.310> sure<00:03:12.489> but

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
actually I'm not completely sure but

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.720 
actually I'm not completely sure but
whenever<00:03:13.840> I've<00:03:14.200> leveled<00:03:14.620> up<00:03:14.860> everything<00:03:15.700> now
