00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 welcome to your channel the channel 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.890
 flowers 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.290
 This is a very simple decoration 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.719
 very nice and I really liked is a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.360
 request of 치lex hern치ndez that this 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.670
 half the decorated her in the video of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.369
 the super long eyelashes and asked me to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.400
 did the tutorial of this set is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.750
 pretty simple and I'm going to tell you that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.689
 what you need then nothing else is this 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.399
 enamel that is of the brand goal but 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.660
 you can use any enamel that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:43.010
 be white also use this that this 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.010
 is a delineator this comes as here 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:52.589
 this is how a eyeliner brings a broach 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:56.890
 as well as an eyeliner and it also brings 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:01:00.250
 here brings a kind of needle 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.280
 In this scenario use this little needle 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.460
 and also use this this is a 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.540
 shine is a top coat is a rayito 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.430
 transparent and use this utensil 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.740
 that I really do not remember what it's called 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.619
 this thing is like a little ball 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.210
 over here and it's to do this is for 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.770
 make the flowers but do not use 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:28.550
 this side I used this 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.110
 I used this that is like a toothpick 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.120
 if you do not have this utensil 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.690
 can use a toothpick there is no 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.790
 problem 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:41.070
 Now I'm going to tell you how I did it 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.500
 nothing else I put a white base I put a 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.240
 layer I'm going to do nothing else a nail because 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.530
 she with a sufficient key then 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.070
 this what I did was 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.979
 this I put the white base first and 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.080
 with the eyeliner I'm going to put some 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.040
 dots as well as doing as a 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.820
 little wheel I hope it looks good 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:11.039
 I'll put you as well as a 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.039
 I'm going to put 5 dots 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.989
 are five dots as well as making a 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.780
 circle and then with the artifact of 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:31.300
 this one I'm going to grab and how am I going to 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.300
 pull on each little dot towards the center 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.440
 I hope it looks good this goes on 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.069
 the center of the dot and closed for 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.700
 for the center of the circle all 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.909
 we are going to miss this way and the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.370
 little flower I will now put on the other 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.920
 extreme 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.310
 and I'm going to do it like five 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.310
 dots 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.980
 and then with this because this is jalan 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.980
 those who pull like that for the center 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.810
 They know me very pretty because I'm not 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.800
 expert I make myself two sets very 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.140
 simple 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.390
 and I'm because good they 'll like that 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.880
 they like and decorated that is very easy 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.400
 of doing now I'm just going to wait for 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.060
 dry a moment to put on the shine 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.060
 number I put good you wear this when 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.450
 it is pre-scale the little flower you run 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.640
 risk of tile pink paint 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.940
 but you're going to wait a moment for it to 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.680
 dry and you will put the shine you can 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.780
 put even if it's fresh but with a lot 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.290
 careful not to pull the pink paint 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.290
 is 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.970
 for in this name put the brightness not 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.810
 I remembered because right now I was 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.150
 doing 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.380
 but with the brightness in all 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.810
 little flowers 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.319
 in all the nails sorry 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.989
 and that's how this decoration is made 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.780
 pretty quick easy and especially so 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.120
 they are very beautiful 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.920
