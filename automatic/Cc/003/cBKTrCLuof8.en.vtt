00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
always thought blistering was just part

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.020 
always thought blistering was just part
and<00:01:34.270> parcel<00:01:34.360> of<00:01:35.280> being<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.370> runner<00:01:36.550> you<00:01:36.940> of

course your blister because we run but
that's<00:01:38.830> not<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.190> case<00:01:39.400> until<00:01:40.180> I<00:01:40.210> put<00:01:40.450> a

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
that's not the case until I put a

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.560 
that's not the case until I put a
speedform<00:01:40.990> on<00:01:41.170> I<00:01:41.380> realized<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:43.000> I<00:01:43.270> never

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
speedform on I realized that I never

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.410

ever<00:01:43.900> have<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.320> blister<00:01:44.770> again<00:01:45.040> because

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
ever have to blister again because

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.149 
ever have to blister again because
blistering<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.720> fact<00:01:46.990> that<00:01:47.159> other
