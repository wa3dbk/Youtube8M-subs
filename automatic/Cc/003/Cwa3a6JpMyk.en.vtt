transmission<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.850> anymore<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.810> have

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
transmission on this anymore so we have

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.810 
transmission on this anymore so we have
to<00:01:40.049> build<00:01:40.170> some<00:01:40.409> sort<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> chain<00:01:40.979> garden<00:01:41.430> now

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
to build some sort of a chain garden now

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.600 
to build some sort of a chain garden now
I<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.570> some<00:01:42.869> scrap<00:01:43.170> plexiglass<00:01:44.040> kicking

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
I do have some scrap plexiglass kicking

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.030 
I do have some scrap plexiglass kicking
around<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.149> was<00:01:45.479> some<00:01:46.439> sort<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.799> large

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
around this was some sort of a large

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.890 
around this was some sort of a large
computer<00:01:47.520> printer<00:01:47.820> cover<00:01:48.030> at<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:48.420> point

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
computer printer cover at one point

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.750 
computer printer cover at one point
and<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.800> would<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.130> make<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> guard<00:01:50.640> out

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
and I would like to make the guard out

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.220 
and I would like to make the guard out
of<00:01:50.790> plexiglass<00:01:51.330> just<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.870> see<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
of plexiglass just so you can see the

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.690 
of plexiglass just so you can see the
chain<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.650> can<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:52.920> how<00:01:53.070> everything<00:01:53.490> works

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
chain you can see how everything works

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.260 
chain you can see how everything works
but<00:01:54.450> how<00:01:54.690> do<00:01:54.750> i<00:01:54.930> attach<00:01:55.440> that<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.180> what<00:01:57.180> I've

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
but how do i attach that to what I've

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.450 
but how do i attach that to what I've
got<00:01:57.300> to<00:01:57.480> work<00:01:57.720> with<00:01:57.930> here<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.590> one<00:01:59.190> thing<00:01:59.370> I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
got to work with here and one thing I

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.010 
got to work with here and one thing I
found<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.970> scrap<00:02:00.240> pile<00:02:00.480> was<00:02:00.750> some

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
found in the scrap pile was some

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.530 
found in the scrap pile was some
aluminum<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.640> already<00:02:02.970> black<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.450> it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
aluminum this is already black so it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.670 
aluminum this is already black so it
matches<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.900> rest<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.350> frame<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.650> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
matches the rest of the frame of the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.640 
matches the rest of the frame of the
motorcycle<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:06.180> sort<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.510> see<00:02:06.690> channel<00:02:07.140> it

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
motorcycle it's sort of a see channel it

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.410 
motorcycle it's sort of a see channel it
already<00:02:07.920> has<00:02:08.160> threaded<00:02:08.460> holes<00:02:08.759> down<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.179> side

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
already has threaded holes down the side

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.450 
already has threaded holes down the side
so<00:02:10.050> I'm<00:02:10.200> thinking<00:02:10.590> if<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.800> got<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:10.979> short<00:02:11.280> piece

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
so I'm thinking if I got a short piece

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.880 
so I'm thinking if I got a short piece
of<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.730> off<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.840> basically<00:02:13.080> put<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.710> in

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
of this off I can basically put it in

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.410 
of this off I can basically put it in
there<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.460> it's<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.060> cover<00:02:15.210> up

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
there like that it's going to cover up

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.270 
there like that it's going to cover up
the<00:02:15.660> battery<00:02:16.230> here<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:16.800> I'm<00:02:16.890> not<00:02:17.010> going<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.190> get

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
the battery here so I'm not going to get

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.370 
the battery here so I'm not going to get
any<00:02:17.400> spanner<00:02:17.820> from<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.690> chain<00:02:18.990> onto<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
any spanner from the chain onto the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.140 
any spanner from the chain onto the
battery<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.340> I'll<00:02:20.460> be<00:02:20.610> able<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.880> come

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
battery and then I'll be able to come

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.270 
battery and then I'll be able to come
straight<00:02:21.480> off<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.500> plexiglass<00:02:23.070> to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
straight off that with the plexiglass to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:43.220 
straight off that with the plexiglass to
make<00:02:23.400> cover<00:02:41.240> so<00:02:42.240> here<00:02:42.540> what<00:02:42.660> I've<00:02:42.810> done<00:02:42.990> is

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
make cover so here what I've done is

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.170 
make cover so here what I've done is
drilled<00:02:43.560> two<00:02:43.890> holes<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.520> put<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.820> pair<00:02:45.060> of

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
drilled two holes and put a pair of

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.650 
drilled two holes and put a pair of
quarter<00:02:45.600> twenty<00:02:45.870> volts<00:02:46.020> through<00:02:46.320> them<00:02:47.570> then<00:02:48.570> I

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
quarter twenty volts through them then I

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.210 
quarter twenty volts through them then I
drilled<00:02:49.020> out<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.230> couple<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.650> these<00:02:49.770> holes<00:02:50.070> to

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
drilled out a couple of these holes to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.000 
drilled out a couple of these holes to
make<00:02:50.400> them<00:02:50.550> quarter<00:02:50.880> twenty<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.860> then<00:02:52.860> in

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
make them quarter twenty and then in

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.729 
make them quarter twenty and then in
theory<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:54.060> fits<00:02:54.360> right<00:02:54.510> under<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:57.350> like<00:02:58.350> cad

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
theory this fits right under I like cad

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.220 
theory this fits right under I like cad
which<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.519> course<00:02:59.550> stands<00:03:00.150> for<00:03:00.540> cardboard

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
which of course stands for cardboard

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.280 
which of course stands for cardboard
aided<00:03:02.010> design<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.880> if<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.090> for<00:03:03.660> example<00:03:03.690> take

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
aided design so if you for example take

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.280 
aided design so if you for example take
an<00:03:04.410> old<00:03:04.530> pizza<00:03:04.920> box<00:03:05.720> we've<00:03:06.720> got<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> marker<00:03:07.170> and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
an old pizza box we've got a marker and

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.310 
an old pizza box we've got a marker and
a<00:03:07.470> razor<00:03:07.680> knife<00:03:08.269> makes<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.390> really<00:03:09.630> easy<00:03:09.780> to

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
a razor knife makes it really easy to

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.949 
a razor knife makes it really easy to
knock<00:03:11.310> up<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.910> figure<00:03:12.150> out<00:03:12.209> what<00:03:12.450> size<00:03:12.690> you

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
knock up and figure out what size you

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.410 
knock up and figure out what size you
actually<00:03:13.350> need<00:03:13.530> trim<00:03:14.250> off<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.640> extra<00:03:14.910> mark

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
actually need trim off the extra mark

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.050 
actually need trim off the extra mark
what<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.810> keep<00:03:16.489> mark<00:03:17.489> any<00:03:17.640> critical

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
what to keep mark any critical

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.460 
what to keep mark any critical
dimensions<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:18.780> now<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:18.870> can<00:03:19.080> make<00:03:19.200> this<00:03:19.320> out

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
dimensions and now I can make this out

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:52.490 
dimensions and now I can make this out
of<00:03:19.500> plexiglass

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.050 

so<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.680> here<00:03:53.950> is<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.100> weld<00:03:54.430> that<00:03:54.640> failed

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
so this here is the weld that failed

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.040 
so this here is the weld that failed
before<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:56.200> I<00:03:56.730> ground<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:57.910> down<00:03:58.150> ree<00:03:58.540> welded<00:03:58.900> it

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
before so I ground it down ree welded it

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.410 
before so I ground it down ree welded it
repainted<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.890> and<00:04:00.100> this<00:04:00.430> time<00:04:00.820> it's<00:04:01.150> going<00:04:01.330> to

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
repainted it and this time it's going to

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.330 
repainted it and this time it's going to
stay<00:04:01.660> for<00:04:01.930> sure<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.410> really<00:04:02.830> mean<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.100> this<00:04:03.130> time

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.800 

well<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.460> motorcycle<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.030> pretty<00:04:07.270> much<00:04:07.420> done

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
well the motorcycle is pretty much done

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.710 
well the motorcycle is pretty much done
and<00:04:08.140> I'm<00:04:08.500> really<00:04:08.740> glad<00:04:08.980> because<00:04:09.630> tomorrow<00:04:10.630> I

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
and I'm really glad because tomorrow I

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.110 
and I'm really glad because tomorrow I
have<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:10.990> be<00:04:11.200> up<00:04:11.230> at<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.470> mrea<00:04:12.040> energy<00:04:12.670> fair<00:04:12.940> by

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
have to be up at the mrea energy fair by
