00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
think that there should be something

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.289 
think that there should be something
like<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.939> usually<00:01:06.330> onic<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> really<00:01:07.740> known

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
like that usually onic is a really known

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.840 
like that usually onic is a really known
we're<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.570> well<00:01:09.810> known<00:01:09.990> hacker<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.850> this

we're really well known hacker and this

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.870 
we're really well known hacker and this
could<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.600> something<00:01:12.979> worth<00:01:13.979> doing<00:01:14.430> so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
could really be something worth doing so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.929
