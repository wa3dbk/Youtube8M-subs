00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
the time 88 Antonio Brown I believe it

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.480 
the time 88 Antonio Brown I believe it
was<00:06:09.670> the<00:06:10.560> chemistry<00:06:11.560> one<00:06:11.740> they<00:06:11.920> can<00:06:12.160> get<00:06:12.310> an

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
was the chemistry one they can get an

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.530 
was the chemistry one they can get an
upgrade<00:06:12.640> to<00:06:12.910> like<00:06:13.120> a<00:06:13.150> 92<00:06:13.690> I<00:06:13.720> think<00:06:14.730> but<00:06:15.730> it<00:06:16.450> was

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
upgrade to like a 92 I think but it was

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.210 
upgrade to like a 92 I think but it was
Antonio<00:06:16.780> Brown<00:06:17.110> which<00:06:17.440> I<00:06:17.590> get<00:06:17.800> at<00:06:17.920> the<00:06:18.040> end<00:06:18.130> of

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
Antonio Brown which I get at the end of

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.390
