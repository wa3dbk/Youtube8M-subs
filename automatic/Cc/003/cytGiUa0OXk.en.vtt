17th up to one morning so definitely and
here<00:01:37.750> we<00:01:37.840> have<00:01:37.990> Vega<00:01:38.290> I<00:01:38.920> think<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:39.940> is<00:01:40.030> the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
here we have Vega I think this is the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.620 
here we have Vega I think this is the
biggest<00:01:40.390> one<00:01:40.510> ahead<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.020> goes<00:01:41.170> up<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:42.630> my

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
biggest one ahead and it goes up to my

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.540 
biggest one ahead and it goes up to my
