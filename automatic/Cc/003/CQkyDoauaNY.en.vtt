 compare me not 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.910
 because the first thing we have to do is ask logically to have the program 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.030
 On your computer 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.070

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.760

 xq as santamarÃ­a pro first we go on foot 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.180
 we have new 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.930
 Well, let's go to size 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.930
 we choose the size of what they want to do their 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.430
 they can do it from little ones 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.430
 for other large square rectangles 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.060

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.320
 / avn 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.570
 read here to choose the color of the background I escaped weapon white 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.630
 so that they exercise a little more 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.800
 in the front to put two other colors 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.660
 let's really put him 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.180

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.030
 in style 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.770
 we were going to put in politics 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.610
 what for me is the one that knows best 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.510
 then we are going to put a little bit of it to erase any point more attention 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.280
 ok that we do not care 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.130
 let's go to 6 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.300
 Jaime Estrada by the size in this colon theme 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.820
 in this case since we do not achieve anything because they think it's a little bit more 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.080
 simple 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.260
 let's go to the image 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.370
 in rent to put him showed and before the Cuban 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.690
 let's win at image 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.129
 in this case of rollover but this year 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.809
 we put it on, we suppose so 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:13.849
 and in this case 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.799
 active to take a little bit because then to lengthen the image 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.479
 hockenheim 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.479

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:28.899
 team that next Saturday after we have already won it completely 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.999
 as you can see 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:33.249
 and was completely seized 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:38.799
 If you enter the trigger, make it more transparent or if you want to see a 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.519
 little bit more because losing a little more does not 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.889
 because afterwards we go or support him 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.579
 the text 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.790
 in the text you can be worth what you want to approach but yes 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.489
 promoted in famous Canfranc October where to start 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.549

 I have many have clear 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.819

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.809
 according to published the newspaper 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:26.049

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.900
 can attend juvenile impeccable pass 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.999
 it was in those countries the color of their letters 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.979
 in this case river they put black to support 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.719
 i with the edge lowe's white report 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.789
 the coleman end 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.929

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:01.689
 know her 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.089
 3d 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.089
 power clients let's see text hamas 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:11.869
 here to put some other stress test you want to relate to 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.079
 adoptions 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.959
 modify what they already have 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:15.940
 and leaders 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.469
 there may be nothing bad we are going to work 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:20.319
 come on cd 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:21.820
 and in the truths 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.689
 here he will not do anything bad we put him 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:27.949
 let's talk defeat folder they have 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.449

 let's see the folder that are 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.030
 As you can see here is the valence I had just done 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.590
 but it has served them well 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.900
 It is a very simple program to use 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.030
 and then you can read the statement as a human being but with 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.909
 photo efe 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:00.689
 which is a little bit more complicated but 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:02.139
 same 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.789

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.240
 and here we are going to walk 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.969
 by everyone 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.249
