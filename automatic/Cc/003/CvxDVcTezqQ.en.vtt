00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.719 
don't worry if it doesn't look amazing
straightaway<00:01:14.920> because<00:01:14.979> we're<00:01:15.220> gonna<00:01:15.340> go<00:01:15.549> over

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
straightaway because we're gonna go over

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.670 
straightaway because we're gonna go over
it<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.060> clean<00:01:16.299> up<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.540> lines<00:01:16.720> and<00:01:17.110> make<00:01:17.530> the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
it and clean up the lines and make the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:37.139 
it and clean up the lines and make the
flick<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:18.100> little<00:01:18.430> bit<00:01:18.549> longer

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.910 

so<00:01:38.149> that's<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.450> kind<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.749> the<00:01:38.929> basis<00:01:39.469> of<00:01:39.710> the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
so that's the kind of the basis of the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.700 
so that's the kind of the basis of the
shape<00:01:40.219> that<00:01:40.249> you<00:01:40.549> want<00:01:40.579> to<00:01:40.999> get<00:01:41.179> and<00:01:41.509> I<00:01:42.319> changed

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
shape that you want to get and I changed

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.169

you<00:01:42.770> up<00:01:42.859> there<00:01:43.100> by<00:01:43.219> day<00:01:43.280> sometimes<00:01:43.909> I'd<00:01:44.060> like

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
you up there by day sometimes I'd like

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.880

it<00:01:44.359> thicker<00:01:44.569> sometimes<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.289> like<00:01:45.439> it<00:01:45.590> longer<00:01:45.859> I

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
it thicker sometimes I like it longer I

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.230
