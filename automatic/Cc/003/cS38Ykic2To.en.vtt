00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.480
 let's talk today about 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.540
 How to keep our paint fresh 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.220
 more time if we have mixed some color 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.380
 that we like a lot and we want 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.740
 use it for the next two or three 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.480
 days what we need is only 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.420
 cover it 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.570
 that is to say the dry oil from the 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.580
 contact with the air then if 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.420
 we cover with a container or a lid 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.880
 let's allow this to be preserved 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.239
 cool for longer 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.579
 the paint that remains in our palette and 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.579
 that with the days it is drying 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.300
 form a movie ie a movie 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.140
 and the outer layer but if we burst 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.750
 this movie below we're going to find 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.240
 fresh paint that we can use without 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.680
 no problem 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:00.760
 ok now to keep the oil fresh 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.780
 we can also use a small 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.960
 vial with lid this will store it and 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.080
 keep cool for longer 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.660
 but we can also 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.840
 invest a little water in our 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.830
 container to perfectly cover the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.180
 oil 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.480
 when we want to use it only 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.990
 we remove all the water 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.770
 we wait for the moisture that remains in 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.200
 the oil will evaporate and good is ready 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.950
 to be used without any problem 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.350
 finally if we have put a lot of paint 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.520
 from our palette and we have not 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.799
 used and also let's say if it's not 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.130
 dirty and if we have the same color as 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.969
 we have in the tube 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:01.579
 We can return the had only 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:04.240
 we need to tap our 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.549
 tube on the table 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.850
 in order to make the level of 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:13.040
 paint 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.040
 and with the help of a spatula we can 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.440
 return the paint to the tube 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.530
 as you can see it is very simple and this is going to 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.650
 preserve our fresh paintings by 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.450
 more time and keep us from wasting 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.650
 material ok 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.650
 See you in the next video
