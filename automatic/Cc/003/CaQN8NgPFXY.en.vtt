now<00:00:04.880> you<00:00:04.940> know<00:00:05.540> your<00:00:06.080> major<00:00:06.649> scales<00:00:07.040> now<00:00:07.250> and

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
now you know your major scales now and

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:09.640 
now you know your major scales now and
you<00:00:08.299> know<00:00:08.510> your<00:00:08.750> major<00:00:09.020> scales<00:00:09.379> with<00:00:09.620> a

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
you know your major scales with a

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.039 
you know your major scales with a
dominant<00:00:10.160> feel<00:00:10.520> with<00:00:10.910> that<00:00:10.940> lowered<00:00:11.600> seventh

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
dominant feel with that lowered seventh

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.160 
dominant feel with that lowered seventh
or<00:00:12.320> another<00:00:12.619> way<00:00:12.799> of<00:00:13.449> calling<00:00:14.449> it<00:00:14.690> is<00:00:14.809> a

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
or another way of calling it is a

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.010 
or another way of calling it is a
mixolydian<00:00:15.980> scale<00:00:16.390> we've<00:00:17.390> got<00:00:17.420> both<00:00:17.750> of<00:00:17.779> those

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
mixolydian scale we've got both of those

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.860 
mixolydian scale we've got both of those
locked<00:00:18.410> in<00:00:18.650> let's<00:00:19.279> go<00:00:19.400> ahead<00:00:19.520> now<00:00:19.910> and<00:00:19.939> learn<00:00:20.600> a

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:20.870 
locked in let's go ahead now and learn a

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.480 
locked in let's go ahead now and learn a
minor<00:00:21.350> scale<00:00:22.040> pattern<00:00:23.260> minor<00:00:24.260> scales<00:00:24.650> have<00:00:25.460> a

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
minor scale pattern minor scales have a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.580 
minor scale pattern minor scales have a
simple<00:00:26.030> pattern<00:00:26.210> as<00:00:26.510> well<00:00:26.690> they're<00:00:27.289> a<00:00:27.320> little

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
simple pattern as well they're a little

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.870 
simple pattern as well they're a little
different<00:00:27.830> than<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.039> major<00:00:28.250> pattern<00:00:28.700> though

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
different than the major pattern though

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.779 
different than the major pattern though
and<00:00:29.150> so<00:00:29.390> it's<00:00:30.230> important<00:00:30.680> that<00:00:30.710> you<00:00:30.890> know<00:00:31.250> how

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
and so it's important that you know how

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.510 
and so it's important that you know how
to<00:00:31.850> play<00:00:32.149> a<00:00:32.449> minor<00:00:32.899> scale<00:00:33.199> on<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.500> bass<00:00:33.649> for

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
to play a minor scale on the bass for

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.920 
to play a minor scale on the bass for
the<00:00:34.610> purposes<00:00:35.000> of<00:00:35.059> this<00:00:35.270> video<00:00:35.449> let's<00:00:35.809> start

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
the purposes of this video let's start

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.869 
the purposes of this video let's start
with<00:00:36.350> a<00:00:36.379> root<00:00:36.649> of<00:00:36.859> C<00:00:37.129> and<00:00:38.440> we're<00:00:39.440> going<00:00:39.710> to<00:00:39.879> just

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
with a root of C and we're going to just

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.459 
with a root of C and we're going to just
like<00:00:41.120> with<00:00:41.269> the<00:00:41.359> major<00:00:41.600> scales<00:00:41.960> we're<00:00:42.350> gonna

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
like with the major scales we're gonna

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.919 
like with the major scales we're gonna
anchor<00:00:42.739> our<00:00:43.100> index<00:00:43.550> finger<00:00:43.909> on<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.120> root<00:00:44.629> so

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
anchor our index finger on the root so

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.680 
anchor our index finger on the root so
again<00:00:45.260> it's<00:00:46.039> good<00:00:46.249> to<00:00:46.399> have<00:00:46.550> a<00:00:46.609> good<00:00:47.089> strong

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
again it's good to have a good strong

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.899 
again it's good to have a good strong
anchor<00:00:48.379> on<00:00:48.589> root<00:00:48.859> and<00:00:49.069> and<00:00:49.489> just<00:00:49.639> for<00:00:49.789> what

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
anchor on root and and just for what

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.299 
anchor on root and and just for what
it's<00:00:50.030> worth<00:00:50.089> the<00:00:51.050> fifth<00:00:51.409> degree<00:00:51.620> of<00:00:51.889> the<00:00:51.979> scale

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
it's worth the fifth degree of the scale

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.379 
it's worth the fifth degree of the scale
is<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:52.850> same<00:00:53.089> in<00:00:53.719> major<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:54.679> minor<00:00:55.429> scales<00:00:55.609> as

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:56.389 
is the same in major and minor scales as

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.889 
is the same in major and minor scales as
is<00:00:57.229> the<00:00:57.530> fourth<00:00:57.889> degree<00:00:58.309> of<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.789> scale<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.870> you

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
is the fourth degree of the scale so you

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.799 
is the fourth degree of the scale so you
can<00:01:00.019> always<00:01:00.379> know<00:01:00.559> in<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.429> minor<00:01:01.670> scale<00:01:01.809> the

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
can always know in a minor scale the

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.340 
can always know in a minor scale the
fourth<00:01:03.199> degree<00:01:03.379> is<00:01:03.909> up<00:01:04.909> one<00:01:05.210> string<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:06.080> fifth

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
fourth degree is up one string the fifth

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.910 
fourth degree is up one string the fifth
degree<00:01:06.970> is<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.719> same<00:01:08.930> relationship<00:01:09.530> as<00:01:09.649> it<00:01:09.710> is

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
degree is the same relationship as it is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.950 
degree is the same relationship as it is
in<00:01:10.039> the<00:01:10.130> major<00:01:10.340> scales<00:01:10.700> here's<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.659> rest<00:01:11.840> of

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
in the major scales here's the rest of

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.990 
in the major scales here's the rest of
the<00:01:12.049> degrees<00:01:12.880> root<00:01:14.680> second<00:01:15.680> now<00:01:16.579> for<00:01:16.909> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
the degrees root second now for the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.639 
the degrees root second now for the
third<00:01:17.210> degree<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:17.630> shift<00:01:17.899> your<00:01:18.049> hand<00:01:18.200> up<00:01:18.439> one

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
third degree you shift your hand up one

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.830 
third degree you shift your hand up one
fret<00:01:19.270> third<00:01:21.250> fourth<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.490> fifth<00:01:22.579> we<00:01:23.479> already

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
fret third fourth and fifth we already

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.160 
fret third fourth and fifth we already
showed<00:01:24.799> you<00:01:25.060> six<00:01:26.289> seven<00:01:27.289> eight

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
showed you six seven eight

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.700 
showed you six seven eight
so<00:01:30.170> again<00:01:30.500> one<00:01:31.430> two<00:01:32.240> three<00:01:33.200> four<00:01:33.979> five<00:01:34.759> six

seven eight and yes it is that that

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.080 
seven eight and yes it is that that
dominant<00:01:41.210> seventh<00:01:41.689> feel<00:01:42.759> happens<00:01:43.759> naturally

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
dominant seventh feel happens naturally

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.870 
dominant seventh feel happens naturally
in<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.479> minor<00:01:44.689> scale<00:01:46.570> coming<00:01:47.570> back<00:01:47.689> down<00:01:47.899> eight

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
in a minor scale coming back down eight

seven six five four three two one now

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.419 
seven six five four three two one now
that<00:01:56.630> pattern<00:01:57.049> like<00:01:57.229> always<00:01:57.619> is<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.950> same<00:01:58.189> in

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
that pattern like always is the same in

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.050 
that pattern like always is the same in
all<00:01:58.909> minor<00:01:59.780> scales<00:02:00.229> let's<00:02:00.859> go<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.490> minor<00:02:03.039> one

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
all minor scales let's go to a minor one

that<00:02:21.320> minor<00:02:21.680> scale<00:02:22.130> pattern<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.120> same<00:02:23.150> no

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
that minor scale pattern is the same no

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.800 
that minor scale pattern is the same no
matter<00:02:24.110> where<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.190> go<00:02:25.220> on<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.360> neck<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.690> this

matter where you go on the neck of this

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.720 
matter where you go on the neck of this
space<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.710> find<00:02:28.100> your<00:02:28.250> route

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
space you find your route

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.000 
space you find your route
that's<00:02:29.330> your<00:02:29.570> first<00:02:30.080> degree<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.500> your<00:02:30.680> scale

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
that's your first degree of your scale

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.630 
that's your first degree of your scale
and<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.550> can<00:02:31.580> play<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:31.960> absolutely<00:02:32.960> anywhere

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
and you can play it absolutely anywhere

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.210 
and you can play it absolutely anywhere
just<00:02:34.640> as<00:02:34.820> another<00:02:35.090> example<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.840> minor<00:02:36.680> we<00:02:37.040> go<00:02:37.160> to

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
just as another example a minor we go to

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.380 
just as another example a minor we go to
a<00:02:38.680> one<00:02:39.680> two<00:02:40.520> three<00:02:41.110> four<00:02:42.110> five<00:02:42.920> six<00:02:43.700> seven

eight

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.280 

so<00:02:54.070> lock<00:02:54.280> in<00:02:54.520> your<00:02:54.670> minor<00:02:55.120> scale<00:02:55.270> patterns<00:02:56.020> and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
so lock in your minor scale patterns and
