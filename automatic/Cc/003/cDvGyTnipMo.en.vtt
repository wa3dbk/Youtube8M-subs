00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
actually really nice so everything is a

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.350

I<00:02:25.660> mean<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.440> only<00:02:26.530> way<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.769> could<00:02:26.980> cover<00:02:27.250> more

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
I mean the only way you could cover more

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.670 
I mean the only way you could cover more
would<00:02:28.480> be<00:02:28.510> if<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.780> covered<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.380> actual

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
would be if you covered the actual

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.170 
would be if you covered the actual
screen<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.430> actually<00:02:30.549> does<00:02:30.880> come<00:02:31.090> with

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
screen and it actually does come with

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.240 
screen and it actually does come with
the<00:02:31.239> screen<00:02:31.540> protector<00:02:32.049> so<00:02:32.290> it's<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.739> hundred

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
the screen protector so it's a hundred

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.759 
the screen protector so it's a hundred
percent<00:02:33.370> coated<00:02:34.260> let's<00:02:35.260> go<00:02:35.380> ahead<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.680> take

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
percent coated let's go ahead and take

to drop this
it<00:04:23.319> doesn't<00:04:23.680> add<00:04:23.770> much<00:04:23.830> bulk<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:26.440> far<00:04:28.830> most<00:04:29.830> of

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
it doesn't add much bulk so far most of

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.909 
it doesn't add much bulk so far most of
the<00:04:30.130> case<00:04:30.340> does<00:04:31.000> not<00:04:31.030> attract<00:04:31.599> length<00:04:31.930> but

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
the case does not attract length but

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.379 
the case does not attract length but
this<00:04:33.099> textured<00:04:33.849> area<00:04:34.410> around<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.590> edges<00:04:36.389> does

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389

attract<00:04:37.930> a<00:04:38.080> little<00:04:38.349> bit<00:04:38.470> of<00:04:38.590> Lin<00:04:41.490> but<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:42.610> can

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
attract a little bit of Lin but you can

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:50.990 
attract a little bit of Lin but you can
just<00:04:42.910> take<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.180> off<00:04:44.099> again<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:47.069> very<00:04:48.069> solid<00:04:48.610> case
