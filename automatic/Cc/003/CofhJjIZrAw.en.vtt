these reviews with the box but the box

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.900 
these reviews with the box but the box
is<00:00:36.390> really<00:00:36.450> big<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:38.190> doesn't<00:00:38.460> even<00:00:38.610> fit

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
is really big like it doesn't even fit

in<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> space<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.230> can't<00:00:40.440> see

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
in the space here I have you can't see

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.200 
in the space here I have you can't see
I'm<00:00:40.649> touching<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> walls<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.000> it'll<00:00:42.090> be

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
I'm touching the walls and so it'll be

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.610 
I'm touching the walls and so it'll be
really<00:00:42.300> difficult<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:42.960> over<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.350> I'm<00:00:43.469> sure

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
really difficult to go over so I'm sure

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.869 
really difficult to go over so I'm sure
you're<00:00:43.739> broken<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.100> about<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:44.610> trust<00:00:44.760> me

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
you're broken up about it but trust me

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.910 
you're broken up about it but trust me
it<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> neat<00:00:45.360> looking<00:00:45.629> box<00:00:45.840> but<00:00:46.649> anyhow

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
it was a neat looking box but anyhow

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.110 
it was a neat looking box but anyhow
we're<00:00:47.309> gonna<00:00:47.399> go<00:00:47.550> ahead<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.760> start<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
we're gonna go ahead and start with the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.250 
we're gonna go ahead and start with the
ring<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.420> take<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.539> look<00:00:48.750> at<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
ring and take a look at it and the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.840 
ring and take a look at it and the
sounds<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.710> does<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> drivers<00:00:50.700> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
sounds it does in the drivers and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.389 
sounds it does in the drivers and
whatnot<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.980> Infinity<00:00:53.370> ring

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
jingle so anyhow it's all I'm gonna show

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:23.810 
jingle so anyhow it's all I'm gonna show
for<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:59.610> then<00:02:00.590> sword<00:02:01.590> gun

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.490 

so<00:02:24.820> it<00:02:24.940> makes<00:02:25.060> some<00:02:25.210> kind<00:02:25.240> of<00:02:25.420> cool<00:02:25.660> different

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
so it makes some kind of cool different

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.990 
so it makes some kind of cool different
sound<00:02:26.860> effects<00:02:27.160> for<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.460> which<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.820> nice

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
sound effects for that which is nice

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.870 
sound effects for that which is nice
okay<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:29.710> what<00:02:29.860> looks<00:02:30.340> excuse<00:02:30.730> me

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
okay so that is what looks excuse me

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.790 
okay so that is what looks excuse me
that<00:02:31.180> does<00:02:31.420> in<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.930> other<00:02:32.050> stuff<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.500> believe

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
that does in the other stuff I believe

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.250 
that does in the other stuff I believe
it<00:02:32.980> does<00:02:33.130> make<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.430> same<00:02:33.580> exact<00:02:33.850> sound<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
it does make the same exact sound in the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.960 
it does make the same exact sound in the
white<00:02:35.500> wizard<00:02:35.680> driver<00:02:35.980> for<00:02:36.790> like<00:02:36.940> a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
white wizard driver for like a

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.220 
white wizard driver for like a
transformation<00:02:37.510> not<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.720> same<00:02:37.870> sound<00:02:38.110> as<00:02:38.200> a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
transformation not the same sound as a

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.410 
transformation not the same sound as a
sword<00:02:38.500> gun<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.490> anyhow<00:02:39.760> let's<00:02:39.910> take<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> look<00:02:40.270> at

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
sword gun so anyhow let's take a look at

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.510 
sword gun so anyhow let's take a look at
it<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:41.020> is<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.170> rather<00:02:41.410> large<00:02:41.710> weapon<00:02:42.220> that's

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
it it is a rather large weapon that's

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.920 
it it is a rather large weapon that's
what<00:02:42.760> she<00:02:42.940> said

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
what she said

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.840 
what she said
and<00:02:44.170> it's<00:02:44.740> kind<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:44.980> nice<00:02:45.160> because<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.760> know

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
and it's kind of nice because you know

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.950 
and it's kind of nice because you know
sometimes<00:02:46.090> these<00:02:46.300> weapons<00:02:46.570> can<00:02:46.660> be<00:02:46.750> kind<00:02:46.900> of

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
sometimes these weapons can be kind of

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.960 
sometimes these weapons can be kind of
dinky<00:02:47.170> I'm<00:02:47.770> in<00:02:47.980> it's<00:02:48.130> axe<00:02:48.310> mode<00:02:48.580> when<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.820> hold

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
dinky I'm in it's axe mode when you hold

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.060 
dinky I'm in it's axe mode when you hold
it<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:50.050> does<00:02:50.200> feel<00:02:50.230> like<00:02:50.410> it's<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.709> nice<00:02:50.860> size

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
it it does feel like it's a nice size

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.920 
it it does feel like it's a nice size
you<00:02:51.250> got<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.400> got<00:02:51.490> a<00:02:51.610> really<00:02:51.790> large<00:02:52.030> blade<00:02:52.540> here

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
you got I got a really large blade here

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.960 
you got I got a really large blade here
it's<00:02:53.350> gotta<00:02:53.500> kind<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:53.830> have<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.490> it<00:02:54.670> so<00:02:54.820> it

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
it's gotta kind of have to it so it

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.670 
it's gotta kind of have to it so it
feels<00:02:55.209> not<00:02:55.450> exactly<00:02:55.870> show<00:02:56.020> accurate<00:02:56.200> but<00:02:56.560> it

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
feels not exactly show accurate but it

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.650 
feels not exactly show accurate but it
feels<00:02:56.830> pretty<00:02:57.010> nice<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:58.150> doesn't<00:02:58.270> really<00:02:58.450> feel

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
feels pretty nice it doesn't really feel

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.330 
feels pretty nice it doesn't really feel
thinking<00:02:59.050> or<00:02:59.110> anything<00:02:59.260> now<00:02:59.920> let's<00:03:00.100> transform

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
thinking or anything now let's transform

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.690 
thinking or anything now let's transform
it<00:03:00.930> God<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.140> took<00:03:02.290> forever<00:03:02.470> what<00:03:03.430> if<00:03:03.520> in<00:03:03.610> his

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
it God that took forever what if in his

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.390 
it God that took forever what if in his
sword<00:03:03.970> mode<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.420> does<00:03:04.600> feel<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.840> bit<00:03:05.200> smaller<00:03:05.860> on

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
sword mode it does feel a bit smaller on

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.240 
sword mode it does feel a bit smaller on
the<00:03:06.520> blade<00:03:06.970> isn't<00:03:07.240> that<00:03:07.540> long<00:03:07.840> but<00:03:08.709> it's<00:03:08.860> not<00:03:09.070> I

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
the blade isn't that long but it's not I

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.180 
the blade isn't that long but it's not I
guess<00:03:09.520> terribly<00:03:09.880> longer<00:03:10.120> in<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.270> show<00:03:10.420> but

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
guess terribly longer in the show but

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.320 
guess terribly longer in the show but
yeah<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.430> just<00:03:12.490> feels<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.850> little<00:03:12.910> small<00:03:13.209> if

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
yeah it just feels a little small if

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
yeah it just feels a little small if
there's<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.540> pose<00:03:13.690> when<00:03:13.900> you're<00:03:14.020> holding<00:03:14.140> it

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
there's a pose when you're holding it

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.560 
there's a pose when you're holding it
from<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.620> axe<00:03:14.770> side<00:03:15.070> but<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.090> still<00:03:16.240> does<00:03:16.390> feel

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
from the axe side but it still does feel

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.020 
from the axe side but it still does feel
that<00:03:16.750> kind<00:03:17.080> of<00:03:17.200> heft<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.830> it<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.580> it's<00:03:18.700> not<00:03:18.820> so

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
that kind of heft to it so it's not so

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.330 
that kind of heft to it so it's not so
bad<00:03:19.240> I<00:03:19.270> do<00:03:19.540> prefer<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:19.959> axe<00:03:20.230> mode<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:21.070> seems

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
bad I do prefer the axe mode that seems

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.920 
bad I do prefer the axe mode that seems
rather<00:03:21.519> stupid<00:03:22.060> like<00:03:22.209> oh<00:03:22.330> let<00:03:22.510> me<00:03:22.630> just<00:03:22.660> switch

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
rather stupid like oh let me just switch

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.800 
rather stupid like oh let me just switch
to<00:03:23.140> axe<00:03:23.260> mode<00:03:23.530> Oh<00:03:23.680> blimey<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.459> got<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:25.239> know<00:03:25.360> cut

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
to axe mode Oh blimey I got you know cut

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.540 
to axe mode Oh blimey I got you know cut
I<00:03:26.050> don't<00:03:26.110> know<00:03:26.320> so<00:03:26.890> that's<00:03:27.070> what<00:03:27.250> happens

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
I don't know so that's what happens

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.670 
I don't know so that's what happens
there<00:03:27.760> but<00:03:28.660> anyway<00:03:28.840> like<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.230> said<00:03:29.260> overall

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
there but anyway like I said overall

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.680 
there but anyway like I said overall
it's<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.980> pretty<00:03:30.130> decent<00:03:30.310> size<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.390> really

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
it's a pretty decent size and I really

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.270 
it's a pretty decent size and I really
do<00:03:31.870> like<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.230> design<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:32.890> guess<00:03:33.100> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
do like the design of it I guess the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.009 
do like the design of it I guess the
idea<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.790> sword<00:03:34.000> axe<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.360> kind<00:03:34.570> of<00:03:34.660> cool<00:03:34.840> it

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
idea of a sword axe is kind of cool it

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.449 
idea of a sword axe is kind of cool it
seems<00:03:35.230> kind<00:03:35.440> of<00:03:35.470> silly<00:03:35.680> but<00:03:35.980> cool<00:03:36.250> at<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.430> same

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
seems kind of silly but cool at the same

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.970 
seems kind of silly but cool at the same
time<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.810> really<00:03:38.050> do<00:03:38.230> love<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.620> design

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
time and I really do love the design

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.340 
time and I really do love the design
here<00:03:39.310> for<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.269> axe<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.690> way<00:03:40.870> it's<00:03:41.050> like<00:03:41.170> his

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
here for the axe the way it's like his

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.280 
here for the axe the way it's like his
dragon<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:42.010> like<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.850> red<00:03:43.060> edge<00:03:43.870> of<00:03:44.170> the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
dragon and like the red edge of the

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.070 
dragon and like the red edge of the
blade<00:03:44.530> here<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.250> dragon<00:03:45.670> head<00:03:45.850> design<00:03:46.239> the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
blade here the dragon head design the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.620 
blade here the dragon head design the
wing<00:03:47.290> that's<00:03:47.470> gonna<00:03:47.620> become<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.070> light<00:03:48.630> not

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
wing that's gonna become the light not

alright<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:14.920> sound<00:04:15.190> wise<00:04:15.430> we're<00:04:16.090> going<00:04:16.239> to

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
alright so sound wise we're going to

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.130 
alright so sound wise we're going to
turn<00:04:16.479> it<00:04:16.600> on<00:04:16.690> back<00:04:16.900> here<00:04:17.169> and<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:18.130> will<00:04:18.280> make<00:04:18.519> a

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
turn it on back here and it will make a

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.890 
turn it on back here and it will make a
activation<00:04:20.140> noise

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.999 

so<00:04:24.900> that's<00:04:25.139> cool<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:25.439> you<00:04:25.530> get<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.710> LEDs

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
so that's cool and you get the LEDs

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:27.830 
so that's cool and you get the LEDs
lighting<00:04:26.219> up<00:04:26.400> there<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:27.270> when<00:04:27.449> you're<00:04:27.569> just<00:04:27.719> in

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
lighting up there so when you're just in

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.089 
lighting up there so when you're just in
this<00:04:28.020> mode<00:04:28.229> without<00:04:28.469> really<00:04:28.650> doing<00:04:28.710> anything

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
this mode without really doing anything

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.320 
this mode without really doing anything
else<00:04:29.249> that<00:04:29.400> only<00:04:29.520> Maggie's<00:04:29.729> a<00:04:29.789> couple<00:04:30.029> sounds

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
else that only Maggie's a couple sounds

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.659 
else that only Maggie's a couple sounds
and<00:04:30.419> makes<00:04:30.569> this<00:04:30.719> noise<00:04:31.340> which<00:04:32.340> it<00:04:32.460> sounds

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
and makes this noise which it sounds

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.489 
and makes this noise which it sounds
like<00:04:32.759> a<00:04:32.789> communication<00:04:33.449> noise<00:04:33.659> from<00:04:33.900> change

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:34.499 
like a communication noise from change

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.010 
like a communication noise from change
or<00:04:34.710> Morpher<00:04:35.129> and<00:04:35.370> then<00:04:36.150> right<00:04:36.689> now<00:04:36.840> it's

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
or Morpher and then right now it's

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.469 
or Morpher and then right now it's
currently<00:04:37.379> in<00:04:37.439> sword<00:04:37.770> mode<00:04:37.979> so<00:04:38.449> it<00:04:39.449> will<00:04:39.539> make

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
currently in sword mode so it will make

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.119 
currently in sword mode so it will make
two<00:04:42.479> very<00:04:42.629> good<00:04:42.810> slashing<00:04:43.289> noises<00:04:43.469> and<00:04:43.919> press

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:44.129 
two very good slashing noises and press

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.429 
two very good slashing noises and press
this<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:44.699> this<00:04:44.879> will<00:04:44.999> light<00:04:45.120> up<00:04:45.300> and<00:04:45.479> if<00:04:46.349> you

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439 
this and this will light up and if you

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.459 
this and this will light up and if you
press<00:04:46.650> this<00:04:46.800> right<00:04:46.979> now<00:04:48.050> it<00:04:49.050> will<00:04:49.169> again<00:04:49.289> make

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:49.469 
press this right now it will again make

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:51.649 
press this right now it will again make
that<00:04:49.650> noise<00:04:49.800> so<00:04:50.520> that's<00:04:50.699> all<00:04:50.909> it<00:04:51.120> does<00:04:51.330> when

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
that noise so that's all it does when

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.290 
that noise so that's all it does when
you<00:04:51.779> just<00:04:52.020> turn<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.860> on<00:04:53.009> immediately<00:04:53.520> so<00:04:54.150> what

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
you just turn it on immediately so what

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.730 
you just turn it on immediately so what
you're<00:04:54.389> gonna<00:04:54.479> want<00:04:54.689> to<00:04:54.750> do<00:04:54.930> is<00:04:55.169> scan<00:04:55.469> the

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
you're gonna want to do is scan the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.439 
you're gonna want to do is scan the
infinity<00:04:56.250> ring<00:04:56.370> light<00:04:56.580> on<00:04:56.759> here<00:04:57.029> it's<00:04:57.270> got<00:04:57.419> a

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
infinity ring light on here it's got a

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.480 
infinity ring light on here it's got a
sensor<00:04:57.840> add<00:04:58.020> only<00:04:58.289> scan<00:04:58.740> Z<00:04:58.889> infinity<00:04:58.979> ring<00:04:59.340> it

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
sensor add only scan Z infinity ring it

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:07.640 
sensor add only scan Z infinity ring it
does<00:04:59.610> only<00:04:59.759> scan<00:04:59.969> anything<00:05:00.300> else<00:05:00.770> so<00:05:06.500> so<00:05:07.500> it'll

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
does only scan anything else so so it'll

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.920 
does only scan anything else so so it'll
say<00:05:07.800> turn<00:05:08.039> on<00:05:08.069> and<00:05:08.550> that<00:05:09.029> switches<00:05:09.479> it<00:05:09.629> so<00:05:09.779> you

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
say turn on and that switches it so you

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.659 
say turn on and that switches it so you
now<00:05:10.020> use<00:05:10.199> it<00:05:10.349> next<00:05:10.469> mode<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.039> you<00:05:13.430> know<00:05:14.430> get

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
now use it next mode so you know get

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.980 
now use it next mode so you know get
slashing<00:05:15.330> noises<00:05:15.509> on<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.930> X<00:05:16.110> mode<00:05:17.689> okay<00:05:18.689> so

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
slashing noises on the X mode okay so

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.629 
slashing noises on the X mode okay so
now<00:05:19.139> what<00:05:19.289> you<00:05:19.409> can<00:05:19.560> do<00:05:19.680> is<00:05:19.800> you<00:05:19.889> can<00:05:19.979> do<00:05:20.189> two

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
now what you can do is you can do two

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.059 
now what you can do is you can do two
final<00:05:20.999> attacks<00:05:21.210> you<00:05:21.419> can<00:05:21.569> do<00:05:21.749> one<00:05:22.710> by<00:05:22.860> pressing

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
final attacks you can do one by pressing

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.490 
final attacks you can do one by pressing
the<00:05:23.460> high<00:05:23.789> touch<00:05:23.999> hand<00:05:24.389> once<00:05:24.719> and<00:05:25.110> then<00:05:25.259> at

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
the high touch hand once and then at

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:42.260 
the high touch hand once and then at
five<00:05:25.680> times<00:05:25.949> so<00:05:26.099> let's<00:05:26.250> do<00:05:26.339> the<00:05:26.430> first<00:05:26.550> one

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.780 

so<00:05:43.270> clearly<00:05:43.630> this<00:05:44.110> thing<00:05:44.410> is<00:05:44.680> a<00:05:44.710> huge<00:05:45.340> fan<00:05:45.760> of

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
so clearly this thing is a huge fan of

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.240 
so clearly this thing is a huge fan of
Kira<00:05:46.360> Ford<00:05:46.630> from<00:05:46.840> Dino<00:05:47.020> Thunder<00:05:47.260> so<00:05:48.100> yeah

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
Kira Ford from Dino Thunder so yeah

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.100 
Kira Ford from Dino Thunder so yeah
that's<00:05:48.550> this<00:05:48.670> high-touch<00:05:49.060> which<00:05:49.300> I'm

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
that's this high-touch which I'm

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.180 
that's this high-touch which I'm
assuming<00:05:50.290> supposed<00:05:50.710> to<00:05:50.800> be<00:05:50.860> high-five<00:05:51.160> I

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
assuming supposed to be high-five I

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.620 
assuming supposed to be high-five I
think<00:05:51.430> they're<00:05:51.520> just<00:05:51.610> not<00:05:51.730> doing<00:05:51.790> direct<00:05:52.330> but

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
think they're just not doing direct but

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.810 
think they're just not doing direct but
so<00:05:52.810> basically<00:05:53.530> high-five<00:05:54.220> minute<00:05:54.460> does<00:05:54.580> that

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
so basically high-five minute does that

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.850 
so basically high-five minute does that
and<00:05:55.060> then<00:05:55.510> if<00:05:55.630> you<00:05:55.720> press<00:05:56.080> it<00:05:56.110> five<00:05:56.380> times<00:05:56.680> it

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
and then if you press it five times it

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:18.180 
and then if you press it five times it
does<00:05:56.950> a<00:05:56.980> different<00:05:57.190> stronger<00:05:58.120> attack

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.790 

all<00:06:18.880> right<00:06:19.060> so<00:06:19.330> that<00:06:19.480> is<00:06:19.510> about<00:06:19.810> it<00:06:20.230> actually

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
all right so that is about it actually

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.380 
all right so that is about it actually
for<00:06:21.010> the<00:06:21.100> functionality<00:06:21.790> that's<00:06:21.970> pretty<00:06:22.210> much

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.390 
for the functionality that's pretty much

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.630 
for the functionality that's pretty much
all<00:06:22.630> of<00:06:22.840> its<00:06:22.960> noises<00:06:23.440> it<00:06:23.590> really<00:06:23.770> doesn't<00:06:24.130> do<00:06:24.370> a

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
all of its noises it really doesn't do a

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.490 
all of its noises it really doesn't do a
whole<00:06:25.030> heck<00:06:25.240> of<00:06:25.360> a<00:06:25.480> lot<00:06:25.510> just<00:06:25.900> a<00:06:25.990> couple<00:06:26.140> final

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
whole heck of a lot just a couple final

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.320 
whole heck of a lot just a couple final
attack<00:06:26.740> noises<00:06:27.130> and<00:06:27.280> standard<00:06:27.610> attack<00:06:27.880> noises

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
attack noises and standard attack noises

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.840 
attack noises and standard attack noises
but<00:06:29.200> so<00:06:29.350> overall<00:06:29.710> I<00:06:29.860> do<00:06:29.920> enjoy<00:06:30.310> this<00:06:30.490> weapon

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
but so overall I do enjoy this weapon

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.100 
but so overall I do enjoy this weapon
like<00:06:31.060> I<00:06:31.180> said<00:06:31.390> at<00:06:31.480> the<00:06:31.570> beginning<00:06:31.690> of<00:06:31.990> the

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
like I said at the beginning of the

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.070 
like I said at the beginning of the
review<00:06:32.260> I<00:06:32.500> do<00:06:33.180> like<00:06:34.180> the<00:06:34.330> design<00:06:34.600> of<00:06:34.630> it<00:06:34.870> quite

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
review I do like the design of it quite

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.870 
review I do like the design of it quite
a<00:06:35.110> bit<00:06:35.230> it<00:06:35.770> looks<00:06:35.920> really<00:06:36.130> cool<00:06:36.340> it's<00:06:36.490> a<00:06:36.550> decent

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
a bit it looks really cool it's a decent

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.820 
a bit it looks really cool it's a decent
size<00:06:36.910> I<00:06:37.390> do<00:06:37.630> like<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:37.900> sounds<00:06:38.230> for<00:06:38.440> and<00:06:38.620> I<00:06:38.650> like

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
size I do like the sounds for and I like

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.400 
size I do like the sounds for and I like
the<00:06:38.950> infinity<00:06:39.400> ring<00:06:39.990> as<00:06:40.990> for<00:06:41.320> like

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
the infinity ring as for like

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.870 
the infinity ring as for like
recommending<00:06:42.040> it<00:06:42.130> it's<00:06:42.250> kind<00:06:42.400> of<00:06:42.430> difficult

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
recommending it it's kind of difficult

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.760 
recommending it it's kind of difficult
because<00:06:43.060> it's<00:06:43.540> kind<00:06:43.750> of<00:06:43.810> expensive<00:06:44.230> and<00:06:44.590> it's

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
because it's kind of expensive and it's

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.890 
because it's kind of expensive and it's
not<00:06:44.950> really<00:06:45.160> all<00:06:45.370> that<00:06:45.400> worth<00:06:45.760> it<00:06:46.030> considering

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
not really all that worth it considering

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.080 
not really all that worth it considering
it<00:06:46.990> doesn't<00:06:47.260> really<00:06:47.350> do<00:06:47.710> that<00:06:47.740> much<00:06:48.430> I<00:06:48.700> mean<00:06:48.730> I

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
it doesn't really do that much I mean I

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.670 
it doesn't really do that much I mean I
don't<00:06:49.570> think<00:06:49.690> it<00:06:49.900> would<00:06:50.020> read<00:06:50.200> all<00:06:50.230> the<00:06:50.470> Rings

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
don't think it would read all the Rings

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.560 
don't think it would read all the Rings
but<00:06:50.980> maybe<00:06:51.220> if<00:06:51.400> it<00:06:51.550> did<00:06:51.730> read<00:06:51.940> some<00:06:52.180> more<00:06:52.360> rings

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
but maybe if it did read some more rings

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.880 
but maybe if it did read some more rings
and<00:06:52.900> do<00:06:52.990> some<00:06:53.170> more<00:06:53.290> things<00:06:53.560> that<00:06:53.740> might<00:06:53.860> be

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
and do some more things that might be

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.860 
and do some more things that might be
hey<00:06:54.400> that<00:06:54.550> rhymed<00:06:54.790> it<00:06:54.970> might<00:06:55.510> be<00:06:55.630> a<00:06:55.660> little

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
hey that rhymed it might be a little

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.960 
hey that rhymed it might be a little
more<00:06:55.990> worth<00:06:56.200> it<00:06:56.350> for<00:06:56.530> the<00:06:56.620> price<00:06:56.860> so<00:06:57.580> I<00:06:57.610> can

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
more worth it for the price so I can

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.570 
more worth it for the price so I can
recommend<00:06:58.330> it<00:06:58.630> if<00:06:58.840> you<00:06:59.110> are<00:06:59.340> going<00:07:00.340> to<00:07:00.430> be

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
recommend it if you are going to be

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.400 
recommend it if you are going to be
collecting<00:07:00.940> all<00:07:01.060> the<00:07:01.180> wizard<00:07:01.450> stuff<00:07:01.750> and<00:07:02.080> you

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
collecting all the wizard stuff and you

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.690 
collecting all the wizard stuff and you
know<00:07:02.710> this<00:07:02.800> last<00:07:03.040> thing<00:07:03.220> you<00:07:03.280> need<00:07:03.430> might<00:07:03.640> as

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
know this last thing you need might as

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.040 
know this last thing you need might as
well<00:07:03.790> get<00:07:03.940> it<00:07:04.120> it's<00:07:04.270> pretty<00:07:04.510> neat<00:07:04.720> I<00:07:04.870> don't

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050 
well get it it's pretty neat I don't

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.360 
well get it it's pretty neat I don't
think<00:07:05.170> you'll<00:07:05.260> be<00:07:05.350> that<00:07:05.470> disappointed<00:07:06.010> it's

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
think you'll be that disappointed it's

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.920 
think you'll be that disappointed it's
kind<00:07:06.580> of<00:07:06.670> a<00:07:06.760> cool<00:07:06.940> weapon<00:07:07.270> to<00:07:07.360> own<00:07:07.510> and<00:07:07.750> you<00:07:07.810> get

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
kind of a cool weapon to own and you get

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.840 
kind of a cool weapon to own and you get
the<00:07:08.050> cool<00:07:08.230> ring<00:07:08.440> and<00:07:08.740> the<00:07:09.190> weapon<00:07:09.430> itself<00:07:09.730> is

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:09.850 
the cool ring and the weapon itself is

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.820 
the cool ring and the weapon itself is
cool<00:07:10.060> but<00:07:10.600> if<00:07:10.690> you<00:07:10.810> are<00:07:10.930> on<00:07:10.960> more<00:07:11.260> of<00:07:11.380> a<00:07:11.440> budget

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:11.830 
cool but if you are on more of a budget

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.470 
cool but if you are on more of a budget
I<00:07:11.950> think<00:07:12.190> it's<00:07:12.310> a<00:07:12.430> relatively<00:07:12.850> easy<00:07:13.060> skip

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.480 
I think it's a relatively easy skip

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.060 
I think it's a relatively easy skip
unless<00:07:14.110> you're<00:07:14.290> super<00:07:14.620> in<00:07:14.710> love<00:07:14.740> with<00:07:15.010> the

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.070 
unless you're super in love with the

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.700 
unless you're super in love with the
noises<00:07:15.280> or<00:07:15.520> something<00:07:16.110> you<00:07:17.110> can<00:07:17.230> get<00:07:17.560> the

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710 
noises or something you can get the

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.080 
noises or something you can get the
Infinity<00:07:18.100> ring<00:07:18.130> by<00:07:18.400> other<00:07:18.580> means<00:07:18.790> I<00:07:19.030> believe

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.090 
Infinity ring by other means I believe

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.940 
Infinity ring by other means I believe
I'm<00:07:19.780> gonna<00:07:19.990> probably<00:07:20.170> beat<00:07:20.410> some<00:07:20.560> other<00:07:20.680> sets

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:20.950 
I'm gonna probably beat some other sets

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.710 
I'm gonna probably beat some other sets
so<00:07:21.280> yeah<00:07:21.520> it's<00:07:22.300> kind<00:07:22.510> of<00:07:22.540> a<00:07:22.630> weird

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 
so yeah it's kind of a weird

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.570 
so yeah it's kind of a weird
recommendation<00:07:23.320> cuz<00:07:23.470> I<00:07:23.560> do<00:07:23.620> enjoy<00:07:23.860> it<00:07:24.190> but<00:07:24.400> if

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.580 
recommendation cuz I do enjoy it but if

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.900 
recommendation cuz I do enjoy it but if
you're<00:07:24.760> trying<00:07:25.480> to<00:07:25.720> save<00:07:26.050> your<00:07:26.230> money<00:07:26.380> and

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:26.910 
you're trying to save your money and

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.100 
you're trying to save your money and
picking<00:07:27.910> and<00:07:28.000> choosing<00:07:28.090> what<00:07:28.419> you<00:07:28.540> buy<00:07:28.720> it's

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110 
picking and choosing what you buy it's

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.310 
picking and choosing what you buy it's
not<00:07:29.320> like<00:07:29.470> an<00:07:29.620> absolute<00:07:30.220> must-have<00:07:30.990> but<00:07:31.990> it<00:07:32.169> is

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.320 
not like an absolute must-have but it is

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.510 
not like an absolute must-have but it is
a<00:07:32.350> cool<00:07:32.680> up<00:07:32.860> in<00:07:33.010> half
