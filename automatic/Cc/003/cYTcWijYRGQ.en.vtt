00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:13.410
 And there, the beauty of the day here is a good one. 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.599
 this video that is not in that 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.670
 questions and answers is different was the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.160
 that has been indicated and has been 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.960
 only five questions and so question 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.029
 that I did not fail in that video so 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.529
 I think it's nice because then 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.000
 description will have five more people 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.769
 kanu the button and that's it 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.750
 I do not know yet but yes, they can 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.189
 give good also wanted to talk to 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.829
 today is starting an event in 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.270
 united states is comic-with 2013 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.730
 It does not have much to do with this car here. 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.430
 right over a legal event also why 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.469
 I enjoyed living abroad as a 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.360
 it was in the other video the staff asked 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.860
 enough for me to want where I would like 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.870
 live six states 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.000
 already tried twice and could not 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.670
 seen but i will keep trying 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.649
 there is tv live sigh no more will have to 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.699
 leave 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.190
 So that's it , folks, let's go there. 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.620
 First question here which console is more 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.719
 He scored seven times hell of 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.510
 answer because it was not just one 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.939
 various phases of life as soon as you do 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.830
 the difference there all all questions 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.020
 what have he done to me but to me? 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.100
 in case no video game would be Felipe 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.330
 not leave arcade boy speaks right 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.310
 because when he was young and his mother could not 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.259
 to give a video game and not everyone I 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.030
 I knew there were sometimes my cousin and my 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.130
 cousin sometimes had in his house 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.060
 even then sometimes I would play the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.229
 phenomenon linked to the immense 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.079
 run there by felipe 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.470
 sometimes the school plays in the Olympic or 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.750
 while I want it to always be the currency 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.600
 it is not even the time of the cruise and 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.390
 not even know it right then took the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.549
 I cruise on and play but it's out 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.100
 there is another time also that the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.189
 run away from the cups play and it was not fifa already 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.079
 was in the era of nintendo 64 and a lousy 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.640
 also then it will be difficult 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.250
 I suppose the most marked was by the cuteness 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.630
 federal release a motherfucker 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.560
 the second question as the type of juca 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.170
 does not like 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.239
 This is a secret but the game that I do not 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.800
 I like no way and it's played like that 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.960
 First-person shooter 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.820
 the men who changed this I did not like 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.050
 Way no field but I do not like it 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.570
 even that's how soccer do not like 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.050
 the goal also does not like 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.180
 Let me think of another video speaks 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.220
 about this but if the borges plays this way and 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.750
 first-person shooter did not like alone 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.460
 I was the little hand of the character I 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.590
 stresses I like more games in third 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.570
 person got character 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.610
 so kind an adventure game is five 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.500
 But she likes but how do I like her? 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.230
 football first person games 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.190
 only the men I like to talk about 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.410
 other video 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.150
 Well the third question is which game? 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.700
 What else do I hope this year? 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.620
 Good thing that encouraged me the most was this. 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.360
 gt a very crazy sgf 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.550
 I confess that I played a little more 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.110
 I did not like it, so I felt like it. 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.680
 to play but when I started playing me 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.930
 I got excited 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.740
 there I did not have a chance to test a 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.540
 multiplayer 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.670
 I can not say also have to go back 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.730
 in this game to test that when 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.950
 it was when i had an xbox it was pirate 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.710
 I played a little bit alone and did not play with 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.450
 I could not play online at the time 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.170
 so I played a little bit and as an online sheet 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.360
 I tested and I did not like it, but sandro 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.350
 I really liked how the game was scored. 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.220
 everybody, right? 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.890
 I wait 56 to 51 and detonate the fourth 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.260
 question is difficult with the best 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.620
 console video game producer 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.310
 That video game is hard the guys 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.480
 but then I already said I'm a fan of ps3 but 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.690
 Unfortunately, you have to say that 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.680
 microsoft point the xbox 360 was a 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.510
 little better 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.040
 There are many things I've thought of doing. 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.180
 video comparing as soon as you have it 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.500
 Good, what is so bad? 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.840
 If you want me to make this video 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.239
 It's just a comment and so much of it now. 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.520
 thing to speak the tip at the good point 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.650
 negative for each one but I do not think 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.870
 moment between the singer speaks of ps 4 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.620
 when xbox onu 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.940
 I think the xbox is a little better it's in 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.790
 another video to speak too 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.739
 because it's whole and how many have 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.130
 questions there asking what I wanted 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.200
 first will be ps4 and xbox one year 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.690
 I respond I intend to have both 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.240
 but I think it will be the first not ps4 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.480
 it has a condition in fact of things 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.810
 where you have none 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.490
 but I will strive to have good ps4 to 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.990
 fifth and last question quite 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.840
 difficult too 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.080
 with the game more marked his childhood this 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.300
 difficult childhood, even so, I'm new 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.230
 with more I played sonic this milestone 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.620
 Pretty low so that 's how I said it 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.480
 Sometimes I missed school to play. 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.550
 I went with my friends and we played 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.520
 like that no, she does not know what's her name 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.990
 this but the pink school but full of 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.270
 videogame I do not know how it is that the same 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.940
 home the game to be there had no name was 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.690
 As soon as I got there I had 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.460
 I understand 64 type load so it was almost 96 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.180
 it generates every day is a friend of mine to 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.490
 people play 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.810
 this method at the time was very good 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.210
 win this game 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.490
 Today I will not even tell the truth, I will not even 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.130
 I've got this game, I've been thinking about it for a year. 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.410
 a close but I think the line alone 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.780
 first instrument was the first 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.700
 second game was very good, very cool 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.950
 play dress copy the channel 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.780
 This one also marked but same childhood 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.460
 first time playing was only then that not 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.880
 smoke played in my childhood type 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.640
 so ten years later it was 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.380
 where this method pretty good guys 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.440
 during the video was thinking the following 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.460
 here I could indicate and go 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.100
 be as follows 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.930
 turn and move I get a message asking 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.820
 help just asking for help helps me 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.430
 grow and this here the marginally 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.710
 some do not have type condition so oo 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.150
 video sometimes does not ruin the 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.060
 audio is bad 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.070
 understood then I'll do the following 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.680
 Felipe had already advised him to indicate 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.960
 so will when felipe and others 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.730
 four people I'll think about here I 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.170
 I'll see who sent me a message. 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.730
 indicating there 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.190
 so you can also meet and 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.340
 evaluate with evaluating the channel 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.860
 I think it's cool, I 'm doing it. 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.140
 I hope you are also helping the staff 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.950
 asked for help then I'll show you your channel 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.080
 ae 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.750
 It's with you, then, the people I do not even know 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.520
 I do not even know if I deserve help because I 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.550
 come over a friend, my neighbor but there 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.170
 every opportunity is with you if you 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.969
 will see the channel if you think it deserves to be 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:37.099
 subscribed and we are going to go there with you 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:38.869
 I'll still know something else, the guy asked. 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:40.489
 helps but sometimes the guy or entered the 

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:42.889
 Your channel is asking for help for love. 

00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:44.539
 of God then indicating people who 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.339
 I will meet some I already know so 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.779
 modify the people I do not even know then 

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:49.699
 Let's see if the guy follows the 

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:53.269
 suddenly more indicated know that there is 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.769
 one night nothing then come on then 

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:57.019
 I hope I have helped because here not all 

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:58.579
 but here I will not always do 

00:06:57.019 --> 00:06:59.569
 It's understood, everybody's asking. 

00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:01.549
 help 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.529
 As I said already as I already told you 

00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:04.939
 some you have to help yourself 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:07.129
 if you do not have much video like that 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:08.929
 will be disclosed guy who has made the 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:11.719
 channel made a video to help me when 

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:13.189
 nor has it as it does not always have logic 

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:15.169
 that help if you do video tries to improve 

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:16.789
 you by yourself that my comment 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.169
 here my comment is not good but look the 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:19.729
 first video to see the difference 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:21.439
 my audi was good too but I was speaking 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.759
 in the first video in which my 

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:25.519
 image here talk my first video 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.929
 understood all this has been improving 

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:28.610
 if someone had indicated it is the first 

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:30.379
 video maybe a tank today because the 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.939
 but a video in a bar when 

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:34.969
 the bomb is fine, I have signed up for 

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:37.009
 first then my comment is to be
