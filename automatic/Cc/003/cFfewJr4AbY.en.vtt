00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
place a block actually yeah a block and

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.480 
place a block actually yeah a block and
on<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> top<00:01:57.390> you're<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.750> put<00:01:58.490> redstone

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
on the top you're going to put redstone

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
so now you're going to want to go out a

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.130 
so now you're going to want to go out a
bit

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
bit

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.589 
bit
and<00:02:14.140> right<00:02:14.800> here<00:02:15.010> say<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:16.120> want<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.360> build<00:02:16.540> a

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
and right here say you want to build a

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.000 
and right here say you want to build a
little<00:02:16.720> structure<00:02:17.319> this<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.739> structure

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
little structure this is the structure

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.300 
little structure this is the structure
which<00:02:18.790> in<00:02:19.330> theory<00:02:20.170> will<00:02:20.440> be<00:02:20.560> much<00:02:20.800> bigger<00:02:21.010> or

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
which in theory will be much bigger or

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.510 
which in theory will be much bigger or
it<00:02:21.459> could<00:02:21.550> be<00:02:21.640> even<00:02:21.730> be<00:02:21.970> underground<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.780> you

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
it could be even be underground and you

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.210 
it could be even be underground and you
can<00:02:24.520> put<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> button<00:02:24.970> right<00:02:25.150> here<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:26.220> you're

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
let me get a minecart where is my mind

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.770 
let me get a minecart where is my mind
cart<00:03:26.459> nope<00:03:30.180> probably<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:31.239> looking<00:03:31.600> right<00:03:31.750> at

what<00:04:05.019> you're<00:04:05.079> going<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.290> do<00:04:05.440> is<00:04:05.650> you're<00:04:06.609> going

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.379 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:04:06.940> create<00:04:07.359> the<00:04:07.660> exact<00:04:08.370> same<00:04:09.370> thing<00:04:10.090> that<00:04:10.120> we

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
to create the exact same thing that we

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.460 
to create the exact same thing that we
made<00:04:10.600> right<00:04:10.900> over<00:04:11.170> here<00:04:11.350> but<00:04:12.160> on<00:04:12.340> this<00:04:12.670> side<00:04:12.910> so

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
made right over here but on this side so

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.870 
made right over here but on this side so
you're<00:04:14.470> going<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.650> make<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.920> exact<00:04:15.190> replica

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
you're going to make the exact replica

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.969 
you're going to make the exact replica
let's<00:04:16.299> say<00:04:16.419> this<00:04:16.539> is<00:04:16.600> going<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.870> be<00:04:16.989> really<00:04:17.680> far

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
let's say this is going to be really far

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.330 
let's say this is going to be really far
away<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.190> make<00:04:18.549> this<00:04:18.700> half<00:04:19.630> fine<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.799> now<00:04:20.919> make

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
away to make this half fine and now make

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.529 
away to make this half fine and now make
it<00:04:21.430> really<00:04:21.700> far<00:04:21.849> away<00:04:21.970> otherwise<00:04:22.270> it's<00:04:22.510> not

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
it really far away otherwise it's not

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:23.640 
it really far away otherwise it's not
really<00:04:22.810> worth<00:04:22.990> it<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.169> could<00:04:23.289> just<00:04:23.380> walk

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
really worth it you could just walk

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.670 
really worth it you could just walk
right<00:04:23.919> across<00:04:24.640> but<00:04:25.120> for<00:04:25.659> example<00:04:25.960> purposes

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.050 

yeah<00:04:29.680> we're<00:04:30.310> just<00:04:30.490> going<00:04:30.699> to<00:04:30.729> have<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:30.970> right

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
yeah we're just going to have it right

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.180 
yeah we're just going to have it right
there<00:04:31.300> so<00:04:31.810> you're<00:04:32.380> basically<00:04:32.620> gonna<00:04:32.889> make<00:04:33.069> the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
there so you're basically gonna make the

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.249 
there so you're basically gonna make the
same<00:04:33.400> exact<00:04:33.849> structure<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.509> that<00:04:35.319> side<00:04:36.000> um<00:04:37.259> and

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
same exact structure on that side um and

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.550 
same exact structure on that side um and
that's<00:04:38.410> pretty<00:04:38.590> much<00:04:38.710> how<00:04:38.949> you<00:04:38.979> make<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:40.560> yeah

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
that's pretty much how you make it yeah

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.659 
that's pretty much how you make it yeah
