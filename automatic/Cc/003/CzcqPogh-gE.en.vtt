00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.360
 Darkness is in my heart. 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.840
 From the past left, nowhere to go. 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.140
 It’s as if I’m not there. 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.720
 There is smoke, but there is no more fire. 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.000
 All life is a constant darkness. 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.840
 No tears, from them only bitterness on the lips. 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.160
 No words, no strength 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.580
 The whole world is not nice. 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.840
 I do not understand how I lived in this darkness. 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.960
 Not reflected in the mirrors 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.080
 In the photo, only a shadow remains, 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.420
 And this endless fear in the eyes 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.120
 Laugh in the face of fate 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.380
 And boldly I will give myself. 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.240
 Yes, yes, yes, one always, 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.140
 But it does not matter. 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.520
 In another tomorrow 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.980
 I leave suddenly 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.720
 This is my world for many years. 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.360
 There I am loved and happy. 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.600
 It's just my life. 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.760
 There was peace in black clouds, 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.340
 But the wind dispersed them. Suns bright beam 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.360
 My path illuminated me. 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.360
 I don’t know how I used to live in darkness. 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.680
 All life became instantly different 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 I have changed myself and everything around with me, 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.980
 And there is no darkness in it, 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.120
 Only peace, only light. 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.540
 I guessed the fate of a secret. 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.240
 And the voices of my friends 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.100
 Make my world brighter, 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.100
 And I want to make them happier. 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.920
 Laugh in the face of fate 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.380
 And boldly I will give myself. 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.880
 Yes, yes, yes, and believe, do not believe 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.660
 I'm not alone now. 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.960
 In another tomorrow 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.820
 I leave suddenly 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.340
 This is my world without sorrow and loss. 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.120
 There I am loved and happy. 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.200
 It's just my life. 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.420
 Laugh in the face of fate 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.980
 And boldly I will give myself. 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.740
 Yes, yes, yes, and believe, do not believe 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.720
 I'm not alone now. 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.860
 In another tomorrow 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.540
 I leave suddenly 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.700
 This is my world without sorrow and loss. 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.020
 There I am loved and happy. 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.360
 It's just my life 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.120
 Laugh in the face of fate 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.380
 And boldly I will give myself. 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.180
 Yes, yes, yes, and friendship light 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.740
 The pledge of my victories. 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.120
 In another tomorrow 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.540
 I leave suddenly 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.420
 This is my bright world, its more beautiful there. 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.840
 There I am loved and happy. 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.340
 It's just my life
