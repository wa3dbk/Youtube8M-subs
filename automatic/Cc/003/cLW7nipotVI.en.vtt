00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
Graham here and in this video I am going

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.620 
Graham here and in this video I am going
to<00:00:10.380> talk<00:00:10.530> about<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.980> camera<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.269> galaxy

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
to talk about the camera of the galaxy

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.690 
to talk about the camera of the galaxy
grant<00:00:12.840> now<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.200> camera<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.860> an<00:00:14.160> 8<00:00:14.340> megapixel

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
grant now the camera is an 8 megapixel

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.510 
grant now the camera is an 8 megapixel
sensor<00:00:15.299> with<00:00:15.599> LED<00:00:15.929> flash<00:00:16.139> autofocus<00:00:16.520> it's

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
sensor with LED flash autofocus it's

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.890 
sensor with LED flash autofocus it's
obviously<00:00:17.880> got<00:00:18.000> touched<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.300> focus<00:00:18.600> as<00:00:18.720> well

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
obviously got touched to focus as well

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.630 
obviously got touched to focus as well

videos at 30 frames per second now the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.779 
videos at 30 frames per second now the
front<00:00:24.000> camera<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> 2<00:00:25.019> megapixel<00:00:25.460> VT<00:00:26.460> camera

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
front camera is a 2 megapixel VT camera

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.179 
front camera is a 2 megapixel VT camera
and<00:00:27.019> it's<00:00:28.019> 2<00:00:28.170> megapixel<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.800> know<00:00:28.890> better

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
and it's 2 megapixel you know better

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.669 
and it's 2 megapixel you know better
than<00:00:29.369> even<00:00:29.490> galaxy<00:00:29.910> note<00:00:30.090> 2<00:00:30.269> which<00:00:30.420> has<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.679> 1.9

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
than even galaxy note 2 which has a 1.9

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.799 
than even galaxy note 2 which has a 1.9
megapixel<00:00:31.830> camera<00:00:32.520> front<00:00:32.790> camera<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
megapixel camera front camera so you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.620 
megapixel camera front camera so you
know<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.290> quite<00:00:34.680> good<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:35.420> video<00:00:36.420> calls

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
know it's quite good for video calls

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.869 
know it's quite good for video calls
anyway<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.410> again<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> back<00:00:38.280> you've<00:00:38.670> got

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
anyway so again at the back you've got

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.119 
anyway so again at the back you've got
the<00:00:38.969> LED<00:00:39.239> flash<00:00:39.719> right<00:00:39.960> there<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.829> 8

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the LED flash right there the 8

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.819 
the LED flash right there the 8
megapixel<00:00:41.610> sensor<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:43.530> know<00:00:43.590> that's

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
megapixel sensor and you know that's

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.700 
megapixel sensor and you know that's
pretty<00:00:44.100> much<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> hardware<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:46.530> let's

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
pretty much about the hardware so let's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.500 
pretty much about the hardware so let's
get<00:00:46.829> inside<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.370> camera<00:00:47.879> user<00:00:48.030> interface

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
get inside the camera user interface

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.049 
get inside the camera user interface
you've<00:00:48.690> got<00:00:48.899> these<00:00:49.020> controls<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> left

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
you've got these controls in the left

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.250 
you've got these controls in the left
nothing's<00:00:51.059> new<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> same

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
nothing's new about that it's the same

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.900 
nothing's new about that it's the same
and<00:00:52.500> you've<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> gallery<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> right

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
and you've got the gallery on the right

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.810 
and you've got the gallery on the right
you've<00:00:54.120> got<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> shutter<00:00:54.600> key<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:56.730> know

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
you've got the shutter key and you know

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.029 
you've got the shutter key and you know
which<00:00:56.969> takes<00:00:57.210> fairly<00:00:57.660> quick<00:00:57.899> pictures<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
which takes fairly quick pictures as you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.130 
which takes fairly quick pictures as you
can<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> lag<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.239> quiet<00:01:00.660> less<00:01:00.960> it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
can see that the lag is quiet less it's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.429 
can see that the lag is quiet less it's
not<00:01:01.289> 0<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.730> fairly<00:01:03.420> low<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.750> then

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
not 0 but it's a fairly low and then

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.899 
not 0 but it's a fairly low and then
you've<00:01:04.559> got<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> toggle<00:01:05.220> between<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.700> video

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
you've got a toggle between the video

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.250 
you've got a toggle between the video
camera<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> camera<00:01:06.720> now<00:01:06.960> when<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.170> go

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
camera on the camera now when you go

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.890 
camera on the camera now when you go
inside<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.619> gallery<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.630> take<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> little

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
inside the gallery so just take a little

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.560 
inside the gallery so just take a little
wide<00:01:10.140> open<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> first<00:01:10.799> time<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.450> as<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
wide open for the first time and as you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.030 
wide open for the first time and as you
can<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.409> know<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.740> does<00:01:14.010> take

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
can see that you know it does take

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
helpful for me at least and look at the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.130 
helpful for me at least and look at the
detail<00:03:37.220> really<00:03:38.220> nice<00:03:38.400> right<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.330> again<00:03:39.900> this

camera<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.560> not<00:03:40.680> going<00:03:40.740> to<00:03:40.920> let<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.100> down<00:03:41.280> just

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
camera is not going to let you down just

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.090 
camera is not going to let you down just
just<00:03:41.790> look<00:03:41.970> at<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.239> bubbles<00:03:42.600> right<00:03:42.780> there<00:03:43.100> so

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
just look at the bubbles right there so

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.920 
just look at the bubbles right there so
the<00:03:44.160> pictures<00:03:44.520> have<00:03:44.790> quite<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> bit<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.780> detail

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
the pictures have quite a bit of detail

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.140 
the pictures have quite a bit of detail
anyway<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.040> gap<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.400> camera<00:03:47.670> overall<00:03:48.000> is

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
anyway so the gap the camera overall is

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.490 
anyway so the gap the camera overall is
really<00:03:48.390> nice<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.780> galaxy<00:03:49.110> grand<00:03:49.290> and
