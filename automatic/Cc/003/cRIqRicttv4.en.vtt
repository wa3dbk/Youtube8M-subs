distances<00:02:53.950> because<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.520> Challenger<00:02:55.060> needs

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
distances because the Challenger needs

distances because the Challenger needs
Highway<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.260> breathe<00:02:56.800> because<00:02:57.370> there's<00:02:57.730> a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
Highway to breathe because there's a

wide ass car minding the centerline is

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.120 
wide ass car minding the centerline is
distracting<00:03:01.780> on<00:03:01.900> tight<00:03:02.170> roads<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:02.830> these

distracting on tight roads like these

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.980 
distracting on tight roads like these
but<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.640> will<00:03:03.850> concede<00:03:04.209> it's<00:03:04.420> not<00:03:04.600> impossible

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
but I will concede it's not impossible

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.820 
but I will concede it's not impossible
because<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:06.490> isn't<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:07.360> muscle<00:03:07.959> car<00:03:08.170> what<00:03:08.709> is

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
because this isn't a muscle car what is
