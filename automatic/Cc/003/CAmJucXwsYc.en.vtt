since<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> ending<00:00:29.580> sequence<00:00:30.110> and<00:00:31.110> trying

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.440 
since the ending sequence and trying

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.200 
since the ending sequence and trying
several<00:00:32.040> things<00:00:32.400> to<00:00:32.489> start<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> ending

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
several things to start the ending

several things to start the ending
sequence<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:34.760> unfortunately<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.850> doesn't

sequence but unfortunately it doesn't

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.500 
sequence but unfortunately it doesn't
