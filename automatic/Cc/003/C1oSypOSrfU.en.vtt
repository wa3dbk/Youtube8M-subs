I<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.370> eaten<00:01:02.579> strawberries<00:01:03.359> growing<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.379> the

I have eaten strawberries growing in the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.160 
I have eaten strawberries growing in the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
greenhouse in the winter in Japan and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.620 
greenhouse in the winter in Japan and
first<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:08.310> look<00:01:08.520> beautiful<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.240> mean<00:01:09.510> they

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
first they look beautiful I mean they

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.940 
first they look beautiful I mean they
were<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.140> beautiful<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.680> couldn't

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
were just so beautiful I couldn't

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.170 
were just so beautiful I couldn't
believe<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.250> they<00:01:11.430> were<00:01:11.490> gonna<00:01:11.640> taste<00:01:11.909> good

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
believe that they were gonna taste good

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.270 
believe that they were gonna taste good
but<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:12.750> did<00:01:12.990> they<00:01:13.170> tasted<00:01:13.560> really<00:01:13.770> good<00:01:13.920> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
but they did they tasted really good and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
but they did they tasted really good and
one<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.210> reasons<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.659> they<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.229> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
one of the reasons that they do is that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.469 
one of the reasons that they do is that
they're<00:01:16.710> bred<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.909> specific

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
they're bred for that specific

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.899 
they're bred for that specific
production<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.259> they're<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.920> bred<00:01:20.310> for

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
production and they're not bred for

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
production and they're not bred for
shelf<00:01:21.420> life<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:22.110> shipping<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:22.830> things<00:01:23.009> like

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
shelf life or shipping or things like

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.330 
shelf life or shipping or things like
that<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.509> fact<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.340> created

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that so the fact that they are created

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.640 
that so the fact that they are created
to<00:01:26.369> perform<00:01:27.240> well<00:01:27.509> under<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.930> circumstances

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
to perform well under the circumstances

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.429 
to perform well under the circumstances
is<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.829> reason<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.400> reason<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.759> they

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
is a reason that one reason that they

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.859 
is a reason that one reason that they
look<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.650> good<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:31.860> taste<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.700> good<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.689> in

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
look so good and taste so good that in

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.240 
look so good and taste so good that in
addition<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> skill<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> growers

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
addition to the skill of the growers

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.679 
addition to the skill of the growers
have<00:01:35.430> been<00:01:35.490> doing<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.180> few<00:01:36.479> people

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
have been doing it for so few people

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.530 
have been doing it for so few people
know<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.159> Phoenix<00:01:38.159> Arizona<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.180> leader

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
know that Phoenix Arizona was a leader

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.960 
know that Phoenix Arizona was a leader
in<00:01:39.750> growing<00:01:39.990> strawberries<00:01:40.820> starting<00:01:41.820> during

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
in growing strawberries starting during

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.560 
in growing strawberries starting during
the<00:01:42.270> territorial<00:01:42.899> days<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.380> into<00:01:43.820> 1960<00:01:44.820> they

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the territorial days up into 1960 they

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.420 
the territorial days up into 1960 they
had<00:01:45.780> strawberries<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.380> were<00:01:46.680> for<00:01:46.890> export

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
had strawberries that were for export

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.179 
had strawberries that were for export
but<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.509> know<00:01:48.689> what<00:01:48.869> happened<00:01:49.380> urbanization

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
but you know what happened urbanization

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.100 
but you know what happened urbanization
happened<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.149> Phoenix<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.720> started

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
happened in Phoenix and we started

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.230 
happened in Phoenix and we started
losing<00:01:52.290> land<00:01:52.710> because<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.700> was<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> best

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
losing land because that was the best

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.200 
losing land because that was the best
land<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:55.110> build<00:01:55.350> houses<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:55.979> easiest<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.060> make

easiest to make the roads and that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.929 
easiest to make the roads and that
shifted<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.320> strawberry<00:02:01.799> production<00:02:02.009> over

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
shifted that strawberry production over

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.730 
shifted that strawberry production over
to<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> coast<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.630> California<00:02:03.780> sorry<00:02:04.500> we

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
was that we

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.500 
was that we
had<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.409> strawberry<00:02:13.890> production<00:02:14.280> long<00:02:14.879> time

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
had a strawberry production long time

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.880 
had a strawberry production long time
ago<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.349> first<00:02:16.560> thing<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:17.010> saw<00:02:17.430> was<00:02:17.849> produce

crepe label and that was out of 1943 and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.410 
crepe label and that was out of 1943 and
then<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.040> started<00:02:26.489> looking<00:02:26.670> for<00:02:26.909> more

I've<00:03:03.150> been<00:03:03.299> in<00:03:03.420> California<00:03:03.599> in<00:03:04.379> a<00:03:04.709> berry<00:03:04.920> field

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
I've been in California in a berry field

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.250 
I've been in California in a berry field
and<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.970> clam<00:03:06.180> shell<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.660> was<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:07.019> pulled

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
and the clam shell that was just pulled

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.930 
and the clam shell that was just pulled
off<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.890> palette<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.459> was<00:03:08.579> going<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.819> be

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
off the palette that was going to be

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.849 
off the palette that was going to be
shipped<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.170> berries<00:03:10.470> tasted

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
shipped and and the berries tasted

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:11.330 
shipped and and the berries tasted
pretty<00:03:10.980> good

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
pretty good

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.449 
pretty good
but<00:03:12.299> that<00:03:12.870> berry<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.319> going<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> be<00:03:13.739> stuck<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
but that berry is going to be stuck on a

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.580 
but that berry is going to be stuck on a
pallet<00:03:14.940> stuck<00:03:15.239> on<00:03:15.359> a<00:03:15.390> truck<00:03:15.720> shipped<00:03:16.379> to<00:03:16.560> a

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
pallet stuck on a truck shipped to a

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.159 
pallet stuck on a truck shipped to a
grocery<00:03:16.859> store<00:03:17.450> left<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.690> store<00:03:18.930> until

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
grocery store left in the store until

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.470 
grocery store left in the store until
somebody<00:03:19.620> buys<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.340> after<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.180> amount

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
somebody buys it and after that amount

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.720 
somebody buys it and after that amount
of<00:03:21.599> time<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.530> quality<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.069> that<00:03:23.099> that

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
of time that the quality of that that

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.150 
of time that the quality of that that
fruit<00:03:24.359> starts<00:03:24.599> to<00:03:24.780> degrade<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:25.139> little<00:03:25.470> bit<00:03:25.650> and

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
fruit starts to degrade a little bit and

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.900 
fruit starts to degrade a little bit and
so<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.430> flavors<00:03:27.889> hydroponics<00:03:28.910> strawberry

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
so the flavors hydroponics strawberry

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.229 
so the flavors hydroponics strawberry
production<00:03:30.540> doesn't<00:03:30.810> require<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:31.980> much<00:03:32.609> of

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
production doesn't require that much of

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.319 
production doesn't require that much of
water<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.290> can<00:03:34.560> save<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:34.889> water<00:03:35.329> another

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
water so you can save the water another

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.750 
water so you can save the water another
thing<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.079> don't<00:03:37.200> have<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.799> fumigate<00:03:38.190> or

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
thing is you don't have to fumigate or

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.110 
thing is you don't have to fumigate or
you<00:03:38.940> don't<00:03:39.120> have<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.450> sterilize<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.260> soil<00:03:40.560> and

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
you don't have to sterilize the soil and

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.629 
you don't have to sterilize the soil and
also<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:42.239> protected<00:03:42.959> therefore<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:44.519> know

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
also it's protected therefore you know

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.490 
also it's protected therefore you know
you<00:03:44.700> can<00:03:44.970> reduce<00:03:45.329> or<00:03:45.720> eliminate<00:03:45.900> completely

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
you can reduce or eliminate completely

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.680 
you can reduce or eliminate completely
the<00:03:47.010> pesticide<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.910> also<00:03:48.239> it's<00:03:48.389> a<00:03:48.480> raised

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
the pesticide and also it's a raised

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.589 
the pesticide and also it's a raised
trap<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.859> workers<00:03:50.310> don't<00:03:50.760> need<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.180> bend<00:03:51.359> over

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
trap so workers don't need to bend over

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.930 
trap so workers don't need to bend over
to<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.500> crop<00:03:52.799> so<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.459> controlled

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
to the crop so the controlled

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.520 
to the crop so the controlled
environment<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.780> can<00:03:54.989> control<00:03:55.380> the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
environment you can control the

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.909 
environment you can control the
temperature<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.519> humidity<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.560> level

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
temperature and humidity to the level

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.890 
temperature and humidity to the level
strawberry<00:03:59.639> like<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.450> can<00:04:00.629> produce

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
strawberry like you can produce

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.170 
strawberry like you can produce
strawberries<00:04:01.769> in<00:04:02.099> winter<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.639> Arizona<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.120> a

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
strawberries in winter so Arizona is a

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.150 
strawberries in winter so Arizona is a
great<00:04:03.450> place<00:04:03.690> for<00:04:03.720> winter<00:04:04.230> production<00:04:04.859> so<00:04:05.099> as

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
great place for winter production so as

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.789 
great place for winter production so as
long<00:04:05.340> as<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:05.760> have<00:04:06.000> system<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:07.410> can<00:04:07.620> produce

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
long as you have system you can produce

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.369 
long as you have system you can produce
very<00:04:08.160> nice<00:04:08.790> high<00:04:09.120> quality<00:04:09.379> strawberries
