itself much better to a video game as

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.290 
itself much better to a video game as

it's a lot more physical and that some

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.580 
it's a lot more physical and that some
of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.220> actions<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.150> mimic<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.410> real

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
of the actions you can do mimic the real

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.980 
of the actions you can do mimic the real
life<00:00:52.829> sports<00:00:53.160> much<00:00:53.490> more<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.870> we've

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 
life sports much more and we've

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.990 
life sports much more and we've
obviously<00:00:55.140> also<00:00:55.920> introduced<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> balanced

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
obviously also introduced a balanced

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.210 
obviously also introduced a balanced
board<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.360> you've<00:00:57.510> seen<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.950> balance

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
board as you've seen and the balance

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.590 
board as you've seen and the balance
board<00:00:59.370> allows<00:00:59.610> us<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.060> lot<00:01:00.239> more<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.540> well

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
board allows us to do a lot more as well

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
board allows us to do a lot more as well
with<00:01:00.840> again<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.290> you<00:01:01.380> can<00:01:01.500> imagine

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
