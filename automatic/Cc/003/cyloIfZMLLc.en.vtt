you're trying to advance a bit forward

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.010 
you're trying to advance a bit forward
there's<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:55.940> head<00:02:56.120> glitch<00:02:56.360> here<00:02:56.630> as<00:02:56.750> well<00:02:56.870> and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
there's a head glitch here as well and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.620 
there's a head glitch here as well and
this<00:02:57.110> little<00:02:57.290> set<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.650> stairs<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.340> it's<00:02:59.090> not

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
this little set of stairs it it's not

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.180 
this little set of stairs it it's not
the<00:02:59.870> best<00:03:00.020> position<00:03:00.290> but<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.710> mean<00:03:00.860> it's<00:03:01.010> good

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
the best position but I mean it's good

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.950 
the best position but I mean it's good
for<00:03:01.340> just<00:03:01.490> a<00:03:01.550> one-shot<00:03:01.790> sort<00:03:02.570> of<00:03:02.660> thing<00:03:02.840> that

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
for just a one-shot sort of thing that

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.810 
for just a one-shot sort of thing that
you<00:03:03.050> can<00:03:03.170> pick<00:03:03.380> them<00:03:03.500> off<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:03.950> another<00:03:04.610> good

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
you can pick them off so another good

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.450 
you can pick them off so another good
little<00:03:05.000> spot<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:05.570> I'm<00:03:05.840> moving<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.400> can

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
little spot and I'm moving to a you can

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.310 
little spot and I'm moving to a you can
capture<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.210> from<00:03:08.420> there's<00:03:08.750> no<00:03:08.870> real<00:03:09.140> good

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
capture it from there's no real good

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.840 
capture it from there's no real good
real<00:03:09.500> position<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.980> capture<00:03:10.280> this<00:03:10.370> flag<00:03:10.640> from

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
real position to capture this flag from

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.520 
real position to capture this flag from
in<00:03:11.030> my<00:03:11.150> opinion<00:03:11.420> but<00:03:11.660> there's<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.230> really

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
in my opinion but there's a really

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.990 
in my opinion but there's a really
really<00:03:12.800> good<00:03:13.010> defender<00:03:13.459> spot<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.760> gives<00:03:13.910> you

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
really good defender spot that gives you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.820 
really good defender spot that gives you
a<00:03:14.060> head<00:03:14.300> glitch<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.780> if<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.350> jump<00:03:15.560> up<00:03:15.680> on

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
a head glitch and if you jump up on

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.230 
a head glitch and if you jump up on
these<00:03:15.950> little<00:03:16.280> boxes<00:03:16.459> here<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.060> you've<00:03:17.150> got

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
these little boxes here and you've got

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.150 
these little boxes here and you've got
your<00:03:17.390> barrel<00:03:17.750> here<00:03:17.990> looking<00:03:18.620> up<00:03:18.770> here<00:03:18.980> you've

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
your barrel here looking up here you've

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.440 
your barrel here looking up here you've
got<00:03:19.220> a<00:03:19.310> full<00:03:19.520> head<00:03:19.730> wedge<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.150> can<00:03:20.300> pick

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
got a full head wedge and you can pick

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.400 
got a full head wedge and you can pick
them<00:03:20.630> off<00:03:20.750> from<00:03:20.870> there<00:03:21.080> whether<00:03:21.230> they're

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
them off from there whether they're

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.260 
them off from there whether they're
going<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.590> run<00:03:21.800> down<00:03:22.160> or<00:03:22.459> doesn't<00:03:23.150> really

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
going to run down or doesn't really

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.340 
going to run down or doesn't really
matter<00:03:23.510> if<00:03:23.630> they're<00:03:23.720> going<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.930> come<00:03:24.080> from<00:03:24.200> the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
matter if they're going to come from the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.080 
matter if they're going to come from the
side<00:03:24.620> here<00:03:24.830> I'd<00:03:24.920> be<00:03:24.950> inclined<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.610> use<00:03:25.820> these

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
side here I'd be inclined to use these

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.940 
side here I'd be inclined to use these
fences<00:03:26.390> a<00:03:26.570> bit<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.840> cover<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:27.260> tend<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:27.830> be<00:03:27.920> a

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
fences a bit of cover you tend to be a

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.070 
fences a bit of cover you tend to be a
bit<00:03:28.010> camouflage<00:03:28.670> through<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.030> can<00:03:29.630> prop<00:03:29.900> down

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
bit camouflage through it can prop down

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.540 
bit camouflage through it can prop down
from<00:03:30.260> this<00:03:30.380> side<00:03:30.590> here<00:03:30.770> it's<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:30.980> bit<00:03:31.100> campy<00:03:31.400> but

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
from this side here it's a bit campy but

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.130 
from this side here it's a bit campy but
I<00:03:31.700> mean<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:31.910> don't<00:03:32.150> have<00:03:32.300> as<00:03:32.540> much<00:03:32.720> cover

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
I mean you don't have as much cover

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.110 
I mean you don't have as much cover
going<00:03:33.470> through<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.830> so<00:03:34.100> talk<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:34.850> you<00:03:34.940> at<00:03:35.030> the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
going through it so talk to you at the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.990 
going through it so talk to you at the
end<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.420> day<00:03:35.540> guys<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.050> um<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:37.100> guess<00:03:37.730> last

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
end of the day guys and um I guess last

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.630 
end of the day guys and um I guess last
but<00:03:38.180> not<00:03:38.330> least<00:03:38.390> i<00:03:38.900> should<00:03:39.290> point<00:03:39.500> out<00:03:39.680> B<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.310> C

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
but not least i should point out B and C

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.699 
but not least i should point out B and C
while<00:03:40.940> they<00:03:41.060> are<00:03:41.239> inside<00:03:41.660> buildings<00:03:42.170> you

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
while they are inside buildings you

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.290 
while they are inside buildings you
actually<00:03:42.920> can<00:03:43.190> get<00:03:43.550> through<00:03:43.730> with<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:43.910> predator

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
actually can get through with a predator

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.430 
actually can get through with a predator
missile<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.690> that's<00:03:44.840> why<00:03:44.989> I've<00:03:45.080> got<00:03:45.200> it<00:03:45.320> on

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
missile and that's why I've got it on
