f-22 now since this lens is an ultra

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.800 
f-22 now since this lens is an ultra
wide-angle<00:01:28.400> lens<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.670> cannot<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> filter

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
wide-angle lens you cannot get a filter

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.289 
wide-angle lens you cannot get a filter
because<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.259> glass<00:01:31.500> bulges<00:01:32.009> out<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.490> little

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
because the glass bulges out a little

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.810 
because the glass bulges out a little
bit<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.430> were<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> take

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
bit so as you can see if I were to take

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.420 
bit so as you can see if I were to take
off<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> lens<00:01:36.240> hood<00:01:36.530> you<00:01:37.530> notice<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.189> Bulge

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
off the lens hood you notice the Bulge

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.969 
off the lens hood you notice the Bulge
in<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.090> glass<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:41.070> lens<00:01:41.310> itself<00:01:42.049> is<00:01:43.049> thick<00:01:43.950> so

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
in the glass the lens itself is thick so

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.580 
in the glass the lens itself is thick so
you<00:01:44.430> cannot<00:01:44.909> remove<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.509> at<00:01:45.840> all<00:01:46.170> whatsoever

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
you cannot remove it at all whatsoever

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.730 
you cannot remove it at all whatsoever
so<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.729> might<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.149> problem<00:01:48.390> for<00:01:48.750> some<00:01:48.990> but

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
so that might be a problem for some but

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.179 
so that might be a problem for some but
if<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.130> look<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> lot<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:52.189> wide-angle

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
if you look at a lot of the wide-angle

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.719 
if you look at a lot of the wide-angle
