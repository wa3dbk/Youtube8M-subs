cytoplasm in this direction this area is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.300 
cytoplasm in this direction this area is

amoeba movement some white blood cells
also<00:01:54.420> move<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:57.890> in<00:01:58.890> plant<00:01:59.310> cells<00:01:59.549> they

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
also move like this in plant cells they

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.420 
also move like this in plant cells they
make<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> sort<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.259> racetrack<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:02.310> the

make a sort of racetrack for the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.819 
make a sort of racetrack for the
cytoplasm<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.210> circulate<00:02:03.689> along<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.740> that's

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
cytoplasm to circulate along so that's

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.499 
cytoplasm to circulate along so that's
called<00:02:05.070> cytoplasmic<00:02:05.369> streaming<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
called cytoplasmic streaming and it

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.740 
called cytoplasmic streaming and it
helps<00:02:06.780> distribution<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:08.450> materials<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.589 

next<00:02:14.879> we<00:02:14.939> can<00:02:14.999> talk<00:02:15.180> about<00:02:15.269> intermediate

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
next we can talk about intermediate

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.559 
next we can talk about intermediate
filaments<00:02:17.090> here's<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.180> picture<00:02:18.450> of

filaments here's a picture of
intermediate<00:02:19.230> filaments<00:02:19.709> they<00:02:19.950> are<00:02:20.129> actually

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
intermediate filaments they are actually

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.989 
intermediate filaments they are actually
out<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.959> three<00:02:21.959> types<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.680> set<00:02:23.519> of<00:02:23.639> sails

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:23.999 
out of the three types of set of sails

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.239 
out of the three types of set of sails
and<00:02:24.209> filaments<00:02:24.749> they're<00:02:25.019> most<00:02:25.859> enduring

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:26.249 
and filaments they're most enduring

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.399 
and filaments they're most enduring
especially<00:02:27.209> after<00:02:27.329> like<00:02:27.569> chemical<00:02:28.019> treatment

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
especially after like chemical treatment

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.670 
especially after like chemical treatment
they'll<00:02:28.920> still<00:02:29.159> be<00:02:29.189> there<00:02:30.109> they're<00:02:31.109> there<00:02:31.530> in

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
they'll still be there they're there in

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.259 
they'll still be there they're there in
like<00:02:31.859> dead<00:02:32.129> skin<00:02:32.400> cells<00:02:32.639> and<00:02:32.790> stuff<00:02:33.030> so

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
like dead skin cells and stuff so

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.360 
like dead skin cells and stuff so
there's<00:02:33.629> usually<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.989> layer<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.409> these<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:35.219> your

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
there's usually a layer of these on your

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.360 
there's usually a layer of these on your
skin<00:02:37.849> so<00:02:38.849> here's<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.209> structure

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.630 
microfilaments intermediate filaments
microtubules<00:05:38.570> that<00:05:38.720> work<00:05:39.140> together<00:05:39.640> without

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
microtubules that work together without

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.000 
microtubules that work together without
them<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.540> cylinders<00:05:42.020> its<00:05:42.200> structure<00:05:42.620> its

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
them the cylinders its structure its

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.910 
them the cylinders its structure its
ability<00:05:43.430> to<00:05:44.320> resist<00:05:45.320> tension<00:05:45.740> and

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
ability to resist tension and

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.980 
ability to resist tension and
compression<00:05:47.020> lose<00:05:48.020> its<00:05:48.200> ability<00:05:48.560> to<00:05:48.590> move

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
compression lose its ability to move

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.480 
compression lose its ability to move
things<00:05:50.990> like<00:05:51.230> that<00:05:51.440> a<00:05:51.680> lot<00:05:52.160> of<00:05:52.310> cell

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
things like that a lot of cell

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.900 
things like that a lot of cell
circulation<00:05:53.030> would<00:05:53.600> be<00:05:53.870> it<00:05:54.620> would<00:05:55.070> have<00:05:55.580> a<00:05:55.610> lot

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
circulation would be it would have a lot

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.680 
circulation would be it would have a lot
of<00:05:55.940> trouble<00:05:56.770> so<00:05:57.770> like<00:05:58.670> vesicles<00:05:59.210> reshef<00:05:59.510> will

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
of trouble so like vesicles reshef will

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.930 
of trouble so like vesicles reshef will
also<00:05:59.960> rely<00:06:00.260> on<00:06:00.290> microtubules<00:06:01.130> too<00:06:01.520> for

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
also rely on microtubules too for

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.960 
also rely on microtubules too for
movement<00:06:03.040> where<00:06:04.040> they<00:06:04.160> at<00:06:04.310> latch<00:06:04.580> onto<00:06:04.820> the

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
movement where they at latch onto the

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.610 
movement where they at latch onto the
microtubule<00:06:05.540> and<00:06:05.690> move<00:06:06.080> around<00:06:06.230> the<00:06:06.410> cell

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
microtubule and move around the cell

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.710 
microtubule and move around the cell
like<00:06:06.800> that<00:06:06.830> distributing<00:06:07.610> materials<00:06:10.720> so

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
like that distributing materials so

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.450 
like that distributing materials so
thank<00:06:11.900> you<00:06:11.990> very<00:06:12.110> much

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
thank you very much

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.090 
thank you very much
