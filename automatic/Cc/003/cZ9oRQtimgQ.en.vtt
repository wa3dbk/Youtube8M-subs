buzzer<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:46.950> able<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> make<00:00:47.280> each

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
buzzer is going to be able to make each

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.350 
buzzer is going to be able to make each
spec<00:00:48.870> unique<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:50.039> new<00:00:50.190> not<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
spec unique so it's new not just all the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.229 
spec unique so it's new not just all the
exact<00:00:51.719> same<00:00:51.930> spec<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.559> were<00:00:52.820> like<00:00:53.820> right<00:00:54.059> now

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
exact same spec you were like right now

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.270 
exact same spec you were like right now
everyone's<00:00:54.600> exact<00:00:55.020> same<00:00:55.199> spec<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.770> your<00:00:55.920> frost

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
everyone's exact same spec if your frost

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.990 
everyone's exact same spec if your frost
or<00:00:56.579> fire<00:00:56.850> or<00:00:56.879> whatever<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.570> most<00:00:57.899> damage

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
or fire or whatever to the most damage

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.430 
or fire or whatever to the most damage
so<00:01:00.000> anyway<00:01:00.270> at<00:01:00.359> level<00:01:00.600> 15<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.109> get<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.320> pick

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
so anyway at level 15 you get to pick

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.860 
so anyway at level 15 you get to pick
from<00:01:01.620> ring<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.070> frost<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.420> same<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.780> it

is now I can see cone of cold which same
answers<00:01:07.890> now<00:01:08.070> or<00:01:08.340> frost<00:01:08.850> jaw<00:01:09.680> which<00:01:10.680> silences

and freezes a target in place for eight
seconds<00:01:13.710> which<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.520> guess<00:01:14.729> I'll<00:01:14.880> ask<00:01:15.000> for

as<00:01:37.530> well<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> level<00:01:39.450> 30<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.170> start<00:01:40.409> getting<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
as well so level 30 you start getting to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.580 
as well so level 30 you start getting to
some<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.340> new<00:01:41.549> abilities<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:43.560> have

some of the new abilities you have

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.590 
some of the new abilities you have
greater<00:01:43.950> invisibility<00:01:44.520> which<00:01:45.030> instantly

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
greater invisibility which instantly

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.899 
greater invisibility which instantly
makes<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.020> invisible<00:01:46.380> reducing<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.520> threat

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
makes you invisible reducing all threat

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.380 
makes you invisible reducing all threat
and<00:01:48.590> removing<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.770> damage<00:01:50.189> over<00:01:50.399> time<00:01:50.430> affixed

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
and removing to damage over time affixed

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.200 
and removing to damage over time affixed
that's<00:01:52.380> pretty<00:01:52.619> cool<00:01:52.790> three<00:01:53.790> minute<00:01:54.030> cooldown

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
that's pretty cool three minute cooldown

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.760 
that's pretty cool three minute cooldown
then<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.320> could<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.649> cauterize<00:01:56.280> instead

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
then you could get cauterize instead

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.670 
then you could get cauterize instead
basically<00:01:58.770> means<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.250> don't<00:01:59.520> die<00:02:00.469> well<00:02:01.469> you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
basically means you don't die well you

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.899 
basically means you don't die well you
do<00:02:01.950> eventually<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:03.119> see<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:04.490> go<00:02:05.490> back<00:02:05.670> up

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
do eventually but see it you go back up

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
do eventually but see it you go back up
if<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.270> die<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.869> go<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.200> sixty<00:02:07.560> percent<00:02:07.680> of

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
if you die you go to sixty percent of

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.369 
if you die you go to sixty percent of
your<00:02:08.039> max<00:02:08.280> health<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.940> then<00:02:09.690> you'll<00:02:09.810> burn<00:02:10.050> for

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
your max health and then you'll burn for

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.650 
your max health and then you'll burn for
ten<00:02:10.560> percent<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.950> your<00:02:11.039> damage<00:02:11.489> every<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
ten percent of your damage every one and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.880 
ten percent of your damage every one and
a<00:02:12.720> half<00:02:12.750> seconds<00:02:13.290> for<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.470> next

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
a half seconds for the next

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.690 
a half seconds for the next
I<00:02:13.920> guess<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.400> don't<00:02:14.610> die<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:17.069> you<00:02:17.130> go<00:02:17.490> down<00:02:17.670> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
I guess you don't die so you go down to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.670 
I guess you don't die so you go down to
twenty<00:02:18.120> percent<00:02:18.480> health<00:02:18.810> i<00:02:19.020> guess<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.500> i

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
twenty percent health i guess and i

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.170 
twenty percent health i guess and i
can't<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.310> more<00:02:20.430> than<00:02:20.550> once<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.880> minute

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
can't have it more than once a minute

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.260 
can't have it more than once a minute
and<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:22.440> get<00:02:22.560> Korra<00:02:22.950> cold<00:02:23.250> snap<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:24.060> am

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
and you get Korra cold snap I am

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.850 
and you get Korra cold snap I am
definitely<00:02:24.510> going<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.050> pick<00:02:25.230> cauterize<00:02:25.830> that

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
definitely going to pick cauterize that

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.120 
definitely going to pick cauterize that
just<00:02:26.340> seems<00:02:26.520> amazing<00:02:26.880> like<00:02:27.540> anywhere<00:02:28.130> I'm

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
just seems amazing like anywhere I'm

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.100 
just seems amazing like anywhere I'm
going<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.340> PvP<00:02:29.760> basically<00:02:30.300> live<00:02:30.540> again<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
going to PvP basically live again and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.960 
going to PvP basically live again and
you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.350> get<00:02:31.470> healed<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.160> get<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.490> killing

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
you can get healed if you get a killing

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.290 
you can get healed if you get a killing
blow<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.380> happen<00:02:34.560> once<00:02:35.520> every<00:02:35.730> minute

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
blow is it can happen once every minute

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.270 
blow is it can happen once every minute
that's<00:02:36.690> crazy<00:02:37.050> especially<00:02:37.410> in<00:02:37.740> raids<00:02:37.980> if<00:02:38.190> you

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
that's crazy especially in raids if you

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.250 
that's crazy especially in raids if you
accidentally<00:02:38.760> pull<00:02:39.300> aggro<00:02:39.480> you're<00:02:40.020> not<00:02:40.140> going

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
accidentally pull aggro you're not going

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260 
accidentally pull aggro you're not going
to<00:02:40.320> die<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.950> mean<00:02:41.220> cauterize<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:41.970> simply<00:02:42.209> an

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
to die I mean cauterize is simply an

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.750 
to die I mean cauterize is simply an
amazing<00:02:42.720> spell<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.400> can't<00:02:44.400> really<00:02:44.550> imagine

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
amazing spell I can't really imagine

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.090 
amazing spell I can't really imagine
when<00:02:45.030> you're<00:02:45.150> not<00:02:45.270> getting<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.870> guess<00:02:46.860> you

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
when you're not getting it I guess you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.800 
when you're not getting it I guess you
could<00:02:47.130> get<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> cold<00:02:47.700> snap<00:02:47.940> for<00:02:48.209> like<00:02:48.300> arena<00:02:48.600> or

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
could get a cold snap for like arena or

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.590 
could get a cold snap for like arena or
something<00:02:49.700> if<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.880> just<00:02:51.060> assume<00:02:51.360> you're<00:02:51.480> not

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
something if you just assume you're not

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.350 
something if you just assume you're not
going<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.810> die<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.290> guess<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:53.280> use<00:02:54.120> everything

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
going to die I guess but use everything

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.390 
going to die I guess but use everything
twice<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:55.430> yeah<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:57.420> 45<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.440> now<00:02:59.160> this

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
twice but yeah that 45 this now this

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.720 
would yeah I probably go with presence
of<00:03:58.790> mind<00:03:59.060> honestly<00:04:00.189> arcane<00:04:01.189> flows<00:04:01.459> can<00:04:01.670> be

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
of mind honestly arcane flows can be

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.280 
of mind honestly arcane flows can be
good<00:04:01.909> if<00:04:02.030> you're<00:04:02.180> in<00:04:02.269> some<00:04:02.480> raid<00:04:02.719> fight<00:04:03.019> where

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
good if you're in some raid fight where

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.099 
good if you're in some raid fight where
you<00:04:03.319> need<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.129> move<00:04:04.250> around<00:04:04.840> arcane<00:04:05.840> flow<00:04:06.019> is

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
you need to move around arcane flow is

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.569 
you need to move around arcane flow is
probably<00:04:06.349> definite<00:04:06.709> rating<00:04:07.069> talent<00:04:07.459> because

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
probably definite rating talent because

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.390 
probably definite rating talent because
it's<00:04:07.700> just<00:04:07.849> short<00:04:08.389> cooldown<00:04:08.599> I<00:04:09.340> think<00:04:10.340> the

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
it's just short cooldown I think the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.099 
it's just short cooldown I think the
shopman<00:04:10.669> ones<00:04:10.970> like<00:04:11.150> three<00:04:11.540> minutes<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.959> be

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
shopman ones like three minutes to be

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.129 
shopman ones like three minutes to be
able<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:12.319> do<00:04:12.409> that<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:13.030> at<00:04:14.030> 60<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:14.900> can<00:04:15.049> either

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
able to do that and at 60 you can either

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.979 
able to do that and at 60 you can either
get<00:04:15.379> mana<00:04:15.799> shield<00:04:16.180> blazing<00:04:17.180> speed<00:04:17.509> or<00:04:17.750> ice

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
get mana shield blazing speed or ice

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.729 
get mana shield blazing speed or ice
barrier<00:04:18.970> now<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.419> don't<00:04:20.900> know<00:04:21.229> why<00:04:21.410> anyone

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
barrier now I don't know why anyone

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.860 
barrier now I don't know why anyone
would<00:04:21.979> get<00:04:22.070> mana<00:04:22.280> shield<00:04:22.550> honestly<00:04:23.300> because<00:04:23.599> I

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
would get mana shield honestly because I

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.580 
would get mana shield honestly because I
superior<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.620> would<00:04:24.979> say<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.190> superior

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
superior I would say a superior

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.230 
superior I would say a superior
definitely<00:04:27.590> two<00:04:27.740> mana<00:04:27.949> shield<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:29.090> have

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
definitely two mana shield and you have

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.969 
definitely two mana shield and you have
either<00:04:29.389> blazing<00:04:29.930> speed<00:04:30.139> or<00:04:30.259> ice<00:04:30.380> barrier<00:04:30.710> I

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
either blazing speed or ice barrier I

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.529 
either blazing speed or ice barrier I
would<00:04:31.130> still<00:04:31.370> go<00:04:31.550> ice<00:04:31.759> barrier<00:04:32.090> that's<00:04:32.389> not

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
would still go ice barrier that's not

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.409 
would still go ice barrier that's not
really<00:04:32.750> a<00:04:32.780> tough<00:04:33.020> choice<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.910> know<00:04:35.000> random

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
really a tough choice you know random

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.129 
really a tough choice you know random
proc<00:04:35.690> up<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:36.020> little<00:04:36.320> run<00:04:36.500> faster<00:04:37.039> or<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:38.180> shield

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139

proc up a little run faster or a shield
you<00:04:39.409> can<00:04:39.590> cast<00:04:39.830> every<00:04:40.460> 30<00:04:40.669> seconds<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.180> absorb

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
you can cast every 30 seconds to absorb

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.839 
you can cast every 30 seconds to absorb
a<00:04:41.690> ton<00:04:42.020> of<00:04:42.050> damage<00:04:42.380> so<00:04:43.070> yeah<00:04:43.220> definitely<00:04:43.520> go

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
a ton of damage so yeah definitely go

targets regeneration of life when
they're<00:04:57.470> polymorphed<00:04:58.130> you<00:04:59.000> get<00:04:59.180> heavy

polymorph which if someone breaks it it

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.230 
polymorph which if someone breaks it it
stuns<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.389> target<00:05:03.340> which<00:05:04.340> is<00:05:04.520> kind<00:05:05.120> of<00:05:05.180> cool

stuns the target which is kind of cool

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.450 
stuns the target which is kind of cool

or double paw if you get polymorph two

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.370 
or double paw if you get polymorph two
things<00:05:07.759> which<00:05:08.030> is<00:05:08.060> probably<00:05:08.840> what<00:05:09.020> I'm<00:05:09.199> going

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
things which is probably what I'm going

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.080 
things which is probably what I'm going
to<00:05:09.440> go<00:05:09.590> with<00:05:09.770> being<00:05:10.130> able<00:05:10.220> to<00:05:10.370> polymorph<00:05:10.880> to

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
to go with being able to polymorph to

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.219 
to go with being able to polymorph to
things<00:05:11.389> like<00:05:11.720> in<00:05:11.900> PvP<00:05:12.409> or<00:05:12.440> something<00:05:14.050> or<00:05:15.050> even

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
things like in PvP or something or even

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.430 
things like in PvP or something or even
in<00:05:15.320> an<00:05:15.409> instance<00:05:16.090> maybe<00:05:17.090> even<00:05:17.509> it<00:05:18.050> only<00:05:18.199> lasts

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
in an instance maybe even it only lasts

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.740 
in an instance maybe even it only lasts
half<00:05:18.620> as<00:05:18.800> long<00:05:18.979> but<00:05:19.310> hey<00:05:19.580> being<00:05:20.150> a<00:05:20.240> polymorph

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
half as long but hey being a polymorph

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.290 
half as long but hey being a polymorph
two<00:05:20.870> things<00:05:21.139> is<00:05:21.259> pretty<00:05:21.500> awesome<00:05:22.030> and<00:05:23.030> you<00:05:23.150> got

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
two things is pretty awesome and you got

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.670 
two things is pretty awesome and you got
level<00:05:24.080> 90<00:05:25.300> blast<00:05:26.300> wave<00:05:26.599> dragon's<00:05:27.229> breath<00:05:27.380> or

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
level 90 blast wave dragon's breath or

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.559 
level 90 blast wave dragon's breath or
slow

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569 
slow

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.959 
slow
now<00:05:30.499> I<00:05:32.050> guess<00:05:33.050> you<00:05:33.439> could<00:05:33.469> since<00:05:34.369> I<00:05:34.520> get<00:05:34.819> I'm

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
now I guess you could since I get I'm

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:36.700 
now I guess you could since I get I'm
probably<00:05:35.029> to<00:05:35.509> get<00:05:35.629> co<00:05:35.809> Nicole<00:05:36.169> for<00:05:36.379> the<00:05:36.469> first

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
probably to get co Nicole for the first

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.409 
probably to get co Nicole for the first
time<00:05:36.919> I<00:05:36.979> probably<00:05:37.189> get<00:05:37.339> blast<00:05:37.729> wave<00:05:38.029> so<00:05:38.300> my

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
time I probably get blast wave so my

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.629 
time I probably get blast wave so my
frost<00:05:38.809> mage<00:05:39.110> could<00:05:39.469> have<00:05:39.649> cone<00:05:40.009> of<00:05:40.129> cold<00:05:40.159> and

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
frost mage could have cone of cold and

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.579 
frost mage could have cone of cold and
blast<00:05:41.029> away<00:05:41.179> it<00:05:41.449> would<00:05:41.569> be<00:05:41.749> pretty<00:05:41.959> funny<00:05:42.289> or

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:42.589 
blast away it would be pretty funny or

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:45.760 
blast away it would be pretty funny or
it<00:05:43.129> could<00:05:43.279> have<00:05:43.309> slowed<00:05:43.729> instead<00:05:44.209> so<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.020> have

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
it could have slowed instead so I have

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.739 
it could have slowed instead so I have
another<00:05:45.949> slow<00:05:46.369> as<00:05:46.580> frost<00:05:46.909> I<00:05:47.209> mean<00:05:47.539> that'd<00:05:47.659> be

00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:47.749 
another slow as frost I mean that'd be

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:53.919 
another slow as frost I mean that'd be
ridiculous<00:05:49.179> so<00:05:50.179> yeah<00:05:50.779> I<00:05:52.360> assume<00:05:53.360> blast<00:05:53.659> wave

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:53.929 
ridiculous so yeah I assume blast wave

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:57.329 
ridiculous so yeah I assume blast wave
probably<00:05:54.379> the<00:05:54.439> best<00:05:54.649> PvE<00:05:55.219> spell<00:05:55.759> right<00:05:56.479> there

00:05:57.329 --> 00:05:57.339 
probably the best PvE spell right there

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:00.279 
probably the best PvE spell right there
15<00:05:58.339> second<00:05:58.639> cool<00:05:58.789> dragons<00:05:59.270> breath<00:05:59.479> yeah<00:06:00.050> it

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
15 second cool dragons breath yeah it

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.909 
15 second cool dragons breath yeah it
could<00:06:00.529> be<00:06:00.559> good<00:06:00.830> twice<00:06:01.669> a<00:06:01.699> cool<00:06:02.029> down<00:06:02.209> though

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
could be good twice a cool down though

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.260 
could be good twice a cool down though
so<00:06:03.919> yeah<00:06:04.099> those<00:06:04.249> are<00:06:04.369> the<00:06:04.459> mage<00:06:04.639> talents<00:06:05.149> I

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
so yeah those are the mage talents I

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.980 
so yeah those are the mage talents I
think<00:06:05.539> they're<00:06:05.719> very<00:06:05.749> good<00:06:06.259> right<00:06:06.499> now<00:06:06.529> except

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
think they're very good right now except

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.439 
think they're very good right now except
maybe<00:06:08.990> what<00:06:09.889> tree<00:06:10.159> was<00:06:10.369> it<00:06:10.550> this<00:06:10.939> one<00:06:10.999> this

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
maybe what tree was it this one this

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.299 
maybe what tree was it this one this
could<00:06:11.689> use<00:06:11.869> a<00:06:11.899> little<00:06:12.139> imagination<00:06:12.309> because

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:13.309 
could use a little imagination because

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:15.040 
could use a little imagination because
if<00:06:13.939> your<00:06:14.089> fire<00:06:14.360> you<00:06:14.539> definitely<00:06:14.839> going<00:06:14.959> to

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
if your fire you definitely going to

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.559 
if your fire you definitely going to
probably<00:06:15.289> have<00:06:15.529> to<00:06:15.649> get<00:06:15.740> scorch<00:06:16.309> and<00:06:16.580> if<00:06:17.509> you

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:17.569 
probably have to get scorch and if you

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:19.619 
probably have to get scorch and if you
do<00:06:17.689> rating<00:06:18.110> you'll<00:06:18.289> get<00:06:18.439> arcane<00:06:18.800> powers<00:06:19.219> and

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
do rating you'll get arcane powers and

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.739 
do rating you'll get arcane powers and
your<00:06:20.709> frost<00:06:21.709> I<00:06:22.039> guess<00:06:22.279> you'll<00:06:23.209> get<00:06:23.389> arcane

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:23.749 
your frost I guess you'll get arcane

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:27.669 
your frost I guess you'll get arcane
powers<00:06:24.169> or<00:06:24.439> arcane<00:06:25.129> and<00:06:25.689> if<00:06:26.689> you<00:06:26.749> do<00:06:26.839> pvp<00:06:27.050> frost

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:27.679 
powers or arcane and if you do pvp frost

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.969 
powers or arcane and if you do pvp frost
you'll<00:06:27.889> probably<00:06:28.129> get<00:06:28.309> presence<00:06:28.729> of<00:06:28.849> mind<00:06:29.979> but

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979 
you'll probably get presence of mind but

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.670 
you'll probably get presence of mind but
yeah<00:06:31.369> the<00:06:31.639> other<00:06:31.789> ones<00:06:32.029> look<00:06:32.119> very<00:06:33.080> good<00:06:33.319> in<00:06:33.379> my
