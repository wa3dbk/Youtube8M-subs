00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 a video that shows a good part of what 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.430
 happened at the international airport 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.649
 of Philadelphia when the selection 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.790
 Mexican was preparing to return to the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.099
 Mexico City 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.809
 what we see on the screen are the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.360
 images taken with a cell phone 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.150
 there we see christian martinoli being 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.550
 pushed by the one they describe in the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.800
 Video as the daughter of Miguel Herrera 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.689
 coach of the Mexican national team we see 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.939
 members of the coaching staff and to own 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.740
 miguel herrera changing next to luís 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.599
 Garcia another sportscaster from the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.579
 Aztec TV chain 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.770
 where he was headed apparently 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.100
 he was pushing his daughter to this commentator 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.110
 sport that claims to have been 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.840
 assaulted by the technical director of the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.610
 Mexican selection in a video too 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.870
 what are we going to see next this is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.680
 the moment in which the daughter of Miguel 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.719
 herrera claims luís garcía and then 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.460
 we saw it clearly there and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.820
 Then Miguel Herrera arrives with Luis 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.820
 Garcia 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.329
 they have an exchange of words miguel 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.519
 Herrera asks her daughter to keep 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.840
 silence and apparently arranges part of 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.940
 the equation we see some players 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.950
 members of the coaching staff trying to 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.720
 intervene there have an exchange 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.250
 words I'm trying to narrate because 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.230
 Sound 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.610
 the video is not good enough 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.870
 as to hear exactly what is it 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.600
 they say we're working on it 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.400
 We received it a few moments ago but 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.380
 that's why I try to tell you what 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.850
 happened there we see already after Luis 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.020
 García changing with Miguel Herrera 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.100
 embraced 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.670
 that is the entrance to the airport 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.020

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.910

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.040
 the security line prior to 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.530
 entrance and to the waiting rooms for 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.540

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.600

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.190

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.360
 he claims to have been attacked 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.580

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.750

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.020
