game and half their jobs dribbling but
the<00:00:28.680> real<00:00:28.859> important<00:00:29.460> bit<00:00:29.580> their<00:00:29.730> job<00:00:29.970> is

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the real important bit their job is

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.999 
the real important bit their job is
crossing<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.779> ball<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.199> put<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
crossing the ball and put it on the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.860 
crossing the ball and put it on the
plate<00:00:32.219> for<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> striker<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.000> we're<00:00:33.690> going<00:00:33.780> to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
plate for a striker so we're going to

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.630 
plate for a striker so we're going to
look<00:00:33.930> at<00:00:33.989> crossing<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> ball<00:00:34.620> now<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:35.520> might

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
look at crossing the ball now we might

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.729 
look at crossing the ball now we might
add<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.940> dribbling<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.420> bit<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
add in dribbling it a bit but the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.170 
add in dribbling it a bit but the
fundamental<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.309> crossing<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.940> right

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
fundamental of crossing for a right

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.720 
fundamental of crossing for a right
winger<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.140> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.250> land<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> ball

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
winger is going to be to land the ball

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.729 
winger is going to be to land the ball
between<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> six<00:00:42.750> yard<00:00:42.899> box<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.379> penalty

between the six yard box and the penalty

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.160 
between the six yard box and the penalty
spot<00:00:43.800> generally<00:00:44.370> throwing<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.390> striker<00:00:46.020> or

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
spot generally throwing it a striker or

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
a sentiment fielder or the left winger

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.330 
a sentiment fielder or the left winger
to<00:00:48.420> run<00:00:48.570> onto<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.960> head<00:00:49.110> most<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> time

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
to run onto and head most of the time

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.250 
to run onto and head most of the time
you<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.579> striking<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.969> ball<00:00:51.170> similar<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
you can be striking the ball similar to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.170 
you can be striking the ball similar to
a<00:00:52.289> long-range<00:00:52.739> curled<00:00:53.129> pass<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.090> going

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
a long-range curled pass so it's going

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.299 
a long-range curled pass so it's going
to<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.530> trying<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> curl<00:00:56.070> with<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
to be up and trying to curl with the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.000 
to be up and trying to curl with the
right<00:00:56.520> foot<00:00:56.550> from<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.660> left<00:00:58.010> where

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
right foot from right to left where

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.590 
right foot from right to left where
you're<00:00:59.129> striking<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> ball<00:00:59.879> from<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
you're striking the ball from is you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.849 
you're striking the ball from is you
want<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.809> get<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:00.989> close<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> byline<00:01:01.680> as

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
want to get as close to the byline as

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.470 
want to get as close to the byline as
possible<00:01:02.370> because<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:02.969> you're<00:01:03.090> pulling<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
possible because then you're pulling it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.590 
possible because then you're pulling it
back<00:01:03.780> defenders<00:01:04.589> then<00:01:04.920> they're<00:01:05.460> running<00:01:06.420> away

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
back defenders then they're running away

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.570 
back defenders then they're running away
from<00:01:06.659> their<00:01:06.930> goal<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.979> goal<00:01:08.010> keep<00:01:08.369> has<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
from their goal the goal keep has to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.550 
from their goal the goal keep has to
come<00:01:08.880> out<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.270> cross<00:01:09.510> from<00:01:09.750> deep<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.350> goal

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
come out if you cross from deep the goal

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.289 
come out if you cross from deep the goal
key<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.010> come<00:01:11.189> towards<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> ball<00:01:11.820> so

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
key we can just come towards the ball so

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.609 
key we can just come towards the ball so
we're<00:01:12.479> looking<00:01:12.600> at<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.930> taking<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.290> from<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
we're looking at get taking it from the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.420 
we're looking at get taking it from the
byline<00:01:13.799> back<00:01:14.610> towards<00:01:15.060> our<00:01:15.180> strikers<00:01:19.430> so

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
byline back towards our strikers so

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.560 
byline back towards our strikers so
really<00:01:20.700> I'm<00:01:20.880> trying<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.330> slightly

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
really I'm trying to get it slightly

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.999 
really I'm trying to get it slightly
further<00:01:21.840> ahead<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.320> than<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.890> can

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
further ahead of it than that so you can

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.740 
further ahead of it than that so you can
attack<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> bit<00:01:23.880> more<00:01:24.000> power<00:01:24.270> it

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:37.370 

nice<00:01:27.750> good<00:01:28.350> header<00:01:32.450> header

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.390 

okay<00:01:38.380> so<00:01:38.440> now<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.800> progression<00:01:39.280> from

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
okay so now the progression from

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.970 
okay so now the progression from
crossing<00:01:39.700> is<00:01:40.030> dribbling<00:01:40.660> and<00:01:40.840> crossing<00:01:41.230> our

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
crossing is dribbling and crossing our

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.200 
crossing is dribbling and crossing our
Center<00:01:42.340> forwards<00:01:42.610> over<00:01:42.670> here<00:01:42.910> he's<00:01:43.000> going<00:01:43.150> to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
Center forwards over here he's going to

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.000 
Center forwards over here he's going to
start<00:01:43.390> with<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.510> ball<00:01:43.720> he'll<00:01:44.320> pass<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.860> me

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
start with the ball he'll pass to me

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.830 
start with the ball he'll pass to me
he's<00:01:45.250> trying<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.730> aim<00:01:45.850> his<00:01:46.030> pass<00:01:46.300> between<00:01:46.540> my

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
he's trying to aim his pass between my

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.290 
he's trying to aim his pass between my
starting<00:01:47.440> position<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:47.980> the<00:01:48.490> next<00:01:48.760> blue<00:01:48.970> cone

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
starting position and the next blue cone

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.750 
starting position and the next blue cone
I'm<00:01:49.930> then<00:01:50.380> going<00:01:50.410> to<00:01:50.590> dribble<00:01:50.830> in<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.550> out<00:01:51.610> the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
I'm then going to dribble in and out the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.510 
I'm then going to dribble in and out the
cones<00:01:52.000> get<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.170> byline<00:01:53.350> across<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:53.980> ball<00:01:54.280> by

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
cones get to the byline across a ball by

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.920 
cones get to the byline across a ball by
which<00:01:54.670> time<00:01:54.850> he'll<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.210> times<00:01:55.510> he's<00:01:55.720> running

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
which time he'll of times he's running

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.690 
which time he'll of times he's running
he'll<00:01:56.050> hold<00:01:56.260> off<00:01:56.470> his<00:01:56.680> run<00:01:56.890> until<00:01:57.130> I<00:01:57.250> get<00:01:57.460> past

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
he'll hold off his run until I get past

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.330 
he'll hold off his run until I get past
the<00:01:57.850> last<00:01:58.000> cone<00:01:58.330> then<00:01:58.990> he'll<00:01:59.170> jog<00:01:59.500> in<00:01:59.710> and<00:01:59.920> as<00:02:00.130> I

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
the last cone then he'll jog in and as I

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.700 
the last cone then he'll jog in and as I
pull<00:02:00.700> my<00:02:00.790> foot<00:02:00.940> back<00:02:01.120> to<00:02:01.270> cross<00:02:01.710> hopefully

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
pull my foot back to cross hopefully

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.990 
pull my foot back to cross hopefully

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
with a friend or some of them on your

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.680 
with a friend or some of them on your
own<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:26.950> don't<00:03:27.160> need<00:03:27.400> an<00:03:27.760> astroturf<00:03:28.360> is<00:03:28.600> you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
own you don't need an astroturf is you

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.840 
own you don't need an astroturf is you
don't<00:03:28.780> need<00:03:28.959> goals<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.440> can<00:03:29.560> use<00:03:29.769> a<00:03:30.010> park<00:03:30.610> you

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
don't need goals you can use a park you

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.060 
don't need goals you can use a park you
can<00:03:30.940> use<00:03:31.060> your<00:03:31.120> garden<00:03:31.600> you<00:03:32.320> can<00:03:32.769> dribble

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
can use your garden you can dribble

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.060 
can use your garden you can dribble
around<00:03:33.220> trees<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:33.940> shoot<00:03:34.180> between<00:03:34.390> two<00:03:34.780> trees

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
around trees and shoot between two trees

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.020 
around trees and shoot between two trees
and<00:03:36.070> that<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.280> think<00:03:36.519> that's<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.670> key<00:03:36.880> to

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
and that I think that's the key to

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.970 
and that I think that's the key to
learning<00:03:37.239> any<00:03:37.720> sport<00:03:38.350> is<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.560> be<00:03:38.709> able<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.920> do

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
learning any sport is to be able to do

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.850 
learning any sport is to be able to do
in<00:03:39.130> your<00:03:39.250> own<00:03:39.310> time<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.840> hopefully<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:41.650> gives

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
in your own time so hopefully this gives

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.800 
in your own time so hopefully this gives
up<00:03:42.010> people<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.280> few<00:03:42.459> ideas<00:03:42.550> and<00:03:43.000> what<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.570> can<00:03:43.660> go

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
up people a few ideas and what it can go

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.500 
up people a few ideas and what it can go
away<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.200> practice
