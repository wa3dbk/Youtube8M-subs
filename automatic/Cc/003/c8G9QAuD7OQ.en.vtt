21st<00:02:21.620> that's<00:02:22.620> all<00:02:22.800> good<00:02:22.830> I'm<00:02:23.099> looking<00:02:24.060> at<00:02:24.180> it

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
21st that's all good I'm looking at it

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.949 
21st that's all good I'm looking at it
from<00:02:24.480> perspective<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:26.300> getting<00:02:27.300> hopefully

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
from perspective of getting hopefully

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.610 
from perspective of getting hopefully
getting<00:02:28.140> under<00:02:28.470> 190<00:02:29.450> never<00:02:30.450> seeing<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.080> 200s

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
getting under 190 never seeing the 200s

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.300 
getting under 190 never seeing the 200s
again<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:33.110> really<00:02:34.110> giving<00:02:34.560> myself<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:35.040> lot<00:02:35.190> of

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
again and really giving myself a lot of

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.350 
again and really giving myself a lot of
leeway<00:02:35.459> on<00:02:35.610> reality<00:02:36.599> um<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.950> will<00:02:38.910> never<00:02:39.150> eat

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
leeway on reality um I will never eat

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.070 
leeway on reality um I will never eat
sugar<00:02:39.630> again<00:02:40.019> during<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.910> p300<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.420> never<00:02:42.870> did

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
sugar again during the p300 I never did

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.820 
sugar again during the p300 I never did
before<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.930> realized<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.049> sugar<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.440> my

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
before I realized that sugar is my

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.009 
before I realized that sugar is my
downfall<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.519> will<00:02:48.330> load<00:02:48.840> with<00:02:49.049> some<00:02:49.170> sugar<00:02:49.380> and

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
downfall I will load with some sugar and

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.009 
downfall I will load with some sugar and
then<00:02:52.370> probably<00:02:53.390> never<00:02:54.390> eat<00:02:54.540> sugar<00:02:54.750> again

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
then probably never eat sugar again

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.910 
then probably never eat sugar again
after<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.560> next<00:02:55.680> load<00:02:55.980> although<00:02:57.739> although<00:02:58.739> I

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
after the next load although although I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.380 
after the next load although although I
probably<00:02:59.160> have<00:02:59.489> another<00:02:59.700> round<00:02:59.880> after<00:03:00.239> that

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
probably have another round after that

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.570 
probably have another round after that
so<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.170> may<00:03:01.500> eat<00:03:01.650> sugar<00:03:01.920> again<00:03:02.250> on<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.430> load

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
so I may eat sugar again on the load

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.000 
so I may eat sugar again on the load
after<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.239> want<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.810> get<00:03:03.930> down<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.170> 140<00:03:04.709> I'm
