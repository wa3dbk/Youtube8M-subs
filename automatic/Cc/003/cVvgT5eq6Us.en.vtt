actually got the evolution radio which
is<00:01:57.860> my<00:01:58.040> favorite<00:01:58.430> in<00:01:58.520> here<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.730> course<00:01:59.000> it's

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
is my favorite in here of course it's

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.500 
is my favorite in here of course it's
just<00:01:59.450> sounds<00:02:00.140> awesome<00:02:00.380> runs<00:02:00.860> great<00:02:01.420> but<00:02:02.420> you

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
just sounds awesome runs great but you

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.810 
just sounds awesome runs great but you
can<00:02:02.630> also<00:02:02.780> use<00:02:03.050> like<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.260> Zilla<00:02:03.680> t-62<00:02:04.460> you've

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
can also use like a Zilla t-62 you've

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.010 
can also use like a Zilla t-62 you've
got<00:02:04.940> an<00:02:05.030> evolution<00:02:05.510> like<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.840> new

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
got an evolution like the new

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.850 
got an evolution like the new
fuel-injected<00:02:07.000> evolution<00:02:08.000> 62<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:09.619> can<00:02:09.740> also

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
fuel-injected evolution 62 you can also

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.280 
fuel-injected evolution 62 you can also
use<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.220> state<00:02:10.460> o57<00:02:11.060> gas<00:02:11.390> twin<00:02:11.750> four-stroke

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
use the state o57 gas twin four-stroke

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.720 
use the state o57 gas twin four-stroke
that's<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.590> really<00:02:12.800> cool<00:02:12.950> option<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.520> sound

great fun airplane and I'm noticing it's

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.920 
great fun airplane and I'm noticing it's
got<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.280> split<00:02:28.580> flaps<00:02:28.880> on<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.570> does<00:02:29.750> have

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
got the split flaps on it it does have

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.420 
got the split flaps on it it does have
this<00:02:30.020> blip<00:02:30.230> flaps<00:02:30.470> yeah<00:02:30.650> it's<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.920> split<00:02:31.250> flap

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
this blip flaps yeah it's a split flap

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.040 
this blip flaps yeah it's a split flap
scale<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.150> real<00:02:32.300> one<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:32.690> also<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
scale to the real one and it's also the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.780 
scale to the real one and it's also the
split<00:02:33.260> flaps<00:02:33.440> are<00:02:33.560> running<00:02:33.740> off<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:33.860> one<00:02:34.310> servo

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
split flaps are running off of one servo

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.480 
split flaps are running off of one servo
inside<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.360> wing<00:02:35.510> so<00:02:35.810> it's<00:02:36.130> kept<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.280> cost

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
inside the wing so it's kept the cost

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.060 
inside the wing so it's kept the cost
down<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.030> weight<00:02:38.150> down<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.720> runs<00:02:39.710> pretty

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
down and weight down and runs pretty

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.580 
down and weight down and runs pretty
simple<00:02:40.370> off<00:02:40.520> of<00:02:40.700> one<00:02:40.910> one<00:02:41.330> circle<00:02:41.720> okay

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
simple off of one one circle okay

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.500 
simple off of one one circle okay
well<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.250> only<00:02:43.400> thing<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:43.820> see<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.390> looks

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
well the only thing I see that it looks

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.300 
well the only thing I see that it looks
like<00:02:44.750> it's<00:02:44.960> missing<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:45.440> maybe<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.740> tail<00:02:46.070> hook

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
like it's missing is maybe a tail hook

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.940 
like it's missing is maybe a tail hook
you<00:02:47.209> know<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.360> be<00:02:47.690> honest<00:02:47.959> with<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.440> drew

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
you know to be honest with you I drew

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.770 
you know to be honest with you I drew
the<00:02:49.100> CAD<00:02:49.280> for<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.700> tail<00:02:49.850> look<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.180> just<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.660> was

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
the CAD for the tail look I just it was

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.420 
the CAD for the tail look I just it was
it<00:02:51.170> was<00:02:51.290> one<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.500> those<00:02:51.590> things<00:02:51.830> it's<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:52.310> don't

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
it was one of those things it's I don't

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.920 
it was one of those things it's I don't
want<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.610> run<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.850> price<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.390> kit<00:02:53.570> up<00:02:53.780> but

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
want to run the price of the kit up but
