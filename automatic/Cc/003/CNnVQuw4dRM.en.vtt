Roche<00:04:47.260> I<00:04:47.500> think<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.979> was<00:04:48.070> a<00:04:48.130> road<00:04:48.370> no<00:04:48.640> it<00:04:48.729> wasn't

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
Roche I think it was a road no it wasn't

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.010 
Roche I think it was a road no it wasn't
called<00:04:49.120> road<00:04:49.300> trip<00:04:49.540> but<00:04:49.630> it<00:04:49.690> was<00:04:49.840> like

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
called road trip but it was like

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.270 
called road trip but it was like
something<00:04:50.169> like<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.979> know<00:04:51.010> he<00:04:51.190> was

something like that you know he was
making<00:04:51.580> these<00:04:51.669> movies<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.870> I<00:04:52.900> don't<00:04:53.020> think<00:04:53.080> he

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
making these movies and I don't think he

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.570 
making these movies and I don't think he
gets<00:04:53.290> enough<00:04:53.410> credit<00:04:53.560> for<00:04:53.919> being<00:04:54.160> one
