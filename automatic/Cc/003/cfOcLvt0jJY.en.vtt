whatever is comfortable for you I'm
really<00:00:48.420> short<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.079> he<00:00:49.350> made<00:00:50.280> me<00:00:50.429> stand<00:00:50.579> in

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
really short so he made me stand in

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.149 
really short so he made me stand in
front<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.269> I<00:00:51.300> could<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:53.010> was

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
front of it so I could see on what was

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.579 
front of it so I could see on what was
comfortable<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.879> me<00:00:53.909> and<00:00:54.300> I'm<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> show

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
comfortable for me and I'm going to show

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.309 
comfortable for me and I'm going to show
you<00:00:55.649> how<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.129> look<00:00:56.370> once<00:00:56.579> they're<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:56.999> and<00:00:57.359> I

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
you how they look once they're up and I

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:59.869 
you how they look once they're up and I
got<00:00:58.499> this<00:00:58.620> idea<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:59.100> somebody<00:00:59.460> else<00:00:59.670> on

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
got this idea from somebody else on

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.029 
got this idea from somebody else on
YouTube<00:01:00.269> but<00:01:00.749> mine<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> little<00:01:01.469> different

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
YouTube but mine is a little different

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.100 
YouTube but mine is a little different
because<00:01:02.519> I'm<00:01:02.879> not<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.269> to<00:01:03.329> put<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.690> border<00:01:04.080> on

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
because I'm not going to put a border on

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.100 
because I'm not going to put a border on
it<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.399> guess<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.210> wide<00:01:06.420> enough<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.750> they

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it but I guess it's wide enough for they

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.980 
it but I guess it's wide enough for they
won't<00:01:07.380> fall<00:01:07.619> off<00:01:07.729> all<00:01:08.729> right<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.390> I'll<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.899> back

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
won't fall off all right so I'll be back

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.920 
won't fall off all right so I'll be back
so<00:01:12.990> basically<00:01:13.530> he's<00:01:13.799> putting<00:01:14.189> these<00:01:14.310> little

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
so basically he's putting these little

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.830 
so basically he's putting these little
drywall<00:01:15.930> anchors<00:01:16.469> to<00:01:17.189> help<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.610> stay<00:01:17.850> up<00:01:18.119> more

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
drywall anchors to help it stay up more

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.310 
drywall anchors to help it stay up more
firm

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.490 

and<00:01:27.970> i<00:01:28.970> also<00:01:29.300> forgot<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:29.720> mention<00:01:30.110> you<00:01:30.229> don't

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
the hammer we did it without there's

the hammer we did it without there's
obviously<00:01:59.410> so<00:02:00.410> here<00:02:00.860> is<00:02:01.039> the<00:02:01.250> finished<00:02:01.430> result

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.480 

that's<00:02:05.360> what<00:02:05.570> it'll<00:02:05.690> look<00:02:05.780> like<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.470> this<00:02:07.430> is

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
that's what it'll look like and this is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.219 
that's what it'll look like and this is
just<00:02:07.759> a<00:02:07.940> lot<00:02:08.149> cheaper<00:02:08.179> than<00:02:08.660> buying<00:02:08.929> those

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
just a lot cheaper than buying those

fretting like I got a whole bunch but
this<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.350> how<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.739> fits<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.850> then<00:02:44.360> like<00:02:44.600> the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
this is how it fits and then like the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.930 
this is how it fits and then like the
bottom<00:02:45.019> is<00:02:45.170> obviously<00:02:45.590> empty<00:02:45.829> so<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.640> just<00:02:46.820> took

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
bottom is obviously empty so I just took

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.960 
bottom is obviously empty so I just took
my<00:02:47.060> little<00:02:47.260> pouch<00:02:48.260> here<00:02:48.620> this<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.010> all<00:02:49.130> my<00:02:49.160> nail

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
I bought this wide enough which I didn't

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.840 
I bought this wide enough which I didn't
want<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:18.380> my<00:03:18.500> boyfriend<00:03:18.709> told<00:03:19.579> me<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.760> get

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
want to but my boyfriend told me to get

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.729 
want to but my boyfriend told me to get
it<00:03:19.970> wider<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.480> he<00:03:20.690> was<00:03:20.840> right<00:03:21.049> because<00:03:21.350> now<00:03:21.709> I

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
it wider and he was right because now I

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:28.270 
it wider and he was right because now I
could<00:03:22.070> fit<00:03:22.340> two<00:03:26.560> right<00:03:27.560> in<00:03:27.769> front<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.100> each

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
could fit two right in front of each

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.930 
could fit two right in front of each
other<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:28.970> i<00:03:29.239> can<00:03:29.510> actually<00:03:30.280> have<00:03:31.280> twice<00:03:31.910> as

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
other so i can actually have twice as

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.729 
other so i can actually have twice as
many<00:03:32.650> up<00:03:33.650> here<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:34.220> i<00:03:34.370> think<00:03:34.700> it'll<00:03:34.970> fit<00:03:35.739> about

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
many up here and i think it'll fit about

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.759 
many up here and i think it'll fit about
25<00:03:37.489> nail<00:03:37.699> polishes<00:03:38.269> and<00:03:38.570> if<00:03:39.049> I<00:03:39.139> just<00:03:39.320> keep<00:03:39.500> one

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
25 nail polishes and if I just keep one

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:40.970 
25 nail polishes and if I just keep one
on<00:03:39.799> each<00:03:40.040> rack<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:40.639> probably

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
on each rack so probably

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.309 
on each rack so probably
about<00:03:41.159> 50<00:03:41.640> polishes<00:03:42.569> on<00:03:42.690> each<00:03:42.810> rack<00:03:43.080> that's

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
about 50 polishes on each rack that's

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.390 
about 50 polishes on each rack that's
about<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.620> hundred<00:03:43.730> polishes<00:03:45.110> altogether<00:03:46.400> so

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
about a hundred polishes altogether so

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.880 
about a hundred polishes altogether so
that's<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.849> end<00:03:47.909> of<00:03:48.000> my<00:03:48.060> video<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:49.860> hope
