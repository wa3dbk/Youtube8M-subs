00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
curious about berlin wall because it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.140 
curious about berlin wall because it
seems<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.830> great<00:01:20.250> map<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.909> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
seems like a really great map and I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.149 
seems like a really great map and I
heard<00:01:21.659> something<00:01:22.020> about<00:01:22.080> automated<00:01:22.860> turrets

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
heard something about automated turrets

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.410 
heard something about automated turrets
in<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.380> trailer<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.549> don't<00:01:27.360> know

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
in the trailer for it so I don't know

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.670 
in the trailer for it so I don't know
that<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.600> think<00:01:27.810> kind<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.020> interesting<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.530> see

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
that I think kind of interesting to see

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.859 
that I think kind of interesting to see
I<00:01:28.710> can't<00:01:29.280> wait<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> play<00:01:30.060> those<00:01:30.210> match<00:01:30.390> myself

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
I can't wait to play those match myself

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.880 
I can't wait to play those match myself
and<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.369> 4<00:01:32.579> multiplayer<00:01:32.880> maps<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
and so we have 4 multiplayer maps and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.460 
and so we have 4 multiplayer maps and
obviously<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.220> new<00:01:35.850> zombie<00:01:36.060> maps<00:01:36.540> ascension

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
obviously the new zombie maps ascension

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.179 
obviously the new zombie maps ascension
and<00:01:38.960> that's<00:01:39.960> pretty<00:01:40.229> good<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:40.470> 1200

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
and that's pretty good for 1200

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.249 
and that's pretty good for 1200
microsoft<00:01:41.400> points<00:01:41.939> 5<00:01:42.150> maps<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:43.020> that

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
microsoft points 5 maps it's not that

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.880 
microsoft points 5 maps it's not that
bad<00:01:44.000> compared<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.119> infinity<00:01:45.570> will

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890

my<00:01:46.159> packages<00:01:46.640> were<00:01:46.820> just<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.090> little<00:01:47.240> bit

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
my packages were just a little bit

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.700 
my packages were just a little bit
overpriced<00:01:47.690> because<00:01:48.080> you<00:01:48.170> didn't<00:01:48.350> get<00:01:48.500> that

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
overpriced because you didn't get that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.090 
overpriced because you didn't get that

maybe<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.480> something<00:03:20.930> like<00:03:21.079> that<00:03:21.410> and

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
maybe it's something like that and

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.020 
maybe it's something like that and
you'll<00:03:23.840> be<00:03:23.989> playing<00:03:24.290> as<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.579> the<00:03:25.579> original

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.080 
abandoned Soviet cosmodrome so it's
somewhere<00:03:53.690> like<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:54.550> Space<00:03:55.550> Launch<00:03:55.880> Facility

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
somewhere like a Space Launch Facility

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.030 
somewhere like a Space Launch Facility
or<00:03:56.720> something<00:03:57.110> like<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.410> that's<00:03:57.860> where

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
or something like that and that's where

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.890 
or something like that and that's where
we<00:03:58.069> get<00:03:58.280> our<00:03:58.340> new<00:03:58.610> enemies<00:03:59.030> which<00:03:59.390> are

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
we get our new enemies which are

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.590 
we get our new enemies which are
confirmed<00:04:00.550> we<00:04:01.550> have<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.700> couple<00:04:01.910> new<00:04:02.120> animals

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
confirmed we have a couple new animals

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.820 
confirmed we have a couple new animals
on<00:04:02.720> here<00:04:03.110> and<00:04:05.019> there's<00:04:06.019> gonna<00:04:06.230> be<00:04:06.410> including

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
on here and there's gonna be including

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.550 
on here and there's gonna be including
space<00:04:07.220> monkeys<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.060> I'm<00:04:08.840> guessing<00:04:09.260> this<00:04:09.440> will

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
space monkeys and I'm guessing this will

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.070 
space monkeys and I'm guessing this will
be<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.830> replacement<00:04:10.190> for<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:10.940> dog<00:04:11.390> round<00:04:11.690> and

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
be the replacement for the dog round and

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.440 
be the replacement for the dog round and
depending<00:04:12.500> on<00:04:12.620> each<00:04:12.830> round<00:04:13.269> they're<00:04:14.269> called

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
depending on each round they're called

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.710 
depending on each round they're called
space<00:04:14.780> monkeys<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.470> they<00:04:16.220> run<00:04:17.209> up<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.479> you<00:04:17.570> and

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
space monkeys and they run up to you and

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.360 
space monkeys and they run up to you and
they<00:04:17.810> jack<00:04:18.109> you<00:04:18.229> apart<00:04:18.729> so<00:04:20.260> apparently

they jack you apart so apparently

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.800 
they jack you apart so apparently

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
instead of depending on theme stealing

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.690 
instead of depending on theme stealing
your<00:04:23.930> weapons<00:04:24.290> we<00:04:24.530> got<00:04:24.680> space<00:04:24.979> monkeys<00:04:25.400> I<00:04:25.520> got

the<00:05:18.540> real<00:05:18.720> name<00:05:18.900> for<00:05:19.170> him<00:05:20.840> there's<00:05:21.840> actually

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
the real name for him there's actually

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.590

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
think that's the same as the curse

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.440 
think that's the same as the curse
device<00:05:26.250> except<00:05:26.850> it's<00:05:26.940> a<00:05:27.000> different<00:05:27.330> name<00:05:27.420> for

made<00:05:51.120> you<00:05:51.270> want<00:05:51.480> to<00:05:51.570> get<00:05:51.660> these<00:05:51.840> maps<00:05:52.080> so

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370
