top of that then you have a whole bunch

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.510 
top of that then you have a whole bunch
of<00:02:32.840> different<00:02:33.320> cards<00:02:33.770> for<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.220> different

meta types and different races and so

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.740 
meta types and different races and so
you<00:02:37.100> can<00:02:37.310> actually<00:02:37.490> develop<00:02:38.030> several

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
you can actually develop several

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.290 
you can actually develop several
different<00:02:39.500> styles<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:40.160> play<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.270> really

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
different styles of play so it really

brings the role-playing aspects of

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.710 
brings the role-playing aspects of
shadowrun<00:02:43.490> which<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.850> really<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.150> heart<00:02:44.270> of

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
shadowrun which is really the heart of

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.350 
shadowrun which is really the heart of
what<00:02:44.900> shattering<00:02:45.320> is<00:02:45.560> out<00:02:46.280> within<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.180> deck

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
what shattering is out within the deck
