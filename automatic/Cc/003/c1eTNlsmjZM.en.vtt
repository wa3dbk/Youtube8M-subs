00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
probably heard of the Helios well we

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.560 
probably heard of the Helios well we
took<00:00:42.320> what<00:00:42.920> we<00:00:43.070> learned<00:00:43.400> in<00:00:43.790> developing<00:00:44.420> these

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
took what we learned in developing these

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.020 
took what we learned in developing these
Helios<00:00:45.080> rods<00:00:45.440> both<00:00:45.800> in<00:00:46.010> terms<00:00:46.250> of<00:00:46.370> materials

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
Helios rods both in terms of materials

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.120 
Helios rods both in terms of materials
and<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.660> way<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.930> material<00:00:48.380> is<00:00:48.440> constructed

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
and the way the material is constructed

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.570 
and the way the material is constructed
and<00:00:49.280> tapers<00:00:50.060> and<00:00:50.270> made<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.080> rod<00:00:51.380> that<00:00:51.980> is<00:00:52.370> the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
and tapers and made a rod that is the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.580 
and tapers and made a rod that is the
second<00:00:53.000> lightest<00:00:53.360> rod<00:00:53.600> in<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.050> industry

rods<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:04.579> hydros<00:02:05.420> rods<00:02:05.719> are<00:02:06.079> in<00:02:06.229> all<00:02:06.350> those

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:06.529 
rods so hydros rods are in all those

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:07.599 
rods so hydros rods are in all those
configurations

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
configurations

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.880

it's<00:02:07.819> an<00:02:07.969> incredible<00:02:08.479> rod<00:02:08.720> second<00:02:09.530> lightest

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
it's an incredible rod second lightest

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.070 
it's an incredible rod second lightest
rod<00:02:10.100> in<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.340> world<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:10.880> we<00:02:11.540> took<00:02:11.750> what<00:02:11.959> we

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
rod in the world and we took what we

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.770 
rod in the world and we took what we
learned<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.100> fabulous<00:02:13.400> Helios<00:02:14.120> rods<00:02:14.510> and

learned in the fabulous Helios rods and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.140 
learned in the fabulous Helios rods and
built<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.530> hydros<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.459> it's<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.730> whole<00:02:16.909> new

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
built the hydros so it's a whole new

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:32.590 
built the hydros so it's a whole new
beginning<00:02:17.360> for<00:02:17.689> us<00:02:17.989> in<00:02:18.230> rod<00:02:18.680> making
