they<00:04:25.690> don't<00:04:26.020> need<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.729> increases<00:04:28.389> good

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
they don't need it and it increases good

they don't need it and it increases good
enough<00:04:28.930> for<00:04:29.080> me<00:04:30.660> so<00:04:31.660> what<00:04:32.380> can<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:32.590> say<00:04:32.740> about

the pipe nothing really I did actually

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.240 
the pipe nothing really I did actually
do<00:04:36.760> need<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.120> correct<00:04:37.450> myself<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:38.770> my<00:04:38.919> first

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
do need to correct myself in my first

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.490 
do need to correct myself in my first

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
that my wording seems to sound like I'm

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.800 
that my wording seems to sound like I'm

to cracking it's a good material I

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.129 
to cracking it's a good material I
probably<00:04:57.639> also<00:04:58.030> showed<00:04:58.539> you<00:04:58.720> this<00:04:58.840> gasket

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
probably also showed you this gasket

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.490 
probably also showed you this gasket

you do it the right way which allegedly

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.370 
you do it the right way which allegedly
is<00:05:17.530> take<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.860> turbo<00:05:18.250> off<00:05:18.659> take<00:05:19.659> it<00:05:19.810> upwards<00:05:20.169> as

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
is take the turbo off take it upwards as

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.620 
is take the turbo off take it upwards as

pulling out through the bottom because
the<00:05:26.050> catalytic<00:05:26.590> converters<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.460> bit<00:05:27.729> through

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
the catalytic converters a bit through

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.279 
the catalytic converters a bit through
the<00:05:27.970> gap<00:05:28.150> you<00:05:28.180> have<00:05:28.300> to<00:05:28.510> check<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.870> engine<00:05:29.020> up

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
the gap you have to check the engine up

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.080 
the gap you have to check the engine up
yeah<00:05:30.070> that<00:05:30.310> sounds<00:05:30.520> like<00:05:30.580> an<00:05:30.760> awful<00:05:30.880> lot<00:05:31.000> of

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
yeah that sounds like an awful lot of

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.320 
yeah that sounds like an awful lot of
grief<00:05:31.300> to<00:05:31.510> me<00:05:31.650> so<00:05:32.650> I'd<00:05:33.219> rather<00:05:33.460> stand<00:05:34.090> up<00:05:34.210> off

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
grief to me so I'd rather stand up off

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.230 
grief to me so I'd rather stand up off
my<00:05:34.510> car<00:05:34.750> and<00:05:34.930> lay<00:05:35.080> under<00:05:35.409> my<00:05:35.530> car<00:05:35.969> so<00:05:36.969> I'm<00:05:37.090> gonna

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
my car and lay under my car so I'm gonna

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.080 
my car and lay under my car so I'm gonna
take<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:37.960> turbocharger<00:05:38.530> off<00:05:38.820> lift<00:05:39.820> it<00:05:39.969> all

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
take the turbocharger off lift it all

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.630 
take the turbocharger off lift it all
well<00:05:40.270> through<00:05:40.840> the<00:05:40.960> polite<00:05:41.200> way<00:05:41.400> there<00:05:42.400> isn't

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
well through the polite way there isn't

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.120 
well through the polite way there isn't
that<00:05:42.669> much<00:05:42.880> to<00:05:42.940> it<00:05:44.280> one<00:05:45.280> gain<00:05:45.520> in<00:05:45.669> T<00:05:45.900> so<00:05:47.130> again

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
that much to it one gain in T so again

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.760 
that much to it one gain in T so again
that's<00:05:48.550> it<00:05:48.820> when<00:05:49.450> I<00:05:49.479> fitted<00:05:50.050> this<00:05:50.200> which<00:05:50.590> will

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
that's it when I fitted this which will

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.350 
that's it when I fitted this which will
be<00:05:50.860> after<00:05:51.280> I've<00:05:51.400> done<00:05:51.520> the<00:05:51.669> up<00:05:51.789> pipe<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:52.270> the

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
be after I've done the up pipe and the

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.430 
be after I've done the up pipe and the
review<00:05:52.690> on<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:52.930> output<00:05:53.260> I<00:05:54.150> shall<00:05:55.169> also<00:05:56.169> bet

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
review on the output I shall also bet

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.230 
review on the output I shall also bet

knowledge as to how it will sound

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.230 
knowledge as to how it will sound
afterwards<00:06:24.219> because<00:06:24.520> obviously<00:06:24.729> with
