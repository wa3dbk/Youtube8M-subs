but that's not permanently deleting them
to<00:01:26.880> permanently<00:01:27.450> delete<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.350> you're<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
to permanently delete it you're going to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.819 
to permanently delete it you're going to
need<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.220> go<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.810> finder<00:01:31.400> secure<00:01:32.400> empty<00:01:32.700> trash

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
need to go to finder secure empty trash

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.499 
need to go to finder secure empty trash
this<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:36.560> secure<00:01:37.560> way<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.549> makes<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.360> get

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
this is a secure way and it makes it get

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.560 
this is a secure way and it makes it get
all<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.170> off<00:01:40.619> your<00:01:41.280> computers<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.540> just

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
all of that off your computers and just

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.170 
all of that off your computers and just
empty<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> transfers<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.520> keeps<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.060> on

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
empty in the transfers it keeps it on

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.149 
empty in the transfers it keeps it on
there<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> doesn't<00:01:46.439> get<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.799> off<00:01:46.950> your

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
there and doesn't get it off your

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.200 
there and doesn't get it off your
computer<00:01:47.610> sort<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> secure<00:01:48.659> as<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.770> see

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
computer sort of secure as you can see

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.510 
computer sort of secure as you can see
it<00:01:51.210> does<00:01:51.570> take<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> while<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.979> will<00:01:53.220> probably

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
it does take a while this will probably

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.319 
it does take a while this will probably
take<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.680> how<00:01:55.920> big<00:01:56.130> your<00:01:56.340> file<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.149> did

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
take and how big your file as I just did

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.270 
take and how big your file as I just did
one<00:01:57.509> earlier<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.170> was<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.439> three<00:01:58.740> thousand

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
one earlier that was like three thousand

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.219 
one earlier that was like three thousand
some<00:01:59.579> that<00:02:00.479> took<00:02:01.110> probably<00:02:01.829> half<00:02:02.219> hour<00:02:03.229> but

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
some that took probably half hour but

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.800 
some that took probably half hour but
this<00:02:04.439> will<00:02:05.189> probably<00:02:05.219> only<00:02:05.670> take<00:02:05.939> ten<00:02:06.420> minutes

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
this will probably only take ten minutes

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.969 
this will probably only take ten minutes
probably<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:08.750> as<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.319> see<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> takes<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
probably so as you can see it takes a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.470 
probably so as you can see it takes a
little<00:02:11.099> bit<00:02:11.250> longer<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:12.060> this

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
little bit longer but that is this

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.309 
little bit longer but that is this
