silver<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.390> obviously<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.439> need<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.619> goal<00:01:49.829> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
silver but obviously you need a goal to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.870 
silver but obviously you need a goal to
go<00:01:50.100> unlike<00:01:50.520> all<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> tracks<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.670> one

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
go unlike all the tracks so so this one

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.249 
go unlike all the tracks so so this one
has<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> lot<00:01:54.390> better<00:01:54.540> graphics<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
has a lot better graphics in the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.450 
has a lot better graphics in the
original<00:01:55.640> trackmania<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
original trackmania the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.149 
original trackmania the
obviously<00:01:58.000> it's<00:01:58.090> got<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.240> canyon<00:01:59.159> landscape

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
obviously it's got a canyon landscape

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.670 
obviously it's got a canyon landscape
there<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.700> when<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:01.659> take<00:02:01.869> damage<00:02:02.049> in<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.470> car

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
there and when you take damage in a car

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.320 
there and when you take damage in a car
starts<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.250> trick<00:02:03.490> crinkle<00:02:03.940> up<00:02:04.000> like<00:02:04.210> an

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
starts to trick crinkle up like an

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.070 
starts to trick crinkle up like an
aluminum<00:02:04.780> can<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.850> let<00:02:07.270> me<00:02:07.360> just<00:02:07.510> fire<00:02:07.750> up<00:02:07.780> a

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
aluminum can so let me just fire up a

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.059 
aluminum can so let me just fire up a
map<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.319> I<00:02:08.530> made<00:02:08.819> nothing<00:02:09.819> special<00:02:10.149> just<00:02:11.069> go

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
map that I made nothing special just go

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.050 
map that I made nothing special just go
here<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.370> guess<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.520> little<00:02:15.550> too<00:02:15.760> loading

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
here I guess it's a little too loading

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.250 
here I guess it's a little too loading
time<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:18.160> yeah<00:02:18.280> add<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:19.360> map<00:02:19.569> maker<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.930> pretty

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
time so yeah add the map maker is pretty

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.710 
time so yeah add the map maker is pretty
straightforward<00:02:20.910> I'll<00:02:21.910> usually<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.420> tracks

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
straightforward I'll usually the tracks

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.190 
straightforward I'll usually the tracks
down<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.200> can<00:02:23.319> do<00:02:24.270> however<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.690> want<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.020> do

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
down you can do however you want to do

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.130 
down you can do however you want to do
it<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:27.550> here's<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.880> track<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.569> made<00:02:28.930> and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
it so here's a track that I made and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.229 
it so here's a track that I made and
that's<00:02:29.350> just<00:02:29.530> validate<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:37.120> can

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
that's just validate it you can

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.240 
that's just validate it you can
customize<00:02:37.750> your<00:02:37.900> car<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.650> can<00:02:38.800> paint<00:02:39.070> it

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
customize your car to you can paint it

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.190 
customize your car to you can paint it
and<00:02:39.430> everything<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.269> is<00:02:40.420> just<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.690> stock<00:02:40.959> car

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
and everything this is just a stock car

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.250 
and everything this is just a stock car
I<00:02:41.260> don't<00:02:41.620> care

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.569 

so<00:02:46.260> we<00:02:46.349> create<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.799> map<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.219> stuff<00:02:47.370> it'll

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
so we create the map and stuff it'll

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:53.750 
so we create the map and stuff it'll
have<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:48.469> render<00:02:49.469> shadows<00:02:52.129> and<00:02:53.129> you<00:02:53.219> can<00:02:53.370> you

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
have you render shadows and you can you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.330 
have you render shadows and you can you
know<00:02:54.409> make<00:02:55.409> it<00:02:55.590> how<00:02:57.290> detail<00:02:58.290> or<00:02:58.590> not<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:59.129> want

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
know make it how detail or not you want

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.949 
know make it how detail or not you want
to<00:02:59.519> be<00:03:01.040> physics<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.400> find<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.480> physics<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.870> be

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
to be physics I find the physics to be

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.830 
to be physics I find the physics to be
kind<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.290> hit<00:03:04.590> or<00:03:04.620> miss<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:08.280> know<00:03:08.840> seems

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
kind of hit or miss you know seems

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.119 
kind of hit or miss you know seems
pretty<00:03:10.109> accurate<00:03:10.260> or<00:03:11.250> spot-on<00:03:12.889> you<00:03:13.889> know<00:03:13.980> when

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
pretty accurate or spot-on you know when

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.250 
pretty accurate or spot-on you know when
it<00:03:14.219> comes<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.459> doing<00:03:14.609> the<00:03:14.819> jumps<00:03:15.689> and<00:03:15.840> whatnot

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
it comes to doing the jumps and whatnot

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.190 
it comes to doing the jumps and whatnot
but<00:03:16.819> sometimes<00:03:17.819> like<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.209> car<00:03:18.480> feels<00:03:18.930> like

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
but sometimes like the car feels like

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.190 
but sometimes like the car feels like
it's<00:03:19.349> only<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.650> don't<00:03:19.829> know<00:03:19.980> five<00:03:20.310> pounds<00:03:20.970> oh

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
it's only I don't know five pounds oh

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.140 
it's only I don't know five pounds oh
that's<00:03:22.200> not<00:03:22.409> cool<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:23.489> hit<00:03:23.639> backspace<00:03:23.970> to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
that's not cool you hit backspace to

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.369 
that's not cool you hit backspace to
restart<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:25.220> by<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.280> way

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
restart it by the way

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.990 
restart it by the way
be<00:03:29.379> restarting<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.069> a<00:03:30.129> lot<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.760> can<00:03:30.909> either

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
be restarting it a lot so you can either

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.490 
be restarting it a lot so you can either
you<00:03:31.269> can<00:03:31.420> either<00:03:31.510> resume<00:03:31.959> from<00:03:32.140> your<00:03:32.319> last

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
you can either resume from your last

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.429 
you can either resume from your last
checkpoint<00:03:33.010> which<00:03:33.849> I<00:03:34.150> ever<00:03:34.299> I<00:03:34.480> rarely<00:03:34.870> ever<00:03:35.079> do

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
checkpoint which I ever I rarely ever do

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.500 
checkpoint which I ever I rarely ever do
or<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:35.799> can<00:03:36.129> resume<00:03:36.519> from<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:39.549> stress<00:03:40.269> start

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
or you can resume from the stress start

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.839 
or you can resume from the stress start
over<00:03:40.840> which<00:03:41.200> think<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.099> last<00:03:42.280> checkpoint<00:03:42.549> is

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
over which think the last checkpoint is

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:50.820 
over which think the last checkpoint is
entered<00:03:43.209> starting<00:03:43.689> over<00:03:44.109> is<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.290> backspace

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.520 

as<00:03:51.830> I<00:03:52.010> said<00:03:52.069> before<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.580> am<00:03:52.640> NOT<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.000> good<00:03:53.530> racer

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
as I said before I am NOT a good racer

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:02.240 
as I said before I am NOT a good racer
I'm<00:03:54.739> definitely<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.370> casual<00:03:56.239> crowd<00:03:56.629> here

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.670 

so<00:04:03.250> yeah<00:04:03.430> get<00:04:03.640> some<00:04:03.700> air<00:04:03.969> time<00:04:04.469> some<00:04:05.469> of<00:04:05.590> the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
so yeah get some air time some of the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.979 
so yeah get some air time some of the
tracks<00:04:05.920> are<00:04:06.099> crazy<00:04:06.430> with<00:04:06.790> loops<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.569> I'd<00:04:07.840> like

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
tracks are crazy with loops and I'd like

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.319 
tracks are crazy with loops and I'd like
it<00:04:08.200> get<00:04:08.980> your<00:04:09.129> hot<00:04:09.280> your<00:04:09.549> car<00:04:09.849> through<00:04:10.090> like

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
it get your hot your car through like

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.479 
it get your hot your car through like
these<00:04:10.480> tiny<00:04:10.810> holes<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.590> landing<00:04:11.980> an<00:04:12.069> air<00:04:12.250> and

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
these tiny holes and landing an air and

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.309 
these tiny holes and landing an air and
all<00:04:12.549> that<00:04:12.670> stuff<00:04:12.790> but<00:04:12.909> I<00:04:13.120> duendes<00:04:13.719> track<00:04:14.170> with

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
all that stuff but I duendes track with

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:23.430 
all that stuff but I duendes track with
a<00:04:14.379> bang<00:04:16.590> haha<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:18.250> close<00:04:19.289> yeah<00:04:22.440> pretty

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
a bang haha so close yeah pretty

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.330 
a bang haha so close yeah pretty
graphics<00:04:23.860> though<00:04:25.590> it's<00:04:26.590> pretty<00:04:26.860> much<00:04:27.070> how

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
graphics though it's pretty much how

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.070 
graphics though it's pretty much how
this<00:04:27.550> goes<00:04:27.759> but<00:04:27.970> some<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.479> tracks<00:04:28.750> they

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
this goes but some of the tracks they

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.260 
this goes but some of the tracks they

on the you know of these canyons and
it's<00:04:45.400> easy<00:04:45.669> to<00:04:45.940> fall<00:04:46.240> off<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:48.610> sometimes<00:04:49.030> you

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
it's easy to fall off so sometimes you

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.760 
it's easy to fall off so sometimes you
have<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.389> be<00:04:49.539> a<00:04:50.699> little<00:04:51.699> touchy<00:04:54.060> with<00:04:55.060> your<00:04:55.770> see

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
there's a damaged put the car still

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.420 
there's a damaged put the car still
drivable<00:04:59.110> so<00:04:59.289> that<00:04:59.440> part's<00:04:59.680> not<00:04:59.770> realistic

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
drivable so that part's not realistic

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.460 
drivable so that part's not realistic
but<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.419> can<00:05:01.539> see<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:01.780> car<00:05:01.960> is<00:05:02.050> a<00:05:02.080> little<00:05:02.169> bit

so<00:05:08.580> yes<00:05:08.909> not<00:05:09.569> they<00:05:10.139> added<00:05:10.499> more<00:05:10.710> realism<00:05:11.219> but

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
so yes not they added more realism but

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.730
