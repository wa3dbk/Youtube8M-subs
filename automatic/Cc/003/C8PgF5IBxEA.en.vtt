okay<00:00:03.659> guys<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:04.770> video<00:00:05.009> tutorial<00:00:05.430> I'm

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
okay guys in this video tutorial I'm

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.280 
okay guys in this video tutorial I'm
going<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.210> talk<00:00:06.420> about<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.839> types<00:00:07.109> of

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
going to talk about the types of

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.730 
going to talk about the types of
rotation<00:00:08.250> by<00:00:08.550> flagella<00:00:09.210> for<00:00:09.510> bacteria<00:00:09.990> it's

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
rotation by flagella for bacteria it's

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.440 
rotation by flagella for bacteria it's
kind<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.160> very<00:00:11.519> unique<00:00:11.700> topic<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.300> I'm<00:00:12.420> going

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
kind of very unique topic that I'm going

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.970 
kind of very unique topic that I'm going
to<00:00:12.630> talk<00:00:12.840> about<00:00:12.990> because<00:00:13.349> people<00:00:13.380> may<00:00:13.799> talk

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
to talk about because people may talk

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.860 
to talk about because people may talk
about<00:00:14.040> structure<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.179> flagella<00:00:15.719> and

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
about structure of flagella and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.650 
about structure of flagella and
chemotaxis<00:00:16.770> also<00:00:17.220> but<00:00:17.400> people<00:00:18.090> generally<00:00:18.480> do

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
chemotaxis also but people generally do

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720 
chemotaxis also but people generally do
not<00:00:18.690> talk<00:00:18.960> about<00:00:19.260> how<00:00:19.800> they<00:00:20.070> actually<00:00:20.189> rotate

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
not talk about how they actually rotate

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.820 
not talk about how they actually rotate
using<00:00:20.910> flagella<00:00:21.510> naturally<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> flagella

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
using flagella naturally the flagella

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.650 
using flagella naturally the flagella
rotation<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.490> possible<00:00:23.970> due<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.150> remember

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
rotation is possible due to remember

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.810 
rotation is possible due to remember
those<00:00:24.930> L<00:00:25.199> ring<00:00:25.500> M<00:00:25.710> ring<00:00:25.980> feeding<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.519> all<00:00:26.640> these

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
those L ring M ring feeding on all these

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.060 
those L ring M ring feeding on all these
rings<00:00:27.060> are<00:00:27.269> there<00:00:27.510> which<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.170> having<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.650> basal

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
rings are there which is having a basal

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.999 
rings are there which is having a basal
body<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.699> also<00:00:30.029> rotol<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.170> state<00:00:31.410> or<00:00:31.590> state

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
body and also rotol so state or state

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.729 
body and also rotol so state or state
there<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.730> rotor<00:00:33.059> helps<00:00:33.420> them<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.719> rotate<00:00:33.870> now

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
there and rotor helps them to rotate now

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.920 
there and rotor helps them to rotate now
flagella<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.460> help<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.940> bacteria<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.450> move<00:00:36.690> in

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
flagella can help a bacteria to move in

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.420 
flagella can help a bacteria to move in
different<00:00:37.079> orientation<00:00:38.010> via<00:00:38.190> different

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
different orientation via different

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.310 
different orientation via different
processes<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.780> case<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:40.200> going

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
processes and in this case we are going

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.799 
processes and in this case we are going
to<00:00:40.469> see<00:00:40.649> two<00:00:41.250> different<00:00:41.670> types<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.239> flagella

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
to see two different types of flagella

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.479 
to see two different types of flagella
that<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.410> present<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.950> bacterial<00:00:44.460> cell

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that can be present in a bacterial cell

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.790 
that can be present in a bacterial cell
for<00:00:45.239> example<00:00:45.329> parrot<00:00:45.960> triggers<00:00:46.289> flagella

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
for example parrot triggers flagella

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.310 
for example parrot triggers flagella
that<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.160> number<00:00:47.969> more<00:00:48.210> than<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.629> our<00:00:48.809> number

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that is number more than one our number

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.410 
that is number more than one our number
of<00:00:49.440> flagella<00:00:49.890> present<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.460> different<00:00:50.489> regions

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
of flagella present in different regions

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
of flagella present in different regions
from<00:00:51.570> different<00:00:52.020> regions<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> bacteria<00:00:52.980> it

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
from different regions in a bacteria it

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.760 
from different regions in a bacteria it
can<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.850> at<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> particular<00:00:55.020> site<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.620> be

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
can be at a particular site it can be

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.619 
can be at a particular site it can be
from<00:00:55.980> different<00:00:56.160> sites<00:00:56.640> completely

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
from different sites completely

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
from different sites completely
surrounding<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.289> bacterial<00:00:58.739> cell<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
surrounding a bacterial cell on the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.790 
surrounding a bacterial cell on the
other<00:00:59.969> hand<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> polar<00:01:01.199> flagella

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
other hand we can see the polar flagella

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.640 
other hand we can see the polar flagella
which<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.160> only<00:01:02.340> present<00:01:02.640> from<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.870> pole<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.530> a

bacterial cell either left right and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.780 
bacterial cell either left right and
whatever<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.229> different<00:01:07.650> side<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
whatever this different side so if you

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.280 
whatever this different side so if you
look<00:01:08.970> at<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> para<00:01:09.600> triggers<00:01:09.990> type<00:01:10.140> of

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
look at the para triggers type of

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.260 
look at the para triggers type of
flagella<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.070> movement<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.580> rotation<00:01:11.729> by

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
flagella the movement or rotation by

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.330 
flagella the movement or rotation by
para<00:01:12.570> triggers<00:01:12.900> flagella<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.380> different<00:01:13.979> than

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
para triggers flagella is different than

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.130 
para triggers flagella is different than
the<00:01:14.460> polar<00:01:14.729> flagella<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the polar flagella because the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.960 
the polar flagella because the
penetrators<00:01:16.619> flagella<00:01:17.070> actually<00:01:17.549> help<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
penetrators flagella actually help the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.749 
penetrators flagella actually help the
cell<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.409> tumbling<00:01:19.860> movement

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
cell to go for the tumbling movement

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.690 
cell to go for the tumbling movement
right<00:01:21.259> it<00:01:22.259> also<00:01:22.470> helps<00:01:22.860> them<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.189> grow<00:01:23.400> for

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
right it also helps them to grow for

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.300 
right it also helps them to grow for
normal<00:01:24.210> bundle<00:01:24.630> movement<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.159> also

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
normal bundle movement but it can also

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.249 
normal bundle movement but it can also
go<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.729> tumbling<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.360> bundle<00:01:27.750> movement<00:01:28.140> as

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
go for tumbling so bundle movement as

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.499 
go for tumbling so bundle movement as
well<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.799> thumb<00:01:29.040> rule<00:01:29.250> movement<00:01:29.400> both<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.299> them

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
well as thumb rule movement both of them

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.380 
well as thumb rule movement both of them
are<00:01:30.689> possible<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.829> political<00:01:32.759> spatula<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
are possible for political spatula and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.810 
are possible for political spatula and
if<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> look<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> bundle<00:01:35.070> movement<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
if you look at the bundle movement that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.730 
if you look at the bundle movement that
means<00:01:36.030> all<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.479> those<00:01:36.659> flagella<00:01:37.170> will<00:01:37.439> work

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
means all of those flagella will work

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.789 
means all of those flagella will work
together<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> bundle<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.450> flagella<00:01:40.290> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
together like a bundle of flagella to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.639 
together like a bundle of flagella to
rotate<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:42.030> themselves<00:01:42.960> at<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> particular

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
rotate it's themselves at a particular

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.380 
rotate it's themselves at a particular
direction<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> same<00:01:44.399> direction<00:01:44.970> remember

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
direction at the same direction remember

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.270 
direction at the same direction remember
all<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.290> flagella<00:01:46.500> working<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.250> a

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
all of the flagella working like a

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.940 
all of the flagella working like a
bundle<00:01:47.579> rotating<00:01:48.479> at<00:01:48.630> same<00:01:48.990> direction<00:01:49.500> either

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
bundle rotating at same direction either

they<00:01:53.610> they<00:01:54.360> rotate<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> counterclockwise

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
they they rotate in the counterclockwise

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.620 
they they rotate in the counterclockwise
direction<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.790> see<00:01:56.969> here<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.240> all<00:01:57.420> of

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
direction as you can see here so all of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.429 
direction as you can see here so all of
them<00:01:57.780> are<00:01:57.869> rotating<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
them are rotating in the

them are rotating in the
counterclockwise<00:01:58.770> direction<00:01:59.299> like<00:02:00.299> bungee

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
counterclockwise direction like bungee

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.800

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
as single-unit and as a result this

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.289 
as single-unit and as a result this
bacteria<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.409> move<00:02:04.710> from<00:02:05.399> one<00:02:05.759> side<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
bacteria can move from one side to

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.010 
bacteria can move from one side to
another

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
another

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
one side to another side so either this

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.870 
one side to another side so either this
side<00:02:09.270> or<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.690> side<00:02:10.020> clockwise<00:02:10.890> or<00:02:11.370> counter

side or this side clockwise or counter

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.699 
side or this side clockwise or counter
clockwise<00:02:11.910> they<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.660> move<00:02:12.840> now<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.470> case

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
clockwise they can move now in this case

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.830 
clockwise they can move now in this case
they<00:02:14.069> are<00:02:14.160> going<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.580> counter<00:02:14.940> clockwise<00:02:15.209> but

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
they are going to counter clockwise but

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.720 
they are going to counter clockwise but
in<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.170> case<00:02:16.410> they<00:02:16.890> are<00:02:16.920> moving<00:02:17.250> remember

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
in this case they are moving remember

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.370 
in this case they are moving remember
clockwise<00:02:18.180> direction<00:02:18.630> they<00:02:19.050> are<00:02:19.080> moving

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
clockwise direction they are moving

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.680 
clockwise direction they are moving
right<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.640> either<00:02:20.819> way<00:02:21.120> they<00:02:21.300> can<00:02:21.480> migrate

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
right so in either way they can migrate

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.600 
right so in either way they can migrate
and<00:02:22.080> move<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.530> due<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.040> movement<00:02:23.340> you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
and move and due to this movement you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.729 
and move and due to this movement you
can<00:02:23.760> see<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> kind<00:02:25.620> of

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
can see this so so this is a kind of

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.860 
can see this so so this is a kind of
mistake<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.069> not<00:02:26.280> CCW<00:02:26.970> should<00:02:27.150> be<00:02:27.269> CW<00:02:27.690> there

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
mistake is not CCW should be CW there

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.460 
mistake is not CCW should be CW there
anyways<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.130> possible<00:02:29.519> like<00:02:29.670> this

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
anyways so this is possible like this

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.720 
anyways so this is possible like this
but<00:02:31.470> for<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.830> other<00:02:31.920> hand<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.280> tumbling

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
but for the other hand the tumbling

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.970 
but for the other hand the tumbling
movement<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.300> slightly<00:02:33.510> different<00:02:33.900> for<00:02:34.530> for

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
movement is slightly different for for

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.190 
movement is slightly different for for
the<00:02:35.640> tumbling<00:02:36.030> movement<00:02:36.450> all<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
the tumbling movement all of the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.770 
the tumbling movement all of the
flagella<00:02:37.410> should<00:02:37.890> work<00:02:38.209> independently<00:02:39.209> not

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
flagella should work independently not

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.710 
flagella should work independently not
all<00:02:40.350> together<00:02:41.250> like<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> bundle<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.420> here<00:02:42.600> we

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
all together like a bundle so here we

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.090 
all together like a bundle so here we
can<00:02:42.810> see<00:02:42.989> three<00:02:43.170> different<00:02:43.350> flagella<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:43.980> this

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
can see three different flagella in this

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.130 
can see three different flagella in this
picture<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.640> see<00:02:45.150> flagella<00:02:45.630> are<00:02:45.660> working

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
picture and see flagella are working

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.559 
picture and see flagella are working
together<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.830> they<00:02:47.340> are<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:47.730> just<00:02:48.150> moving

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
together and they are just just moving

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.330 
together and they are just just moving
they<00:02:48.840> are<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.110> moving<00:02:49.260> via<00:02:49.680> their<00:02:50.310> own

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
they are just moving via their own

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.460 
they are just moving via their own
processes<00:02:51.239> they<00:02:51.360> are<00:02:51.390> just<00:02:51.630> rotating<00:02:52.110> by<00:02:52.440> a

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
processes they are just rotating by a

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.620 
processes they are just rotating by a
clockwise<00:02:53.010> orientation<00:02:53.280> clockwise<00:02:54.090> rotation

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
clockwise orientation clockwise rotation

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.390 
clockwise orientation clockwise rotation
due<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.380> clockwise<00:02:55.799> rotation<00:02:56.250> they<00:02:56.340> are

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
due to this clockwise rotation they are

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.280 
due to this clockwise rotation they are
moving<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.880> migrating<00:02:57.390> as<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.569> result<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.140> that

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
moving and migrating as a result of that

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.050 
moving and migrating as a result of that
the<00:02:58.680> bacteria<00:02:59.069> is<00:02:59.160> moving<00:02:59.519> from<00:02:59.700> one<00:02:59.819> place<00:02:59.970> to

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
the bacteria is moving from one place to

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.210 
the bacteria is moving from one place to
another<00:03:00.209> place<00:03:00.690> right<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.769> tumbling

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
another place right so this tumbling

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.309 
another place right so this tumbling
movement<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.790> also<00:03:03.120> very<00:03:03.299> very<00:03:03.480> important

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
movement is also very very important

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.370 
movement is also very very important
because<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.830> many<00:03:05.010> cases<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.610> bacteria

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
because in many cases the bacteria

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.110 
because in many cases the bacteria
usually<00:03:07.380> need<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.160> go<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:08.489> bundling<00:03:08.910> and

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
usually need to go for bundling and

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.060 
usually need to go for bundling and
sometimes<00:03:09.840> they<00:03:10.049> need<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.410> have<00:03:10.590> this

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
sometimes they need to have this

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.650 
sometimes they need to have this
tumbling<00:03:11.459> movement<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.940> rotate<00:03:12.269> from<00:03:12.480> one

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
tumbling movement to rotate from one

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.270 
tumbling movement to rotate from one
place<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.900> another<00:03:13.019> place<00:03:13.440> all<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.739> time<00:03:13.920> so

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
place to another place all the time so

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.770 
place to another place all the time so
that's<00:03:14.370> why<00:03:14.519> both<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:15.000> these<00:03:15.120> movements<00:03:15.390> are

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
that's why both of these movements are

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.960 
that's why both of these movements are
equally<00:03:16.590> important<00:03:17.340> for<00:03:17.760> different

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
equally important for different

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.270 
equally important for different
orientation<00:03:18.870> for<00:03:19.230> orientation<00:03:19.709> battery

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
orientation for orientation battery

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.670 
orientation for orientation battery
usually<00:03:20.459> learn<00:03:20.910> tumbling<00:03:21.510> for<00:03:22.320> maintaining

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
usually learn tumbling for maintaining

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.949 
usually learn tumbling for maintaining
the<00:03:22.920> balance<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.459> particular<00:03:23.880> solution<00:03:24.510> or

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
the balance in a particular solution or

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.229 
the balance in a particular solution or
liquid<00:03:25.470> environment<00:03:26.160> for<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.400> but<00:03:27.030> for

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
liquid environment for that but for

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.020 
liquid environment for that but for
actual<00:03:27.840> movement<00:03:28.230> directed<00:03:29.010> movement<00:03:29.250> do<00:03:29.910> you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
actual movement directed movement do you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.030 
actual movement directed movement do you
do<00:03:30.239> two<00:03:30.420> chemotaxis<00:03:30.930> duty<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.560> their<00:03:31.650> presence

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
do two chemotaxis duty of their presence

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.949 
do two chemotaxis duty of their presence
of<00:03:32.190> their<00:03:32.370> food<00:03:32.640> sources<00:03:33.239> they<00:03:33.630> will<00:03:33.750> migrate

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
of their food sources they will migrate

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.710 
of their food sources they will migrate
via<00:03:34.410> bundling<00:03:35.130> movement<00:03:35.579> right<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.390> that's<00:03:36.569> it

body into the kind of vertically and

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.360 
body into the kind of vertically and
then<00:04:26.870> again<00:04:27.290> clockwise<00:04:27.800> rotation<00:04:28.250> of

then again clockwise rotation of
plazuela<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:29.000> then<00:04:29.480> the<00:04:29.570> bacteria<00:04:29.750> will<00:04:30.110> move

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
plazuela and then the bacteria will move

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.950 
plazuela and then the bacteria will move
from<00:04:30.950> bottom<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.730> top<00:04:31.760> so<00:04:32.180> this<00:04:32.630> is<00:04:32.780> one

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
from bottom to the top so this is one

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.780 
from bottom to the top so this is one
kind<00:04:33.110> of<00:04:33.320> unidirectional<00:04:34.010> flagella<00:04:34.430> movement

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
kind of unidirectional flagella movement

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.060 
kind of unidirectional flagella movement
for<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.720> reversible<00:04:36.200> flagella<00:04:36.680> movement

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
for the reversible flagella movement

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.310 
for the reversible flagella movement
again<00:04:37.640> this<00:04:37.910> is<00:04:38.090> kind<00:04:38.360> of<00:04:38.510> clockwise<00:04:38.900> and

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
again this is kind of clockwise and

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.440 
again this is kind of clockwise and
clock<00:04:40.010> anti-clockwise<00:04:40.700> both<00:04:41.000> of<00:04:41.150> them<00:04:41.300> are

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
clock anti-clockwise both of them are

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.330 
clock anti-clockwise both of them are
coming<00:04:41.840> together<00:04:42.080> so<00:04:42.710> if<00:04:42.770> you<00:04:42.860> look<00:04:43.010> at<00:04:43.130> here

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
coming together so if you look at here

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.220 
coming together so if you look at here
in<00:04:43.520> this<00:04:43.670> case<00:04:43.730> the<00:04:44.330> rotation<00:04:44.720> of<00:04:44.780> flagella

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
in this case the rotation of flagella

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.010 
in this case the rotation of flagella
counter<00:04:45.710> clockwise<00:04:46.010> or<00:04:46.520> anti-clockwise<00:04:47.020> due

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
counter clockwise or anti-clockwise due

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.140 
counter clockwise or anti-clockwise due
to<00:04:48.200> this<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.800> bacteria<00:04:49.280> is<00:04:49.370> moving<00:04:49.820> from<00:04:50.030> left

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
to this the bacteria is moving from left

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.870 
to this the bacteria is moving from left
hand<00:04:50.600> side<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.930> right<00:04:51.200> hand<00:04:51.260> side<00:04:51.650> then<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.580> can

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
hand side to right hand side then it can

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.270 
hand side to right hand side then it can
also<00:04:53.060> go<00:04:53.450> back<00:04:53.480> from<00:04:53.900> right<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.590> left

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
also go back from right to left

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.610 
also go back from right to left
once<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.270> flagella<00:04:56.660> start<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.080> rotate<00:04:57.410> in

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
once the flagella start to rotate in

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.220 
once the flagella start to rotate in
clockwise<00:04:57.700> orientation<00:04:58.700> so<00:04:59.600> anti-clockwise

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
clockwise orientation so anti-clockwise

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.100 
clockwise orientation so anti-clockwise
going<00:05:00.890> left<00:05:01.130> to<00:05:01.250> right<00:05:01.340> clockwise<00:05:02.090> right<00:05:02.900> to

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
going left to right clockwise right to

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.410 
going left to right clockwise right to
left<00:05:03.260> and<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:03.830> is<00:05:03.890> a<00:05:04.040> way<00:05:04.280> of<00:05:04.460> rotation<00:05:05.240> using

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
left and this is a way of rotation using

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.660 
left and this is a way of rotation using
polar<00:05:05.870> flagella<00:05:06.500> like<00:05:06.650> reversible<00:05:07.160> flies<00:05:07.430> all

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
polar flagella like reversible flies all

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.250 
polar flagella like reversible flies all
right<00:05:07.790> so<00:05:08.180> these<00:05:08.330> are<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.660> different<00:05:09.020> types

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
right so these are the different types

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.220 
right so these are the different types
of<00:05:09.920> rotation<00:05:10.670> by<00:05:10.910> flageolet<00:05:11.570> as<00:05:11.690> are<00:05:11.810> possible

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
of rotation by flageolet as are possible

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.390 
of rotation by flageolet as are possible
and<00:05:12.470> I<00:05:12.710> hope<00:05:12.920> that's<00:05:13.130> helpful<00:05:13.160> guys<00:05:13.610> thank<00:05:14.270> you
