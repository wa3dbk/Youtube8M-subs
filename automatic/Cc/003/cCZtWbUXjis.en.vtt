are<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.539> capturing<00:00:22.109> some<00:00:22.439> ghosts

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
are going to be capturing some ghosts

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:35.479 
are going to be capturing some ghosts
with<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.850> Potter<00:00:24.330> cost<00:00:24.830> 3000<00:00:33.469> so<00:00:34.469> yeah<00:00:35.130> we're

with the Potter cost 3000 so yeah we're
back<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.820> again<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.960> actually<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
back here again and this is actually the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.780 
back here again and this is actually the
whole<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.030> redstone<00:00:39.660> contraption<00:00:40.350> bit

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
whole of the redstone contraption bit

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.150 
whole of the redstone contraption bit
I'm<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.239> quickly<00:00:42.600> kill<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.200> gasps

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.850 

yeah<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.489> does<00:00:47.760> spoil<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.510> trick<00:00:48.899> when<00:00:49.710> it's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
yeah it does spoil the trick when it's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.970 
yeah it does spoil the trick when it's
far<00:00:50.070> away<00:00:50.340> over<00:00:50.750> multiple<00:00:51.750> gases<00:00:52.170> but

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
far away over multiple gases but

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.319 
far away over multiple gases but
otherwise<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.670> does<00:00:53.850> look<00:00:54.059> pretty<00:00:54.180> cool

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
otherwise it does look pretty cool

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.830 
otherwise it does look pretty cool
anyway<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.610> as<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.789> always<00:00:57.000> start<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.780> my

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
anyway and as I always start with my

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.160 
anyway and as I always start with my
redstone<00:00:58.370> contraption<00:00:59.370> things<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.030> start<00:01:00.960> off

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
redstone contraption things I start off

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.979 
redstone contraption things I start off
with<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.800> start<00:01:02.399> off<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.760> these<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
with I start off with these and this is

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.480 
with I start off with these and this is
a<00:01:04.019> very<00:01:04.439> fast<00:01:06.020> luck<00:01:07.020> place<00:01:07.500> earth<00:01:07.830> clock<00:01:08.189> I

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
a very fast luck place earth clock I

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.960 
a very fast luck place earth clock I
believe<00:01:09.260> this<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.130> smallest<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.790> I

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
believe this one is the smallest one I

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
believe this one is the smallest one I
believe<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> quickest<00:01:13.439> there's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
believe and one of the quickest there's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.130 
believe and one of the quickest there's
also<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.670> makes<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.630> noisy

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
also one that makes it so it's not noisy

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.960 
also one that makes it so it's not noisy
nor<00:01:16.500> does<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.740> make<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.159> particle<00:01:17.700> effect

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
nor does it make this particle effect

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.969 
nor does it make this particle effect
but<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:18.990> prefer<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.890> because

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
but I do prefer this one just because

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.609 
but I do prefer this one just because
it's<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.460> lot<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.700> compact<00:01:21.119> anyway<00:01:21.780> let's<00:01:22.530> go

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
it's a lot more compact anyway let's go

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.310 
it's a lot more compact anyway let's go
on<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.479> is<00:01:24.479> constantly<00:01:25.049> getting

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
on this one is constantly getting

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.050 
on this one is constantly getting
activated<00:01:25.920> by<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.100> redstone<00:01:26.610> block<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
activated by this redstone block as you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.230 
activated by this redstone block as you
can<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.470> testing<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
can see and it is testing for the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240 
can see and it is testing for the
minecraft<00:01:30.780> popper<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:32.040> my

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
minecraft popper if it is in my

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.390 
minecraft popper if it is in my
inventory<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.240> moving<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.040> can<00:01:35.189> see

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
inventory so moving on as you can see

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.940 
inventory so moving on as you can see
this<00:01:35.759> is

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
this is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.039 
this is
lock<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.189> goes<00:01:38.490> around<00:01:38.610> when<00:01:39.030> activated<00:01:39.810> and

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
lock that goes around when activated and

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.899 
lock that goes around when activated and
just<00:01:40.470> constant<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> goes<00:01:41.250> around<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.600> have

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
just constant it goes around as I have

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.120 
just constant it goes around as I have
in<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:45.119> inventory<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.170> don't<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.799> goes

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
in my inventory one I don't it just goes

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.490 
in my inventory one I don't it just goes
off<00:01:47.310> straightaway<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.630> see<00:01:48.990> even<00:01:49.259> if

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
off straightaway you can see even if

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.120 
off straightaway you can see even if
it's<00:01:49.649> mid<00:01:49.979> mid<00:01:50.880> through<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:52.259> cycle<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.920> just

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it's mid mid through the cycle it just

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.639 
it's mid mid through the cycle it just
stops<00:01:53.369> completely<00:01:54.179> it's<00:01:54.659> very<00:01:54.929> quick<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
stops completely it's very quick and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.760 
stops completely it's very quick and
very<00:01:55.860> accurate<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.409> may<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.590> wondering

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
very accurate so you may be wondering

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.950 
very accurate so you may be wondering
that<00:01:59.220> what<00:01:59.460> does<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.820> command<00:02:00.179> block<00:02:00.299> do<00:02:00.600> it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
that what does this command block do it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.410 
that what does this command block do it
actually<00:02:01.170> plays<00:02:01.679> this<00:02:02.009> sound<00:02:02.310> which<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
actually plays this sound which is the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.679 
actually plays this sound which is the
little<00:02:03.630> pop<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.020> effect<00:02:04.670> which<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.880> do<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.390> it

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
little pop in effect which I do like it

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.559 
little pop in effect which I do like it
does<00:02:07.259> sound<00:02:07.950> pretty<00:02:08.280> much<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:11.569> more

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
does sound pretty much like a more

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.759 
does sound pretty much like a more
old-fashioned<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.900> does<00:02:16.110> actually<00:02:16.350> sound

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
old-fashioned it does actually sound

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.449 
old-fashioned it does actually sound
kind<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:17.940> vacuum<00:02:18.209> or<00:02:19.200> some<00:02:19.980> sort<00:02:20.250> of

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
kind of like a vacuum or some sort of

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.410 
kind of like a vacuum or some sort of
goes<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.260> capturing<00:02:22.260> things<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.950> guess<00:02:23.420> not

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
goes to capturing things I guess not

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.240 
goes to capturing things I guess not
that<00:02:24.480> I've<00:02:24.780> ever<00:02:24.900> heard<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.349> one<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.709> those<00:02:25.890> but

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
that I've ever heard of one of those but

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.990 
that I've ever heard of one of those but
oh<00:02:26.400> well<00:02:27.470> anyway<00:02:28.470> when<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.549> a<00:02:29.580> clock

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
oh well anyway when this is on a clock

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.880 
oh well anyway when this is on a clock
cycle<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.019> comments<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.530> command

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
cycle this is comments this command

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.890 
cycle this is comments this command
block<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.220> also<00:02:32.670> constantly<00:02:33.150> being<00:02:33.450> activated

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
block is also constantly being activated

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.610 
block is also constantly being activated
what<00:02:34.709> this<00:02:34.860> does<00:02:35.099> is<00:02:35.370> kill<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.730> gusts<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:40.440> yeah

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
what this does is kill the gusts so yeah

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.690 
what this does is kill the gusts so yeah
and<00:02:40.890> when<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.549> does<00:02:41.760> kill<00:02:42.000> Agust<00:02:42.320> this

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
and when it does kill Agust this

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.460 
and when it does kill Agust this
comparator<00:02:44.700> will<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:45.450> go<00:02:45.660> off<00:02:45.840> force<00:02:46.230> but

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
comparator will like go off force but

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.009 
comparator will like go off force but
it's<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> moment<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.209> will<00:02:48.329> activate<00:02:48.750> this

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
it's a moment and it will activate this

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.890 
it's a moment and it will activate this
which<00:02:49.350> gives<00:02:49.680> me<00:02:49.859> the<00:02:49.980> gust<00:02:50.160> here<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.510> I'm

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
which gives me the gust here and I'm

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.360 
which gives me the gust here and I'm
gonna<00:02:52.140> actually<00:02:52.560> change<00:02:52.769> that<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.930> gusts<00:02:55.370> egg

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
gonna actually change that to gusts egg

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.120 
gonna actually change that to gusts egg
I<00:02:56.780> don't<00:02:57.780> exactly<00:02:58.140> know<00:02:58.410> I'm<00:02:58.560> gonna<00:02:58.739> fix<00:02:58.950> that

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
I don't exactly know I'm gonna fix that

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.729 
I don't exactly know I'm gonna fix that
in<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.310> moment<00:02:59.459> or<00:02:59.790> two<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.900> yeah<00:03:01.109> that's<00:03:01.410> really

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
two for six I believe for making the

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.420 
two for six I believe for making the
vacuum<00:03:20.940> in<00:03:21.060> Minecraft<00:03:21.540> but<00:03:22.380> yeah<00:03:23.190> go<00:03:23.370> check

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
vacuum in Minecraft but yeah go check

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.849 
vacuum in Minecraft but yeah go check
out<00:03:23.760> his<00:03:23.850> video<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.239> can<00:03:24.630> see<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:25.079> both

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
out his video you can see that both

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.809 
out his video you can see that both
these<00:03:26.160> are<00:03:26.549> completely<00:03:27.120> different<00:03:27.440> in<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.530> way

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
these are completely different in a way

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.430 
these are completely different in a way
his<00:03:29.819> ones<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.329> lot<00:03:30.450> more<00:03:30.630> complicated<00:03:31.290> because

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
his ones a lot more complicated because

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.550 
his ones a lot more complicated because
it<00:03:31.709> cleans<00:03:31.980> up<00:03:32.220> certain<00:03:32.549> blocks<00:03:33.139> is<00:03:34.139> a<00:03:34.170> very

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
it cleans up certain blocks is a very

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.849 
it cleans up certain blocks is a very
kind<00:03:34.859> clever<00:03:35.750> concept<00:03:36.750> thing<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.380> should<00:03:37.590> go
