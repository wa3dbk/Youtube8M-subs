00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.130
 there are all guys i'm uncle and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.500
 this is the 50 failed shots ago 12 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.420
 different the glory and as promised at the end 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.580
 video I will talk to you in the understanding of how 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.870
 it works and how many points you take 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.889
 through the various links between 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.630
 players 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.340
 we open to comment on the video 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.460
 to show you some things I have 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.390
 wrong to build the team 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.710
 however they were not very great 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.449
 errors indeed in the end it has succeeded 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.980
 also to take a small advantage 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.810
 with credits 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.369
 thanks to these mistakes however then you 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.340
 I'll show the video 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.059
 what I mean and in these first games 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.410
 I still haven't found any opponents 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.940
 too difficult or otherwise 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.809
 fought matches are in fact almost 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.789
 not dominated but if for example I do 45 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.200
 the game now ca n't get me 45 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.700
 you hit the goal so there isn't really the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.100
 risk losing even to equalize 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.430
 the game maybe in the next episodes 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.360
 will be some match fought because 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.860
 as it also goes forward 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.829
 team of opponents will become more 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.469
 strong and when saliva complains will rise 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.300
 surely that of the opponents like 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.510
 you have seen this game more or less 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.909
 controlled inter 6 to 0 also done 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.200
 some nice goals was the opponent not 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.790
 as I said before it was not the most 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.580
 strength above all to defend and how 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.229
 you have seen 1990 credits taken however 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.930
 here the errors begin here 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.259
 I said I wanted to buy bolso fa that is 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.420
 a Moroccan left outsider playing 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.729
 in the Russian championship he is a fullback 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.049
 Moroccan left because he was convinced 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.790
 which includes playing in the championship 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.470
 Russian doesn't know why he doesn't either 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.659
 controlled however does not play in the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.790
 Russian championship and then in the alpha forest 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.770
 in the left- back it seems to me that yes 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.020
 call such a thing out of the heat 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.759
 they never have the understanding that explains it 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.060
 have it and at the end of the video 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.170
 so he made a wrong purchase 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.810
 convinced that they both had ship 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.689
 in agreement with their connections gracefully 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.189
 but no, and let's say that he has me 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.020
 penalized in this game 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.759
 especially at the beginning because it was 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.409
 inhabited play with stretcher which is also 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.810
 a little faster than Russian does and that 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.490
 therefore it leaves spaces behind the opponents 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.439
 this time I had some 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.909
 difficulty even if I can do 5 stars 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.500
 truth, however, then I'll show you to 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.870
 of this of this game as I have 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.599
 made for attention to avoid 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.450
 too much to lose the credits as you have 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.310
 seen however after one by one 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.580
 he tried to reverse the situation 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.810
 however, to return to the advantage also 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.549
 because then it was the only shot on goal 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.110
 of the game perhaps in the facts lasts me 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.970
 I remember I made two shots on goal 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.129
 so even here there really wasn't 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.799
 the risk of losing the game you have 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.450
 view this opponent used 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.860
 we simply say the aics for 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.730
 in fact, he never defended me 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.500
 contrasted and this is the thing that matters 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.030
 they often have because I see 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.980
 also do a lot but if you enable the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.560
 possibility if for save keeps pressed 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.670
 league will always stop anyway 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.799
 how do you see buying a midfielder 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.599
 to give the change it seems to me to danilo 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.579
 that he had finished the contracts or otherwise 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.650
 to the little form, physical form and then 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.750
 the quarterback also accidentally escaped 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.160
 Portuguese left which starting to what 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.019
 go and buy another 16 ha 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.120
 put back some credits and as you can see 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.010
 which sends the exchange stack for that 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.870
 will love remaining 7 credits but the intention 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.579
 to stay with 7 credits 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.220
 however, I had the left back 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.380
 paid 650 and the outside left I have it 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.880
 paid 900 and as you can see I can 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.239
 selling them even for 20 is 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.419
 was a thing we say good in the end if 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.859
 they recited to give us credits with two 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.410
 networks I managed to go buy 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.209
 an attacker is said to buy will be 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.599
 sony was also the attacker I would have 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.910
 He wanted to buy put him there in front 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.650
 so they see year also understood cabaye 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.169
 and to why to the double connection 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.440
 with the right outside with the attacker 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.790
 however, I will talk about this later 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.919
 this track went very well 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.079
 as you already see first action d'ayas 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.579
 on the band or different us of how it is 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.230
 pronounce on the band takes a 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.340
 opponent passes it in the middle will be first 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.919
 ball touching 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.919
 second of the match one to zero e 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:06.650
 game immediately downhill and still know al 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.810
 third minute he takes the ball when I knew 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.269
 I did n't remember he was right-handed 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.940
 their favorite to do is very simple 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.840
 empty door with rafael sobis and come 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.019
 see now also in the seventh minute 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.740
 cabaye penalty kicks and make no mistake 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.930
 and recite the 30th and this was first 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.270
 really easy to see was also 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.169
 expelled one of his players before the 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.340
 fifteenth it 4 but also to the 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.260
 twice his first game 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.440
 debut with youtube succeeds in 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.889
 find his first one- two and make the 4th 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.600
 at 0 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.650
 unfortunately the betting version I say 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.030
 unfortunately because what surely 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.190
 more credits, however, now I'll explain 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.320
 more or less with what I say the things I have 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.680
 understood concerning the inter 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.030
 as you see the left back and it was worth 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.430
 have double links made to 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.540
 hand from the green lighted link e 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.700
 this because they play in the same 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.070
 team have the same nationality 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.210
 and this is something they asked know 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.700
 well understood both players 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.010
 any position of the field and yes they are 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.580
 and I'm talking about 4 4 2 because of the 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.560
 other modules 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.120
 I'm not sure it's like that anyway 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.330
 sees us two players who have the 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.400
 green dot link because they play 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.199
 in the same on the same team in the 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.050
 same nationality both will arrive 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.870
 in the name of understanding and therefore the same thing 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.789
 which happens between rafael sobis and thiago 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.970
 neves only the gun la7 d intesa 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.650
 because enel in the wrong role should 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.410
 be cc to see the agreement 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.150
 while santa croce camerina and sorrentina 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.950
 have both there is 1t we all fall apart 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.590
 three but well understood because they are all e 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.050
 three Italians and three are rampant in the series 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.389
 and this of a double connection 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.610
 which gives it seems to me that of 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.080
 link to a point 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.760
 no, on the contrary, care of nationality by a 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.110
 point and a half then both take 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.370
 about 5 points does not intend to run of 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.750
 how it works well requires why 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.400
 in fact there is also the fact from 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.650
 calculate the dead links that are 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.870
 the red links and that seems to me 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.630
 which I believe is a half-point agreement 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.669
 any link that is very much is one 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.870
 something that should not be calculated however for the 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.970
 speech that I said before 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.669
 links of the same team 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.680
 person nationality with which he instead loves 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.780
 it is simply understood as 7 in agreement 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.210
 because in the wrong formation and from 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.710
 a normal connection let's say both with 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.740
 the right outside with that of defender 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.680
 central shrimp that is never the year 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.500
 you understand why 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.850
 the double connection with sa and has a 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.350
 nationality connection with 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.030
 the right exterior so this is the 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.320
 leads to having nine by agreement 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.020
 the right exterior instead we have well 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.919
 intended because everyone among the links 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.930
 for they are pitfalls 3 of the same 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.389
 nationality and in any case that in the form e 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.639
 right training and right role module 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.919
 while it knows if the understanding because to the 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.410
 wrong training and this takes away 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:55.900
 three points and only for what a 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:58.030
 home in agreement and therefore briefly I believe 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.099
 that links between the same league 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.690
 give a point of understanding and those with the 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:04.360
 Italian national one point and a half e 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:08.560
 those not with the team give two 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.050
 instead points the connection between the 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.030
 school if the nationality from both 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.599
 players 9 points of understanding I hope that 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.830
 this sense of help because I don't believe 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:21.009
 that many of you knew about these 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.900
 things or in any case to be in any 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.430
 chance I also hope that the TV is 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.880
 liked all the guys to the next one 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.880
 video
