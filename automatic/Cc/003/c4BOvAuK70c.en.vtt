addition<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:53.640> electric<00:01:53.969> staff

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
addition to that the electric staff

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.990 
addition to that the electric staff
allows<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.070> basically<00:01:56.070> teleport<00:01:56.850> but

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
allows you to basically teleport but

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.569 
allows you to basically teleport but
like<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.780> spring<00:01:58.110> forward<00:01:58.439> right<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.520> you

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
like you spring forward right so you

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.980 
like you spring forward right so you
know<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.240> spring<00:02:00.479> forward<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> little<00:02:00.869> bit

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
know you spring forward a little bit

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.560 
know you spring forward a little bit
spring<00:02:01.649> for<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> little<00:02:01.979> bit<00:02:02.070> more<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:03.000> takes<00:02:03.240> it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
spring for a little bit more it takes it

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.540 
spring for a little bit more it takes it
you<00:02:04.229> know<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.560> uses<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.250> pretty<00:02:06.030> rapidly<00:02:07.550> but

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you know it uses it pretty rapidly but

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.639 
you know it uses it pretty rapidly but
now<00:02:09.210> so<00:02:09.450> I'm<00:02:09.539> gonna<00:02:09.660> show<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.869> how<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.259> do

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
now so I'm gonna show you how to do

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.860 
now so I'm gonna show you how to do
something<00:02:10.979> that's<00:02:11.100> pretty<00:02:11.340> cool<00:02:11.840> what<00:02:12.840> I

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
something that's pretty cool what I

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.180 
something that's pretty cool what I
think<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.290> pretty<00:02:13.500> cool<00:02:13.650> with<00:02:13.769> it<00:02:13.950> at<00:02:14.040> least

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
think is pretty cool with it at least

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.280 
think is pretty cool with it at least
and<00:02:14.599> some<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.750> may<00:02:15.840> know<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.019> some<00:02:16.260> of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and some of you may know that some of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.630 
and some of you may know that some of
you<00:02:16.349> may<00:02:16.530> not<00:02:16.680> again<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.160> series

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
you may not again the series

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.720 
you may not again the series
to<00:02:17.880> help<00:02:18.180> those<00:02:18.600> who<00:02:18.660> may<00:02:19.170> not<00:02:19.319> know<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.550> to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
to help those who may not know it and to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.070 
to help those who may not know it and to
teach<00:02:20.940> everyone<00:02:21.240> little<00:02:21.450> bit<00:02:21.540> more<00:02:21.690> about<00:02:21.810> hex

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
teach everyone little bit more about hex

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.630 
teach everyone little bit more about hex
that<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.590> wonderful<00:02:22.830> mind<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.490> feel

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
that this is a wonderful mind I feel

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.240 
that this is a wonderful mind I feel
like<00:02:23.730> sometimes<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.209> doesn't<00:02:24.420> get<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:25.250> what

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
like sometimes it doesn't get the what

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.210 
like sometimes it doesn't get the what
it<00:02:26.340> deserves<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.900> theoretically<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.920> know<00:02:29.040> if

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
it deserves so theoretically you know if

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.130 
it deserves so theoretically you know if
it<00:02:29.430> balances<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.090> forward<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.600> little<00:02:30.810> bit<00:02:30.959> if

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
it balances you forward a little bit if

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.250 
it balances you forward a little bit if
you<00:02:31.709> put<00:02:32.010> into<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.280> air<00:02:32.810> it'll<00:02:33.810> make<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.050> jump

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
you put into the air it'll make you jump

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.380 
you put into the air it'll make you jump
and<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:35.190> don't<00:02:35.370> take<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.730> fall<00:02:35.970> damage<00:02:36.270> I

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
and you don't take a fall damage I

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.710 
and you don't take a fall damage I
should<00:02:36.570> say<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.950> what<00:02:38.100> if<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.280> do<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.490> twice<00:02:39.150> or

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
should say so what if you do it twice or

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.620 
should say so what if you do it twice or
three<00:02:40.650> times<00:02:40.680> or<00:02:41.190> four<00:02:41.790> times

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
three times or four times

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.979 
three times or four times
oops<00:02:43.970> yeah<00:02:44.970> that's<00:02:45.120> right<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.420> keep<00:02:45.540> jumping

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
oops yeah that's right you keep jumping

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.350 
oops yeah that's right you keep jumping
you<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.680> literally<00:02:46.920> whirl<00:02:47.190> around<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:48.180> map

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
you can literally whirl around the map

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.449 
you can literally whirl around the map
in<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.900> air<00:02:49.610> using<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.850> staff<00:02:52.280> now<00:02:53.280> I

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
in the air using this staff now I

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.420 
in the air using this staff now I
suggest<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.239> wait<00:02:54.420> until<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:55.590> until<00:02:56.160> I

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
suggest that you wait until the until I

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.800 
suggest that you wait until the until I
start<00:02:56.700> spinning<00:02:57.000> out<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.420> like<00:02:57.480> what<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.660> mean

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
start spinning out so like what I mean

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.050 
start spinning out so like what I mean
by<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.140> like<00:02:58.230> if<00:02:58.860> you're<00:02:59.100> going<00:02:59.250> up<00:02:59.400> wait

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
by that is like if you're going up wait

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.610 
by that is like if you're going up wait
until<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.390> starts<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.690> stop<00:03:00.989> before<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.410> use

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
until it starts to stop before you use

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.780 
until it starts to stop before you use
it<00:03:01.650> again<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.190> don't<00:03:02.340> use<00:03:02.459> too<00:03:02.670> many

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
it again so you don't use too many

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.699 
it again so you don't use too many
charges<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.510> like<00:03:03.660> spam<00:03:04.080> clicking<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.560> like

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
charges just like spam clicking it like

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.220 
charges just like spam clicking it like
that<00:03:04.920> they<00:03:05.850> just<00:03:05.880> use<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.300> too<00:03:06.420> fast<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:07.050> you

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
that they just use it too fast and you

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.960 
that they just use it too fast and you
don't<00:03:07.380> take<00:03:07.470> fall<00:03:07.680> damage<00:03:07.709> as<00:03:08.130> long<00:03:08.760> as<00:03:08.880> you

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
don't take fall damage as long as you

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.009 
don't take fall damage as long as you
have<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.180> out<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.420> as<00:03:09.510> long<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.840> use<00:03:09.989> it

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
now if I was to jump per say look if I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.229 
now if I was to jump per say look if I
was<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.390> stop<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:15.870> if<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.709> was<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.950> jump

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
was to stop that if I was to jump

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.820 
was to stop that if I was to jump
straight<00:03:18.239> off<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.570> tower<00:03:19.080> without<00:03:19.260> using

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
straight off that tower without using

this<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.130> will<00:03:20.430> take<00:03:20.610> fall<00:03:20.820> damage<00:03:20.850> but<00:03:21.269> if<00:03:21.360> I

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
this I will take fall damage but if I

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.199 
this I will take fall damage but if I
use<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:21.989> once<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.709> will<00:03:23.040> not<00:03:23.070> this<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.180> a
