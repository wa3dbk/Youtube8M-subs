00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.510
 until Sunday at nothing 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.510
 week it were 4 percent cheaper 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 because they are also a bit behind 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.390
 how long the soldiers 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.390
 in on 13 trees 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.840
 is too expensive 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.100
 have well 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.540
 In addition, it thinks that in the taste there is little to play yet 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.090
 and at least that is what commotion arose 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.740
 vitesse too 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.050
 the other two cells 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.800
 mr but the electronics and motivate 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.560
 the nice thing 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.230
 that pays that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.590
 and how much 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.590
 always in Eindhoven every hour in the week in the month 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.960
 I live in Salzburg myself where the ball has to be removed, he says 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.080
 and 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.870
 would be postponed 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.579
 ep de molse the police of course 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.159
 before that were thousands of people 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.500
 the leusdenaren 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.270
 also just with municipal buildings 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.270
 and 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.900
 Three of the promotions we have today are the annual open day 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.900
 one of the pioneers 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.080
 that's a day less 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.540
 that time environment involved with what the publicity huddled 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.310
 we are here 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.280
 also to participate in the tour 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.770
 swallow the model 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.400
 you have a past 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 the total small 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.920
 78 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.659
 the levels last 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.889
 but you have to put together more things throughout the year 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:13.990
 over the years 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.180
 flown although it is true that a substantial profit decreases a shrink 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.569
 from 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.849
 it's not good that they flew in the snow as me 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.849
 the equipment is mounted on the ski slopes 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.339
 but well supported 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.739
