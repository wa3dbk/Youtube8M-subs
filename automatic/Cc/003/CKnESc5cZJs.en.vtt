00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
booting up we figured out one problem we

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.510 
booting up we figured out one problem we
still<00:00:48.780> need<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.989> figure<00:00:49.230> out<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> other<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
still need to figure out the other so I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.540 
still need to figure out the other so I
either<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.449> buy<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.920> send<00:00:53.160> off<00:00:53.280> for

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
either have to buy and the send off for

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.420 
either have to buy and the send off for
a<00:00:53.610> new<00:00:53.850> replacement<00:00:54.210> card<00:00:54.750> or<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.190> to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
a new replacement card or I have to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.310 
a new replacement card or I have to
change<00:00:56.850> my<00:00:57.000> motherboard<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.960> haven't

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
change my motherboard we haven't

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.709 
change my motherboard we haven't
detected<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> actual<00:00:59.789> problem<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.449> yet

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
detected what the actual problem is yet

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.039 
detected what the actual problem is yet
so<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.210> towards<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> middle<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.840> next

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
so I think towards the middle of next

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.920 
so I think towards the middle of next
week<00:01:04.580> well<00:01:05.580> towards<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.000> end<00:01:06.119> depending<00:01:06.630> on

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
week well towards the end depending on

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020 
week well towards the end depending on
how<00:01:07.140> long<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.560> takes<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.159> new<00:01:08.520> parts<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
how long it takes for new parts to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.260 
how long it takes for new parts to
arrive<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:10.080> us<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.229> fit<00:01:10.619> them<00:01:10.860> i<00:01:11.150> am<00:01:12.150> not

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
