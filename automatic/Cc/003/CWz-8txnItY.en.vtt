decks in modern do and based the entire

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.060 
decks in modern do and based the entire
point<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.719> cast<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.380> number<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.710> spells<00:00:37.950> in

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
point is to cast a number of spells in

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.150 
point is to cast a number of spells in
one<00:00:38.219> turn<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.610> combo<00:00:39.090> off<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.690> generate<00:00:40.469> 20

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
one turn and combo off and generate 20

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.869 
one turn and combo off and generate 20
or<00:00:41.640> 25<00:00:42.360> storm<00:00:42.870> counters<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.010> then<00:00:44.430> cast

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
or 25 storm counters and then cast

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.350 
or 25 storm counters and then cast
grapeshot

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
grapeshot

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.330 
grapeshot
or<00:00:45.539> Samoan<00:00:45.809> condition<00:00:46.200> which<00:00:46.860> essentially

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
or Samoan condition which essentially

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.040 
or Samoan condition which essentially
does<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:47.969> damage<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.420> each<00:00:48.450> storm<00:00:48.750> counter

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
does one damage for each storm counter

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.439 
does one damage for each storm counter
so<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> full<00:00:50.700> person's<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.149> total

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
so I can do a full person's like total

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.670 
so I can do a full person's like total
damage<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.440> turn

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
damage in one turn

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.439 
damage in one turn
no<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.309> would<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.730> say<00:00:53.879> are<00:00:53.910> some<00:00:54.090> cute

no what would you say are some cute
pieces<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.930> kind<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.140> how<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.320> deck<00:00:55.620> would<00:00:55.800> go

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
pieces to kind of how the deck would go

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.189 
pieces to kind of how the deck would go
on<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.370> deck<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.090> based<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.930> legacy

and<00:01:03.600> how<00:01:03.750> they<00:01:03.899> work<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> heritage<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
and how they work is the heritage it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.260 
and how they work is the heritage it
allows<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> tap<00:01:05.460> any<00:01:05.670> three<00:01:05.880> elves<00:01:06.150> to

which<00:03:30.609> is<00:03:31.060> 4x<00:03:31.840> our<00:03:32.079> keiki<00:03:32.590> get<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.549> basic

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
which is 4x our keiki get a basic

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.920 
which is 4x our keiki get a basic
structure<00:03:36.340> um<00:03:36.670> just<00:03:37.390> sort<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.630> catch-all

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
structure um just sort of a catch-all

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.140 
structure um just sort of a catch-all
one<00:03:38.739> of<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.859> main<00:03:38.950> things<00:03:39.190> is<00:03:39.280> used<00:03:39.519> for<00:03:39.730> is

makeshift mannequin to animate things

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.970 
makeshift mannequin to animate things
like<00:03:44.470> chemical<00:03:44.920> or<00:03:46.170> paint<00:03:47.170> like<00:03:47.319> that<00:03:47.350> if<00:03:47.739> they

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
like chemical or paint like that if they

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.770 
like chemical or paint like that if they
were<00:03:48.760> yeah<00:03:49.090> when<00:03:49.209> they<00:03:49.269> drop<00:03:49.389> they<00:03:49.510> were<00:03:49.569> cool

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
were yeah when they drop they were cool

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.780 
were yeah when they drop they were cool
in<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.900> graveyard<00:03:50.049> well<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.739> reshuffle<00:03:51.700> is

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
in the graveyard well the reshuffle is

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.830 
in the graveyard well the reshuffle is
on<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:52.000> stack<00:03:52.180> and<00:03:52.209> I<00:03:52.389> try<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.540> make<00:03:52.690> some

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
on the stack and I try to make some

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.170 
on the stack and I try to make some
Anakin<00:03:53.170> ice<00:03:53.319> traction<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:54.130> out<00:03:54.250> there<00:03:54.940> for

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
Anakin ice traction it out there for

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.900 
Anakin ice traction it out there for
killing<00:03:55.720> sort<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:56.049> their<00:03:56.170> decker<00:03:56.530> plan<00:03:56.769> or<00:03:57.760> any
