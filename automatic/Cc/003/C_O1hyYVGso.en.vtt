00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 good what's up guys welcome a 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.700
 more time to my channel the its balance 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.080
 I distract a very important video that 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.790
 I want you to pay close attention 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.469
 because it's quite complicated to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.269
 understand but if you do, you're going to 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.830
 understand right away first of all I 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.940
 would like to ask you to leave is a good 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.369
 like the video because it has cost me 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.260
 quite collects information and think 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.449
 in the way of explaining this to you since it is 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.039
 a bit complicated, we're going to 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.630
 take our time with this topic and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.609
 which is a very important issue and I want 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.289
 that you pay me a lot of attention 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.390
 first of all if you do not know for what 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.130
 serve the supplies I leave a video 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.290
 in the description how good you have to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.430
 stop the video already and watch that video for 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.440
 understand what I am going to explain to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.120
 then it's worth it so if you do not know 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.070
 what are the supplies used for or what 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.989
 improvements give you there you have in the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.360
 description a good video that you what 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.860
 explains all good supplies 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.570
 guys are something complicated to explain 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.700
 as I say and I'm going to do it in a way 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.850
 as short as possible to see if you understand 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.980
 and more summary call of duty chooses 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.500
 randomly the items in which 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.400
 you are going to touch supplies you can 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.040
 unlock or not these supplies 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.230
 there are different ways to imagine that in 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.900
 the next game I have to receive 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.130
 supplies you do not know that you do not know 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.810
 what game you are going to touch the 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.760
 supplies is completely random 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.040
 but suppose we know it is 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.510
 impossible but suppose it's worth it in the 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.760
 next game you get supplies 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.610
 how can you unblock them well 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.260
 there are three ways guys a very strange 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.880
 It's hard to touch you but well 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.400
 that sometimes happens you see it at the beginning 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.590
 of the video simply by entering the 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.600
 departure upon entering as are the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.460
 supplies without doing absolutely anything 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.930
 you do not even have to choose class if 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.840
 You send the video back and put the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.820
 first clip the minute 00 you will see how in 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.280
 the first game they give me supplies 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.320
 nothing else entering is very strange as I say 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.450
 is the most complicated way that 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.400
 I touch you but at the same time simpler 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.500
 how good that would be the first way 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.540
 let them touch you next supplies 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.100
 way to get supplies here already 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.050
 the mess begins the important thing begins 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.850
 where you will also see yourself at stake 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.860
 your skill as a player to 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.720
 get better or worse supplies 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.340
 attention to these guys is a hypothesis 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.280
 that I have to tell you more 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.619
 forward these two new ways are 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.750
 the between them either or do one or 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.000
 you do to the other I have to say that the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.220
 You can get supplies at the start 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.290
 of the game simply at the beginning 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.080
 when they meet the objectives or the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.840
 the first time you die, you can only 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.910
 get supplies once per game 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.160
 you can not get supplies twice 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.890
 have it clear well these two ways 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.680
 are you either make a losing streak 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.030
 Call of Duty randomly chosen 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.620
 me the maximum losing streak that has 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.600
 I could do it is 5 and they gave me 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.709
 supplies then followed with the streak 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.530
 but it is already in the moment that they have 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.660
 you can not get more or 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.130
 you make a losing streak or you die 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.380
 the first time you die, they will give you 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.220
 supplies that is so between these two 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.769
 If you die, they give them to you as they are. 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.019
 hypothesis is the bigger your streak 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.850
 of lower good supplies you are going to 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.800
 give as I say call of duty choose 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.630
 randomly the limit to get 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.910
 the supplies maybe you put a 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.769
 limit of three of three casualties and when 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.600
 you get to the streak of three losses you get 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.310
 the supplies to me the most that I 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.079
 have put has been five and at the time 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.550
 I've made a run of five casualties 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.140
 they have given the supplies 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.750
 the time the two low they have given me 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.820
 to the third to the fourth that depends 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.890
 as I say it depends on luck and it depends 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.840
 of what you say call of duty when 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.790
 you always die the first death if you 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.280
 you need to get supplies in that game 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.910
 when you die you will give them this way 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.400
 Clear 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.030
 my hypothesis is the supplies are going to 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.770
 be worse if you get them with death 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.600
 when there's more to me, your streak of 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.180
 lower is better a minister are you going to get 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.480
 for example if you get supplies 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.040
 killing three enemies without dying they go to 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.660
 be worse supplies than if the 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.850
 You get killing five enemies without 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.770
 die on what I base good on my own 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.590
 experience as I say is a hypothesis and 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.910
 not a theory the three times that I 've 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.980
 made streak of five and I have been given 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.350
 streak supplies five without dying 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.570
 get supplies because they have given me the 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.940
 ministers three elite weapons between 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.490
 they here 12 ripke is the best here 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.310
 there are and two elite laser weapons 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.320
 I do not know if this will be true if it will be true 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.940
 it will not be true but good lets see them in 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.590
 the comments to see what you think about 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.910
 this because I really have 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.180
 quite intrigued and it would be a bombshell 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.800
 informative if it is really confirmed is 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.110
 a theory that imposes a hypothesis 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.550
 I have been checking that I have 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.380
 proven enough I have commented with 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.690
 friends and that and also happens to them 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.430
 and well, I think it can be 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.960
 quite interesting all three times at 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.720
 unless I have been touched by 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.270
 supplies with a run of five casualties have 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.610
 been three elite weapons guys not 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.350
 leave me the comments what do you think if 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.300
 I have some doubt I do not know if what 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.890
 will have explained well but I think that 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.810
 it's pretty well explained as I say 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.520
 the three hours of obtaining supplies 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.220
 are or entering the game is 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.200
 complicated without doing anything dying for 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.270
 the first time they 're going to give them always if 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.160
 you die the first time and if you do not die you 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.230
 you have to make a losing streak the 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.700
 which then call of duty chooses the limit to 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.590
 the best the limit is between each other when 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.060
 you get to 3 they give you supplies 4 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.890
 because the huti is going the clamp and you 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.960
 7 puts a limit well maybe 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.400
 when you get to the 7 casualties they give you the 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.530
 supplies 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.910
 my hypothesis as I say is how much greater 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.160
 be the best losing streak 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.199
 supplies you're going to get I do not rely on 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.430
 nothing simply my own experience and 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.750
 nothing simply I hope that I have 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.669
 liked the video that supports it is my 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.020
 tried to explain in the best way and 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.210
 nothing we see in the next guys 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.100
 remember that if you do not know what you get 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.020
 with the supplies you go through the 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.620
 description video a greeting to all and 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.580
 until next time 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.580
 goodbye
