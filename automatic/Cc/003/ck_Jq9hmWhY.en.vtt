00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:00.089 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:04.439 

my<00:06:01.089> pokemon<00:06:01.300> see<00:06:01.960> I<00:06:01.990> already<00:06:02.289> caught<00:06:02.680> it<00:06:03.449> it's

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 
my pokemon see I already caught it it's

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.040 
my pokemon see I already caught it it's
just<00:06:04.689> nothing<00:06:04.899> just<00:06:05.559> this<00:06:05.800> and<00:06:06.719> first<00:06:07.719> it<00:06:07.930> was

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
just nothing just this and first it was

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.779 
just nothing just this and first it was
level<00:06:08.729> 132<00:06:09.729> but<00:06:10.119> I've<00:06:10.419> trained<00:06:11.259> it<00:06:11.550> like<00:06:12.550> one

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
level 132 but I've trained it like one

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.969 
level 132 but I've trained it like one
battle<00:06:13.240> and<00:06:13.389> then<00:06:13.479> it<00:06:13.629> became<00:06:13.869> a<00:06:13.930> 100<00:06:14.619> somehow

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
battle and then it became a 100 somehow

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:23.219 
battle and then it became a 100 somehow
so<00:06:16.860> then<00:06:17.860> it's<00:06:18.099> number<00:06:18.490> 0<00:06:18.879> 0<00:06:19.270> 0<00:06:20.219> so<00:06:21.219> this<00:06:21.939> is<00:06:22.839> the

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
so then it's number 0 0 0 so this is the

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.769
