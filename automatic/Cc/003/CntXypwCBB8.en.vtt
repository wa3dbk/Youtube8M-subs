00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
to save yourself and then also when the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.430 
to save yourself and then also when the
other<00:03:52.489> players<00:03:52.790> are<00:03:53.329> not<00:03:53.569> playing<00:03:53.840> doubles

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
other players are not playing doubles

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.349 
other players are not playing doubles
you<00:03:54.739> also<00:03:54.890> have<00:03:55.099> tendency<00:03:55.459> not<00:03:55.579> to<00:03:55.640> play<00:03:55.939> not

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
you also have tendency not to play not

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.149 
you also have tendency not to play not
to<00:03:56.390> give<00:03:56.629> them<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.900> advantage<00:03:57.379> and<00:03:57.680> when

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
to give them the advantage and when

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.849 
to give them the advantage and when
everybody<00:03:58.370> plays<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:59.000> think<00:03:59.420> it's<00:03:59.750> a<00:03:59.959> good<00:04:00.590> feel

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
everybody plays I think it's a good feel

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.199 
everybody plays I think it's a good feel
and<00:04:01.069> it's<00:04:01.220> it's<00:04:01.430> helpful<00:04:01.579> for<00:04:01.819> the<00:04:02.000> tour

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
and it's it's helpful for the tour

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.149 
and it's it's helpful for the tour
because<00:04:02.420> doubles<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:02.959> very<00:04:03.680> important<00:04:04.010> part

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159
