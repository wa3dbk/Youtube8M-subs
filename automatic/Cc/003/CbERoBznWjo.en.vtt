00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
little bit in the fridge just so it's a

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.200 
little bit in the fridge just so it's a

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
little bit thicker and that will make it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
little bit thicker and that will make it
easier<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.720> work<00:02:29.900> with

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
easier to work with

and then I'm just going to take some

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.140 
and then I'm just going to take some
sugar<00:05:53.870> glue<00:05:54.170> you<00:05:54.920> can<00:05:54.950> also<00:05:55.190> use<00:05:55.610> our<00:05:55.850> clear

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
sugar glue you can also use our clear

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.690 
sugar glue you can also use our clear
alcohol<00:05:56.750> or<00:05:57.140> even<00:05:57.410> water<00:05:57.740> but<00:05:58.160> I<00:05:58.190> do<00:05:58.310> find<00:05:58.580> that

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
alcohol or even water but I do find that

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.180 
alcohol or even water but I do find that
sugar<00:05:58.970> glue<00:05:59.150> keeps<00:05:59.720> it<00:05:59.960> a<00:06:00.110> little<00:06:00.800> bit<00:06:00.920> better

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
sugar glue keeps it a little bit better

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.820 
sugar glue keeps it a little bit better
and<00:06:01.580> give<00:06:01.790> us<00:06:01.910> a<00:06:01.940> a<00:06:02.300> much<00:06:02.780> better<00:06:02.990> adherence<00:06:03.650> to

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
and give us a a much better adherence to
