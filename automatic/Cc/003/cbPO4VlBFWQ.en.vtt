00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.420
 A heart has to plant one so fast 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.250
 as possible and thus not as listless as 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.949
 possible what no problem is very 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.090
 realistic controls move the fingers 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.090
 with abs 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.879
 [Music]

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.770

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:38.170

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:47.759
 the victim was the luggage or I am 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:47.759
 doctor no panic button and I have to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:02:02.259
 say I need exactly that 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:04.060
 I 'm so careful of caution 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:14.819
 not in the heart but my body 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:17.819

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.819

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.600

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.950
 canceled 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:43.100
 yes panic do not panic i can join 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.509
 Fingertip feeling pull out of this 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.509
 [Music] 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:55.540
 can happen that we build afterwards 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.540
 again the gerippe has with him 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.170
 Jesus' other heart wrestling becomes wonderful 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.920
 but not to the other 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.340
 including what should set 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.439
 already happen 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.439
 [Music] 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.330
 now 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.510
 my hand is pretty verkuppelt 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.989
 arrangement the previous patient has the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:38.010
 Operation could not survive for it 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:42.260
 but nothing , just be careful 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:59.129
 Hopefully take this device now 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:04:02.060
 the han careful but I have 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.060
 actually still with itself 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.550
 very good , be careful that is not 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.610
 selling nothing makes no problem 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.810
 We have enough blood for everyone 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:25.400
 here what he gets new bones fell 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.700
 thing now i cut this one here 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.790
 is 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:33.200
 i am a doctor i know what i am doing exactly 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:39.230
 i am i know myself i have 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.900
 What are you studying 19 cash patients? 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:46.090
 not insured 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:50.420
 Never mind's ok but 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:05:04.370
 not exactly as I thought and 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:05:05.840
 Now say it carefully aside 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.850
 yes many blood we have the same 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:17.560
 have the same then the new one needs 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:17.560
 fresh okay 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:31.059
 I wanted to take that other heart here 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:35.409
 we do it perfectly and carefully 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:39.319
 fingertip used perfectly 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.360
 perfect i know the plaster over it 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:44.559
 bring 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.610
 I think I think that's great 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:51.699
 well maybe we still think here 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.699
 thus as well as that 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:02.330
 but press on it to glue three 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:11.570
 remains then we take now that yes 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:15.340
 oh my god, it's going to happen 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:32.570
 So, when I understand 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:33.860
 whether it's ok a bit blood loss me 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.099
 think that was perfect i dont know 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.370
 what could be better here? 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:42.080
 yes no idea maybe you want 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:55.130
 We can still do that 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:56.509
 added that here still clean up and packs 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.740
 everything here is one in here and everything 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.440
 then take 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:06.470
 then everything is clean, I think that is 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:08.979
 the most successful heart surgery ever 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.979
 has given 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:29.889
 I have been able to learn something here 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:31.819
 you do something like that tokyo I do not know 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:33.849
 if he's dead, he can not stop me 

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:38.979
 sue therefore successful operation 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:38.979
 patient okay
