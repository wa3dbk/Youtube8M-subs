00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.460
 and then everything works fine here and there and 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.070
 today I present to you a theory 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.590
 Well famous to involve the game of Mario Yes 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.539
 will be that the super mario bros 3 was a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.029
 play 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.519
 Okay, without further ado, let's go to theory. 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.800
 super mario bros 3 does not seem to have 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.900
 actually happened between quotation marks is 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.730
 of course there are a number of elements in the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 game that imply that it was drawn 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.050
 as a theatrical play what can 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.020
 that Mario has never been in 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.360
 real danger and that it was simply 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.160
 acting is and other the game treats us like 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.230
 if we were part of a 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.379
 audience you remember the home screen 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.480
 the game starts with curtain rising like this. 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.000
 such as the beginning of a play in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.039
 then the lights are turned on and there 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.989
 a very interesting detail you may notice 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.050
 shadows in the background 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.940
 dean lighting 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.040
 probably caused by a spotlight 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.930
 So the game starts, he's also a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.540
 a lot of clues that lead us to believe 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.490
 that everything is a play like the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.979
 platforms screwed into the plane of 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.380
 background and also the shadows of 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.950
 lights now stamped on 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320
 cel 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.030
 also notice these platforms 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.460
 hanging on the ceiling something would have 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.860
 who is holding it is not as it is but 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.780
 nothing appears and lastly the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.420
 The last clue to this theory is 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.640
 relation to the end of the main phases 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.280
 they are on the right which characterize 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.380
 an area devoid of lighting this 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.450
 corresponds to the end of the scenario where 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.750
 the actors then and site giving to understand 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.729
 what the sea would be leaving the scene is 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.070
 galley is if the theory of super mario bros 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.899
 3 and then found 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.329
 remembering that the base text here 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.820
 used and the images placed here 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.189
 were removed from the site nintendo blast 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.290
 would leave the link in the description for whom 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.329
 want to check before finalizing 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.040
 I would also like to invite you

 check out my friend's video of gatton 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.759
 telling some more crazy theories of 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.649
 Game's world 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.679

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.480
