00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.650 

yeah<00:00:00.840> it<00:00:01.140> works<00:00:01.319> okay<00:00:01.739> Oh<00:00:02.270> let<00:00:03.270> me<00:00:03.390> ask<00:00:03.510> you<00:00:03.629> a

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:03.660 
yeah it works okay Oh let me ask you a

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.400 
yeah it works okay Oh let me ask you a
question

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
question

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.079 
question
I'll<00:00:04.890> make<00:00:05.039> a<00:00:05.069> statement<00:00:05.189> first<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.759> diode

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
I'll make a statement first the diode

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.900 
I'll make a statement first the diode
laser<00:00:06.299> loves<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.930> see<00:00:07.109> pigment<00:00:07.700> doesn't<00:00:08.700> sieve

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
laser loves to see pigment doesn't sieve

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.930 
laser loves to see pigment doesn't sieve
water<00:00:09.470> remember<00:00:10.470> that<00:00:10.740> statement<00:00:10.940> next

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
water remember that statement next

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.800 
water remember that statement next
statement<00:00:13.280> it<00:00:14.280> loves<00:00:14.550> blood<00:00:14.850> and<00:00:15.180> doesn't

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:15.810 
statement it loves blood and doesn't

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.300 
statement it loves blood and doesn't
like<00:00:15.930> to<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.620> said<00:00:16.860> that<00:00:17.010> already

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
like to we said that already

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.609 
like to we said that already
okay<00:00:17.610> so<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.960> back<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.200> the<00:00:19.350> statement

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
okay so going back to the statement

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.950 
okay so going back to the statement
number<00:00:19.800> one<00:00:19.980> if<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.670> put<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.060> laser<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.630> white

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
number one if I put this laser on white

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.100 
number one if I put this laser on white
paper<00:00:22.200> versus<00:00:23.100> black<00:00:23.789> print<00:00:24.270> which<00:00:24.900> do<00:00:25.050> you

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
paper versus black print which do you

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.040 
paper versus black print which do you
think<00:00:25.199> would<00:00:25.440> interact<00:00:26.510> black<00:00:27.510> print<00:00:27.810> right

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
think would interact black print right

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.359 
think would interact black print right
so<00:00:28.440> here's<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.070> laser<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.430> black<00:00:30.000> print

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
so here's the laser on black print

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.010 
so here's the laser on black print
burning<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> black<00:00:32.669> print<00:00:33.000> here<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.840> on

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
burning the black print here it is on

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.360 
burning the black print here it is on
white<00:00:34.230> paper<00:00:35.810> nothing<00:00:36.810> happens

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
white paper nothing happens

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.180 
white paper nothing happens
so<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> specific<00:00:39.630> absorption<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
so this is a specific absorption for the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.610 
so this is a specific absorption for the
diode<00:00:41.520> okay<00:00:42.060> going<00:00:42.510> back<00:00:42.720> to<00:00:42.930> our<00:00:42.960> pig<00:00:43.350> thing

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
diode okay going back to our pig thing

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.280 
diode okay going back to our pig thing
if<00:00:44.400> I<00:00:44.580> can<00:00:44.640> find<00:00:44.970> a<00:00:45.150> similar<00:00:45.510> freedom<00:00:46.140> area

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
if I can find a similar freedom area

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.440 
if I can find a similar freedom area
which<00:00:46.590> maybe<00:00:47.010> I'll<00:00:47.250> let's<00:00:47.670> let's<00:00:47.940> say<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.270> is

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
which maybe I'll let's let's say this is

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.690 
which maybe I'll let's let's say this is
similar<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.989> what<00:00:49.080> we<00:00:49.170> had<00:00:49.290> same<00:00:49.920> power<00:00:50.220> to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
similar to what we had same power to

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.270 
similar to what we had same power to
watts<00:00:50.910> member<00:00:51.390> same<00:00:51.720> thing<00:00:51.900> here<00:00:52.110> okay<00:00:52.200> let<00:00:53.190> me

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
watts member same thing here okay let me

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.470 
watts member same thing here okay let me
just<00:00:53.550> let<00:00:53.700> me<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.000> use<00:00:54.150> it<00:00:54.360> here

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.770 

three<00:01:00.230> four<00:01:00.920> five<00:01:02.170> there's<00:01:03.170> five<00:01:03.470> seconds

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
three four five there's five seconds

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.149 
three four five there's five seconds
similar<00:01:05.780> depth<00:01:06.170> but<00:01:06.560> different<00:01:06.920> looking

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
similar depth but different looking

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.130 
similar depth but different looking
wound<00:01:07.400> see<00:01:08.030> how<00:01:08.119> it's<00:01:08.270> black<00:01:08.750> around<00:01:08.990> the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
wound see how it's black around the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.560 
wound see how it's black around the
outside<00:01:09.490> this<00:01:10.490> got<00:01:10.700> hotter<00:01:11.619> than<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:12.800> erbium

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
outside this got hotter than the erbium

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.120 
outside this got hotter than the erbium
however<00:01:14.570> this<00:01:14.869> wouldn't<00:01:15.229> be<00:01:15.380> bleeding<00:01:15.950> if

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
however this wouldn't be bleeding if

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.010 
however this wouldn't be bleeding if
this<00:01:16.310> were<00:01:16.490> in<00:01:16.640> on<00:01:16.880> your<00:01:17.090> patient<00:01:17.479> therapy

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
this were in on your patient therapy

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.530 
this were in on your patient therapy
would<00:01:18.350> probably<00:01:18.830> be<00:01:18.979> bleeding<00:01:19.369> because<00:01:20.150> every

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
would probably be bleeding because every

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.740 
would probably be bleeding because every
doesn't<00:01:20.930> go<00:01:20.990> very<00:01:21.229> deep<00:01:22.540> difference<00:01:23.540> in<00:01:23.660> the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
doesn't go very deep difference in the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.109 
doesn't go very deep difference in the
wavelength<00:01:23.900> now<00:01:24.380> also<00:01:24.860> this<00:01:25.580> is<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:25.850> little

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
wavelength now also this is a little

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.999 
wavelength now also this is a little
thin<00:01:26.360> fiber<00:01:26.720> I<00:01:26.869> love<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:27.380> particular

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
thin fiber I love this particular

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.340 
thin fiber I love this particular
traction<00:01:28.430> for<00:01:28.610> your<00:01:28.729> crown<00:01:29.000> perhaps<00:01:29.390> I've

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
traction for your crown perhaps I've

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.810 
traction for your crown perhaps I've
worked<00:01:30.650> with<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.830> couple<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:31.369> on<00:01:31.520> that<00:01:31.700> in

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
worked with a couple of you on that in

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.730 
worked with a couple of you on that in
the<00:01:31.940> old<00:01:32.270> one<00:01:32.479> just<00:01:32.720> cut<00:01:32.899> on<00:01:33.250> well<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:35.680> did<00:01:36.680> I

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
the old one just cut on well I did I

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.889 
the old one just cut on well I did I
gently<00:01:37.039> yeah<00:01:37.640> well<00:01:38.030> we<00:01:38.270> can<00:01:38.450> cut<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.720> tissue

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
gently yeah well we can cut the tissue

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.930 
gently yeah well we can cut the tissue
off<00:01:39.200> but<00:01:39.590> I'm<00:01:40.130> talking<00:01:40.369> about<00:01:40.399> getting<00:01:40.759> your

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
off but I'm talking about getting your

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.990 
off but I'm talking about getting your
crown<00:01:41.240> prep<00:01:42.220> margin<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:43.430> you<00:01:43.490> don't<00:01:43.759> have<00:01:43.880> to

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
crown prep margin so you don't have to

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.139 
crown prep margin so you don't have to
pack<00:01:44.210> card<00:01:44.750> for<00:01:45.050> 45<00:01:45.710> minutes<00:01:46.009> we<00:01:46.820> just<00:01:47.030> go

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
pack card for 45 minutes we just go

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.810 
pack card for 45 minutes we just go
around<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.720> gingival<00:01:48.350> sulcus<00:01:48.380> just<00:01:49.340> winders

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
around the gingival sulcus just winders

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.889 
around the gingival sulcus just winders
okay<00:01:53.080> I'll<00:01:54.080> show<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.289> a<00:01:54.380> mic<00:01:55.660> I'm<00:01:56.660> going<00:01:56.840> to

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
okay I'll show you a mic I'm going to

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:07.149 
okay I'll show you a mic I'm going to
try<00:01:57.080> about<00:01:57.200> 8/10<00:01:57.800> of<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:57.979> wide<00:02:00.700> so<00:02:01.700> if

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.760 

if<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:07.820> had<00:02:07.969> a<00:02:08.000> crown<00:02:08.330> prep<00:02:08.599> into<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.200> area<00:02:09.530> I

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
if you had a crown prep into that area I

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.920 
if you had a crown prep into that area I
would<00:02:09.979> take<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.520> laser<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.480> get<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.720> light

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
would take this laser and get the light

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.920 
would take this laser and get the light
hair<00:02:12.110> sorry<00:02:12.489> yours

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.250 

wrong<00:02:17.930> hunk<00:02:18.290> what<00:02:18.470> controls<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.959> okey-dokey

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
wrong hunk what controls that okey-dokey

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.160 
wrong hunk what controls that okey-dokey
I'll<00:02:22.190> take<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.700> laser<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.300> put<00:02:23.569> it<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.959> the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
I'll take the laser and put it in the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.540 
I'll take the laser and put it in the

want to do a ginge of ectomy let's
assume<00:03:41.550> we<00:03:41.790> have<00:03:41.819> some<00:03:42.239> biologic<00:03:43.340> wheels<00:03:44.340> like

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
assume we have some biologic wheels like

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.119 
assume we have some biologic wheels like
we<00:03:44.610> do<00:03:45.140> let's<00:03:46.140> suppose<00:03:46.440> we<00:03:46.650> want<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:46.830> take<00:03:46.980> off

we do let's suppose we want to take off

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.190 
we do let's suppose we want to take off
a<00:03:47.160> couple<00:03:47.310> millimeters<00:03:47.879> of<00:03:48.360> we<00:03:48.540> just<00:03:48.720> had<00:03:48.870> four

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
a couple millimeters of we just had four

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.660 
a couple millimeters of we just had four
there<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.560> look<00:03:49.650> like<00:03:49.830> so<00:03:50.250> let's<00:03:50.400> take<00:03:50.549> off

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
there and look like so let's take off

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.089 
there and look like so let's take off
two<00:03:50.989> one<00:03:51.989> good<00:03:52.140> way<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.290> do<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.980> hold

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
two one good way to do that is to hold

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:02.350 
two one good way to do that is to hold
your<00:03:53.310> probe<00:03:53.870> at<00:03:54.870> -<00:03:56.480> there's<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.569> septa<00:03:57.930> Pro

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:56.600 
easy for me to say let's reduce the
power<00:04:42.990> by<00:04:43.110> half<00:04:46.100> oops<00:04:47.100> one<00:04:47.729> side<00:04:55.460> better<00:04:56.460> if<00:04:56.550> I

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
power by half oops one side better if I

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:04.170 
power by half oops one side better if I
could<00:04:56.789> see

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.930 

you<00:05:04.690> see<00:05:04.870> it's<00:05:04.990> a<00:05:05.050> little<00:05:05.139> slower<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:06.639> tissue

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
you see it's a little slower the tissue

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.070 
you see it's a little slower the tissue
isn't<00:05:07.180> as<00:05:07.330> black

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.770 

so<00:05:12.710> Phil<00:05:13.039> game<00:05:13.190> something<00:05:13.520> yeah<00:05:14.210> still<00:05:14.660> get

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
so Phil game something yeah still get

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.749 
so Phil game something yeah still get
him<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:15.020> say<00:05:15.110> so<00:05:15.169> the<00:05:15.440> trick<00:05:15.710> is<00:05:15.740> what's<00:05:16.520> the

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
him and say so the trick is what's the

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.309 
him and say so the trick is what's the
minimum<00:05:17.150> power<00:05:17.300> remember<00:05:17.840> our<00:05:17.990> discussion

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 
minimum power remember our discussion

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.619 
minimum power remember our discussion
what's<00:05:19.069> the<00:05:19.160> least<00:05:19.310> power<00:05:19.520> we<00:05:19.699> can<00:05:19.849> use<00:05:20.060> looks

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:20.629 
what's the least power we can use looks

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:22.360 
what's the least power we can use looks
like<00:05:20.810> one<00:05:21.050> watt<00:05:21.259> cuts<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.710> pig<00:05:21.919> pretty<00:05:22.159> well

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
like one watt cuts the pig pretty well

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.670 
like one watt cuts the pig pretty well
two<00:05:22.970> watts<00:05:23.150> clearly<00:05:23.690> cuts<00:05:23.930> it<00:05:24.110> for<00:05:24.560> your

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
two watts clearly cuts it for your

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.939 
two watts clearly cuts it for your
patient<00:05:25.099> don't<00:05:25.729> know<00:05:26.650> because<00:05:27.650> we<00:05:27.830> would

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
patient don't know because we would

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.260 
patient don't know because we would
probably<00:05:28.220> start<00:05:28.550> at<00:05:28.639> one<00:05:28.789> watt<00:05:28.970> on<00:05:29.120> your

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
probably start at one watt on your

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.960 
probably start at one watt on your
patient<00:05:29.629> watch<00:05:30.080> a<00:05:30.229> little<00:05:30.470> bit<00:05:30.620> saying<00:05:31.460> great

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
patient watch a little bit saying great

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.540 
patient watch a little bit saying great
cool<00:05:32.539> or<00:05:32.780> terrible<00:05:33.590> turn<00:05:33.860> it<00:05:33.949> down<00:05:34.069> turn<00:05:34.340> it<00:05:34.400> up

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
cool or terrible turn it down turn it up

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.189 
cool or terrible turn it down turn it up
there<00:05:34.759> right<00:05:35.060> no<00:05:35.690> different<00:05:36.020> than<00:05:36.080> your

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199 
there right no different than your

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.119 
there right no different than your
handpiece<00:05:36.500> right

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129 
handpiece right

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.879 
handpiece right
pick<00:05:37.580> a<00:05:37.610> bird<00:05:37.819> it's<00:05:38.300> not<00:05:38.389> doing<00:05:38.629> very<00:05:38.720> well

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
pick a bird it's not doing very well

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:46.240 
pick a bird it's not doing very well
okay<00:05:39.889> okay<00:05:41.259> so<00:05:42.259> once<00:05:42.979> you<00:05:43.099> all<00:05:43.190> play<00:05:43.460> party
