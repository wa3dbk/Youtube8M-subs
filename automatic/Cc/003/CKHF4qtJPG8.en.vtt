00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello in our video today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.400
 the photography basics are about the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.320
 Exposure question the exposure scales 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.750
 is another tool for 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.580
 correct metering and also 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.770
 control directly in the camera 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.750
 in our last video to the histogram 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.010
 the link there and there again later in 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.230
 the video determination we have you 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.769
 already explained that the histogram about it 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.779
 there is that after the photograph 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.910
 the photo can already look at and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.750
 the brightness values ​​in the picture 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.300
 can look at 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.760
 The exposure scales do the whole thing 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.239
 similar but before the photographs 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.129
 as before you can squeeze in the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.350
 display on the display or through 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.550
 the viewers get that is 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.960
 photo overexposed or underexposed 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.430
 that's why the exposure scales are there and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.620
 how it works I show you 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.390
 just a few examples and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.390
 then also in the camera display 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.860
 you can ask the exposure 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.440
 display on the display by 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.900
 one presses the info button at canon and 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.610
 Nikon is definitely like that 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.170
 by default if the display 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.420
 hidden is simply info button 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.580
 press until you get the setting so far 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.490
 gets displayed and there you can see 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.030
 already the settings this scale 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.360
 so is it also says in nikon 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.710
 Exposure scale not exposure scales 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.200
 in the middle so a zero position 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.360
 has and then go right and left then 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.190
 pay from one to three in general 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.340
 once in the plus range to the right 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.729
 once in the minus area to the left 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.560
 and you can do that in the whole thing 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.360
 manual mode of course perfect and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.990
 I always use it, too 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.720
 when I shoot in manual mode 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.550
 great and can then with the values 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.660
 the one sign on either the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:11.170
 exposure time or about the blind 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.200
 value jain leveling to zero 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.510
 the middle position 0 indicates that 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.510
 the picture is properly exposed at least 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.580
 says the camera and because the camera 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.700
 yes tried my properly exposed the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.230
 Picture always the blacks he so ins 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.239
 to pull gray so not that 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.280
 deep runs and the wayss worth so 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.549
 the very bright areas also picture 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.170
 to darken it is a really one 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.540
 orientation value it always comes 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.610
 a little bit of what you want for a motive 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.950
 has before you and what you photograph 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.000
 if i want to go up now for example 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.290
 the black bothers me here at mike 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.530
 Focusing and illuminating the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.670
 never camera me a black t-shirt 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.590
 Show but always try it 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.810
 to whiten and haul in the herb 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.850
 that means you can not always be there 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.910
 one hundred percent on the exposure 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.160
 Libra leave and not 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.630
 directly set to zero if so 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.400
 I want a black shirt 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.829
 really black 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.250
 then my camera is the gray 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.390
 I have to represent a bit 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.690
 underexposed the shirt and too 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.280
 really black is the same 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.319
 also works with yes with very bright 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.030
 or white motifs if i have this 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.799
 bark of the plants in the background 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.120
 to stand for example to take pictures 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:31.099
 would like to photograph and on the others 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.620
 and exposed the camera will think oh 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:38.739
 that is too bright and is better one 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:42.079
 bit under underexposed and yes 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.469
 thus the others are more gray 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.409
 to let 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:46.909
 that means I have to stop when I'm with the 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.400
 Although exposure worked 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.409
 make a slight overexposure to 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.629
 at least one dazzling stage around that 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.079
 knows too well in the picture too 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.939
 to have 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.919
 thus the exposure really does serve 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.659
 as a guide to taking pictures in the 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.699
 manual mode will often makes it 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.500
 can take pictures manually 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:06.109
 really before taking pictures 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.030
 make an impression like the photo then 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.459
 it is more suitable for snapshots 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.239
 less suitable because then just on pkv 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.039
 put oled tvs and the automatic or 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.639
 semi-automatic mode of the camera easy 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.859
 leave 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.320
 but then it can be really that 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.410
 Camera during the exposure measurement is not 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.800
 the result is photographed on what you have 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.039
 would like to 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.960
 because he always tries the dark ones 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.909
 values lightly lighten 14 and bright 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.159
 will slightly darken around there so one 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:35.930
 to find a middle compromise 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.909
 do you have that with the 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.400
 Exposure scales have photographed this 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:42.050
 used in manual mode and thus 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.550
 first experience writes us 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.530
 just below in the comments with 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.930
 in and we'll take a look again 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.789
 so yes your experiences and to be 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.590
 which video has liked then gives the 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.570
 Thumbs up subscribes to our channel 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.889
 on the sides there are next to the effect 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.990
 here we also take the links to the 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.759
 other league channels and many important ones 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.900
 info and links also below in the 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.900
 video description until then
