00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.500
 my people today shows you the red 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.500
 dot 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.590
 yes my people and welcome 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.720
 to race with review and yes the rays 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.520
 mini map is the minimap to the right-like 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.220
 actually already clear that the 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.140
 minimap often deliver at something like travel 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.210
 Just got right in the top right and wanted 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.850
 I just introduce you today 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.390
 you can see that is minimal 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.950
 and that shows a so the environment and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.320
 I apologize in case already 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.390
 The material is not quite all features 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.760
 explained because there are so many 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.640
 There are possibilities for this murder 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.980
 already a police for 14.6 but me 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.400
 I'm still in a plane 05 though 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.210
 no matter 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.130
 here presses m as default and then comes 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.590
 because this window you can only there 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.820
 andes minimap times the turn of 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.030
 bio brender on cave brender so one 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.520
 hollow edges get used and on surface 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.159
 or how it is so what grad holds 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.689
 that you can see from above the friend 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.609
 I'll come again to 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.999
 and as you can see already in the mini map 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.380
 chips billions of option and the 

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:25.289
 I'll show you here there is 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.679
 ground and square so square 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:31.229
 here you run so stop on the map 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:34.859
 you can see on the top right as a smaller one 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.439
 arrow and in square the map moves 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.979
 each with and you are the cross in 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.079
 the middle 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.109
 yes then there are the rays minimap 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.689
 graphic and dancing with me 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.850
 mini max and yes then there are the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.219
 position that is actually 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.899
 self-explanatory the size I can too 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.000
 Once you realize it correctly 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.910
 smart view comes the better 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.200
 the transparency so the opacity 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:08.860
 then there is the large scale and latsch 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.650
 So you open the capital with the phoenix 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.510
 then comes a big map that you so 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.010
 a large part renders and this 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.110
 automatically stop them being educated 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.100
 small part you can do yours 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.459
 see environment and latsch websale best 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.560
 just make the size of this map so 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.580
 smaller, bigger anyway 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.280
 also self-explanatory then the opacity 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.270
 the large cap the latent label i have 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.030
 no idea I do not see any 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.580
 Differences filtering is like now 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.830
 Look at the minimap in the upper right corner 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.260
 is rendered hard or something 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.700
 soft because if I now with z 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.980
 then I wanted to see you soon 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.150
 show a number so they ran otherwise 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.010
 blurry but with filtering off then 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.380
 that's just rendered hard I call 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.610
 Just let me search again 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.390
 out that goes with z 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.390
 now do that again where it was 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.239
 I already coordinate whether the 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:12.640
 to be displayed there is this point 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:16.870
 and that then commas and then 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.269
 whether the menu is displayed so what 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.860
 you who opens this menu if you have that 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.120
 I forget that I always do that because 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.120
 I do not like that and me 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.040
 know that it is essential then the front so 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:33.280
 the size of the coordinates front and 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.489
 oh yes yes menu katie fforde zoom that is 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.590
 stop the zoom automatically always stop 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.230
 there is if you're not automatic 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.579
 even rhine and maas I know unfortunately 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.180
 neither do I not see any 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.670
 difference 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.469
 update frequency is how often he is 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.129
 you see this you when I do that 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:53.469
 will move the shadow and the 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.870
 sugar updated and if he faster 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.700
 or slow down I do not know 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.650
 because they are not and many and long 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.359
 I want to go on with it you 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.950
 Larger map run better that was otherwise 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.680
 he changes that I believe only when 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.689
 you're running since that was it 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.720
 first to the first point so we 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.650
 come to the service options and there 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.139
 Can you adjust the 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.180
 lighting conditions whether the dynamic day 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.979
 or night are the times when I show 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.050
 they are dynamic during the day 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:27.910
 bright and night so what am I doing 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.139
 Here at night they are where there is light 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.789
 it will also be a bit light 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.270
 displayed like this right here I think 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:37.389
 You can see well and you can go on 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.520
 there is then so if that just so with 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.320
 the shadow if height so height 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.479
 should be rendered or if that is flat 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.520
 appears then there is such a one 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.220
 small attitude to the the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.870
 transparent if transparent blocks 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.220
 easy in a color or so easy 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.550
 transparent as you can on the water 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.550
 this can change a bit 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.470
 the color 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.610
 and I do not really know that 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.420
 prevents snow from being displayed 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:08.600
 that shows you so long grid and that 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:12.710
 shows you all the chance to die 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.500
 service web so we come to the monster 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.190
 Radar if I can say that 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.500
 and yes you can adjust here so if so 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.490
 animals player villiger everything possible 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.900
 should be displayed 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.910
 So here squids and I shall times 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.280
 just everything here then you see 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.530
 monsters are red as well as zombie 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.110
 at all, just stay away fast 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.560
 Creative Sun Monsters are red animals 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.910
 white and other creatures are green me 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.740
 do not know exactly what kind of here 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.230
 other creatures hover around 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.710
 probably slams the slams are too 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:51.320
 green below me you see a few 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.090
 are also a bit more transparent 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.650
 that means they are further below 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.800
 earth or further over the earth 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.290
 the blue ones are inkfishes and 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.790
 then you can still the direction 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.260
 this was the father of the father here 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.700
 Direction of the ads let so 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.680
 where they are going with these 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.540
 that works too 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.990
 only multiplayer he had to the the 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.969
 server operates a specific code in 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.769
 the 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.289
 welcome message so write that 

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:22.209
 does not work because without further ado 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.689
 with multiplayer the whole map but probably 

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:27.939
 only the animals do not stop and here so 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:30.009
 we come to the way polens yes I have 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.719
 once created mini map report 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:34.779
 At the top of the minimap you can see 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:37.449
 a small green arrow on the large 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:39.549
 cap you can see such a green square 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.529
 or a rhomb and here you can see 

00:06:39.549 --> 00:06:43.719
 minimap and the distance from it 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:45.129
 and then I can get closer to it 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:46.419
 for example, just now will be 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.579
 he on the minimap top right too 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:51.939
 displayed again and so hovers the then 

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:54.549
 in the air my wake legal rap 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:56.349
 hand pressed on then comes waypoint 

00:06:54.549 --> 00:07:00.249
 then write everything you go what you do 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:02.110
 want and here you can your color 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:05.819
 stop and you have one 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:09.509
 waypoint creates this you can 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:12.489
 wii points then leave it there but 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:14.799
 can not show so later again 

00:07:12.489 --> 00:07:17.379
 display and a specific 

00:07:14.799 --> 00:07:20.829
 Waypoint is the point of the self 

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:22.719
 a waypoint then where you died 

00:07:20.829 --> 00:07:25.659
 so that he can find where you are again 

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:27.610
 because pushed time and that was it 

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:29.139
 actually of the minimap the important one 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.209
 here are a few more options 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:35.739
 so if i ever show again 

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:36.159
 let waypoint show minimap 

00:07:35.739 --> 00:07:38.560
 to let 

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:42.050
 there are a few here 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:45.290
 option to see if the name is displayed 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.360
 whether only the icon change if 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.850
 this whether the name change whether the 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.890
 distance change if only the icon here in 

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.150
 the air should float and so on in 

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.150
 you can still use the key config 

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:58.100
 Thousands of different things set 

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.620
 So the zoom and change everything 

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.470
 and that 's it from the right mini map 

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:06.250
 a really cool card on the top right a lot 

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.250
 fun with the motto
