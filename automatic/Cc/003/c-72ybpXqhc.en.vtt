tutorial<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.760> got<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.360> flood<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.809> emails<00:00:10.260> today

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
tutorial I got a flood of emails today

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.620 
tutorial I got a flood of emails today
after<00:00:10.950> my<00:00:11.160> animating<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.880> map<00:00:12.059> in<00:00:12.210> motion

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
after my animating a map in motion

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.749 
after my animating a map in motion
tutorial<00:00:13.230> came<00:00:13.380> out<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.769> people<00:00:14.549> were

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
tutorial came out and people were

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.740 
tutorial came out and people were
wondering<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.059> know<00:00:15.120> how<00:00:15.179> did<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.509> do<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
wondering you know how did you do the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.480 
wondering you know how did you do the
gradient<00:00:16.170> how<00:00:16.289> did<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.619> lay<00:00:16.890> out<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.220> make<00:00:17.340> it

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
gradient how did you lay out and make it

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.880 
gradient how did you lay out and make it
look<00:00:17.640> really<00:00:17.820> nice<00:00:18.199> I'm<00:00:19.199> also<00:00:19.439> going<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> add

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
look really nice I'm also going to add

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.710 
look really nice I'm also going to add
one<00:00:19.920> other<00:00:20.279> thing<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.730> didn't<00:00:21.180> add<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
one other thing that I didn't add to the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.420 
one other thing that I didn't add to the
map<00:00:21.930> which<00:00:22.199> actually<00:00:22.710> now<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.369> think

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
map which actually now that I think

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.310 
map which actually now that I think
about<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.760> would<00:00:23.910> be<00:00:23.970> cool<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:24.990> start<00:00:25.170> a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
about it would be cool we can start a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.070 
about it would be cool we can start a
beginning<00:00:25.949> red<00:00:26.250> dot<00:00:26.490> for<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> begin<00:00:27.570> point<00:00:27.930> of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
beginning red dot for the begin point of

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.779 
beginning red dot for the begin point of
the<00:00:28.320> journey<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.830> an<00:00:29.010> end<00:00:29.160> point<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the journey and an end point of the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.730 
the journey and an end point of the
journey<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.810> how<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.349> do<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.590> is

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
journey and so how we can do that is

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.530 
journey and so how we can do that is
just<00:00:31.769> come<00:00:32.009> up<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> your<00:00:32.279> shapes<00:00:32.550> select<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
just come up to your shapes select the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.600 
just come up to your shapes select the
circle<00:00:33.750> I'm<00:00:34.680> going<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.860> go<00:00:34.980> ahead<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.250> just

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
circle I'm going to go ahead and just

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880 
circle I'm going to go ahead and just
guess<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.780> was<00:00:36.899> round<00:00:37.170> here<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.530> florence

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
guess it was round here in florence

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.549 
guess it was round here in florence
avenue<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:39.030> where<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.420> right<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.600> hold

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
avenue it's where it was right here hold

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.740 
avenue it's where it was right here hold
down<00:00:40.710> shift<00:00:41.040> it'll<00:00:41.640> actually<00:00:41.820> stay<00:00:42.270> nice<00:00:42.540> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
down shift it'll actually stay nice and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.410 
down shift it'll actually stay nice and
symmetrical<00:00:43.739> circle<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.940> go<00:00:45.149> ahead<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
symmetrical circle so go ahead and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.069 
symmetrical circle so go ahead and
change<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.469> phil<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> red<00:00:48.539> color<00:00:48.809> i<00:00:48.870> had

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
change this phil to the red color i had

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.869 
change this phil to the red color i had
saved<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.160> didn't<00:00:50.430> save<00:00:50.579> your<00:00:50.670> color

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
saved here you didn't save your color

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.600 
saved here you didn't save your color
you<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.149> use<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> eyeglass<00:00:52.020> tool<00:00:52.610> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
you can use the eyeglass tool to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.970 
you can use the eyeglass tool to
actually<00:00:53.760> get<00:00:54.059> your<00:00:54.090> color<00:00:54.469> ok<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.530> I've<00:00:55.800> got

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
actually get your color ok so I've got

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.130 
actually get your color ok so I've got
that<00:00:56.190> little<00:00:56.340> red<00:00:56.610> starting<00:00:57.270> dot<00:00:57.449> I'm<00:00:57.899> also

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that little red starting dot I'm also

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.689 
that little red starting dot I'm also
going<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.500> give<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> little<00:00:59.070> drop<00:00:59.399> shadow

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
going to give that a little drop shadow

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.500 
going to give that a little drop shadow
here<00:01:00.559> ok<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.070> that's<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.399> start<00:01:02.640> point<00:01:02.910> I'm

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
here ok so that's the start point I'm

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.310 
here ok so that's the start point I'm
going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.719> copy<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.199> paste<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:06.320> here

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
going to copy and paste this to here

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.380 
going to copy and paste this to here
which<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> end<00:01:08.369> point<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:08.909> play<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.299> it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
which is the end point if we play it it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.469 
which is the end point if we play it it
should<00:01:09.600> come<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.049> there<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:11.450> sure<00:01:12.450> enough

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
should come out of there and sure enough

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.590 
should come out of there and sure enough
I<00:01:13.310> can<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.460> move<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.850> dot<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.479> bit

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
I can just move this dot a little bit

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.340 
I can just move this dot a little bit
over<00:01:17.030> right<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.270> okay<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:18.900> that's<00:01:19.200> how<00:01:19.320> i

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
over right there okay so that's how i

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.289 
over right there okay so that's how i
would<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.130> make<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.000> look<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> little

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
would do that make that look a little

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.969 
would do that make that look a little
better<00:01:21.479> also<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.990> drop<00:01:22.200> shadow<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> little

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
better also this drop shadow is a little

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.429 
better also this drop shadow is a little
strange<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.610> select<00:01:23.759> both<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.990> change

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
strange so we can select both and change

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.550 
strange so we can select both and change
the<00:01:25.590> drop<00:01:25.770> shadow<00:01:26.100> under<00:01:26.700> properties<00:01:27.560> drop

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the drop shadow under properties drop

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.980 
the drop shadow under properties drop
shadow<00:01:28.829> i'ma<00:01:29.189> turn<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> opacity<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:30.000> we

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
shadow i'ma turn the opacity down we

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.830 
shadow i'ma turn the opacity down we
don't<00:01:31.170> need<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> high<00:01:31.850> ok<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.329> how<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> did

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
don't need it that high ok so how I did

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.170 
don't need it that high ok so how I did
the<00:01:33.930> gradients<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.500> let<00:01:34.829> me<00:01:34.950> show<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.189> first

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the gradients here let me show you first

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.490 
the gradients here let me show you first
of<00:01:36.270> all<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> map<00:01:36.720> actually<00:01:36.960> has<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> drop

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
of all the map actually has a drop

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.560 
of all the map actually has a drop
shadow<00:01:37.710> behind<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.250> which<00:01:38.400> makes<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.820> pop<00:01:39.329> out

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
shadow behind it which makes it pop out

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.870 
shadow behind it which makes it pop out
from<00:01:39.810> these<00:01:40.020> two<00:01:40.380> color<00:01:40.710> bars<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.369> columns<00:01:41.759> on

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
from these two color bars the columns on

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.139 
from these two color bars the columns on
the<00:01:41.909> side<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.680> at<00:01:43.799> 260<00:01:44.340> degrees<00:01:44.460> so

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the side and I have it at 260 degrees so

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.020 
the side and I have it at 260 degrees so
260<00:01:45.899> degrees<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:47.159> coming<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
260 degrees so that it's coming all the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.569 
260 degrees so that it's coming all the
way<00:01:48.060> around<00:01:48.470> here<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.770> also<00:01:49.890> pulled<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
way around here and I also pulled up the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.480 
way around here and I also pulled up the
blur<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.210> 37<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.649> pull<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.040> blur<00:01:53.250> it

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
blur to 37 and if you pull the blur it

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.429 
blur to 37 and if you pull the blur it
always<00:01:53.729> expands<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.020> drop<00:01:55.200> shadow

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
always expands it so the drop shadow

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.840 
always expands it so the drop shadow
will<00:01:55.619> usually<00:01:55.829> go<00:01:56.130> around<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.430> whole<00:01:56.579> object

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
will usually go around the whole object

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.359 
will usually go around the whole object
that<00:01:57.210> you're<00:01:57.390> adding<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> drop<00:01:58.049> shadow<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.469> now

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
that you're adding a drop shadow to now

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.130 
that you're adding a drop shadow to now
what<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> did<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.299> columns<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.899> actually

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
what I did for the columns to actually

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.020 
what I did for the columns to actually
create<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> gradient<00:02:01.680> let<00:02:02.340> me<00:02:02.430> go<00:02:02.549> ahead<00:02:02.790> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
create a gradient let me go ahead and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.420 
create a gradient let me go ahead and
turn<00:02:03.360> off<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.659> group<00:02:03.990> I'll<00:02:04.530> create<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.189> new

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
turn off this group I'll create a new

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.039 
turn off this group I'll create a new
group<00:02:05.610> here<00:02:05.880> well<00:02:06.030> create<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> gradient<00:02:06.780> from

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
group here well create a gradient from

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.520 
group here well create a gradient from
scratch<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> one<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.759> saw

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.729 

okay<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.010> if<00:02:15.220> i<00:02:15.340> go<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.690> shape<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.959> can<00:02:17.590> change

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
okay so if i go to shape I can change

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.800 
okay so if i go to shape I can change
this<00:02:17.830> from<00:02:18.010> color<00:02:18.370> for<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.209> film<00:02:19.420> ode<00:02:19.599> to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
this from color for the film ode to

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.750 
this from color for the film ode to
gradient<00:02:20.230> okay<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.190> now<00:02:21.250> i'm<00:02:21.400> going<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.580> pull

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
gradient okay and now i'm going to pull

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.280 
gradient okay and now i'm going to pull
this<00:02:21.790> down<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.420> we're<00:02:22.599> going<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.780> change<00:02:23.020> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
this down and we're going to change the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.750 
this down and we're going to change the
start<00:02:23.709> point<00:02:24.540> grab<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.690> color<00:02:25.900> wheel<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.760> i'm

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
start point grab the color wheel and i'm

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.509 
start point grab the color wheel and i'm
going<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.940> change<00:02:28.060> this<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.980> lighter<00:02:29.980> blue<00:02:30.310> on

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
going to change this to lighter blue on

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.430 
going to change this to lighter blue on
top<00:02:30.550> now<00:02:31.480> i'm<00:02:31.569> going<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.750> save<00:02:32.019> this<00:02:32.170> color

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
top now i'm going to save this color

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.780 
top now i'm going to save this color
there's<00:02:32.739> one<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.069> tips<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.400> want<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.610> save

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
there's one of the tips you want to save

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.380 
there's one of the tips you want to save
that<00:02:33.819> color<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:34.450> use<00:02:35.310> for<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.430> next<00:02:36.849> one<00:02:37.090> use

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
that color you use for the next one use

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.380 
that color you use for the next one use
the<00:02:37.540> same<00:02:37.750> color<00:02:38.050> but<00:02:39.030> actually<00:02:40.030> pull<00:02:40.239> down

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
the same color but actually pull down

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.100 
the same color but actually pull down
the<00:02:40.569> darkness<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:42.599> pulled<00:02:43.599> it<00:02:43.690> down<00:02:43.720> quite<00:02:44.080> a

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
the darkness I pulled it down quite a

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.990 
the darkness I pulled it down quite a
bit<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:44.799> what<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.100> do<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.340> right<00:02:45.549> click<00:02:45.580> on<00:02:45.940> it

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
bit but what you do is right click on it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.240 
bit but what you do is right click on it
and<00:02:46.180> go<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.450> edit<00:02:46.569> gradient<00:02:47.140> pull<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:48.010> down

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
and go to edit gradient pull this down

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.080 
and go to edit gradient pull this down
so<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.850> be<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> smoother<00:02:49.510> transition

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
so you can be a smoother transition

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.729 
so you can be a smoother transition
what's<00:02:52.090> up<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> little<00:02:52.510> bit<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:53.380> there<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:53.680> get

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
what's up a little bit so there you get

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.180 
what's up a little bit so there you get
a<00:02:53.799> nice<00:02:53.950> gradient<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.730> then<00:02:55.660> I'm<00:02:55.810> going<00:02:56.049> to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
a nice gradient and then I'm going to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.150 
a nice gradient and then I'm going to
copy<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.459> paste<00:02:57.700> this<00:03:01.500> over<00:03:02.500> there<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:02.950> then

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
copy and paste this over there and then

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.280 
copy and paste this over there and then
drag<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.670> map<00:03:03.880> right<00:03:04.480> here<00:03:04.540> with<00:03:04.900> its<00:03:05.140> own

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
drag the map right here with its own

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.170 
drag the map right here with its own
drop<00:03:05.560> shadow<00:03:05.799> so<00:03:06.310> there's<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.580> few<00:03:06.670> questions

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
drop shadow so there's a few questions

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.910 
drop shadow so there's a few questions
