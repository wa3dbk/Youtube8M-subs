00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.740 

here<00:00:06.050> we<00:00:06.170> have<00:00:06.320> a<00:00:06.350> home<00:00:06.670> with<00:00:07.670> living<00:00:08.060> space<00:00:08.450> in

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
here we have a home with living space in

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.290 
here we have a home with living space in
the<00:00:08.870> Attic<00:00:09.230> so<00:00:09.470> you<00:00:10.070> need<00:00:10.520> to<00:00:10.639> be<00:00:10.760> able<00:00:10.880> to<00:00:11.000> get

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
the Attic so you need to be able to get

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.040 
the Attic so you need to be able to get
to<00:00:11.510> the<00:00:11.660> Attic

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
to the Attic

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.920 
to the Attic
from<00:00:12.800> within<00:00:12.980> the<00:00:13.340> room<00:00:13.520> so<00:00:14.210> the<00:00:14.240> insulation

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
from within the room so the insulation

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.070 
from within the room so the insulation
runs<00:00:15.410> up<00:00:15.710> the<00:00:16.070> outside<00:00:16.369> wall<00:00:16.640> along<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:17.840> top

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
runs up the outside wall along the top

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.859 
runs up the outside wall along the top
of<00:00:18.110> the<00:00:18.439> first<00:00:19.010> floor<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:19.550> then<00:00:19.880> up<00:00:20.150> along<00:00:20.689> the

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
of the first floor and then up along the

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.530 
of the first floor and then up along the
inside<00:00:21.349> of<00:00:21.860> the<00:00:22.099> second<00:00:22.460> floor<00:00:22.669> upper<00:00:23.270> floor

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
inside of the second floor upper floor

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.900 
inside of the second floor upper floor
they<00:00:23.840> have<00:00:24.020> attic<00:00:24.470> above<00:00:24.619> and<00:00:25.099> to<00:00:25.489> the<00:00:25.610> sides

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
they have attic above and to the sides

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.140 
they have attic above and to the sides
so<00:00:26.239> what<00:00:26.840> this<00:00:27.140> project<00:00:27.470> is<00:00:27.829> about<00:00:27.980> is<00:00:28.340> getting

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
so what this project is about is getting

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.560 
so what this project is about is getting
access<00:00:29.360> to<00:00:30.200> those<00:00:30.410> attic<00:00:31.369> spaces<00:00:31.700> they're<00:00:32.360> on

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
access to those attic spaces they're on

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.319 
access to those attic spaces they're on
the<00:00:32.840> side<00:00:33.110> of<00:00:33.380> that<00:00:33.649> room<00:00:34.030> so<00:00:35.030> when<00:00:35.180> these

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
the side of that room so when these

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.840 
the side of that room so when these
people<00:00:35.390> bought<00:00:35.899> this<00:00:36.079> house<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:37.219> access<00:00:37.670> to

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
people bought this house the access to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.000 
people bought this house the access to
the<00:00:37.969> attic<00:00:38.269> was<00:00:38.660> just<00:00:39.019> a<00:00:39.140> simple<00:00:39.500> wooden<00:00:39.710> door

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
the attic was just a simple wooden door

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.639 
the attic was just a simple wooden door
and<00:00:40.250> it<00:00:40.850> was<00:00:40.969> a<00:00:41.000> great<00:00:41.329> source<00:00:41.989> of<00:00:42.260> heat<00:00:42.440> loss

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
and it was a great source of heat loss

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.880 
and it was a great source of heat loss
so<00:00:43.309> what<00:00:43.640> we're<00:00:43.789> gonna<00:00:43.879> do<00:00:44.149> today<00:00:44.329> is<00:00:44.750> build<00:00:45.590> a

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
so what we're gonna do today is build a

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.150 
so what we're gonna do today is build a
door<00:00:46.460> that<00:00:47.149> gives<00:00:47.449> access<00:00:47.719> to<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.199> attic<00:00:48.949> and

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
door that gives access to the attic and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.150 
door that gives access to the attic and
at<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:49.519> same<00:00:49.699> time<00:00:50.030> is<00:00:50.469> insulated<00:00:51.469> so<00:00:51.920> there's

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
at the same time is insulated so there's

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.700 
at the same time is insulated so there's
only<00:00:52.250> one<00:00:52.399> trick<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.120> this<00:00:53.269> this<00:00:53.839> type<00:00:54.289> of<00:00:54.469> door

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
only one trick to this this type of door

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.410 
only one trick to this this type of door
is<00:00:54.949> that<00:00:55.010> that<00:00:55.460> because<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:55.940> door<00:00:56.089> is<00:00:56.210> so

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
is that that because the door is so

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.270 
is that that because the door is so
thick<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:56.960> have<00:00:57.199> to<00:00:57.410> have<00:00:57.589> a<00:00:57.620> special<00:00:57.949> way<00:00:58.249> of

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
thick you have to have a special way of

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.579 
thick you have to have a special way of
opening<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:59.089> door<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.079> what<00:01:00.260> we're<00:01:00.410> going<00:01:00.530> to

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
opening the door so what we're going to

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.459 
opening the door so what we're going to
do<00:01:00.829> instead<00:01:01.609> of<00:01:01.670> having<00:01:01.789> the<00:01:02.179> door<00:01:02.469> seal

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
do instead of having the door seal

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.040 
do instead of having the door seal
against<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.070> ninety<00:01:04.370> degree<00:01:04.489> angle<00:01:04.840> the<00:01:05.840> door

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
against a ninety degree angle the door

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.960 
against a ninety degree angle the door
is<00:01:06.170> going<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.409> seal<00:01:06.710> against<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.310> 45<00:01:07.790> degree

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
is going to seal against a 45 degree

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.200 
is going to seal against a 45 degree
that<00:01:08.870> way<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.950> sides<00:01:10.280> of<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.700> door<00:01:10.940> are

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
that way the sides of the door are

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.800 
that way the sides of the door are
unrestricted<00:01:12.200> when<00:01:13.190> they<00:01:13.430> turn<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.540> you<00:01:14.630> can

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
unrestricted when they turn so you can

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.510 
unrestricted when they turn so you can
cut<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:14.990> forty-five<00:01:15.530> with<00:01:15.770> this<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:15.980> miter<00:01:16.400> saw

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
cut the forty-five with this a miter saw

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.240 
cut the forty-five with this a miter saw
that<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:17.960> notice<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.410> saw<00:01:18.620> has<00:01:18.830> all<00:01:19.100> the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
that you notice the saw has all the

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.030 
that you notice the saw has all the
graduations<00:01:19.730> here<00:01:20.300> and<00:01:20.510> it's<00:01:20.990> very<00:01:21.260> simple<00:01:21.650> to

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
graduations here and it's very simple to

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.550 
graduations here and it's very simple to
put<00:01:22.490> your<00:01:22.760> workpiece<00:01:23.240> in<00:01:23.480> and<00:01:23.720> cut<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.440> out

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
put your workpiece in and cut it out

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.040 
put your workpiece in and cut it out
whatever<00:01:24.830> angle<00:01:25.190> you<00:01:25.340> need<00:01:25.550> in<00:01:26.420> this<00:01:26.540> case<00:01:26.840> is

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
whatever angle you need in this case is

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.650 
whatever angle you need in this case is
going<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.230> be<00:01:27.290> 45<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.190> it's<00:01:28.730> going<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:28.910> be<00:01:29.060> with

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
going to be 45 and it's going to be with

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.790 
going to be 45 and it's going to be with
the<00:01:29.780> help<00:01:29.930> of<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.170> side<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:30.500> going<00:01:30.620> to<00:01:30.680> be

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
the help of the side is going to be

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:46.340 
the help of the side is going to be
perfect<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.460> perfect<00:01:31.660> 45<00:01:32.660> degree<00:01:32.990> angle

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.010 

one<00:01:46.980> facing<00:01:47.520> outward<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.120> the<00:01:48.150> right<00:01:48.390> side<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
one facing outward on the right side and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.290 
one facing outward on the right side and
another<00:01:49.350> facing<00:01:49.680> inward<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.850> left<00:01:51.060> side

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
another facing inward on the left side

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.740 
another facing inward on the left side
and<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.200> door<00:01:52.440> do<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> opposite<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.150> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
and on the door do the opposite so the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.920 
and on the door do the opposite so the
angles<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.250> angle<00:01:56.550> faces<00:01:57.000> match<00:01:57.479> each<00:01:57.720> other

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
angles the angle faces match each other

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.320 
angles the angle faces match each other
so<00:01:58.590> here<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.100> all<00:01:59.250> framed<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
so here it is all framed you have the

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.620 
so here it is all framed you have the
angles<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> sides<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:02.670> door<00:02:02.940> which

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
angles on the sides and the door which

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.410 
angles on the sides and the door which
turns<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:04.440> for<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.220> hinge<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.790> don't<00:02:05.970> need

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
turns and for the hinge you don't need

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.419 
turns and for the hinge you don't need
anything<00:02:06.780> exciting<00:02:07.259> all<00:02:07.440> there<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.009> here<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
anything exciting all there is here is a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.940 
anything exciting all there is here is a
nail<00:02:08.789> through<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.240> top<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:10.590> through<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
nail through the top and one through the
