upgrade<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.529> course<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.279> these<00:00:20.609> whatever

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
upgrade of course was to these whatever

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.050 
upgrade of course was to these whatever
you<00:00:21.630> call<00:00:21.810> these<00:00:21.960> these<00:00:22.140> Blue<00:00:23.130> Beam<00:00:23.400> antennas

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
you call these these Blue Beam antennas

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.450 
you call these these Blue Beam antennas
because<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.359> for<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> race<00:00:25.289> car<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.859> for<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> rock

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
because I for a race car are for a rock

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.310 
because I for a race car are for a rock
crawler<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.849> was<00:00:27.060> not<00:00:27.269> getting<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.840> distance

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320

that<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.670> guess<00:00:29.970> you're<00:00:30.150> supposedly

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
that you know I guess you're supposedly

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.970 
that you know I guess you're supposedly
to<00:00:30.779> get<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> had<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.410> get<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> pair<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.859> these

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
to get so I had to get a pair of these

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.819 
to get so I had to get a pair of these
these<00:00:32.250> for<00:00:32.460> about<00:00:32.870> 75<00:00:33.870> bucks<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.559> after

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
these for about 75 bucks or so after

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.049 
these for about 75 bucks or so after
shipping<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.460> get<00:00:35.610> these<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.969> they

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
shipping to get these and they

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.290 
shipping to get these and they
definitely<00:00:36.239> helped<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.930> range<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:38.180> you<00:00:39.180> know

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
definitely helped on range but you know

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.810 
definitely helped on range but you know
it's<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:39.780> again<00:00:40.050> something<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:41.070> thought

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
it's just again something that I thought

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.889 
it's just again something that I thought
shoulda<00:00:42.030> came<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> system<00:00:42.750> when<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
shoulda came with the system when I

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.479 
shoulda came with the system when I
first<00:00:43.110> got<00:00:43.290> instead<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.680> having<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.920> buy<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.129> so

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
it's not going to go anywhere unlike

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.630 
it's not going to go anywhere unlike
this<00:01:39.960> flimsy<00:01:40.439> thing<00:01:40.860> here<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.310> noticed

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
look at this I mean I mean the wind is

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.260 
look at this I mean I mean the wind is
pushing<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.490> thing<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.880> got<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.180> an

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
pushing this thing if you got this on an

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.580 
pushing this thing if you got this on an
airplane<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.720> thing's<00:01:45.869> gonna<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:46.110> jolt<00:01:46.439> I

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
airplane this thing's gonna be jolt I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.380 
airplane this thing's gonna be jolt I
mean<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.829> could<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.280> could<00:01:48.119> hit<00:01:48.270> this

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
mean you could just I could hit this

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.350 
mean you could just I could hit this
thing<00:01:48.450> all<00:01:48.780> day<00:01:48.810> long<00:01:49.280> unlike<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.850> other<00:01:51.149> one

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
thing all day long unlike the other one

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
thing all day long unlike the other one
the<00:01:51.479> HD<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.229> got<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:53.220> thing

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the HD one that I got here this thing

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.069 
the HD one that I got here this thing
ain't<00:01:53.549> moving<00:01:53.640> nowhere<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.360> mean<00:01:54.570> unless<00:01:54.840> it's

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
ain't moving nowhere I mean unless it's

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.410 
ain't moving nowhere I mean unless it's
moving<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> servo<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.880> see<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.240> one

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
moving the servo so you can see this one

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.300 
moving the servo so you can see this one
here<00:01:57.450> by<00:01:57.780> far<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> far<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:59.040> far

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
here by far is a far you know far

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.010 
here by far is a far you know far
superior<00:01:59.520> camera<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.719> one<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.960> things

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
superior camera but one of the things

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.670 
superior camera but one of the things
that<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.320> noticed<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:02.509> if<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.689> look<00:02:03.869> here<00:02:04.229> this

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
that I noticed is if you look here this

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.580 
that I noticed is if you look here this
only<00:02:05.040> has<00:02:05.659> basically<00:02:06.659> these<00:02:06.899> three<00:02:07.320> wires

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
only has basically these three wires

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.619 
only has basically these three wires
here<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.280> hopefully<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.179> come<00:02:09.239> not<00:02:09.509> too

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
here so hopefully you can come not too

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.830 
here so hopefully you can come not too
close<00:02:09.840> only<00:02:10.649> has<00:02:10.830> these<00:02:11.069> three<00:02:11.310> wires

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
close only has these three wires

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.730 
close only has these three wires
comparison<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.440> stuff

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
comparison to the stuff

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.040 
comparison to the stuff
Rock<00:02:13.800> one<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.160> has<00:02:14.310> no<00:02:15.180> air<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.510> five<00:02:15.870> or

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
Rock one that has no air that is five or

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.510 
Rock one that has no air that is five or
six<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.410> had<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.590> tweak<00:02:16.890> these<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.100> little<00:02:17.280> bit

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
six so I had to tweak these a little bit

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.670 
six so I had to tweak these a little bit
to<00:02:17.640> get<00:02:17.730> them<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.970> work<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:19.110> case<00:02:19.290> many<00:02:19.560> of

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
to get them to work and in case many of

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.260 
to get them to work and in case many of
you<00:02:19.770> guys<00:02:19.890> are<00:02:19.950> doing<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.790> get<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.120> to

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
you guys are doing this to get it to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.380 
you guys are doing this to get it to
work<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.630> ended<00:02:22.230> up<00:02:22.320> doing<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.790> red<00:02:24.180> one

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
work I ended up doing the the red one

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.420 
work I ended up doing the the red one
first<00:02:24.690> or<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.930> red<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.320> into<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.920> all<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
first or the red one into the all the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.700 
first or the red one into the all the
way<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.730> right<00:02:26.910> slot<00:02:27.330> here<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.500> did<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
way to the right slot here so I did the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.700 
way to the right slot here so I did the
red<00:02:28.890> one<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.280> then<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.300> actual<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:31.170> think<00:02:31.590> it's

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
red one and then the actual I think it's

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.500 
red one and then the actual I think it's
called<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.160> red<00:02:32.310> one<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.760> black<00:02:33.000> one<00:02:33.060> and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
called the red one the black one and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.990 
called the red one the black one and
then<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.050> green<00:02:34.320> one<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.340> had<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.670> into

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
then the green one and so I had it into

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.830 
then the green one and so I had it into
the<00:02:36.470> wherever<00:02:37.470> at<00:02:37.560> which<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:38.730> had<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.480> into<00:02:39.750> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
the wherever at which I had it into the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.080 
the wherever at which I had it into the
other<00:02:39.990> little<00:02:40.200> connector<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:40.890> was<00:02:41.700> able<00:02:41.880> to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
other little connector and was able to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.670 
other little connector and was able to
get<00:02:42.180> video<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.810> do<00:02:42.930> all<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.170> pan<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.530> tilt

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
get video and do all the pan and tilt

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.550 
get video and do all the pan and tilt
just<00:02:44.010> fine<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.880> was<00:02:45.510> able<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.840> use<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.080> and

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
just fine so I was able to use that and

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.610 
just fine so I was able to use that and
again<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.940> i<00:02:47.970> was<00:02:48.180> able<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.540> again<00:02:48.930> sorry<00:02:49.350> uh

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
again so i was able to again sorry uh

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.680 
again so i was able to again sorry uh
you<00:02:50.220> know<00:02:50.460> get<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:51.000> work<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.480> shot

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
you know get this to work and it shot

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.140 
you know get this to work and it shot
decently<00:02:52.620> good<00:02:52.710> video<00:02:53.220> i<00:02:53.280> mean<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.970> wasn't

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
decently good video i mean it wasn't

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.600 
decently good video i mean it wasn't
like<00:02:54.300> stellar<00:02:55.080> i<00:02:55.500> mean<00:02:55.770> i<00:02:55.980> think<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.550> one

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
like stellar i mean i think this one

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.580 
like stellar i mean i think this one
again<00:02:56.820> did<00:02:57.090> like<00:02:57.210> five<00:02:57.510> hundred<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.990> twenty

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
again did like five hundred and twenty

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.560 
again did like five hundred and twenty
lines<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:59.070> resolution<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.970> was<00:03:00.150> definitely<00:03:00.330> a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
lines of resolution it was definitely a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.290 
lines of resolution it was definitely a
significant<00:03:01.530> increase<00:03:01.740> than<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.790> stock<00:03:03.090> one

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
significant increase than the stock one

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.630 
significant increase than the stock one
for<00:03:03.600> sure<00:03:03.870> but<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.680> still<00:03:04.980> wasn't<00:03:05.220> up<00:03:05.460> to<00:03:05.490> par

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
for sure but it still wasn't up to par

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.130 
for sure but it still wasn't up to par
and<00:03:06.030> again<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:06.420> could<00:03:06.540> see<00:03:06.720> look<00:03:06.870> at<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.020> i

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
and again you could see look at this i

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.230 
and again you could see look at this i
mean<00:03:07.170> if<00:03:07.650> i<00:03:07.830> wiggle<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.250> thing<00:03:08.490> look<00:03:09.060> at<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
mean if i wiggle this thing look at the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.670 
mean if i wiggle this thing look at the
whole<00:03:09.360> thing<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.750> just<00:03:09.840> jiggling<00:03:10.320> around<00:03:10.410> up

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
whole thing is just jiggling around up

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
stock camera that comes with it again

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.000 
stock camera that comes with it again
look<00:04:23.910> at<00:04:24.000> this<00:04:24.260> so<00:04:25.260> when<00:04:25.380> this<00:04:25.470> thing's<00:04:25.680> going

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
look at this so when this thing's going

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.620 
look at this so when this thing's going
man<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.340> air<00:04:26.460> if<00:04:26.610> you're<00:04:26.700> flying<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.030> air

man the air if you're flying the air

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.270 
man the air if you're flying the air
taking<00:04:27.840> all<00:04:27.960> around<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:28.890> know<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.100> winds

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
taking all around you know the winds

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.350 
taking all around you know the winds
probably<00:04:29.400> gonna<00:04:29.640> push<00:04:29.880> I<00:04:30.000> mean<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:30.210> could

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
probably gonna push I mean I could

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.700 
probably gonna push I mean I could
barely<00:04:30.510> push<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:30.990> thing<00:04:31.170> and<00:04:31.260> it<00:04:31.530> pushes

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
barely push this thing and it pushes

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.160 
barely push this thing and it pushes
back<00:04:31.950> forward<00:04:32.400> so<00:04:32.640> here<00:04:33.600> I<00:04:33.630> would<00:04:33.900> recommend

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
back forward so here I would recommend

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.810 
back forward so here I would recommend
is<00:04:34.380> picking<00:04:34.680> up<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:34.950> camera<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.460> hooking<00:04:35.670> it

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
is picking up this camera and hooking it

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.820 
is picking up this camera and hooking it
up<00:04:35.850> again<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.360> works<00:04:36.540> plug<00:04:37.170> and<00:04:37.350> play<00:04:37.530> with<00:04:37.800> a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
up again it works plug and play with a

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.800 
up again it works plug and play with a
little<00:04:38.040> modification<00:04:38.490> again<00:04:39.180> to<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.510> actual

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
little modification again to the actual
