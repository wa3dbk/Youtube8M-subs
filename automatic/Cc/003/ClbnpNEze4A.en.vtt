00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.100
 hello together that Babbel today exists 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.910
 again a camera review today it works 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:19.510
 a sony and quite fresh 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.470
 camera sony alpha 6000 what does this have 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.570
 camera to offer 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.690
 so we have cool in any case 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.640
 thing that it aps-c sensor that is 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.770
 Sensor is as big as most 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.570
 Cameras with coarse factor 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.930
 I'm talking about now 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.000
 mirror cameras not of 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.190
 compact cameras and of course a lot 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.250
 good because noise behavior of this 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.200
 camera is very good i already have 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.399
 difficult lighting conditions 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.630
 Photographed and rushing holds itself 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.930
 really in limits 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:51.460
 I can honestly say so now 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.800
 the camera is safe to 1000 iso 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.600
 which already refers to and which I have 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.579
 actually tried that we at 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.660
 difficult lighting conditions 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.879
 Of course, have taken in camera 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.059
 Of course, that's also very important to raw 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.690
 The cameras handle camera raw well 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.479
 can 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.090
 this photographed in jpeg and the 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.890
 camera raw 6 will of course be internal 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.369
 processed a bit smooth ironed 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.830
 sometimes too much for my idea 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.869
 but if the camera take raw then 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.560
 Of course we can do everything very well 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.439
 Develop the camera has an extreme 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.930
 fast hybrid autofocus so me 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.970
 now just want to do a test 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.330
 I will now a series image function 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.860
 show so strap on that 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.049
 really cool, so I'll take a look 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.740
 which attitudes I do not have 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:46.119
 now dimming area code and I work 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.439
 now with blind we make five iso 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.430
 320 and I'm coming to about 1 now 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.070
 640 goal of the second 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.140
 according to the manufacturer has this camera 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.799
 speed of 11 pictures per 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.990
 second 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.990
 in series mode so now 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.480
 that is really impressive because 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.100
 we actually have something like that here 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.510
 similar to kalaschnikow mode so 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.670
 the term has already been used by others 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.950
 used cameras 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.620
 this is really cool here, though 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.860
 if I is now press play 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.280
 write here on memory card and 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.600
 preview not possible but 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.420
 now that's going on for a few seconds 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.430
 this camera needs the data 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.650
 clearly to write the card because that is 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.380
 every amount of wood we take pictures now 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.020
 in camera raw these are big files and 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.400
 at camera raw we had about 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.130
 20 megapixels nonsense 20 megapixels 20 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.680
 megabyte data and that suits me already 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.720
 very good 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.680
 then there is the following to report 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.450
 So built-in lightning that is one 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.830
 toy 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.960
 I have already photographed with it so 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.210
 built-in lightning that's one anyway 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.640
 little disaster that's what 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.800
 girls taking photos at the parties 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.020
 So that's nothing for real men 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.410
 That's why I'm all the more pleased that 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.390
 I have a shoe and this one 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.430
 Hotshoe already used in the studio 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.340
 So you can with this camera in 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.560
 manual mode is actually absolutely good 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.940
 pictures in the studio make clear that is 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.070
 perfect light conditions 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.730
 we have 100 so we have blender 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.860
 10 the sharpness is terrific and that 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.959
 I am very pleased 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.660
 resolution has this camera 24 3 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.450
 megapixel image relationships are 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.360
 by the way, not like compact cameras 4 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.920
 to 3 but we have two to 3 3 here 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.430
 to 2 depending on the portrait or landscape format 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.170
 and you can also switch to 16 to 9 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.690
 I will not do that because I am 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.820
 find format 2 to 3 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.269
 this is classic thumbnail format and 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.470
 that's great what has this camera yet 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.360
 what others do not have 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.850
 Well, other things like for example 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.620
 flap hinged display that is in 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.780
 okay i miss that bit 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.019
 display can be flipped up 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.359
 but that does not hurt then 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:13.239
 many criticize that this camera no 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.880
 patch sensor has but why so me 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.530
 come here with 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.209
 the whole menu and with two girls what 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.720
 the camera copes very well so we 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.180
 have a back wheel with that and the 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.240
 then we have a wheel here if I have 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.190
 For example, with aperture pre-selection work 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.380
 not at all your blinding waves can down 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.410
 I now for example multifunction 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.510
 For example , we take advice 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.800
 make exposure correction or 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.540
 serial picture or single recording 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.480
 iso setting and so on here so 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.300
 Everything is very fast to reach and 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.740
 I think that's quite good now he asks 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.250
 probably what kind of objective I have 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.280
 now here 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.260
 Of course this camera has a fixed 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.220
 built-in lens so that's now 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.020
 an objectively So one sees please 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.210
 do not touch yes that's all 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.820
 dangerous so the objective thing is me 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.540
 right now that's awesome 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.280
 So that's sigma from the series 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.850
 I already have a video for you 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.760
 shown with a Nikon camera I have 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:20.180
 signal from the series of 35mm tested 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.360
 that is now an objectively 19 mm with 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.460
 Aperture 28 as I said fixed focal length 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.640
 Focusing can be done manually 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.050
 or auto autofocus is extreme 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.460
 I like it very much 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:37.910
 The lens hood is attending as 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.540
 and the most beautiful is 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.250
 this objective costs completely gone i have 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.630
 So three big animals bought so too 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.260
 I will become the other objective later 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.360
 So tell water here 19 mm 28 lies 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.690
 at about 180 euro depending on where you are 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:58.270
 buys almost everything fantastic I have 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:00.020
 So try out images sensor 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.150
 distortions chromatic aberration 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.860
 is really limited 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.870
 we do not have the sharpness only in the 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.760
 middle but also on the edge so I have 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.260
 now, of course, no tests on the test 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.480
 started but i just got it 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.080
 photographed and I'm an artist 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.430
 and no special camera tester 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.040
 I now just the card the 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.700
 photos viewed at 100% magnification 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.580
 and that impresses and the size of the 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.090
 quality 24 megapixel resolution it too 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.070
 Well 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.910
 advantage over the other cameras 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:34.520
 is the many system cameras have 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.220
 only 16 megapixel has 24 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.660
 So that's really quite well what 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.500
 now still objectively determined 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:45.650
 So somehow I have to shake pass 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.180
 but that's all about it now 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.280
 Objectives are so if now the 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.229
 these lenses for the camera one 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.139
 the focal length of sigmar goal is so 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:55.580
 they are all a bit shaky in 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:58.520
 the middle but that does not matter 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.440
 that does not affect the quality and 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.410
 I'm really with the photos 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.090
 very satisfied 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:08.090
 may the camera also has you can 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.300
 control via smartphone or via tablet 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.220
 pc ipad or any android tablet 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.650
 I can do that too later 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:19.039
 but try the first one at the moment 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:22.720
 impression what I have is great 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:25.039
 quality astonishingly fast sharpness 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.350
 other things good that of course with 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:28.940
 objectively also to do that we dramatically 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.000
 have less operation 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:35.240
 fixed focal lengths than zoom lenses 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.690
 and all together for say housing 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.760
 600 euro is really cool thing that 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.110
 now not the last report about 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.360
 this camera will of course still 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.590
 test in more detail and see what 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.840
 can do anything with it 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.729
 yes, but the first impression is very good 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.599
 and I have pictures now 

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:53.240
 displayed 

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:54.169
 Now you have the impression that 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.270
 get a camera 

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:58.669
 So I think there is a lot 

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:01.729
 Potential in it and I'm on more 

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:03.740
 things curious then I would say 

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:05.450
 this spot I say goodbye to 

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.750
 next time, stay healthy and 

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.750
 clean
