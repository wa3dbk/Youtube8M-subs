00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.000 

I<00:00:45.020> think<00:00:46.020> now<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.440> been<00:00:46.590> pushing<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
I think now we have been pushing the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.800 
I think now we have been pushing the
envelope<00:00:47.130> for<00:00:47.700> different<00:00:48.060> genres<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> movies

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
envelope for different genres of movies

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.140 
envelope for different genres of movies
for<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> long<00:00:49.230> time<00:00:49.470> so<00:00:49.800> maybe<00:00:50.130> I<00:00:50.280> think<00:00:50.880> from

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
for a long time so maybe I think from

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.250 
for a long time so maybe I think from
the<00:00:51.240> director's<00:00:51.660> point<00:00:51.810> of<00:00:51.930> view<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.080> going<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the director's point of view is going to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.390 
the director's point of view is going to
feel<00:00:52.410> differently<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.040> think<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.370> us

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
feel differently but I think for us

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.550 
feel differently but I think for us
every<00:00:54.390> new<00:00:54.540> movie<00:00:54.810> is<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.930> new<00:00:55.080> push<00:00:55.350> new
