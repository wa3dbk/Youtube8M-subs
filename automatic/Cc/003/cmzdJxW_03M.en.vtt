 hello youtube friends good in this 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:06.710
 video tutorial I will show you how to stop 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.360
 the time in the game more against the 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.890
 wind first we have to have the 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.070
 check engine any version no 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.710
 matter which version has a lot I have 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:20.380
 6.2 well then we need is the 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:25.270
 egg and put our level 7 level 8 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.650
 let's go first let's open the check in 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.610
 as I said in any version 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.610
 import 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:37.410
 We hope that it will open once 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.590
 open let's go to the option that blinks an 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.380
 computer and we give you in plug in with 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.510
 trainer point etc for what we use and 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.079
 the nothing else I say 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.190
 well now let's go to our level and 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.190
 let's go play 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.780
 we hope good this does not matter to 30 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.200
 seconds will give us in 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.860
 double speed fac in 'speak speed funk 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.940
 matter more pim-pam-pum time here 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.960
 let's see 0 in apli and time 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.420
 it is frozen well you look at it 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.600
 what I'm going to do is not that it's brand page 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.549
 that is well marked 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:26.320
 we are going to teach almost everyone to see this is 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.650
 one of this 7 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:36.750
 two 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:38.520
 222 a plant plant plant more and more 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.870
 and I'm full of faith and I think there's more 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.130
 each 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.130
 and something more 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.490
 now to continue the theater with 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.580
 the time nothing more and nothing less was had 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.980
 to go here and put water and without going to 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.290
 run and eat everything and now we're going to 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.630
 put a plate and it freezes back the 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.939
 good time let's keep doing this 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.489
 is a base is a hack of for the time 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.300
 it's the best because what they can not do 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.300
 would be 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.360
 and we are going to designate all these 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.360
 good 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.769
 good and so on we're going to have 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:32.769
 and we mix it we stopped it back 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.769
 we give to play and we will continue to mark 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.909
 let's wait to mark almost all 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.370
 we continue I do not know I have good 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.490
 this thing I do not know which one 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:57.880
 well, I think so here 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:57.880
 makes one who is 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.959
 Now, look, let's see if it 's 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.959
 6 and we have 6 and it adds 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.830
 friend ten couples 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:19.790
