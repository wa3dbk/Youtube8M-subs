00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.240
 2 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.329
 2012 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:20.429
 m hello to all and welcome to this new studio that will be dedicated touch 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:21.419
 always fashion 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.979
 and today we will see the last part all the mechanically part 

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:26.640
 all the makeup part 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.329
 So here we will open immediately images that interests us 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.769
 the one with which 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.810
 we worked from the beginning 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.770
 we will press the key to be in full screen 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.030
 so you see that there we had arranged in groups 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.640
 what is the most 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.329
 practical to find your eyes but if the skin was all 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.860
 dispatched in it's in these groups 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.690
 the same age is complicated groups 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.060
 just before so just before I believe 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.260
 in the earliest to consider so seems to me so if you have not followed 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.100
 to use a look is very important for storing calculations 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.060
 so the 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.930
 we will return to our photos 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.240
 and we will look a little bit in what we are going to have touched what we are going 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.450
 do it so I can 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.439
 the power that 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.670
 there is still a lot of lip level makeup 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.890
 on the weave of eye-contour jousting on the mobile eyelids and on the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.830
 eyelid a lot for me 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.260
 we are going to tackle I think rather 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.180
 now we will rise 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.780
 so they are already made up 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.280
 I already had a makeup 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.030
 this lunch on the grass 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.380
 but we will be able to accentuate a little 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.770
 dangerous but on the air 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.490
 so for the zoom% and if it's because working 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.820
 on the semester the stylus - it plunges and intimate 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.510
 and for the zoom this clip of very interesting is that pulls me on the 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.270
 spacing bar i'm going to be able to do it right and the mouse is 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.120
 also enough you press the space bar 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.979
 but one hand per shepherd you can 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.850
 move your photo 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.290
 as you see fit 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.830
 so for sure on tools pressed to these practices do you see what you 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.830
 can you walk yours too much photo 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.050
 see a little bit of editing that is to do so we will now 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.160
 always on the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.450
 so if you press the spacebar or bring up its 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.139
 little hands like that and you can see the photo demo 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.879
 6 you press the sfax port the commands on mac 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.510
 you have and little cross that appears so the zoom in 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.800
 his function his mom so you just have to click and then select 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.529
 or with the tip of the stylus rest the end of the century and m 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:35.489
 while staying pressed slipped and is selected amazon who you 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.599
 interested and it surprises you 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.340
 directly roulette paris 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.979
 so to zoom out 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.320
 that will be the key 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.360
 space commands options on mac 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.360
 so these little functions not bad that are really interesting 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.849
 for the time floor and work on his victims 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.749
 so we're going back we're able with m so we're going 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:59.219
 go on the link so I'm playing now on the ranks in a first 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.499
 time we will change the color 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.979
 so we'll make it easier to violate 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.289
 so we start with the mayor we could have started with the eyes full of good 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:09.430
 boxers 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.700
 it does not matter anyway in everything mechanical 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.120
 you can mix all the colors that is of interest to you 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.329
 really do not be embarrassing we do what you want 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.959
 but we're not going to take a look at whether she's raping 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.459
 the glass and with the red in the fight 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.289
 a little montceau 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:30.849
 you can even 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.249
 carved in deliriums it's not embarrassing have fun 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.290
 this is the main one here many seemed to have been heckled 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:38.469
 maquis and slightly 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.249
 so we're just going to accent a little bit 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:43.109
 makeup 10 hours 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.029
 so we position ourselves of course the working layer 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:49.029
 and we'll take a little brush 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:52.729
 we will go more than thin and we will press the key plus the keyboard 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.789
 here are random checks 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.789
 control option I will manage the size of my brush 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.109
 far back and forth 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.759
 m 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.559
 the lips 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.099
 being careful to respect 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.449
 here the area 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.990
 of what is called the art of cupid 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.859
 that is to say right here under the nose 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.859
 that's where swimming is gone 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.969
 once again you have not 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:30.180
 to press penaltouche over the keyboard 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.319
 and that makes you your selection 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.770
 so this selection inside sierre 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.319
 so you can do internet selection from 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.449
 or to press the key 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.449
 damage ellis like uppercase life 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.770
 this is what awaits you a little warned that the selection 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.770
 so we will work well inside this selection is not 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.180
 but not outside so 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.960
 we will apply 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.789
 a hue layer of saturation 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.520
 we will put here 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.439
 on the reds 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:02.610
 the device 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.610
 if you am a little slider 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.959
 change little surprise 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:14.909
 here 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.909
 we will get back on the ground 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.020
 so we can now a little to see 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.349
 for what it gives 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.770
 this complaint 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.770
 Entrance 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.249
 at the 70 ' 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:34.330
 we're going to get back on which was working anna would have created a ride 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.219
 but he said I had a pencil stroke around the greens 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:42.219
 contest is then a little bit 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.870
 so for that we'll take a little more density 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.569
 experienced 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.289
 quite simply 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:52.879
 go around 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.479
 lips 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.479
 just to accentuate that little pencil stroke that is unique 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.509
 around 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:08.009
 here is in brief carney 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.039
 not bad 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.939
 and before closing soon we're going anyway 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:14.770
 created 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.469
 a group 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:19.930
 we will attack geneva 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.110
 and would have slipped 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.839
 all the cases of correspondents 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.479
 in this case to the press was lifted some saturation elves 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.539
 so thank you for having followed all 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.460
 for the next part of the job so all the rest of the makeup that we 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.559
 remains to be done 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:39.900
 in an adjoining room 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.810
 rugby 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.099
 2 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.270
 2012

 even 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.330
 tomorrow 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.740
 even if she 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.830
 m
