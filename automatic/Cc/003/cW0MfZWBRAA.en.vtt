00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
on it battery life on the EVO 4G however

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.080 
on it battery life on the EVO 4G however
is<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> seven<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.100> half<00:00:53.160> hours<00:00:53.550> talktime<00:00:53.789> and

phones also do 1080p HD video recording

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.200 
phones also do 1080p HD video recording
so<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.740> only<00:01:25.890> difference<00:01:25.979> camera<00:01:26.729> wise<00:01:26.909> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
so the only difference camera wise is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.630 
so the only difference camera wise is
that<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.860> galaxy<00:01:28.860> s2<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> little<00:01:29.549> bit

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
that the galaxy s2 is a little bit

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.010 
that the galaxy s2 is a little bit
better<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> front<00:01:30.420> facing<00:01:30.750> camera
