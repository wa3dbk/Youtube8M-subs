00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.719
 hello friends today iphone today 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.230
 let's see a new tweet from cydia in 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.599
 this case is about taj hotels like 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.320
 you want to pronounce it is about 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:26.810
 tweet that we say replaces the 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.730
 disappeared that tweet that no 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.640
 it helped close applications open the 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.110
 multitasking switch to applications 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.489
 switch between applications through everything 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.190
 it by gestures without having to 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.880
 use our home button and that 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.850
 Well, he updated us for new 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.090
 versions of them but in children 8 then 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.880
 we have this this tweet as I tell you 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.470
 call page you have all the information 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.079
 to download it in the blog article 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.390
 and here we are going to see how it works 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.760
 well you can configure many 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.960
 but good, well I'll tell you 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.149
 pretty much the configuration that I 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.129
 I have basic 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.049
 you can configure it so that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.229
 gestures from the bottom of the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.600
 screen you get to launch multitasking 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.789
 if you need without pressing two 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.220
 times on the start button so I have 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.890
 configured that by sliding your finger from 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.729
 bottom up by the bottom 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.770
 right I get multitasking multitasking 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.420
 which is good because I can move like 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.350
 anyone 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.150
 as natively in children 8 can 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.460
 close applications by sliding towards 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.840
 above but I also have the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.630
 possibility to close applications 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.180
 sliding down the sprint if I do 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.619
 that automatically closes all the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.500
 applications when you reopen the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.810
 multitasking because there is nothing 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.530
 we are going to open some application for 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.660
 can continue to show how it works 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.660
 of this week 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.270
 we are going to open applications to be able 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.319
 continue to show the functioning of 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.319
 this tweet 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.350
 for example so 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.000
 and we continue with what more things does 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.340
 details not only allows us 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.830
 access to multitasking but we 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.660
 allows you to close applications so 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.470
 by the same object for example 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.770
 I can close the application and it stays in 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.950
 multitasking but even more so if I 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:40.800
 configured I can do that when I 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:44.350
 I slipped and passed a level directly 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.690
 in the application closes I repeat it 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.840
 so that it is clearer if I 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.000
 just slipped a little bit the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.970
 application closes but the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.300
 multitasking however if I upload more with 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.860
 the finger the application 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.950
 but 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.680
 the application of directly disappears 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.750
 of multitasking that is to say I can with that 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.660
 gesture close it in keep the second 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.040
 flat or is extending the gesture a bit 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.150
 more up and that the application 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.820
 directly closed more but more 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.610
 things we can do with this trick can 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.950
 change application quickly 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.349
 sliding from 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.590
 Right or left of the screen 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.090
 from the edge I can make the gesture of 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.910
 slide from left to right of 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.370
 right to left and change 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.310
 directly from application 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.720
 but if it seems like little, there's still a lot 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.670
 more and is that if I slipped from below 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.170
 up on the left side until 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.060
 now everything was done on the right side 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.190
 if I use below up on the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.019
 left side is g what allows me 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.000
 is to quickly change between 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:59.670
 applications as you see a click 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.280
 absolutely complete that is also 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.780
 fully compatible with the center 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.870
 control is to say how I have 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.900
 configured that the gestures are in the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.390
 bottom right 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.610
 in the lower left if I 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.609
 I gesture d 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.519
 slide from the center I get my 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.069
 control center without needing 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.009
 to have other tweets that modify it 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:29.159
 or anything a highly recommended tweet 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:31.470
 let's say aesthetically, it's not so 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.909
 spectacular as it can be to use 3 but 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.780
 that the truth that is full of 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:40.039
 functions and how good you can 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.039
 set up pretty easy 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.610
 As you can see the configuration menu 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.270
 tahe is within the system setting 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.449
 and we have the option on the one hand 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.669
 to close an application or activate the 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.699
 multitasking that is what I do from 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.060
 the lower right corner 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.039
 the active in this part in screen nerea 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.139
 with figures that area of ​​the screen and 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.810
 what functions do you see I have put 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.270
 in raid in on the right side and led and 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.970
 I have said to close the application and 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.440
 multitasking appears that is to say that I 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.900
 if I lift it closed and if I keep 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.000
 multitasking will appear 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.160
 the theme of animations and what 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.180
 he said to slide the finger more towards 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.740
 up if I make a slip or little 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.990
 closes but stays in the background and 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.300
 if I go up more with my finger then 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.789
 nations directly that is configured 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.139
 here and we can also configure what 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.780
 height 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.660
 we want the application directly 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.100
 closes without being in the background 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.840
 also the option to switch between 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.320
 applications sliding from the edges 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.390
 from the left edge or the edge 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.150
 straight 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.760
 we activate it with how many fingers we want 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.080
 do the sensitivity and the area I do 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.380
 I have configured so that this nothing more 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.510
 that occurs in the upper half part 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.820
 of the screen if I make that gesture in 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.960
 the bottom does not happen anything without 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.090
 However, if I do it at the top 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.580
 Well, as you can see, it allows me to change 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.770
 quickly between the application also 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.410
 we have the option of saying that the 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.150
 keyboard disable this function to 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.550
 avoid good that when typing 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.920
 accidentally we do it and then 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.500
 we have the part of the exchanger 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.500
 rapid of applications ie from the 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.050
 lower left corner is configured 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.430
 in this part I have it as 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:38.340
 You see in the left corner 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.740
 well we can configure the speed and 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.890
 we also have gestures to block the 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.870
 device that I do not have 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:48.390
 disabled and good the general option 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.500
 that the keyboard and disable this 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.200
 application 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.540
 the configuration of what to do when 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.940
 we slide we slide down one 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.890
 application in multitasking I have you 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.860
 configured that when swiping down 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:05.090
 the page the sprint word the page 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.090
 main is to say 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.889
 is all the applications used 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.900
 down all the applications are 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:14.720
 they close 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.630
 and what happens also when he slipped a 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.370
 application any I also have the 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.770
 options that is to remove all the 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.919
 applications remove them from the background 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.570
 and there is the possibility of closing also 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:28.669
 when closing applications that close 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:32.030
 also what is playing in 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:34.130
 the audio player or yes or remove it 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.780
 or not remove it and we can configure a 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.389
 white list of a white list of 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:41.539
 applications so good that all 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:43.220
 let's add here when I close by 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:45.080
 the gesture all the applications those 

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.270
 they will remain open in case there are any 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.610
 application so I know how whatsapp 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:53.000
 or like the one that we do not want that 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:57.229
 never never close page click 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.850
 I already tell you with a multitude of options 

00:07:57.229 --> 00:07:59.720
 the information at present iphone 

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.139
 dot com 

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.139
 until next time
