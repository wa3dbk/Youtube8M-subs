00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.649
 twitter and then several people sent 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.390
 also he asked me to do this 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.280

 playing with a name of him and who knows the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.050
 here in online mode and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.969
 also miss him more than to see the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.739
 fans and many people can have this news 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.960

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.720

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.580
 for him playing with media to toyota 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.939
 represented too much for the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.430
 too many games for nintendo and now go 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.439
 seek the match and try to do better 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.920
 possible homage by reaching the first 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.390
 place and there is satoru's friend o 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.790
 athlete stayed somewhat 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.860
 interesting that the fans created is not 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.509
 It was me who created this friend many fans. 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.939
 available on the internet to be able to 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.340
 simply create it automatically 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.340
 with the name of guatÃ¡ sam querrey and I found it 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.009
 Looked really coby same and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.570
 wear the clothes of the own 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.759
 actors yesterday the character had much 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.710
 baby then we go with a friend or 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.060
 dilute of trying to run on that track 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.189
 beautiful to die did not give 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.079
 choose nothing but ok great car arrives 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.990
 here we go then we have no one 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.850
 with his name but Satan is fine 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.729
 empty most raised equipment 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.140
 Brazilians but ok let's run then 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.270
 dolphins chelsea this little tribute 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.770
 It will not be long until this video comes 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.460
 A little quick actually I do not 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.650
 I intend to 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.960
 the back does not want to create a friend 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.360
 but since this has become a 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.920
 a lot more people asked me to 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.660
 I'm bringing them to the same as yours. 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.970
 like a very simple homage I know 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.340
 which was a great loss with a stone 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.500
 gigantic and a lot of people at those moments 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.630
 begins to remember facts that do not 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.810
 should be remembered many people 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.570
 comments that in fact even before this 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.940
 already said that he himself 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.820
 was one of the guys who started doing with 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.100
 that the nintendo dropped and I do not think so 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.390
 in fact I completely disagree 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.930
 In relation to this I think there is nothing 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.520
 to see 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.490
 and in fact in moments like this the 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.290
 rethink this kind of situation and the 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.510
 good things because he got to be 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.100
 Nintendo president if he can 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.130
 to be president of nintendo lot 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.100
 good he did then and moments was in the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.560
 good things but sometimes it's complicated 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.470
 Sometimes people come always what is 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.880
 Bad but I just ask you to try to see everything. 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.000
 the hard work that I know sometimes 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.740
 cc RTP corrie takes trying 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.970
 make the curve completed accustomed to 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.990
 the entities that haiti it now 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.720
 slow hurts 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.660
 so just to try to see the good things 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.010
 he did it because it is for someone 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.170
 who managed to be president of one of the 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.390
 largest companies in the world and one 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.150
 bigger video games 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.580
 for it is already an extraordinary feat 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.870
 tragedy an incredible feat and people 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.390
 do not notice this people end up 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.520
 ignoring and moses that ignored these 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.160
 facts and good things to transpose 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.350
 company mainly these moments 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.510
 You should not even think that way then. 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.210
 This is a very simple homage. 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.090
 because a lot of people asked for many asked 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.030
 and also many fans are doing it 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.710
 move us here and have several futures 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.690
 who are also doing it out there 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.390
 I did not see many people in Brazil doing more 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.500
 still one second you blew up 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.390
 on the beam 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.510
 I still hope you like it. 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.720
 this small homage even though 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.750
 does not represent 10% of the professional 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.480
 that he was and it was really cool we see 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.970
 the world of games by clicking on 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.710
 relationship was very cool indeed 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.989
 had several companies twitter that 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.360
 companies that 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.990
 do not have to own sony did homage 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.689
 because it is not only the competitor if the being 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.430
 human one person knows will fail marked 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:35.129
 the industry in general competition is something 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.509
 important for the industry and it was very 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.400
 legal see companies do these 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.960
 Honors was really cool even though I 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.000
 I liked it too much, everybody homage 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.879
 Did he think I blew him with him? 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.159
 It was there that he managed to take second 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.960
 so it was a good race for who was 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.849
 very accustomed to online mode 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.539
 especially with the speed of the mode 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.069
 online 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.139
 but this is a really fast video 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.629
 maybe I still have one more video today 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.000
 Maybe if I can post if I have not 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:02.069

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.139
 will who and also the fund to the new 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.419
 mortal kombat is a matter of posting tomorrow 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.979
 it is possibly and also a video you 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.719
 remember if you did not watch also be 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.789
 Do you remember me today, I hope? 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.830
 even if you have enjoyed this 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.949
 video is a video that many of you 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.069
 asked to play with the actors name 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.810
 that many fans created and I only managed 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:24.389
 recreate it here based on what the fans 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.069
 have passed and this if possible let me 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.900
 I liked it down if you did not want it I liked it 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:30.839
 that's no problem, the important thing is 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.270
 Did you like the visa and understood the 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:34.979
 tribute and also if possible let your 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.259

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.270
