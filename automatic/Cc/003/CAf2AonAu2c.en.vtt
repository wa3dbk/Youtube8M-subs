00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
when I put it on the dream when I didn't

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.950 
when I put it on the dream when I didn't
be<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.090> see<00:00:33.210> i'm<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.630> getting

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
be as you can see i'm just getting

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.840 
be as you can see i'm just getting
battered<00:00:34.350> there's<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.160> much<00:00:35.370> better<00:00:35.640> than<00:00:35.790> me

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
battered there's so much better than me

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.869 
battered there's so much better than me
and<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.989> think<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.320> because<00:00:37.440> for<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.129> number<00:00:38.790> of

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and I think it's because for a number of

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.270 
and I think it's because for a number of
fifa's<00:00:39.210> pulled<00:00:39.420> last<00:00:39.600> three<00:00:40.020> before<00:00:40.530> FIFA's<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
fifa's pulled last three before FIFA's I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.709 
fifa's pulled last three before FIFA's I

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.500 
played on my class i'm used to world
class<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.730> you<00:00:44.730> know<00:00:44.850> its<00:00:44.940> difficulty<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
class and you know its difficulty and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.779

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
now to play on it and so then stepping

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.029 
now to play on it and so then stepping
it<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> massive<00:00:49.289> change<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:49.980> me

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
this is a big big step up and this is

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.160 
this is a big big step up and this is
why<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.149> absolutely<00:01:00.600> annihilated

pretty much it was sort of a chip of the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.890 
pretty much it was sort of a chip of the
keeper<00:02:47.100> but<00:02:47.190> now<00:02:47.460> I<00:02:47.490> just<00:02:47.550> hit<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:47.910> normally

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
keeper but now I just hit it normally

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.260

see<00:02:49.620> they<00:02:49.770> cross<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.790> head<00:02:50.910> strike

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
see they cross it in and the head strike

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.630 
see they cross it in and the head strike
it<00:02:51.510> first<00:02:51.750> time<00:02:52.020> really<00:02:52.860> good<00:02:53.070> goal<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.430> at

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
it first time really good goal that at

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.330 
it first time really good goal that at
my<00:02:53.760> house<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.470> NBC<00:02:55.470> elbows<00:02:55.860> tracking<00:02:56.280> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
man and then sort of stopped I thought

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.930 
man and then sort of stopped I thought
he's<00:02:58.320> offside<00:02:58.590> at<00:02:58.770> first<00:02:58.980> but<00:02:59.280> then<00:02:59.459> when<00:02:59.880> you

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
he's offside at first but then when you

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.520 
he's offside at first but then when you
see<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.150> replay<00:03:00.300> wasn't<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.930> just<00:03:01.050> awesome

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
but made it one all and unfortunately we

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.100
