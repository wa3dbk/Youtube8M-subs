00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.610
 welcome in this video we will finish 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.250
 the exercise entitled illumination of 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.740
 interiors using virrey and marx tree 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.110
 this is the second and last part of 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.420
 this tutorial if you have not seen the first 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.720
 video at this time will appear in your 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.510
 screen the link of the first part 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.120
 we started once we separated the floor 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.150
 of the walls we can apply materials 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.970
 independent this tutorial is only 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.220
 focused on lighting, which is why 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.489
 I will explain in detail how to do 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.159
 materials in future tutorials we will see 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.250
 how to create viceroy materials now 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.170
 we create a new material viceroy 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.049
 we will add a bigmac in the diffuse slot 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.839
 so we can add an image to 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:01.870
 use it in texture on the internet we can 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.600
 find many textures should only 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.400
 use an image search engine if they already have 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.280
 a little knowledge of bi right 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.220
 can add reflection to your material if 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.770
 they do not know do not worry later 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.120
 we will deal with this issue since we have the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.620
 material with texture 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.620
 we will proceed to apply it 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.880
 If the texture is distorted, it will not 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.250
 worry to visit the size and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.890
 texture position we will add the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.740
 wornat modifier 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.590
 the type of king will select plane 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.080
 in this menu you can also modify the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.390
 texture size if they want to know 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.490
 more of how to texturize you go to the link that 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.000
 appears on screen 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.710
 once the floor material has been applied 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.960
 we adjust the camera to our liking and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.049
 we do a test render 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.090
 the rendering time will depend on 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.850
 the characteristics of your computer 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.920
 how the result of this is observed 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.150
 test is very similar to that of the image 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.150
 final that we want to achieve 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.490
 and not 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.980
 i 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.900
 the result of this selling is pretty 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.840
 acceptable now I will add some shapes 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.430
 I will apply some colors to see 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.430
 how does light exert on these 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.440
 and 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.170
 and 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.319
 and 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.380
 reuse again 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.200
 and 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.250
 and 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.640
 Y 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.239
 Y 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.530
 Y 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.370
 correct the colors are sent I will add 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.550
 a chair to see how it looks with this 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.550
 illumination 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.370
 now rendering is only the region 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.370
 to see the result of the chair 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.380
 and 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.810
 Y 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.720
 Y 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.789
 the final clock is quite acceptable 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.949
 to improve the quality of reflections and 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.229
 shadows we will have to increase the 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.259
 subdivisions in shadow parameters 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.509
 materials should always keep in mind 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.060
 that the more subdivisions the better 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:15.419
 quality will have surrender but it will take 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.229
 more in rendering this tutorial has 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.449
 finalized 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.810
 if it can help you I invite you to 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.729
 subscribe and share it with your friends 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.729
 in this way the channel will continue to grow 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:30.650
 and you will continue learning do not forget 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.650
 subscribe until next time
