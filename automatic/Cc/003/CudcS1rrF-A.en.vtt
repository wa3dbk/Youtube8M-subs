00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.210 
I didn't put knife only in the title
because<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.759> believe<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.060> got<00:00:30.210> eight<00:00:30.950> c4<00:00:31.950> kills

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.630 
because I believe I got eight c4 kills
and<00:00:32.960> I<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:34.560> some<00:00:34.980> people<00:00:35.130> don't<00:00:35.370> really<00:00:35.520> like

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
some of the situations I really didn't

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.810 
some of the situations I really didn't
need<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> c4<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.710> used<00:00:47.040> it<00:00:47.220> to<00:00:47.280> make<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
need the c4 I just used it to make the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.090 
need the c4 I just used it to make the
gameplay<00:00:48.060> a<00:00:48.240> little<00:00:48.420> bit<00:00:48.540> faster<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.170> I'll

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
gameplay a little bit faster and I'll

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.500 
gameplay a little bit faster and I'll
try<00:00:50.220> to<00:00:50.250> point<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.580> out<00:00:50.640> when<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.880> see<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.270> but

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
try to point that out when I see it but

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.760 
try to point that out when I see it but
there<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.110> point<00:00:52.290> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> game<00:00:52.560> where<00:00:52.740> I

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
there is one point of the game where I

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.320 
there is one point of the game where I
just<00:00:52.830> killed<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.220> guy<00:00:53.310> c-4<00:00:53.790> just<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.300> I

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
just killed the guy c-4 just because I

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.760 
just killed the guy c-4 just because I
make<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.720> game<00:00:54.900> a<00:00:54.930> little<00:00:55.110> bit<00:00:55.290> more<00:00:55.350> faster

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
make the game a little bit more faster

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.510 
make the game a little bit more faster
paced<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:57.060> didn't<00:00:57.750> want<00:00:57.900> to<00:00:58.400> make<00:00:59.400> this

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
paced and I didn't want to make this

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.790 
paced and I didn't want to make this
game<00:00:59.700> really<00:00:59.880> slow<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.540> there<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.080> a<00:01:01.110> lot<00:01:01.560> of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
game really slow so there is a lot of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.640 
game really slow so there is a lot of
cuts<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.240> rounded<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.990> think<00:01:04.470> eight

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
cuts this is rounded I think eight

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.640 
cuts this is rounded I think eight
minute<00:01:05.100> nuclear<00:01:05.810> of<00:01:06.810> course<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.229> knife<00:01:07.380> only

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
minute nuclear of course it's knife only

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.929 
minute nuclear of course it's knife only
okay<00:01:07.830> there<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.070> eight<00:01:08.220> right<00:01:08.400> there<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.820> could

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
okay there are eight right there I could

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:09.800 
okay there are eight right there I could
have<00:01:09.180> killed<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> guy<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> knife
