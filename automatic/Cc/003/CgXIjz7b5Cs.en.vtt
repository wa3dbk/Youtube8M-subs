00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 if guys has leaked a trailer 2 of 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 the mobile ticket movie then 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.540
 you follow us we had nothing because this is going to 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.849
 be like two parts first let's 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.580
 watch the video reaction because I've already recorded 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.279
 seeing him and then already investigate about 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.160
 the translation all that and then already 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.660
 we can see what it says and what it is 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.689
 what ties you the trailer good to be 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.039
 explained because it's not the official 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.619
 so first what do you think if we go 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.679
 to watch the trailer quickly and then 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.079
 we comment what's up with everything that's 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.520
 happening here 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.320
 ok I saw that the video is too short 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.450
 and only lasts for 30 seconds so 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.350
 I think this is going to be too fast 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.350
 let's see what wave 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:50.960
 bolton happens that is like nando 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:55.230
 closed with his yasky harangues 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:59.900
 that is if they give agonizing a note 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:04.210
 with egg egg there something happened 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.210
 and that a committee that 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.420
 the band so clear 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.710
 God 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.920
 I ask my partner at the end they saw that 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.610
 can not be 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.610
 okay 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.510
 yes they lived my reaction because yes 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.100
 like wow what's up and how the video is not 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.960
 of very good quality almost not heard 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.420
 nothing then I started to investigate 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.920
 because I can not fall like that with nothing 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.300
 see the images without knowing what it is that 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.330
 they say the characters please do not thing 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.150
 I could not then a boy and they know the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.369
 who lives in japan dato font and the very 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.009
 Kindly shown with what he says and 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.479
 If you want to see the video, I'll leave it 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.400
 the description career to go to 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.619
 see how he says it also explain 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.840
 pretty good and so what it says 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.930
 it's practically already you know, you know what it is 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.080
 the sensei of gross because gross has the 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.670
 radio element the button like as 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.680
 you know then obviously what 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.479
 better teacher than those who know him 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.700
 maybe that it plays a role like the one 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.650
 did and adjacent and with the route then 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.550
 that's not how it's done in 73 as it was 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.690
 here it almost happened is like as a teacher 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.730
 personalized or something like that and well 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.500
 we see that he gives it continues with the sharing 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.030
 undone took and has not developed the 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.160
 I think that our film is already 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.110
 developed the next if not that 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.460
 the three of them that I think will be like 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.560
 the evolution of it 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.050
 he does not get along very well with his father 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.050
 I think he still does not forgive him 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.060
 trip he made with respect to the genes 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.280
 from karen that we are seeing the manga that 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.620
 if your logical mother or something like that we're going to 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.510
 see is the time passes but I think 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.040
 that there he will be giving him programs that 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.840
 there is you and how long may not 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.150
 I said it about the mission I had 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.380
 what to do with kaguya then how do you 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.060
 can you give an explanation then 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.670
 closed think the worst and that's why 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.920
 like they do not get along so well but 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.080
 another side in the trailer one will 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.960
 We saw that she wants to impress 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.000
 Naruto then I think it takes super 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.100
 well with him he admires him and what he wants 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.590
 become like him then I 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.210
 I think at some point in some other 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.090
 if it is that we wanted to let us see 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.580
 surely she is going to become the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.280
 eighth or maybe in the ninth shit and 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.650
 that one that waves with what minutes is 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.260
 as well as agonizing and it turns out that in 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.270
 the translation he says as well as you know that 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.060
 I leave everything to you as well as I already 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.680
 I can not keep fighting, I 'm already like 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.540
 that I am no longer here as in my senses 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.160
 so I think that there he defeated 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.230
 that has a failure I do not know if it had 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.019
 put in weird 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.060
 because of everything that happens in Cairo 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.470
 the best and not and really well you will 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.000
 were the goats and now you know that 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.670
 have to take care of some things 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.860
 or maybe yes to the one that really is 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.440
 entrusting is to his rough son that I 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.209
 I think it goes around more because 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.129
 something courteous can no longer with him because 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.019
 we know that it also does not take very 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.629
 well with your child then there is no longer 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.430
 that neither closed or abortion is for god and 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.379
 if it is the experience in that as well as wah 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.220
 wah wah when was the gross explosion 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.319
 there 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.060
 saski the way they go as well as on camera 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.280
 slow you know it's the one that goes and saves 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.140
 gross and definitely he never never 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.790
 do you have your arm new to 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.109
 simply the they remain one 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.780
 and I think if you're going to stay for the whole 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.180
 eternity and that one with mitsubishi its 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.100
 can I draw like that or here 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.780
 definitely to whoever looks like 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.580
 brooch bigger or it really looks like 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.820
 the top we do not know that he is the only 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.100
 that can as well as 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.640
 long body parts as well as wow 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.000
 then this goes as much to notice of 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.330
 that maybe it's like I do not know a relative 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.070
 of him or someone who has his genes or 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.360
 be of your same plan because you never hear 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.370
 We knew where the night came from most 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.260
 generally it was not like the others if not 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.660
 you saw the village its skin color was 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.460
 super different then we never knew 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.520
 nothing of its origin can this boy 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.710
 come from that village where he came from 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.720
 came the summary or have something to do with 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.670
 he does not believe and well if nice says he's going 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.840
 to overcome his father that is already so 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.820
 as as of what is something antiquated and 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.040
 really gross you ask those who 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.620
 in soul those of the fairies wondered 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.420
 how is it that his father did to overcome 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.460
 everything that the law did then 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.190
 he responds like that with a face like that because 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.650
 you ask yourself and no, you can not 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.570
 getting the last picture touched me 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.220
 pretty if they remember if they remember 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.230
 when you know how nice they were going to fight you 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.220
 against killing in the fourth war 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.220
 ninjas as well 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:36.899
 we will do it then today that image well 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:40.019
 as a vehicle that is as much as 

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:42.569
 no boom boom boom that was that was 

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:44.009
 something here in made me like this after 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.349
 obviously from here we already saw something very 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.789
 important and that naturally I do not know I think 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.889
 who lost the powers of recognize and 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.979
 why do not you see the spheres behind 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.719
 as we saw in the the in the war 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.879
 then I think that nothing else in the mode 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:59.369
 than locating them in sewing mode can 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:00.809
 it unless it is really why because if 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:03.299
 the seclusion in picks up some of those 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:04.319
 powers when they sealed the cabuya because 

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:05.999
 remember that is what 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.089
 I definitely had to wake up 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:11.729
 come to force or yes or yes because I had 

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:13.589
 already the study the abandonment loves because he 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.939
 he gave them to him then I think he 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:17.489
 yes I was going to wake them up if I was not going to 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:18.959
 wake up definitely and I think that 

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:20.639
 it was not like so much for the power of and 

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:23.069
 easy asses recognize in power 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.049
 of the yin but it was to oil 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:27.659
 charge already and when they returned their powers 

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:30.179
 to the vehicle when they were given 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:31.979
 this lady goddess the goddess rabbit 

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:33.479
 so I think you have to take the 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.930
 powers of both adults with bags that 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.610
 but how 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.650
 those that I woke up do not come on their own 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.270
 so I think that's why it's the middle 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.030
 now there are three people who no longer have 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.060
 the spheres as well as the back ones I do not know 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:47.970
 for this it was very very interesting or 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.310
 be I want to see complete decay and 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.930
 does not estimate that in Japanese the voice is not 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.310
 so that Mexico comes will be like a 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.500
 finished again maybe until 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.000
 December if it is good that we are going then 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.639
 I do not know I'll be very 30 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.020
 obviously we are going to support a lot so that 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.030
 with meager faith bring it back 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.400
 so I do not know, I do not know, you have to be at 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.690
 pending and well I already had as 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.280
 I really want to practice it with 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.490
 you because really yes it was like very 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.099
 exciting and I'm like this very very very 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.690
 happy for everything that comes and many 

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:17.340
 thanks for watching with me I hope that you 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.840
 have liked the video reaction with the 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.940
 theories included I did it all in one 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.120
 only video but irrationally if it is 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.680
 just as it is authentic because you already 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.570
 They saw my faces when they met 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.340
 reaction thank you very much for everything 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.509
 remember that is until we enter 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.750
 the next 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:32.750
 bye
