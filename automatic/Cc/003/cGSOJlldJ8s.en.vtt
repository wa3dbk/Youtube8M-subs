too<00:01:07.770> much<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.610> does<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.780> mix<00:01:10.170> with

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
too much because it does really mix with

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.020 
too much because it does really mix with
in<00:01:10.619> really<00:01:10.979> well<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.549> will<00:01:11.729> give<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
in really well and it will give it a
