00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:13.709
 let's see briefly the operation and the possible utilities of the books 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.140
 Virtuals created with mastery within the educational world 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.970
 As you can see this is a virtual book created for an institute of 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.869
 secondary education 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.910
 and it has a main page which welcomes the user and is 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.649
 explain briefly the instructions for using the virtual book 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.940
 on this right page we have an index of the chapters do not have 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.110
 what to be absolutely related to each other 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.200
 in such a way that the reading of the names supposes the reading of the bond 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.740
 They do not have to be the same if they hurry me and the same teacher 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.360
 However, if we consider it convenient to have a virtual book for all the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.820
 center in such a way that the subjects are mixed 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 and in some way the interrelation between the contents that explain 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.369
 let's see some of the chapters 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.060
 starting with this the medieval castles for example that is obviously 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.990
 of social sciences 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.409
 we have a page in production in which the professor teacher in this case 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.060
 who has created the chapter in some way welcomes the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.520
 students and explain to them how absolute detail is what is 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.600
 wait for them 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.930
 is currently what they have to do 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.140
 it is convenient and percent and invest 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.490
 enough time to make a detailed description 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.549
 and that will save us a lot of time after the arc 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.010
 let's see some of the articles 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.640
 As you can see, the students had to select an illustrative image of their 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.040
 article write your article based on information that had 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.510
 previously found 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.830
 on the internet, books are sneaked in the library 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.840
 and all this entails a job of selection 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.540
 handling 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.260
 of very important information to develop literacy 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.210
 information that we believe is absolutely essential in the 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.309
 concerts 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:16.579
 we will come back 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.579
 to the index to have some other chapter 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:21.969
 for example 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.129
 hong 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.129
 p this is the English department 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.459
 here the students have to according to crisma 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.069
 It is very basic 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.170
 but somehow it's very motivating for the students 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:44.549
 the fact that what they publish 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.579
 it is immediately visible 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.229
 and also accessible to a huge number of people 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.879
 they are very aware of the immense number of users who can access 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.879
 these contents 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.589
 when they announce images this is from the department of plastic education 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.059
 and in this case, it was about the students performing 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.569
 An illustrative image of the concept that Andalusia has of them 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.729
 some techniques that were explained to him 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:27.719
 in classes 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.319
 of plastic with respect to 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.299
 digital image processing 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.189
 the result is very colorful and the students were really 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.659
 excited 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.659
 with what they had learned and above all with the possibility of showing 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:45.409
 world 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.409
 in this way so seen 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.759
 we return to the index 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:57.879
 and now what we are going to do is see another book different in this case 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:04.879
 is a book believes that as visibly happy different is more modern 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.999
 andrÃ©s times of different interpreters 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.829
 This version is a bit more modern, so 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:17.129
 that the inclusion of multimedia elements such as this one is also allowed 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.779
 boc and that feels here 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.400
 that moves and that you can also 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.189
 can play a sound 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.219
 3 your style the game had fugitive 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.180
 as you see 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.249
 It is very easy to do it 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.249
 and it is very attractive and attractive for pedestrians 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.740
 and in this case they are second of that 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.229
 and they had to write a small article 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.800
 about his favorite musicians 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.800
 obviously in English 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.789
 this type of work we consider that 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:04.629
 they are really motivating for the students they realize very 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.699
 soon that if we ask them for a job 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.699
 for example it is the same as the favorite pocico 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:16.279
 as much as possible is that we finish enough time to correct it and good 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.779
 You can even finish the garbage can or on a shelf 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.159
 asleep however it is otherwise 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.710
 It is very different because 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.110
 they know you're a job 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.090
 they are immediately available to anyone but I want to see if what 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.090
 can show their family and friends 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.659
 and good for them is relevant and that changes everything in this case are about 100 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.699
 interviews we do every year to tourists in the city center 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.859
 and that it is very motivating for students to check creek that the level 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.669
 of language management 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.189
 they are acquiring that allows them to communicate with people of others 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:02.189
 countries 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.680
 and well I think this is all then what we are going to do is and 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.600
 sprinkle 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.390
 see how an article would be published in this same chapter a student 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.320
 type to enter and here would push the write button 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:24.479
 after which he would have to put his name 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.669
 I'm going to put the stamp 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.900
 select an image from your hard drive 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.919
 I would have had dinner 21 anyone I do not know the worst way out 

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:39.499
 I put the title 

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:42.499
 yes 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:49.599
 in mind in anticipated story for what the article is written 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.139
 good for a very short space she 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.550
 let's suppose that this conscious or consented to own 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.139
 that is not the case but moss 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:03.189
 by ap the judge 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.189
 I only need to send the article 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.819
 this always takes a little bit of time while the image goes up to the 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:16.529
 server 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:19.529
 Now we can click to go back to the virtual book 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:23.899
 and we would see how the article we just published 

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:27.909
 that is first on the list 

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:32.860
 and here we have the final result 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.860
 As you can see, it's really easy to do 

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:42.229
 hinwil motive of unemployment students so we strongly recommend that 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:44.399
 use it your houses 

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.159
 I think we can
