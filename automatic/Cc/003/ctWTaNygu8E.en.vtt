you'll notice that there's the acoustics

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:44.969 
you'll notice that there's the acoustics
are<00:00:43.719> different<00:00:44.050> so<00:00:44.199> your<00:00:44.319> amp<00:00:44.589> will<00:00:44.739> sound

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:44.979 
are different so your amp will sound

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.489 
are different so your amp will sound
different<00:00:45.089> what<00:00:46.089> this<00:00:46.269> is<00:00:46.449> for<00:00:46.719> is<00:00:46.780> this<00:00:47.140> this

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:47.499 
different what this is for is this this

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:50.489 
different what this is for is this this
adjusts<00:00:48.190> all<00:00:48.909> of<00:00:49.300> your<00:00:49.479> presets<00:00:50.319> you've

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
adjusts all of your presets you've

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:51.569 
adjusts all of your presets you've
already<00:00:50.679> made<00:00:50.890> so<00:00:51.069> you<00:00:51.129> don't<00:00:51.280> have<00:00:51.370> to<00:00:51.460> go

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
already made so you don't have to go

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.000 
already made so you don't have to go
through<00:00:51.850> every<00:00:52.690> individual<00:00:53.289> one<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.499> tweak

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
through every individual one and tweak

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.840 
through every individual one and tweak
them<00:00:54.190> you<00:00:55.030> can<00:00:55.210> do<00:00:55.839> that<00:00:56.219> generally<00:00:57.219> by

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
them you can do that generally by

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:05.880 
them you can do that generally by
tweaking<00:00:58.839> the<00:00:59.909> global<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.989> you<00:01:05.140> have<00:01:05.260> a<00:01:05.500> big

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
tweaking the global so if you have a big

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.820 
tweaking the global so if you have a big
stage<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.990> reverbs<00:01:07.990> a<00:01:08.200> little<00:01:08.440> too<00:01:08.620> much

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
stage and the reverbs a little too much

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.160 
stage and the reverbs a little too much
you<00:01:09.070> can<00:01:10.500> kill<00:01:11.500> it<00:01:11.590> -<00:01:12.550> it<00:01:12.780> bump<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:13.930> back<00:01:14.140> a

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
you can kill it - it bump it back a

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.810 
you can kill it - it bump it back a
little<00:01:14.410> bit<00:01:14.590> or<00:01:14.650> if<00:01:14.860> it's<00:01:15.130> not<00:01:15.310> enough<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:15.790> can

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
little bit or if it's not enough you can

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.920 
little bit or if it's not enough you can
you<00:01:16.420> can<00:01:16.600> bump<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:16.930> up<00:01:17.910> so<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.390> same<00:01:19.570> thing<00:01:19.750> is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
you can bump it up so the same thing is

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.630 
you can bump it up so the same thing is
here<00:01:20.080> we<00:01:20.110> have<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.530> store<00:01:20.890> manager<00:01:21.010> trouble

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
here we have a store manager trouble

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:29.100 
here we have a store manager trouble
here<00:01:21.820> log<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.720> in<00:01:22.870> whatever<00:01:24.120> so<00:01:27.870> this<00:01:28.870> is<00:01:29.080> a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
here log you in whatever so this is a

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.900 
here log you in whatever so this is a
212<00:01:30.150> combo<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:34.450> I<00:01:34.570> say<00:01:35.080> head<00:01:35.440> -<00:01:36.250> take<00:01:36.460> if<00:01:36.700> it

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
212 combo so if I say head - take if it

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:44.010 
212 combo so if I say head - take if it
is<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.240> 212<00:01:37.800> combo<00:01:41.400> well<00:01:42.400> I'm<00:01:42.910> going<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.390> I'm

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
is a 212 combo well I'm going to I'm

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.870 
is a 212 combo well I'm going to I'm
just<00:01:44.200> going<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.380> run<00:01:44.920> through<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.280> presets

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
just going to run through the presets

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.590 
just going to run through the presets
I've<00:01:46.090> made<00:01:47.050> up<00:01:47.290> because<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:48.310> can't<00:01:48.640> go<00:01:49.270> through

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
I've made up because I can't go through

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.320 
I've made up because I can't go through
all<00:01:49.660> of<00:01:49.870> these<00:01:50.350> because<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.920> would<00:01:51.160> take<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.580> lot

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
all of these because it would take a lot

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.899 
all of these because it would take a lot
longer<00:01:52.600> than<00:01:52.810> 10<00:01:53.110> minutes<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.790> so<00:01:55.390> I'm<00:01:56.909> gonna

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
longer than 10 minutes and so I'm gonna

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.480 
longer than 10 minutes and so I'm gonna
briefly<00:01:58.390> run<00:01:59.200> through<00:01:59.260> these<00:01:59.650> handful<00:02:00.340> of

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
briefly run through these handful of

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:10.070 
briefly run through these handful of
settings<00:02:00.820> I've<00:02:01.000> made<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.330> up

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.660 

yeah<00:02:11.280> massive<00:02:12.280> volume<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.900> quite<00:02:13.900> touchy<00:02:14.670> so

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
yeah massive volume is quite touchy so

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.020 
yeah massive volume is quite touchy so
you<00:02:15.760> don't<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:17.020> don't<00:02:17.110> want<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.350> crank<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:18.030> at

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
you don't you don't want to crank it at

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.590 
you don't you don't want to crank it at
first<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.630> want<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:21.310> touch<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.300> little

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.530 

the<00:02:32.530> guitar<00:02:33.010> I'm<00:02:33.190> gonna<00:02:33.910> be<00:02:34.060> playing<00:02:34.330> through

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
the guitar I'm gonna be playing through

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.430 
the guitar I'm gonna be playing through
is<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:36.280> Sala<00:02:36.550> -<00:02:36.880> seven<00:02:37.569> string<00:02:37.930> I've

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
is this the Sala - seven string I've

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.610 
is this the Sala - seven string I've
named<00:02:38.950> Frank<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:40.780> more<00:02:40.989> of<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.140> Franken

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
named Frank it's more of a Franken

00:02:41.620 --> 00:03:16.619 
named Frank it's more of a Franken
string

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.199 

so<00:03:17.629> you<00:03:18.379> can<00:03:18.470> get<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.590> relatively<00:03:19.459> clean

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
so you can get a relatively clean

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.170 
so you can get a relatively clean
channel<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:21.189> nice<00:03:22.189> and<00:03:22.220> warm<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.060> smooth<00:03:25.180> wall

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
channel it nice and warm and smooth wall
