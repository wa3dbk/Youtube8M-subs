 wee 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.430
 U 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.570
 U 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.300
 U 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.830
 U 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.860
 U 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.610
 U 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:34.930
 What is that white and a very bright future, may postpone this case resolved willed 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:40.270
 If it works as a positive element, it will be a bright future. 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:43.150
 However, if serious problems arise due to a minor accident 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:48.340
 It could be the end or the future. 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:53.559
 So forget about the new recovery was sseudeon Shima, Japan in March last year 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.550
 The issue triggered by the issue became the largest in the planning of our exhibition 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.330
 The concept 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:04.030
 We are witnesses to daily life in the near feature and there 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:09.610
 200 yards are really just useful energy in the state of bread 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:14.229
 This is the same thing I get when I take it with my thoughts, 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:19.630
 Furthermore , when such a serious problem such as establishment 1 occurred, 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:22.240
 Audience this problem would be how to bond further five days the exhibition 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.150
 Management has a variety of stories 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.150
 I'm going to use it to deliver 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150
 U 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 U 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:45.010
 The characteristic of a talisman's work 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:46.510
 European motor control shot back plants that have the majority of the very human life 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:52.510
 It's close. 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:58.030
 Here it means the two nuclear power plants in the country that there is a risk of one 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:02.680
 Around which the number of nuclear power in order to make possible a very distant 0 ideology 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.990
 Be careful if you give it becomes a fit yoga on a beautiful culinary culture I 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:10.030
 A space where you can live your life 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:14.050
 We can do these things together. 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:21.040
 Has a role in useful and beautiful places 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:22.360
 What we see right behind is the shape of the nuclear power plant. 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.550
 It's different. 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.420
 There is always the main reason that you can enjoy the example of cultural space health 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.870
 Play space 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:36.790
 By creating a common space, people came to visit. 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:40.299
 Next, these people come to the nearest nuclear power plant and enjoy 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:45.430
 Also, because the leisure culture itself is enjoyed 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:50.980
 The fact that nuclear power plants have no human 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:53.820
 Who saw that the work can be very urban and externally took the fourth 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.820
 I can do the work. 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.120
 o 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.129
 And it is the work of 4 cut cancer students 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:14.569
 In the case of three fishermen in the case of Japan, Japan Stalker 9 Shima Nuclear Power Generation Document 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:19.219
 I started shooting in 1997 . 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:24.739
 So masem'll taste this work during recovery to occur someday buy now 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:26.719
 Place one of the jjikeotdeon achieve unfolding picture that came with the post-March 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.129
 After 10 days I woke up 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:36.169
 Now , downloading the body of the earth in the land of death has changed to 30 kilometers of the area 5 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.980
 The 40-kilometer-long photo of the dirt and the dirt is now on the stand. 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:41.689
 There is 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.650
 What high school students did for the first time after the Fukushima nuclear accident 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.849
 It is work. 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.750
 As you can see, this work turns into a place where people can not live after the accident. 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.669
 Abandoned 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:57.709
 But still this beautiful sunflower tteudeon to death by his life 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:04:01.790
 So let me know that after the accident happened, 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.769
 Because they can not live in Greece , 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.180
 I can not live in the area 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.739
 Even after the disappearance of humans such as old e Nature 2 and So 4 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.819
 It's still here. 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:17.819
 By the way, sunflowers are going to take their lives now. 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.819
 U 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.570
 U 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.020
 Korea Zhengzhou ah writer saw a little perspective from abroad at the same cooperation that writer 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:35.539
 I'm out. 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:39.110
 For example, all nuclear power plants in Europe are almost as if they come from nuclear power plants . 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:43.759
 Let the stories open through the chimney. 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:50.900
 But for Korea, the multicolored power plant is in the sea. 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:51.830
 Unlike in Europe, nuclear power plants are more 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.440
 Only 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:05:03.169
 Then I got rattling around in a nuclear power plant in South Korea a substantial portion of radiation 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:08.510
 The fact is that it can be contaminated. Several nuclear power plants in Korea 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:12.949
 Surrounded by floors and residents swimming in these places and holding seashells in these places 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:18.380
 That's how we take meat and actually eat it. 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:23.000
 When this happens, we can accumulate radioactivity in our bodies 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:26.030
 The danger that there is no other way to do it. 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.130
 It is common to work that you want to show 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:35.840
 Uh, which shares close Herring in Korea and nuclear shrinkage live 4 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:41.180
 It is the most representative of the mountainous people who show signs of humor. 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:45.889
 What if people living around nuclear power plants are more stable than living outside 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:50.510
 And the heat that can live to some extent leaves the place on the road . 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:51.500
 So , the person with the majority of them will be leaving the master and know the danger. 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:57.199
 Because 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:06:02.539
 But the people who bought Choi Jun-hee still remain, 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:05.990
 No choice but to love intensely paradoxical to some drab writer 3 groups 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:07.990
 You can see such a work that you are showing 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.990
 U 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:31.610
 Thank you.
