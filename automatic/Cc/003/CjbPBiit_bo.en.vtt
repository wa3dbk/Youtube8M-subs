00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
I guess 2010 volkswagen jetta turbo

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.950 
I guess 2010 volkswagen jetta turbo
diesel<00:00:13.950> now<00:00:14.610> what<00:00:14.790> I'm<00:00:14.880> hoping<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.690> lot

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
diesel now what I'm hoping is that a lot

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.570 
diesel now what I'm hoping is that a lot
of<00:00:15.990> people<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.619> maybe<00:00:17.010> heard<00:00:17.220> about<00:00:17.400> that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
of people have maybe heard about that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.800 
of people have maybe heard about that
Biff<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.000> lot<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.180> people<00:00:18.300> haven't<00:00:18.690> heard

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
Biff and a lot of people haven't heard

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.060 
Biff and a lot of people haven't heard
about<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.140> hope<00:00:19.320> they<00:00:19.470> stay<00:00:19.680> tuned<00:00:19.890> for

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
about that I hope they stay tuned for

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.019 
about that I hope they stay tuned for
this<00:00:20.160> video<00:00:20.400> because<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.580> think<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:20.850> going<00:00:20.970> to

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
this video because I think it's going to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.630 
this video because I think it's going to
be<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.359> very<00:00:21.810> educational<00:00:22.470> experience<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.490> say

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
be a very educational experience to say

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.529 
be a very educational experience to say
the<00:00:23.670> least<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:24.449> really<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:25.529> really

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
the least I'm really really really

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.419 
the least I'm really really really
infatuated<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:28.050> guess<00:00:28.260> I've<00:00:28.529> become

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
infatuated I guess I've become

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.429 
infatuated I guess I've become
infatuated<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:30.359> turbo<00:00:30.810> diesel<00:00:31.140> technology

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
infatuated with turbo diesel technology

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.979 
infatuated with turbo diesel technology
and<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.550> didn't<00:00:32.850> necessarily<00:00:33.030> really<00:00:33.630> start

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and it didn't necessarily really start

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.160 
and it didn't necessarily really start
with<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:35.280> turbo<00:00:35.550> diesel<00:00:36.030> jetta<00:00:36.239> now<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> term

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
with the turbo diesel jetta now the term

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.500 
with the turbo diesel jetta now the term
of<00:00:37.260> these<00:00:37.380> two<00:00:37.500> JK<00:00:37.829> mout<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.340> wasn't<00:00:38.730> super<00:00:39.210> hot

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
of these two JK mout I wasn't super hot

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.510 
of these two JK mout I wasn't super hot
on<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.780> until<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.140> watched<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.649> 24<00:00:41.100> hour<00:00:41.219> series

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
on it until I watched the 24 hour series

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.940 
on it until I watched the 24 hour series
in<00:00:41.760> lamont<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.690> talks<00:00:42.899> about<00:00:43.079> audi<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
in lamont but it talks about audi and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.400 
in lamont but it talks about audi and
howdy<00:00:44.640> had<00:00:44.940> dominated<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.870> last<00:00:46.020> two<00:00:46.260> times

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
howdy had dominated the last two times

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.770 
howdy had dominated the last two times
they<00:00:46.649> won<00:00:46.890> off<00:00:47.070> turbo<00:00:47.550> diesel<00:00:47.879> technology<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
they won off turbo diesel technology and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.410 
they won off turbo diesel technology and
I<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:49.980> turbo<00:00:50.340> diesel<00:00:50.670> gets<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.910> very<00:00:51.149> very

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
I think turbo diesel gets a very very

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.119 
I think turbo diesel gets a very very
bad<00:00:51.629> rap<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.320> people<00:00:52.860> don't<00:00:52.980> really

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
bad rap and people don't really

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.319 
bad rap and people don't really
understand<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:53.910> really<00:00:54.090> all<00:00:54.180> about

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
understand what it's really all about

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.819 
understand what it's really all about
and<00:00:54.629> that's<00:00:54.719> why<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> want<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> talk<00:00:55.440> about<00:00:55.469> this

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
and that's why I want to talk about this

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.380 
and that's why I want to talk about this
today<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.460> finally<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.329> know

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
today because I finally get it I know

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.029 
today because I finally get it I know
what<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:57.840> about<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:58.620> hoping<00:00:58.890> that

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039

all that i think that all of them for

volkswagen jetta though because from a

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.800 
volkswagen jetta though because from a

price point perspective it's the most

most for your money i think it's the

DSG<00:03:48.979> transmission<00:03:49.449> which<00:03:50.449> I<00:03:50.659> think<00:03:51.109> that

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
DSG transmission which I think that

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.929 
DSG transmission which I think that
again<00:03:51.919> I've<00:03:52.129> now<00:03:52.430> stressed<00:03:52.819> that

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
again I've now stressed that

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.399 
again I've now stressed that
transmission<00:03:53.419> on<00:03:53.599> three<00:03:53.840> different<00:03:53.989> cars<00:03:54.229> I

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
transmission on three different cars I

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:55.659 
transmission on three different cars I
think<00:03:54.650> part<00:03:54.889> of<00:03:54.949> the<00:03:55.069> problem<00:03:55.099> is<00:03:55.340> I'm<00:03:55.519> not

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
think part of the problem is I'm not

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.039 
think part of the problem is I'm not
stressing<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.180> value<00:03:56.509> of<00:03:56.599> that<00:03:56.720> transmission

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
stressing the value of that transmission

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.379 
stressing the value of that transmission
and<00:03:57.439> I<00:03:57.500> I'm<00:03:57.979> kind<00:03:58.250> of<00:03:58.340> set<00:03:58.609> i<00:03:58.639> almost<00:03:59.180> wish<00:03:59.269> i

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
and I I'm kind of set i almost wish i

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.689 
and I I'm kind of set i almost wish i
could<00:03:59.540> redo<00:03:59.780> those<00:03:59.900> videos<00:04:00.290> but<00:04:01.069> basically

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:01.699
