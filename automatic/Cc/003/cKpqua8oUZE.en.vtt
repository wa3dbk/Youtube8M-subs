yeah you could have made Google we could

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.480 
yeah you could have made Google we could
have<00:01:27.659> made<00:01:27.840> something<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.530> think<00:01:28.950> similar<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
have made something I think similar to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.420 
have made something I think similar to
Google<00:01:31.100> 20<00:01:32.100> years<00:01:32.280> ago<00:01:32.430> yeah<00:01:33.799> as<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.100> wooden

right<00:02:13.810> last<00:02:14.810> question<00:02:15.230> Tesla<00:02:15.650> why<00:02:16.130> will<00:02:16.430> that

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
right last question Tesla why will that

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.580 
right last question Tesla why will that
be<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> success<00:02:17.210> why<00:02:17.630> why<00:02:17.960> would<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.170> do<00:02:18.530> it

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
be a success why why would you do it

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.440 
be a success why why would you do it
when<00:02:18.830> for<00:02:19.280> example<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.670> Norwegian<00:02:20.120> company

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
when for example the Norwegian company

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.050 
when for example the Norwegian company
think<00:02:20.690> didn't<00:02:21.050> do<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.400> why<00:02:22.400> would<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.610> succeed

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
think didn't do it why would you succeed

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.540 
think didn't do it why would you succeed
sure<00:02:23.500> for<00:02:24.500> sure<00:02:24.530> electric<00:02:25.160> cars<00:02:25.310> are<00:02:25.490> very

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
sure for sure electric cars are very

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.030 
sure for sure electric cars are very
difficult<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.660> fact<00:02:26.900> companies<00:02:27.410> general<00:02:27.950> are

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
very difficult in a parent electric

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:41.460 
very difficult in a parent electric
cause<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:34.510> think<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.900> think<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:37.330> think

well<00:02:43.510> with<00:02:44.510> with<00:02:44.780> in<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:44.990> case<00:02:45.170> Tesla<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.650> think

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
well with with in the case Tesla I think

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.800 
well with with in the case Tesla I think
we<00:02:45.980> finally<00:02:46.280> got<00:02:46.580> kind<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.210> critical<00:02:47.630> mass

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
we finally got kind of a critical mass

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.520 
we finally got kind of a critical mass
of<00:02:49.000> talent<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.210> create<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.990> car<00:02:51.260> and

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
of talent to create a car and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.360 
of talent to create a car and
manufacturer<00:02:52.160> car<00:02:52.460> and<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.740> technology

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
manufacturer car and and the technology

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.180 
manufacturer car and and the technology
timing<00:02:55.820> is<00:02:55.940> right<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:57.110> be<00:02:57.710> able<00:02:57.770> to<00:02:57.920> create<00:02:58.100> a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
timing is right to be able to create a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.950 
timing is right to be able to create a
compelling<00:02:58.610> electric<00:02:59.120> car<00:02:59.330> something

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
compelling electric car something

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.570 
compelling electric car something
something<00:03:00.410> that's<00:03:00.560> really<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.920> great<00:03:01.190> product

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
something that's really a great product

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.700 
something that's really a great product
that<00:03:02.390> stands<00:03:02.750> on<00:03:02.840> its<00:03:02.990> own<00:03:03.170> whether<00:03:03.440> or<00:03:03.620> not

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
that stands on its own whether or not

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.890 
that stands on its own whether or not
it's<00:03:03.890> electric<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.520> think<00:03:05.210> that's<00:03:05.390> sort<00:03:05.690> of<00:03:05.780> the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
it's electric I think that's sort of the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.100 
it's electric I think that's sort of the
critical<00:03:06.880> threshold<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:09.070> in<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.160> past

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
critical threshold and in the past

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.180 
critical threshold and in the past
companies<00:03:12.110> weren't<00:03:12.320> able<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.710> really<00:03:12.950> put

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
companies weren't able to really put

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.770 
companies weren't able to really put
together<00:03:13.280> that<00:03:13.610> critical<00:03:13.970> mass<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.360> talent

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
together that critical mass of talent

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.130 
together that critical mass of talent
and<00:03:15.410> resources<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:17.150> technology<00:03:17.840> the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
and resources and the technology the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.820 
and resources and the technology the
sort<00:03:18.320> of<00:03:18.350> fundamental<00:03:19.190> technology<00:03:19.730> wasn't

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
sort of fundamental technology wasn't

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.510 
sort of fundamental technology wasn't
quite<00:03:21.830> ready<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.410> they<00:03:25.070> ended<00:03:25.250> up<00:03:25.340> making

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
quite ready and so they ended up making

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.150 
quite ready and so they ended up making
cars<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.120> were<00:03:26.540> not<00:03:27.290> good<00:03:27.470> value<00:03:27.740> for<00:03:27.800> money

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
cars that were not good value for money

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.880 
cars that were not good value for money
they<00:03:28.490> were<00:03:28.550> either<00:03:29.540> they<00:03:30.500> were<00:03:30.560> but<00:03:30.770> too

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
they were either they were but too

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.970 
they were either they were but too
expensive<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.530> performance

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
expensive and and and the performance

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.590 
expensive and and and the performance
wasn't<00:03:34.280> there<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.550> range<00:03:34.760> wasn't<00:03:35.120> there<00:03:35.330> and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
wasn't there the range wasn't there and

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.120 
wasn't there the range wasn't there and
so<00:03:35.630> people<00:03:36.230> would<00:03:36.410> look<00:03:36.560> at<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:36.950> say

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
so people would look at that and say

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.070 
so people would look at that and say
doesn't<00:03:37.850> make<00:03:37.970> sense<00:03:38.270> for<00:03:38.690> my<00:03:38.750> value<00:03:39.020> for

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
doesn't make sense for my value for

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.960 
doesn't make sense for my value for
money<00:03:39.260> standpoint<00:03:39.770> the<00:03:40.370> range<00:03:40.580> isn't<00:03:40.850> long

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
money standpoint the range isn't long

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.199 
money standpoint the range isn't long
enough<00:03:41.000> it's<00:03:42.700> maybe<00:03:43.700> got<00:03:43.910> some<00:03:44.060> other

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
enough it's maybe got some other

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.930 
enough it's maybe got some other
concerns<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.110> people<00:03:45.230> have<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.770> so<00:03:45.940> they

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
concerns that people have and so they

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.440 
concerns that people have and so they
didn't<00:03:47.240> then<00:03:47.810> make<00:03:48.709> it<00:03:48.860> okay<00:03:49.670> okay<00:03:50.030> thank<00:03:50.420> you

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
didn't then make it okay okay thank you

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.959 
didn't then make it okay okay thank you
all<00:03:50.870> right
