00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
install so it's a regular stick on

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.539 
install so it's a regular stick on
screen<00:01:07.140> shield<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.530> peel<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:07.979> off<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.220> put<00:01:08.520> it

screen shield you peel it off and put it

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.210 
screen shield you peel it off and put it
on<00:01:08.729> whereas<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> HTC<00:01:10.500> Sensation

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
on whereas the one on the HTC Sensation

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.130 
on whereas the one on the HTC Sensation
you<00:01:11.340> actually<00:01:11.760> need<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.000> use<00:01:12.180> solution<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.990> put

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
you actually need to use solution to put

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.810 
you actually need to use solution to put
it<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.530> squeegee<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.549> that's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
it on and squeegee that out so that's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.120 
it on and squeegee that out so that's
the<00:01:15.000> only<00:01:15.180> difference<00:01:15.299> between<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.990> two<00:01:16.170> so

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the only difference between the two so

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.859 
the only difference between the two so
in<00:01:17.400> terms<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.850> screens<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.330> didn't<00:01:18.600> apply<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
in terms of screens I didn't apply the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.510 
in terms of screens I didn't apply the
nexus<00:01:19.320> s<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.680> we're<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> take<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.250> look<00:01:20.400> at

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
nexus s so we're going to take a look at

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.510 
nexus s so we're going to take a look at
sensation<00:01:21.150> screen<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.070> see<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.280> did<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
sensation screen as you can see I did a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.420 
sensation screen as you can see I did a
very<00:01:24.030> nice<00:01:24.299> job<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:26.159> where

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
very nice job on it so you can see where

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.859 
very nice job on it so you can see where
it<00:01:26.729> actually<00:01:26.939> comes<00:01:27.360> up<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> edge<00:01:28.530> right

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
it actually comes up to the edge right

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.039 
it actually comes up to the edge right
there<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.070> very<00:01:32.490> very<00:01:33.049> barely

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
there so it's very very barely

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.170 
there so it's very very barely
noticeable<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.430> looks<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
noticeable so it looks just like the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.499 
noticeable so it looks just like the
screen<00:01:36.509> itself<00:01:37.700> right<00:01:38.700> down<00:01:38.939> there<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.270> might

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
screen itself right down there you might

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.590 
screen itself right down there you might
be<00:01:39.630> able<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.840> tell<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> little<00:01:40.320> more<00:01:41.420> just<00:01:42.420> in

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
be able to tell it a little more just in

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.819 
be able to tell it a little more just in
that<00:01:42.720> little<00:01:42.990> corner<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.380> there<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.710> it's

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
that little corner right there but it's

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.190 
that little corner right there but it's
a<00:01:43.890> great<00:01:44.040> screen<00:01:44.549> shield<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.570> protects<00:01:45.960> very

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
a great screen shield it protects very

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.469 
a great screen shield it protects very
nicely<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:47.310> only<00:01:47.549> issue<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.850> have<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
nicely the only issue I have with it's a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.289 
nicely the only issue I have with it's a
little<00:01:48.810> bit<00:01:48.930> tacky<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.280> not<00:01:50.460> bad<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.180> has

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
little bit tacky but it's not bad it has

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.240 
little bit tacky but it's not bad it has
no<00:01:51.509> orange<00:01:51.840> peel<00:01:52.140> effect<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:53.040> so

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
no orange peel effect as you can see so

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.370 
no orange peel effect as you can see so
it's<00:01:53.399> much<00:01:53.670> much<00:01:53.880> better<00:01:54.119> than<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.479> zagg<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
it's much much better than the zagg and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.160 
it's much much better than the zagg and
if<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.070> turn<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.360> retains<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> whole

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
if we turn this on it retains the whole

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.230 
if we turn this on it retains the whole
clarity<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.950> device<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.610> as<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.000> see

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
clarity on the device so as you can see

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.630 
clarity on the device so as you can see
right<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:00.979> it's<00:02:01.979> very<00:02:02.219> smooth<00:02:03.710> it<00:02:04.710> functions

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
right here it's very smooth it functions

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.069 
right here it's very smooth it functions
very<00:02:05.850> well<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.420> touch<00:02:06.659> screen<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.049> not

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
very well the touch screen is not

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.029 
very well the touch screen is not
affected<00:02:07.680> at<00:02:07.770> all<00:02:07.890> neither<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.209> clarity<00:02:10.039> so

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
affected at all neither is a clarity so

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.559 
affected at all neither is a clarity so
like<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.280> said<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.580> crystal<00:02:12.120> clear<00:02:12.150> so

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
like I said this is crystal clear so

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.460 
like I said this is crystal clear so
it's<00:02:12.720> not<00:02:12.840> anti<00:02:13.200> glare

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
it's not anti glare

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.470 
it's not anti glare
there<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:14.100> will<00:02:14.340> still<00:02:14.670> pick<00:02:14.820> up<00:02:14.970> fingerprints

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
there it will still pick up fingerprints

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.870 
there it will still pick up fingerprints
and<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.950> only<00:02:17.070> thing<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.370> does<00:02:17.520> release

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
and the only thing it does release

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.750 
and the only thing it does release
protect<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> screen<00:02:18.540> from<00:02:18.750> scratches<00:02:19.760> so

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
protect the screen from scratches so

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.910 
protect the screen from scratches so
taking<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.180> look<00:02:21.210> at<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.450> back<00:02:21.630> on<00:02:21.870> both<00:02:22.110> these

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
taking a look at the back on both these

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.010 
taking a look at the back on both these
are<00:02:23.190> matte<00:02:23.490> finishes<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.360> they'll<00:02:24.540> provide

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
are matte finishes so they'll provide

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.160 
are matte finishes so they'll provide
very<00:02:25.320> nice<00:02:25.560> grip<00:02:25.860> as<00:02:26.070> well<00:02:26.430> as<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:27.000> nice<00:02:27.840> matte

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
very nice grip as well as a nice matte

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.080 
very nice grip as well as a nice matte
finish<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.710> them<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.400> they<00:02:29.580> are<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> little<00:02:29.850> bit

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
finish on them so they are a little bit

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.750 
finish on them so they are a little bit
smooth<00:02:30.450> but<00:02:30.840> at<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:30.990> same<00:02:31.110> time<00:02:31.350> grippy<00:02:31.830> let's

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
smooth but at the same time grippy let's

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.640 
smooth but at the same time grippy let's
start<00:02:32.880> off<00:02:33.150> with<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.330> nexus<00:02:33.990> one<00:02:34.260> i<00:02:34.290> have<00:02:34.500> been

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
start off with the nexus one i have been

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.140 
start off with the nexus one i have been
using<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.040> one<00:02:35.220> for<00:02:35.400> about<00:02:35.580> two<00:02:35.790> weeks<00:02:35.820> now

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
using this one for about two weeks now

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.900 
using this one for about two weeks now
because<00:02:36.570> this<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.720> my<00:02:36.960> main<00:02:37.140> device<00:02:37.760> as<00:02:38.760> you

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
because this is my main device as you

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.190 
because this is my main device as you
can<00:02:39.030> see<00:02:39.210> from<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.510> installation<00:02:39.750> i<00:02:40.020> have<00:02:40.170> a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
can see from the installation i have a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.030 
can see from the installation i have a
couple<00:02:40.500> bubbles<00:02:40.800> here<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.310> some<00:02:42.180> down<00:02:42.390> there

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
couple bubbles here and some down there

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.200 
couple bubbles here and some down there
but<00:02:44.040> overall<00:02:44.130> i<00:02:44.370> did<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.580> pretty<00:02:44.760> good<00:02:44.940> job<00:02:45.000> so

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
but overall i did a pretty good job so

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.940 
but overall i did a pretty good job so
let<00:02:45.540> me<00:02:45.600> take<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.930> around<00:02:46.050> there<00:02:46.440> on<00:02:46.620> these

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
let me take you around there on these

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.800 
let me take you around there on these
corners<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.550> can<00:02:47.670> see<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.940> folds<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.450> because

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
corners you can see it folds in because

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.770 
corners you can see it folds in because
obviously<00:02:48.990> you<00:02:49.500> can't<00:02:49.740> have<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.330> just<00:02:51.330> one

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
obviously you can't have that just one

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.770 
obviously you can't have that just one
large<00:02:52.050> piece<00:02:52.410> as<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.800> would<00:02:52.920> bubble<00:02:53.220> up<00:02:53.780> same

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
large piece as it would bubble up same

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.880 
large piece as it would bubble up same
on<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.140> side<00:02:55.640> as<00:02:56.959> we<00:02:57.959> go<00:02:58.110> down<00:02:58.380> here<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.770> can

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
on this side as we go down here you can

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.390 
on this side as we go down here you can
see<00:02:59.100> actually<00:02:59.280> was<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.820> little<00:03:00.180> bit<00:03:00.270> off<00:03:01.400> that

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
see actually was a little bit off that

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.790 
see actually was a little bit off that
corner<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.970> same<00:03:03.209> right<00:03:04.140> down<00:03:04.380> here<00:03:04.680> is

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
corner is the same right down here is

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.260 
corner is the same right down here is
where<00:03:04.980> actually<00:03:05.310> screwed<00:03:05.670> up<00:03:05.790> just<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.120> little

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
where actually screwed up just a little

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.270 
where actually screwed up just a little
bit<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:06.840> as<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.020> can<00:03:07.140> see<00:03:07.440> because<00:03:07.650> i<00:03:07.920> was<00:03:08.070> off

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
bit so as you can see because i was off

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.850 
bit so as you can see because i was off
on<00:03:08.580> this<00:03:09.120> side<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.690> made<00:03:10.230> everything<00:03:10.530> down

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
on this side it made everything down

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.620 
on this side it made everything down
here<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.100> little<00:03:11.190> bit<00:03:11.490> so<00:03:11.760> i<00:03:11.790> cut<00:03:12.150> off<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.300> piece

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
here a little bit so i cut off a piece

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.340 
here a little bit so i cut off a piece
from<00:03:13.320> here<00:03:13.709> just<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.040> what<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.340> bubble<00:03:14.640> up<00:03:15.350> and

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
from here just so what it bubble up and

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.070 
from here just so what it bubble up and
as<00:03:16.500> we<00:03:16.620> come<00:03:16.830> this<00:03:17.010> way<00:03:17.280> as<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.550> can<00:03:17.700> see<00:03:18.080> it

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
as we come this way as you can see it

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.860 
as we come this way as you can see it
protects<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.010> whole<00:03:20.190> back<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:21.360> can<00:03:21.600> pop

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
protects the whole back and you can pop

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.490 
protects the whole back and you can pop
off<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.080> back<00:03:22.380> cover<00:03:22.820> just<00:03:23.820> fine<00:03:24.320> so<00:03:25.320> let's

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
off the back cover just fine so let's

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.920 
off the back cover just fine so let's
cut<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.680> out<00:03:25.800> very<00:03:26.010> nicely<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.420> can<00:03:27.690> see

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
cut it out very nicely and you can see

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.440 
cut it out very nicely and you can see
that<00:03:28.140> this<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.410> no<00:03:28.560> longer<00:03:28.800> glossy<00:03:29.519> so<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.239> will

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
that this is no longer glossy so it will

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.290 
that this is no longer glossy so it will
protect<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.959> from<00:03:31.050> scratches<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:33.060> looks

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
protect it from scratches and it looks

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.180 
protect it from scratches and it looks
much<00:03:33.570> better<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:33.959> my<00:03:34.140> opinion<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.860> won't

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
much better in my opinion so you won't

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.990 
much better in my opinion so you won't
get<00:03:35.310> any<00:03:35.459> fingerprints<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.239> this<00:03:37.820> now<00:03:38.820> let's

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
get any fingerprints on this now let's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.690 
get any fingerprints on this now let's
take<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> look<00:03:39.390> at<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.600> sensation<00:03:40.260> model<00:03:40.700> which

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
take a look at the sensation model which

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.940 
take a look at the sensation model which
is<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.000> same<00:03:42.180> thing<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:43.830> actually

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
is the same thing so this is actually

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.680 
is the same thing so this is actually
separate<00:03:44.459> into<00:03:44.640> three<00:03:44.880> pieces<00:03:45.090> so<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.480> have

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
separate into three pieces so you have

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.229 
separate into three pieces so you have
the<00:03:45.840> top<00:03:46.049> piece<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:47.100> middle<00:03:47.340> piece<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.850> the

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
the top piece the middle piece and the

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.460 
the top piece the middle piece and the
bottom<00:03:48.570> so<00:03:48.750> it's<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.930> little<00:03:49.049> bit<00:03:49.170> more

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
bottom so it's a little bit more

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.590 
bottom so it's a little bit more
difficult<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:50.070> install<00:03:50.310> but<00:03:51.150> i<00:03:51.180> did<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.390> much

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
difficult to install but i did a much

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.420 
difficult to install but i did a much
better<00:03:51.630> job<00:03:51.930> on<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:52.440> one<00:03:52.650> says<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.070> can<00:03:53.220> see

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
better job on this one says you can see

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.610 
better job on this one says you can see
the<00:03:53.549> students<00:03:53.820> barely<00:03:54.180> noticeable<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:55.470> can

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
the students barely noticeable you can

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.300 
the students barely noticeable you can
see<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.920> skin<00:03:56.160> right<00:03:56.459> near<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.940> speaker<00:03:58.310> once

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
see the skin right near the speaker once

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.210 
see the skin right near the speaker once
again<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.580> very<00:03:59.880> nice<00:04:00.120> matte<00:04:00.390> finish<00:04:00.720> on<00:04:00.900> there

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
again a very nice matte finish on there

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.860 
again a very nice matte finish on there
the<00:04:02.220> middle<00:04:02.489> one<00:04:02.549> has<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.790> cutout<00:04:03.030> for<00:04:03.239> HTC<00:04:03.840> I

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
the middle one has a cutout for HTC I

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.420 
the middle one has a cutout for HTC I
don't<00:04:04.110> know<00:04:04.170> why<00:04:04.290> they<00:04:04.440> added<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:05.070> think

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
don't know why they added that I think

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.670 
don't know why they added that I think
it<00:04:05.610> was<00:04:05.760> because<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.420> letters<00:04:06.810> would

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
it was because you letters would

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.199 
it was because you letters would
actually<00:04:08.040> make<00:04:08.190> it<00:04:08.340> bubble<00:04:08.640> up<00:04:08.730> just<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.060> little

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
actually make it bubble up just a little

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.270 
actually make it bubble up just a little
bit<00:04:09.330> but<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.290> still<00:04:10.500> looks<00:04:10.680> great<00:04:10.890> if<00:04:11.130> you

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
bit but it still looks great if you

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.729 
bit but it still looks great if you
align<00:04:11.519> it<00:04:11.670> well<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:12.530> finally<00:04:13.530> at<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.680> bottom

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
align it well and finally at the bottom

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.940 
align it well and finally at the bottom
you<00:04:14.100> can<00:04:14.130> see<00:04:14.250> that<00:04:14.670> i<00:04:15.500> aligned<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.650> pretty

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
you can see that i aligned it pretty

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.159 
you can see that i aligned it pretty
well<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:18.120> have<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.299> little<00:04:18.540> bit<00:04:18.750> of<00:04:18.780> bubbling

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
well and I have a little bit of bubbling

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.640 
well and I have a little bit of bubbling
around<00:04:19.290> here<00:04:20.419> now<00:04:21.419> they<00:04:21.750> both<00:04:21.959> come<00:04:22.289> with<00:04:22.320> side

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
around here now they both come with side

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.890 
around here now they both come with side
protection<00:04:23.070> in<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.520> case<00:04:23.849> of<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.120> Nexus<00:04:24.479> S<00:04:24.660> I

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
protection in the case of the Nexus S I

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.080 
protection in the case of the Nexus S I
did<00:04:25.140> not<00:04:25.289> install<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:26.039> because<00:04:26.400> they

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
did not install it just because they

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.970 
did not install it just because they
seemed<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.360> little<00:04:27.510> bit<00:04:27.720> too<00:04:27.870> thick<00:04:28.230> so<00:04:28.530> I'm<00:04:28.770> not

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
seemed a little bit too thick so I'm not

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.980 
seemed a little bit too thick so I'm not
sure<00:04:29.040> if<00:04:29.310> they<00:04:30.000> were<00:04:30.060> cut<00:04:30.330> just<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.660> little<00:04:30.870> bit

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
sure if they were cut just a little bit

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.870 
sure if they were cut just a little bit
large<00:04:31.230> so<00:04:31.500> I<00:04:31.530> didn't<00:04:31.949> even<00:04:32.130> try<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.310> install<00:04:32.669> it

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
large so I didn't even try to install it

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.760 
large so I didn't even try to install it
but<00:04:33.330> most<00:04:33.510> people<00:04:33.810> probably<00:04:33.960> wouldn't<00:04:34.169> just

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
but most people probably wouldn't just

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.370 
but most people probably wouldn't just
because<00:04:35.070> it's<00:04:35.250> so<00:04:35.400> cumbersome<00:04:36.169> but<00:04:37.169> I<00:04:37.229> did

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
because it's so cumbersome but I did

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.010 
because it's so cumbersome but I did
install<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.860> on<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.310> sensation<00:04:39.060> so<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.870> can

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
install it on the sensation so you can

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.530 
install it on the sensation so you can
see<00:04:40.139> right<00:04:40.169> here<00:04:40.560> on<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.830> front<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:42.180> skin

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
see right here on the front the skin

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.719 
see right here on the front the skin
that<00:04:43.169> comes<00:04:43.500> up<00:04:43.710> around<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.880> speaker<00:04:46.729> along

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
that comes up around the speaker along

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.879 
that comes up around the speaker along
this<00:04:47.940> side<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.389> can<00:04:48.540> see<00:04:48.570> it<00:04:48.840> as<00:04:48.960> well<00:04:49.139> and

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
this side you can see it as well and

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.250 
this side you can see it as well and
we'll<00:04:50.040> move<00:04:50.160> down<00:04:50.780> there's<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.810> little<00:04:51.960> bubble

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
we'll move down there's a little bubble

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.240 
we'll move down there's a little bubble
right<00:04:52.410> there<00:04:53.960> so<00:04:54.960> you<00:04:55.050> get<00:04:55.290> real<00:04:55.680> maximum

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
right there so you get real maximum

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.159 
right there so you get real maximum
protection<00:04:56.400> on<00:04:56.910> this<00:04:57.150> now<00:04:57.360> one<00:04:57.570> thing<00:04:57.600> I<00:04:57.810> noted

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
protection on this now one thing I noted

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.530 
protection on this now one thing I noted
was<00:04:58.410> around<00:04:59.340> these<00:04:59.580> sides<00:04:59.880> it<00:05:00.150> tends<00:05:00.419> to

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
was around these sides it tends to

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.090 
was around these sides it tends to
bubble<00:05:00.870> up<00:05:00.930> just<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:01.290> little<00:05:01.440> bit<00:05:01.590> because<00:05:01.800> you

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
bubble up just a little bit because you

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.050 
bubble up just a little bit because you
can<00:05:02.340> take<00:05:02.669> off<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.840> back<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.639> leaves<00:05:05.820> that

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
can take off the back so it leaves that

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.570 
can take off the back so it leaves that
exposed<00:05:06.870> just<00:05:07.169> a<00:05:07.290> little<00:05:07.530> bit<00:05:07.650> that's<00:05:08.370> why<00:05:08.520> it

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
exposed just a little bit that's why it

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.360 
exposed just a little bit that's why it
bubbles<00:05:08.910> up<00:05:09.000> as<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:09.300> can<00:05:09.450> see<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:11.010> we<00:05:11.100> can<00:05:11.250> put

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
bubbles up as you can see so we can put

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.420 
bubbles up as you can see so we can put
this<00:05:11.520> back<00:05:11.760> in<00:05:11.940> and<00:05:12.150> snap<00:05:12.479> it<00:05:12.510> in<00:05:12.780> and<00:05:13.190> it<00:05:14.190> wraps

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
this back in and snap it in and it wraps

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.810 
this back in and snap it in and it wraps
around<00:05:14.639> the<00:05:15.210> whole<00:05:15.870> phone<00:05:16.250> so<00:05:17.250> really<00:05:17.280> this

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
around the whole phone so really this

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.219 
around the whole phone so really this
will<00:05:18.030> provide<00:05:18.300> pretty<00:05:18.780> much<00:05:18.900> one<00:05:19.020> hundred

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
will provide pretty much one hundred

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.930 
will provide pretty much one hundred
percent<00:05:19.260> coverage<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:20.370> only<00:05:20.520> thing<00:05:20.669> that's

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
percent coverage the only thing that's

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.779 
percent coverage the only thing that's
left<00:05:21.030> uncovered<00:05:21.570> is<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:22.740> speaker<00:05:23.039> and<00:05:23.250> both
