to<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.039> satellites<00:00:50.550> I'll<00:00:51.149> show<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.390> how<00:00:51.539> many

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to get satellites I'll show you how many

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.229 
to get satellites I'll show you how many
satellites<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.559> green<00:00:53.149> blue<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
satellites here you have in green blue I

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.729 
satellites here you have in green blue I
think<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:55.370> guess<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.399> try<00:00:56.610> require<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
think or I guess the try require a

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.630 
think or I guess the try require a
satellites<00:00:58.739> got<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> little<00:00:59.129> picture<00:00:59.399> up<00:00:59.489> there

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
satellites got a little picture up there

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.029 
satellites got a little picture up there
where<00:01:00.180> each<00:01:00.359> satellite<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.989> which<00:01:01.649> ones<00:01:01.859> we're

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
where each satellite is which ones we're

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.060 
where each satellite is which ones we're
locked<00:01:02.219> into<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:03.199> at<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> time<00:01:04.860> of

locked into you up here at the time of
course<00:01:05.600> batteries<00:01:06.600> down<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.869> yellow<00:01:07.939> I've

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
course batteries down the yellow I've

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.800 
course batteries down the yellow I've
got<00:01:09.090> some<00:01:09.240> Duracell<00:01:10.700> really<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.390> kind<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
got some Duracell really not I kind of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.219 
got some Duracell really not I kind of
alkaline<00:01:13.200> batteries<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:15.229> we've

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
alkaline batteries in here and we've

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.420 
alkaline batteries in here and we've
been<00:01:16.320> hugging<00:01:16.470> our<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.799> having<00:01:17.040> someone<00:01:17.250> down

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
been hugging our and having someone down

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.179 
been hugging our and having someone down
to<00:01:17.460> yellow<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.850> that's<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.119> too<00:01:18.270> bad<00:01:19.189> I'd

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to yellow so that's not too bad I'd

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.590 
to yellow so that's not too bad I'd
imagine<00:01:20.310> lithium<00:01:20.909> batteries<00:01:21.180> probably<00:01:21.509> do<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
imagine lithium batteries probably do a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.850 
imagine lithium batteries probably do a
little<00:01:21.689> better<00:01:23.060> next<00:01:24.060> page<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.590> kind<00:01:25.830> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
little better next page and kind of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.210 
little better next page and kind of
stick<00:01:26.070> where<00:01:26.310> we've<00:01:26.520> been<00:01:27.979> started<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.070> down

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
stick where we've been started that down

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.359 
stick where we've been started that down
here<00:01:29.430> at<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.579> trailhead<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:31.159> got<00:01:32.159> about<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
here at the trailhead and got about a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.399 
here at the trailhead and got about a
mile<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.729> half<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.240> got<00:01:33.570> some<00:01:33.750> geocaches<00:01:33.960> on

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
mile and a half I got some geocaches on

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.140 
mile and a half I got some geocaches on
here<00:01:34.590> too<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:37.460> it's<00:01:38.460> pretty<00:01:38.670> cool<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.970> mean

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
here too so it's pretty cool you mean

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.170 
here too so it's pretty cool you mean
when<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.570> turn<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> arrow<00:01:40.140> moves<00:01:41.060> as<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
when you turn it the arrow moves as to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.639 
when you turn it the arrow moves as to
which<00:01:42.329> way<00:01:42.479> you're<00:01:42.720> moving<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> that's<00:01:46.409> that

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
which way you're moving so that's that

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.740 
which way you're moving so that's that
page<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.939> go<00:01:48.030> back<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.210> magnetic

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
page then you go back to magnetic

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.899 
page then you go back to magnetic
compass<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.740> thing<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.100> easy<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.399> use<00:01:50.640> I

I<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:12.930> go<00:02:13.020> up<00:02:13.230> use<00:02:13.680> my<00:02:13.860> arrow<00:02:14.930> there's<00:02:15.930> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
I can go up use my arrow there's a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.699 
I can go up use my arrow there's a
geocache<00:02:20.450> right<00:02:21.450> up<00:02:21.540> here<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:22.050> says<00:02:22.530> we're

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
geocache right up here that says we're

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.520 
geocache right up here that says we're
about<00:02:22.800> one<00:02:22.980> point<00:02:23.130> two<00:02:23.250> seven<00:02:23.400> miles<00:02:23.880> from<00:02:24.030> it

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
gonna take these out because we I don't

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.340 
gonna take these out because we I don't
want<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.880> recalibrate<00:03:30.480> everything<00:03:31.020> and<00:03:31.200> lose

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
want to recalibrate everything and lose

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.800

our<00:03:31.470> position<00:03:31.950> under<00:03:32.760> there<00:03:32.910> I've<00:03:33.150> got<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.330> 4

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
our position under there I've got a 4

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.060 
our position under there I've got a 4
gigabyte<00:03:33.960> memory<00:03:34.380> card<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:36.830> that's<00:03:37.830> where<00:03:38.010> I

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
gigabyte memory card and that's where I

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.510 
gigabyte memory card and that's where I
guess<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.490> can<00:03:38.640> easily<00:03:38.730> change<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.210> out<00:03:39.330> so

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
guess you can easily change it out so

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.590 
guess you can easily change it out so
they're<00:03:41.520> pretty<00:03:41.640> accurate<00:03:41.850> so<00:03:42.030> far<00:03:42.120> we've<00:03:42.420> got

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600

checked<00:03:42.810> out<00:03:42.930> with<00:03:43.020> some<00:03:43.140> compasses<00:03:43.440> and

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
checked out with some compasses and

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.870 
checked out with some compasses and
stuff

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880

the<00:03:45.210> magnetic<00:03:45.480> electronic<00:03:46.380> compass<00:03:46.650> is

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
the magnetic electronic compass is

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.170 
the magnetic electronic compass is
pretty<00:03:46.950> good<00:03:48.410> so<00:03:49.760> we're<00:03:50.760> gonna<00:03:50.880> keep<00:03:51.000> on

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
pretty good so we're gonna keep on

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.740 
pretty good so we're gonna keep on
keeping<00:03:51.510> on<00:03:51.630> it's<00:03:52.440> about<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:53.240> offset<00:03:54.240> this<00:03:54.360> GPS

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
keeping on it's about a offset this GPS

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.510 
keeping on it's about a offset this GPS
cost<00:03:54.990> maybe<00:03:55.620> three<00:03:56.010> hundred<00:03:56.040> three<00:03:56.490> hundred

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520
