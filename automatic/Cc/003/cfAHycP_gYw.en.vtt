00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.150
 how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.980
 time we will make a jelly 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.680
 mosaic for which we are going to prove that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.600
 colorful colors of the flavor of your 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.120
 preference we will occupy a milk 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.530
 condensed 4 sachets of grenetine 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.530
 and a liter of milk 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.879
 As a next step we are going to take the 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.920
 boxes of our gelatins from the 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.130
 brand that we have chosen and we are going to 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.010
 prepare as it says here back 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.610
 and we're going to take them to refrigerate all 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.610
 those of the flavors 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.579
 well once they are done 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.680
 our gelatins it's time to make the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.909
 diced with a knife let 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.239
 to take that good either as 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.239
 line 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.719
 and then we are going to cut them 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.009
 and so on to form squares with each 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.009
 one of the jellies 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.729
 once we have them all chopped 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.040
 we're going to take them all to a container 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.780
 to yourself to make a mixture of 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.049
 jellies and that they remain of several 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.049
 flavors 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.830
 and now yes since we have them all 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.440
 we are going to mix them together 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.680
 careful and we will take them to 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.780
 refrigerate again 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.420
 in what are ours and our 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.920
 next step in our headquarters something 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.670
 we are going to place the four envelopes of 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.960
 grenet inah and we will reserve them 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.830
 later we will take three cups 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.820
 of milk is that type the cup and 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.820
 let's bring to simmer 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.020
 once our milk is a little 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.680
 warm we 're going to take we 're going to add 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.680
 condensed milk 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.239
 three-quarters if you feel that it is 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.060
 very sweet or half as you like it is 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.470
 sweet to you in this case I'm going to 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.470
 occupy three quarters 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.319
 and I will incorporate well 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.620
 we must be careful and it must be to 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.220
 very low fire because the milk tends 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.220
 stick 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.940
 until our condensed milk with 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.800
 our milk is about to boil 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.050
 let's add the grenetina that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.370
 we had previously hydrated and we're going to 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.150
 perfectly incorporate the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.150
 ingredients 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.470
 ah 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.709
 to dissolve completely 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.709
 grenetina 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.500
 ah 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.690
 and once you have incorporated 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.350
 perfectly the grenetina with the milk 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.180
 let's let it be tempered even at level 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.210
 normal temperature so that a 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:23.170
 room temperature to cool this 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.510
 well once it's already cooled 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.270
 our mix that we made of milk 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.790
 now let's accommodate in a container 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.680
 the gelatins that we had already chopped 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.080
 diverse way as we like it 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.430
 ok and once we put them in a 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:42.180
 refractory we will bring the mixture of 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.180
 milk here 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.590
 and we're going to bring it to refrigerate again
