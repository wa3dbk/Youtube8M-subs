00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.470 

so<00:00:00.950> we<00:00:01.010> did<00:00:01.160> a<00:00:01.189> few<00:00:01.339> things<00:00:01.520> today<00:00:01.759> for<00:00:02.240> the

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:02.480 
so we did a few things today for the

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.830 
so we did a few things today for the
hops<00:00:02.690> I<00:00:03.410> took<00:00:04.190> down<00:00:04.520> the<00:00:05.029> chicken<00:00:05.420> wire<00:00:05.570> that<00:00:05.779> I

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:05.840 
hops I took down the chicken wire that I

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.160 
hops I took down the chicken wire that I
was<00:00:06.020> surrounding<00:00:06.680> the<00:00:07.009> Centennial<00:00:08.170> and

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
was surrounding the Centennial and

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.070 
was surrounding the Centennial and
originally<00:00:09.680> put<00:00:09.830> that<00:00:10.010> up<00:00:10.130> because<00:00:10.250> our<00:00:10.670> dog

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
originally put that up because our dog

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.730 
originally put that up because our dog
was<00:00:12.080> tramping<00:00:12.889> through<00:00:13.240> the<00:00:14.240> hops<00:00:14.450> and<00:00:14.780> that

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
was tramping through the hops and that

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.040 
was tramping through the hops and that
wasn't<00:00:15.980> going<00:00:16.340> to<00:00:16.460> help<00:00:16.610> it<00:00:16.760> grow<00:00:16.910> so<00:00:17.330> we

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
wasn't going to help it grow so we

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.500 
wasn't going to help it grow so we
needed<00:00:18.260> some<00:00:18.440> way<00:00:18.529> to<00:00:18.560> protect<00:00:18.770> it<00:00:19.510> we

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
needed some way to protect it we

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.590 
needed some way to protect it we
attached<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:21.160> twine<00:00:22.160> to<00:00:22.190> the<00:00:22.550> crown<00:00:22.789> of<00:00:23.060> the

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
attached the twine to the crown of the

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.820 
attached the twine to the crown of the
maple<00:00:24.020> and<00:00:25.660> tethered<00:00:26.660> it<00:00:26.779> down<00:00:26.990> with<00:00:27.380> stakes

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
maple and tethered it down with stakes

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.860 
maple and tethered it down with stakes
that<00:00:28.609> are<00:00:28.670> very<00:00:29.330> similar<00:00:29.449> to<00:00:29.769> camping<00:00:30.769> stakes

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:31.870 
that are very similar to camping stakes

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.879 
that are very similar to camping stakes
show<00:00:32.870> you<00:00:32.929> them<00:00:33.229> and<00:00:34.219> then<00:00:34.370> ground<00:00:34.789> there<00:00:35.889> try

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:36.889 
show you them and then ground there try

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:40.989 
show you them and then ground there try
to<00:00:36.949> get<00:00:37.159> the<00:00:37.489> I<00:00:38.469> guess<00:00:39.469> the<00:00:39.499> shape<00:00:40.190> of<00:00:40.370> this<00:00:40.519> as

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:40.999 
to get the I guess the shape of this as

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:44.500 
to get the I guess the shape of this as
circular<00:00:41.449> as<00:00:41.659> possible<00:00:42.460> but<00:00:43.460> we<00:00:44.389> weren't

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
circular as possible but we weren't

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.169 
circular as possible but we weren't
really<00:00:44.749> that<00:00:45.109> successful<00:00:46.010> it's<00:00:46.819> more<00:00:47.049> oval

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
really that successful it's more oval

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.549 
really that successful it's more oval
but<00:00:50.179> it<00:00:50.929> should<00:00:51.289> do<00:00:51.409> its<00:00:51.559> job<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:54.079> twine<00:00:54.350> is

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
but it should do its job the twine is

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.959 
but it should do its job the twine is
close<00:00:55.159> to<00:00:55.429> where<00:00:55.639> the<00:00:55.760> hops<00:00:55.969> are<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:57.969> what

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
close to where the hops are and what

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.340 
close to where the hops are and what
we're<00:00:59.359> going<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.629> have<00:00:59.690> to<00:00:59.869> do<00:00:59.959> is<00:01:00.109> really

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
we're going to have to do is really

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.660 
we're going to have to do is really
train<00:01:01.239> perhaps<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.420> go<00:01:02.510> up<00:01:02.749> and<00:01:03.019> around<00:01:03.670> I'm

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
train perhaps it go up and around I'm

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.700 
train perhaps it go up and around I'm
listen<00:01:04.969> to<00:01:05.030> Spile<00:01:07.240> following<00:01:08.320> up<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.590> the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
listen to Spile following up to the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.300 
listen to Spile following up to the
crown<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:09.979> maybe<00:01:10.520> back<00:01:10.880> down<00:01:11.979> I'm<00:01:12.979> have<00:01:13.159> to

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
crown and maybe back down I'm have to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.349 
crown and maybe back down I'm have to
see<00:01:13.520> how<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:13.909> works<00:01:14.119> but<00:01:15.939> I<00:01:16.939> think<00:01:17.210> we'll<00:01:17.329> be

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
see how that works but I think we'll be

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.510 
see how that works but I think we'll be
pretty<00:01:17.630> successful<00:01:18.229> I'm<00:01:18.829> just<00:01:19.009> glad<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.399> get

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
pretty successful I'm just glad to get

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.380 
pretty successful I'm just glad to get
the<00:01:20.049> twine<00:01:21.049> up<00:01:21.259> because<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.759> Centennial

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
the twine up because the Centennial

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.179 
the twine up because the Centennial
definitely<00:01:23.929> needed<00:01:24.170> someplace<00:01:24.439> to<00:01:24.649> latch

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
definitely needed someplace to latch

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.249 
definitely needed someplace to latch
onto<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:27.670> eventually<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.820> Cascade<00:01:29.390> will

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
onto and eventually the Cascade will

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.380 
onto and eventually the Cascade will
also<00:01:30.590> have

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
also have

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.030 
also have
you<00:01:32.960> know<00:01:33.080> need<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.800> grab<00:01:34.159> on<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:34.729> branch<00:01:35.300> out

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
you know need to grab on and branch out

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.490 
you know need to grab on and branch out
you<00:01:37.040> know<00:01:37.159> secure<00:01:37.580> itself<00:01:37.909> to<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.150> lines<00:01:38.500> but

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
you know secure itself to the lines but

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.810 
you know secure itself to the lines but
all<00:01:39.860> in<00:01:40.100> all<00:01:40.190> a<00:01:40.430> very<00:01:40.820> successful<00:01:41.330> day<00:01:42.820> still

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
all in all a very successful day still

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.450 
all in all a very successful day still
no<00:01:43.940> progress<00:01:44.210> with<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.570> other<00:01:44.720> two

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
no progress with the other two

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.070 
no progress with the other two
Centennial<00:01:46.460> hops<00:01:46.580> out<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.720> disappointing<00:01:48.400> but

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
Centennial hops out of disappointing but

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.380 
Centennial hops out of disappointing but
I'll<00:01:51.080> keep<00:01:51.229> my<00:01:51.350> fingers<00:01:51.380> crossed<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.970> like<00:01:53.270> I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
I'll keep my fingers crossed and like I

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.320 
I'll keep my fingers crossed and like I
said<00:01:53.450> in<00:01:53.720> last<00:01:53.930> one<00:01:54.520> if<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.850> doesn't<00:01:56.119> come<00:01:56.180> up

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
said in last one if it doesn't come up

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.850 
said in last one if it doesn't come up
this<00:01:56.479> year<00:01:56.750> I'll<00:01:56.869> probably<00:01:57.020> just<00:01:57.290> plant<00:01:57.619> two

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
this year I'll probably just plant two

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.999 
this year I'll probably just plant two
more<00:01:58.100> here<00:01:58.580> next<00:01:58.940> year<00:01:59.030> so<00:02:00.020> we<00:02:00.259> can<00:02:00.409> have<00:02:00.560> three

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
more here next year so we can have three

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.740 
more here next year so we can have three
on<00:02:01.220> each<00:02:02.050> type<00:02:03.050> of<00:02:03.080> hops<00:02:03.409> here
