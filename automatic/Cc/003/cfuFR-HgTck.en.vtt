quadcopter straight up on a scale of 1

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.880 
quadcopter straight up on a scale of 1
to<00:00:21.650> 10<00:00:21.980> I<00:00:22.220> give<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:22.699> syma<00:00:22.939> x5c<00:00:23.570> a<00:00:24.109> straight<00:00:24.740> up

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
to 10 I give the syma x5c a straight up

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.839 
to 10 I give the syma x5c a straight up
9<00:00:25.070> and<00:00:25.279> a<00:00:25.310> half<00:00:25.509> for<00:00:26.509> a<00:00:26.539> 45<00:00:27.199> to<00:00:27.470> $50<00:00:28.009> quadcopter

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
9 and a half for a 45 to $50 quadcopter

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.210 
9 and a half for a 45 to $50 quadcopter
you<00:00:29.029> just<00:00:29.509> can't<00:00:30.080> beat<00:00:30.439> it<00:00:30.470> there<00:00:31.009> are<00:00:31.099> only

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
you just can't beat it there are only

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.490 
you just can't beat it there are only
two<00:00:31.550> things<00:00:31.820> I<00:00:32.029> would<00:00:32.180> change<00:00:32.480> 1<00:00:33.080> the

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
two things I would change 1 the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.980 
two things I would change 1 the
transmitter<00:00:34.100> control<00:00:34.520> range<00:00:34.760> is<00:00:35.210> relatively

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
transmitter control range is relatively

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.710 
transmitter control range is relatively
short<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:36.560> thus<00:00:37.400> if<00:00:37.670> you<00:00:37.790> want<00:00:38.030> to<00:00:38.210> convert<00:00:38.600> it

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
short and thus if you want to convert it

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.440 
short and thus if you want to convert it
to<00:00:38.750> fpv<00:00:39.380> such<00:00:39.710> as<00:00:39.890> I<00:00:39.980> did<00:00:40.160> on<00:00:40.280> this<00:00:40.460> model<00:00:40.730> well

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
to fpv such as I did on this model well

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.350 
to fpv such as I did on this model well
you<00:00:42.020> might<00:00:42.230> want<00:00:42.470> a<00:00:42.680> control<00:00:43.250> upgrade<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:44.180> get

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
you might want a control upgrade to get

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.380 
you might want a control upgrade to get
some<00:00:44.630> more<00:00:44.810> distance<00:00:45.230> out<00:00:45.410> of<00:00:45.440> it<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:47.210> other

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
some more distance out of it the other

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.510 
some more distance out of it the other
thing<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:47.840> didn't<00:00:48.080> care<00:00:48.290> for<00:00:48.320> was<00:00:48.860> that<00:00:49.100> it<00:00:49.220> only

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
thing I didn't care for was that it only

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.330 
thing I didn't care for was that it only
has<00:00:50.150> auto<00:00:50.570> level<00:00:50.990> mode<00:00:51.170> there<00:00:51.380> is<00:00:51.410> no<00:00:51.680> rate

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
has auto level mode there is no rate

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.970 
has auto level mode there is no rate
mode<00:00:52.610> of<00:00:52.970> course<00:00:53.270> no<00:00:53.660> toy<00:00:53.990> quadcopter<00:00:54.260> that<00:00:54.950> I

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
mode of course no toy quadcopter that I

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.100 
mode of course no toy quadcopter that I
know<00:00:55.100> of<00:00:55.370> actually<00:00:55.880> has<00:00:56.150> a<00:00:56.180> rate<00:00:56.510> mode<00:00:56.780> so

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
know of actually has a rate mode so

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.110 
know of actually has a rate mode so
maybe<00:00:57.680> I<00:00:57.800> shouldn't<00:00:58.220> count<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.580> against<00:00:58.970> it

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
maybe I shouldn't count it against it

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.090 
maybe I shouldn't count it against it
but<00:00:59.720> everything<00:00:59.960> else<00:01:00.290> about<00:01:00.440> this<00:01:00.710> vehicle

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
but everything else about this vehicle

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.030 
but everything else about this vehicle
is<00:01:01.220> excellent<00:01:02.000> I<00:01:02.210> can't<00:01:02.930> speak<00:01:03.350> enough<00:01:03.590> about

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
is excellent I can't speak enough about

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.660 
is excellent I can't speak enough about
how<00:01:04.549> well<00:01:05.119> this<00:01:05.449> thing<00:01:05.689> performs<00:01:06.400> indoor<00:01:07.400> and

how well this thing performs indoor and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.850 
how well this thing performs indoor and
outdoor<00:01:08.330> this<00:01:08.659> thing<00:01:08.930> can<00:01:09.080> be<00:01:09.170> flying<00:01:09.440> flown

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
outdoor this thing can be flying flown

out of it they said it's amazing that

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.970 
out of it they said it's amazing that
this<00:02:21.550> thing<00:02:21.940> still<00:02:22.480> flies<00:02:23.050> despite<00:02:23.770> being

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
this thing still flies despite being

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.910 
this thing still flies despite being
this<00:02:24.250> mangled<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.060> problem<00:02:25.840> with<00:02:25.960> it<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.680> dog

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
this mangled the problem with it the dog

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.740 
this mangled the problem with it the dog
chewed<00:02:27.280> through<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.670> actually<00:02:27.910> broke<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
chewed through and actually broke the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.100 
chewed through and actually broke the
receiver<00:02:29.140> internally<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.160> well<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.910> for<00:02:31.510> $20

receiver internally and well and for $20

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.949 
receiver internally and well and for $20
it's<00:02:32.500> just<00:02:32.680> not<00:02:32.830> worth<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:36.750> another<00:02:37.750> great

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
it's just not worth it another great

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.660 
it's just not worth it another great
thing<00:02:38.230> about<00:02:38.380> these<00:02:38.709> is<00:02:38.950> multiple<00:02:39.370> flight

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
thing about these is multiple flight

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.460 
thing about these is multiple flight
modes<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.090> as<00:02:40.209> both<00:02:40.420> low<00:02:40.660> rates<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.170> high

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
modes and as both low rates and high

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.680 
modes and as both low rates and high
rates<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:42.070> low<00:02:42.340> rates<00:02:42.580> are<00:02:42.820> great<00:02:43.180> for<00:02:43.390> flying

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
rates the low rates are great for flying

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.350 
rates the low rates are great for flying
indoors<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.440> for<00:02:44.650> tight<00:02:44.920> spaces<00:02:45.360> for

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
indoors and for tight spaces for

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.530 
indoors and for tight spaces for
outdoors<00:02:46.870> high<00:02:47.590> rates<00:02:47.890> are<00:02:48.130> awesome<00:02:48.820> you<00:02:49.420> can

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
outdoors high rates are awesome you can

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.270 
outdoors high rates are awesome you can
fly<00:02:49.750> high<00:02:49.780> rates<00:02:50.320> indoors<00:02:50.860> but<00:02:51.040> you're<00:02:51.190> gonna

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
fly high rates indoors but you're gonna

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.220 
fly high rates indoors but you're gonna
find<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.940> vehicle<00:02:52.330> gets<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.750> other<00:02:52.959> end

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
find that the vehicle gets the other end

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.170 
find that the vehicle gets the other end
of<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.380> house<00:02:53.590> or<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:53.950> building<00:02:54.370> very<00:02:54.820> very

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
of the house or the building very very

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.720 
of the house or the building very very
quickly<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:55.690> if<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.650> want<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:56.980> fly<00:02:57.160> sensitive

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
quickly so if you want to fly sensitive

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.670 
quickly so if you want to fly sensitive
thumbs<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.330> works<00:02:58.690> but<00:02:59.020> friend<00:02:59.350> or<00:02:59.530> you're

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
probably gonna want low rates another

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.520 
probably gonna want low rates another
great<00:03:04.030> thing<00:03:04.239> is<00:03:04.300> this<00:03:04.660> has<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.870> auto<00:03:05.110> flip

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
great thing is this has the auto flip

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.190 
great thing is this has the auto flip
switch<00:03:05.800> hit<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.580> button<00:03:06.910> press<00:03:07.510> one<00:03:07.720> side<00:03:07.959> the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
switch hit the button press one side the

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.650 
switch hit the button press one side the
vehicle<00:03:08.560> flips<00:03:08.860> over<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:09.220> recovers<00:03:09.820> the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
vehicle flips over and recovers the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.420 
vehicle flips over and recovers the
great<00:03:10.930> thing<00:03:11.140> about<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.800> it<00:03:12.070> seems

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
great thing about this is it seems

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.630 
great thing about this is it seems
extremely<00:03:13.270> stable<00:03:13.770> one<00:03:14.770> problem<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.370> quad

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
extremely stable one problem that quad

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.340 
extremely stable one problem that quad
copters<00:03:16.090> often<00:03:16.390> have<00:03:16.600> is<00:03:16.750> when<00:03:16.930> you<00:03:17.020> reduce

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
copters often have is when you reduce

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.380 
copters often have is when you reduce
the<00:03:17.590> throttle<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.190> vehicle<00:03:18.580> begins<00:03:19.120> to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
the throttle and the vehicle begins to

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.150 
the throttle and the vehicle begins to
descend<00:03:19.750> if<00:03:20.049> you<00:03:20.170> suddenly<00:03:20.470> kick<00:03:20.860> on<00:03:21.010> the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
descend if you suddenly kick on the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
throttle or attempt to recover it often

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.830 
throttle or attempt to recover it often
wobbles<00:03:23.470> off<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.160> out<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.370> control<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.030> will

wobbles off and out of control and will

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.080 
wobbles off and out of control and will
still<00:03:26.110> crash<00:03:26.440> this<00:03:27.040> doesn't<00:03:27.670> do<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:27.940> it

still crash this doesn't do that it

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.240 
still crash this doesn't do that it
simply<00:03:28.420> snaps<00:03:28.480> upright<00:03:29.230> recovers<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:29.920> keeps

simply snaps upright recovers and keeps
on<00:03:30.489> going<00:03:30.910> it's<00:03:31.870> extremely<00:03:32.410> controlled<00:03:32.830> and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
on going it's extremely controlled and

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.130 
on going it's extremely controlled and
it's<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.670> lot<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:34.030> fun<00:03:34.239> for<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.510> beginner<00:03:34.870> and

it's a lot of fun for a beginner and
intermediate<00:03:35.260> or<00:03:36.190> even<00:03:36.459> advanced<00:03:36.820> pot<00:03:37.090> you

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
intermediate or even advanced pot you

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.060 
intermediate or even advanced pot you
just<00:03:37.330> wants<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.780> trash<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.110> vehicle<00:03:38.650> knowing<00:03:38.860> it

just wants to trash a vehicle knowing it

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.759 
just wants to trash a vehicle knowing it
won't<00:03:39.220> break<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:39.910> would<00:03:40.780> say<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.170> cyma<00:03:41.470> is<00:03:41.739> a

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
won't break I would say the cyma is a

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.050 
won't break I would say the cyma is a
value<00:03:42.430> at<00:03:42.640> twice<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.480> price<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.950> if<00:03:45.940> you're

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
value at twice the price so if you're

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.880 
value at twice the price so if you're
looking<00:03:46.209> for<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.510> great<00:03:46.660> quadcopter<00:03:47.560> just<00:03:47.829> to

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.800 
throttle is it reduce throttle well yeah
and<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.130> great<00:04:09.400> thing<00:04:09.700> is<00:04:09.730> that<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.660> won't

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
and the great thing is that it won't

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.539 
and the great thing is that it won't
hurt<00:04:11.170> her<00:04:11.350> in<00:04:11.500> any<00:04:11.560> way<00:04:11.739> you<00:04:11.890> could<00:04:12.130> stick<00:04:12.400> your

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
hurt her in any way you could stick your

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.460 
hurt her in any way you could stick your
fingers<00:04:12.910> right<00:04:13.239> into<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.600> rotors<00:04:14.019> while<00:04:14.230> it's

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
fingers right into the rotors while it's

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.590 
fingers right into the rotors while it's
spinning<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:15.130> you<00:04:15.400> just<00:04:15.549> get<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.850> little<00:04:16.180> pinch

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
spinning and you just get a little pinch

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.659 
spinning and you just get a little pinch
and<00:04:17.049> that's<00:04:17.320> about<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:17.890> so<00:04:18.160> it's<00:04:18.280> not<00:04:18.400> even

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
and that's about it so it's not even

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.340 
and that's about it so it's not even
enough<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:18.970> deter<00:04:19.329> the<00:04:19.510> dog<00:04:19.690> from<00:04:19.930> going<00:04:20.200> after

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
enough to deter the dog from going after

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.339 
enough to deter the dog from going after
it<00:04:20.620> another<00:04:20.829> time<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.810> amazingly<00:04:22.810> she<00:04:23.200> can

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
it another time and amazingly she can

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.080 
it another time and amazingly she can
get<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.620> in<00:04:23.680> her<00:04:23.800> mouth<00:04:23.950> six<00:04:24.340> or<00:04:24.460> seven<00:04:24.760> times

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
get it in her mouth six or seven times

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.850 
get it in her mouth six or seven times
before<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.630> need<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.960> actually<00:04:26.110> adjust

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
before I need to actually adjust

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.260 
before I need to actually adjust
something

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.999 

you<00:04:31.270> also<00:04:31.509> note<00:04:31.960> that<00:04:32.139> a<00:04:32.169> few<00:04:32.409> times<00:04:32.439> I've<00:04:32.889> been

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
you also note that a few times I've been

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.129 
you also note that a few times I've been
throwing<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.759> quadcopter<00:04:34.060> from<00:04:34.629> the<00:04:34.810> top

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
throwing the quadcopter from the top

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.020 
throwing the quadcopter from the top
without<00:04:35.349> the<00:04:35.620> rotor<00:04:35.860> spinning<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.580> then

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
without the rotor spinning and then

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.969 
without the rotor spinning and then
throttling<00:04:37.509> up<00:04:37.659> after<00:04:38.110> it's<00:04:38.229> in<00:04:38.379> flight<00:04:38.680> and

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
throttling up after it's in flight and

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.540 
throttling up after it's in flight and
yet<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.669> still<00:04:40.060> manages<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.840> retain<00:04:41.319> control

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
yet it still manages to retain control

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.740 
yet it still manages to retain control
another<00:04:42.550> thing<00:04:42.879> you'll<00:04:43.030> notice<00:04:43.210> when<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.539> dog

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
another thing you'll notice when the dog

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.020 
another thing you'll notice when the dog
hits<00:04:44.139> and<00:04:44.319> it<00:04:44.409> spins<00:04:44.770> out<00:04:44.979> of<00:04:45.039> control<00:04:45.189> it

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
hits and it spins out of control it

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.270 
hits and it spins out of control it
regains<00:04:46.479> control<00:04:46.659> rather<00:04:47.169> quickly<00:04:47.710> this<00:04:48.219> is

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
regains control rather quickly this is

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.100 
regains control rather quickly this is
absolutely<00:04:48.849> incredible<00:04:49.000> for<00:04:49.389> a<00:04:49.509> toy<00:04:49.780> quad
