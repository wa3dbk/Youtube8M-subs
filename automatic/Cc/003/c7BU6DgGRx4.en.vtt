chip rich rich runs and software and
software<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.000> written<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.360> these<00:00:42.450> programming

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
software is written in these programming

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.770 
software is written in these programming
languages<00:00:43.530> which<00:00:44.160> are<00:00:44.309> based<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.730> maths<00:00:44.940> and

logic<00:00:48.620> so<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:50.969> there's<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
logic so as you can see here there's a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.910 
logic so as you can see here there's a
robot<00:00:51.660> that's<00:00:51.870> been<00:00:52.050> instructed<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.620> do

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
robot that's been instructed to do

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.250 
robot that's been instructed to do
something<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:54.629> robots<00:00:55.110> been

something and this robots been
instructed<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:55.949> his<00:00:56.100> native<00:00:56.250> language<00:00:56.850> which

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
instructed in his native language which

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.510 
instructed in his native language which
is<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> programming<00:00:57.809> language<00:00:58.160> now<00:00:59.160> I'm<00:00:59.280> sure

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
is a programming language now I'm sure

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.860 
is a programming language now I'm sure
they're<00:00:59.789> not<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.969> lot<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.390> planet<00:01:00.690> that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
they're not a lot on this planet that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.299 
they're not a lot on this planet that
will<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.199> able<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> understand<00:01:01.980> what<00:01:02.160> this

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
will be able to understand what this

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.070 
will be able to understand what this
robot<00:01:02.670> was<00:01:02.789> set<00:01:02.940> out<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.149> D<00:01:03.300> which<00:01:03.930> is

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
robot was set out to D which is

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.950 
robot was set out to D which is
absolutely<00:01:04.320> no<00:01:04.710> problem<00:01:05.240> because<00:01:06.240> not<00:01:06.659> all<00:01:06.689> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
absolutely no problem because not all of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.830 
absolutely no problem because not all of
our<00:01:07.080> skill<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.470> programming<00:01:08.010> languages<00:01:08.840> but

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
our skill and programming languages but

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.980 
our skill and programming languages but
the<00:01:09.900> problem<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.619> think<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.600> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the problem that I think is and that I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.810 
the problem that I think is and that I
don't<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.010> right<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> these

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
don't think is right is that these

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.460 
don't think is right is that these
people<00:01:15.090> won't<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:15.540> able<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.869> communicate<00:01:16.080> with

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
people won't be able to communicate with

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.300 
people won't be able to communicate with
robots<00:01:16.979> which<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.210> day<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.450> age<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:19.310> vital

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
robots which in this day in age is vital

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.640 
robots which in this day in age is vital
I<00:01:20.490> find<00:01:20.850> because<00:01:21.210> technology<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:21.930> evolving<00:01:22.259> so

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
I find because technology is evolving so

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.010 
I find because technology is evolving so
rapidly<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.180> need<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:24.570> computers

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
rapidly and we need to make computers

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.920 
rapidly and we need to make computers
and<00:01:25.140> robots<00:01:25.229> more<00:01:25.530> accessible<00:01:26.720> so<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.869> is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and robots more accessible so this is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.539 
and robots more accessible so this is
the<00:01:27.990> same<00:01:28.229> robot<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> same<00:01:29.009> instruction

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the same robot with the same instruction

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.670 
the same robot with the same instruction
just<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.970> time<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.270> English<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.840> guess<00:01:31.530> this

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
just this time in English I guess this

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.940 
just this time in English I guess this
is<00:01:31.890> more<00:01:32.100> understandable<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.950> this

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
is more understandable and this

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
is more understandable and this
observation<00:01:35.579> has<00:01:35.670> given<00:01:35.939> me<00:01:36.060> an<00:01:36.150> idea<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
observation has given me an idea the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.740 
observation has given me an idea the
idea<00:01:37.140> was<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.759> were<00:01:38.880> possible<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.450> have

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
idea was if it were possible to have

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.780 
idea was if it were possible to have
computers<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.770> robots<00:01:40.890> understand<00:01:41.610> our

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
computers and robots understand our

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.999 
computers and robots understand our
language<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.540> proposed<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.560> learning<00:01:43.860> their

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
language as proposed to learning their

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.030 
language as proposed to learning their
language<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:46.170> asked<00:01:46.439> myself<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.009> question

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
language so I asked myself the question

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.370 
language so I asked myself the question
if<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.000> would<00:01:48.149> be<00:01:48.270> possible<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:49.049> create

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
if it would be possible to create

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.130 
if it would be possible to create
application<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.759> could<00:01:51.000> translate<00:01:51.659> English

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
application that could translate English

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.370 
application that could translate English
sentences<00:01:52.740> into<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:54.270> language<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.079> robot

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
sentences into a language the robot

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.020 
sentences into a language the robot
would<00:01:55.470> understand<00:01:55.950> which<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.340> programming

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
would understand which is programming

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.420 
would understand which is programming
language<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.630> started<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.680> journey<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
language so I started this journey and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.249 
language so I started this journey and
the<00:02:02.460> first<00:02:03.180> step<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.600> doing<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.990> was<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the first step to doing this was to

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.370 
the first step to doing this was to
identify<00:02:04.590> all<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:06.000> key<00:02:06.299> words<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.960> this

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
identify all the the key words this this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.309 
identify all the the key words this this
application<00:02:08.369> should<00:02:08.489> identify<00:02:09.020> relating<00:02:10.020> to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
application should identify relating to

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.710 
application should identify relating to
the<00:02:10.800> actions<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.370> robot<00:02:11.670> can<00:02:11.819> accomplish<00:02:12.150> for

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the actions of robot can accomplish for

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.760 
the actions of robot can accomplish for
example<00:02:13.110> have<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.349> too

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
example have this too

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.220 
example have this too
we<00:02:14.250> all<00:02:14.370> drove<00:02:14.550> out<00:02:14.790> here<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.630> we<00:02:15.840> wanted<00:02:16.080> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
we all drove out here and we wanted to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.210 
we all drove out here and we wanted to
move<00:02:16.380> from<00:02:16.560> point<00:02:16.770> A<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.630> point<00:02:18.630> B<00:02:18.990> now<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:19.950> can

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
move from point A to point B now we can

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.510 
move from point A to point B now we can
use<00:02:20.370> words<00:02:20.610> such<00:02:20.760> as<00:02:20.910> move<00:02:21.360> gah<00:02:21.930> go<00:02:22.560> drive<00:02:23.220> and

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
use words such as move gah go drive and

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.880 
use words such as move gah go drive and
so<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:24.300> accomplish<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.710> was<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
so on to accomplish this so that was the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.790 
so on to accomplish this so that was the
first<00:02:26.130> step<00:02:26.310> now<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.780> second<00:02:28.170> step<00:02:28.380> was<00:02:28.590> to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
first step now the second step was to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.820 
first step now the second step was to
find<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.630> key<00:02:30.630> words<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:30.900> would<00:02:31.350> i<00:02:31.410> dint<00:02:31.680> I

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
find the key words that would i dint I

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.770 
find the key words that would i dint I
mean<00:02:32.070> customize<00:02:32.610> this<00:02:32.790> action<00:02:33.210> for<00:02:33.420> example

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
mean customize this action for example

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.870 
mean customize this action for example
if<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.110> say<00:02:34.320> tell<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.980> robot<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.280> drive

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
if we say tell the robot to drive

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.940 
if we say tell the robot to drive
forward<00:02:36.180> that's<00:02:36.840> that's<00:02:37.230> very<00:02:37.320> rough

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
forward that's that's very rough

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.530 
forward that's that's very rough
explanation<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.700> what<00:02:38.850> we<00:02:38.970> want<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.270> robot<00:02:39.480> to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
explanation of what we want the robot to

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.750 
explanation of what we want the robot to
D<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.350> we<00:02:40.590> can<00:02:40.740> say<00:02:40.890> robot<00:02:41.070> drive<00:02:41.370> forward<00:02:41.640> very

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
D so we can say robot drive forward very

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.670 
D so we can say robot drive forward very
fast<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.510> how<00:02:42.750> should<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.080> robot<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:43.500> this

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
fast so how should the robot do this

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.710 
fast so how should the robot do this
very<00:02:43.950> fast<00:02:44.310> when<00:02:44.730> should<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> robot<00:02:45.420> do<00:02:45.540> this

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
very fast when should the robot do this

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.600 
very fast when should the robot do this
once<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.080> clap<00:02:46.260> my<00:02:46.290> hands<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.920> sound<00:02:47.460> is

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
once I clap my hands and the sound is

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.000 
once I clap my hands and the sound is
heard<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.060> son<00:02:48.350> said<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.470> was<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.680> second

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
heard and son said that was the second

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.730 
heard and son said that was the second
step<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.510> finally<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.780> won't<00:02:52.230> go<00:02:52.350> into<00:02:52.380> much

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
step and finally I won't go into much

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.040 
step and finally I won't go into much
detail<00:02:52.770> about<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:54.270> designed<00:02:54.930> these

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
detail about this I I designed these

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.140 
detail about this I I designed these
algorithms<00:02:55.290> step-by-step<00:02:56.250> procedures<00:02:56.850> and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
algorithms step-by-step procedures and

thank you Thanks thank you so being a
fun<00:04:12.709> tool<00:04:13.040> there<00:04:13.310> are<00:04:13.459> real<00:04:13.700> life

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
fun tool there are real life

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.020 
fun tool there are real life
applications<00:04:14.569> that<00:04:14.810> emerge<00:04:15.079> from<00:04:15.349> this<00:04:15.699> so<00:04:16.699> my

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
applications that emerge from this so my

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.620 
applications that emerge from this so my
parents<00:04:17.269> are<00:04:17.660> both<00:04:17.810> doctors<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.889> I<00:04:19.479> hear<00:04:20.479> them

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
parents are both doctors and I hear them

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.600 
parents are both doctors and I hear them
talk<00:04:20.840> about<00:04:20.870> lack<00:04:21.500> of<00:04:21.530> nurses<00:04:22.039> in<00:04:22.070> Africa

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
talk about lack of nurses in Africa

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.029 
talk about lack of nurses in Africa
especially<00:04:22.759> in<00:04:23.150> rural<00:04:23.270> areas<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:24.650> thinking

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
especially in rural areas so thinking

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.680 
especially in rural areas so thinking
well<00:04:25.220> maybe<00:04:25.250> we'll<00:04:25.759> have<00:04:25.850> robots<00:04:26.330> there<00:04:26.539> one

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
well maybe we'll have robots there one

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.270 
well maybe we'll have robots there one
day<00:04:26.870> that<00:04:27.110> will<00:04:27.139> assist<00:04:27.470> doctors<00:04:28.009> and

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
day that will assist doctors and

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.870 
day that will assist doctors and
patients<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.910> so<00:04:29.060> on<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:30.340> some<00:04:31.340> our<00:04:31.490> people

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
patients and so on and some our people

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.760 
patients and so on and some our people
would<00:04:32.000> have<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.449> interact<00:04:32.810> with<00:04:33.199> these<00:04:33.320> robots

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
would have to interact with these robots

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.409 
would have to interact with these robots
so<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.160> was<00:04:34.340> thinking<00:04:34.490> well<00:04:34.850> maybe<00:04:34.880> we<00:04:35.270> could

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
so I was thinking well maybe we could

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.170 
so I was thinking well maybe we could
apply<00:04:35.600> this<00:04:35.720> technology<00:04:36.169> to<00:04:36.410> these<00:04:36.680> robots<00:04:37.180> so

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
apply this technology to these robots so

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.310 
apply this technology to these robots so
I've<00:04:38.360> been<00:04:38.539> playing<00:04:38.750> around<00:04:38.900> with<00:04:39.110> this

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
I've been playing around with this

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.680 
I've been playing around with this
thought<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.680> little<00:04:39.919> and<00:04:40.280> I've<00:04:41.060> I've<00:04:41.479> bought

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
thought a little and I've I've bought

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.430 
thought a little and I've I've bought
this<00:04:41.840> prototype<00:04:42.229> that<00:04:42.650> I<00:04:43.160> wish<00:04:43.820> can<00:04:44.750> well

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
this prototype that I wish can well

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.409 
this prototype that I wish can well
we'll<00:04:46.070> be<00:04:46.220> able<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.550> one<00:04:46.789> day<00:04:46.820> accomplish

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
we'll be able to one day accomplish

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.080 
we'll be able to one day accomplish
these<00:04:47.570> tasks<00:04:47.800> so<00:04:48.800> for<00:04:49.400> example<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.789> bedridden

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
these tasks so for example the bedridden

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.580 
these tasks so for example the bedridden
patient<00:04:50.600> could<00:04:50.750> say<00:04:50.900> something<00:04:50.960> along<00:04:51.350> the

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
patient could say something along the

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.560 
patient could say something along the
lines<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:51.949> robot<00:04:52.639> fetch<00:04:52.940> me<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.150> bowl<00:04:53.300> of<00:04:53.330> water

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
lines of robot fetch me a bowl of water

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.650 
lines of robot fetch me a bowl of water
and<00:04:53.960> pour<00:04:54.320> it<00:04:54.349> into<00:04:54.620> my<00:04:54.800> glass<00:04:54.949> so<00:04:55.910> let<00:04:56.449> me<00:04:56.539> show

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
and pour it into my glass so let me show

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:14.810 
and pour it into my glass so let me show
this<00:04:56.840> video<00:05:00.849> so<00:05:01.849> this<00:05:02.030> is<00:05:02.060> a<00:05:02.150> robot<00:05:02.389> a<00:05:02.449> boat

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:22.530
