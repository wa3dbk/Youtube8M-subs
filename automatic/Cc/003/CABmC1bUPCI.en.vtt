00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.090
 today we are going to make a pizza and we 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.700
 we have a very special guest here 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.510
 what are you going to help us 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.310
 Okay, so let's talk to 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.189
 this recipe we will need 500 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.630
 grams of wheat flour a spoonful of 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:37.250
 sugar soup each baking cups 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:41.390
 biological dry oregano to taste salt to 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.000
 I like two tablespoons of olive oil and 250 250 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.580
 ml of warm water 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.640
 we then start a canister with 500 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.120
 with 500 grams of wheat flour and 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:03.830
 People are going to add sugar, please honey. 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:06.049
 sugar yeast even put sugar 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.700
 This faith is even putting sugar 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.670
 this recipe will not get sweet 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.509
 the sugar is just to help activate the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.189
 yeast 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:20.469
 then we will put the oregano in the dough 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.469
 stay cool can put 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:38.049
 because they deny you, put a 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:41.920
 little salt is not good 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:45.789
 the load of salt we will put two 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.060
 spoons of olive oil you open 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.060
 on here 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.720
 instead of the olive oil can be placed the 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:12.210
 oil but with us is tastier and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.010
 Now we'll put water on. 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.670
 slowly pouring water as people 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.670
 go stir 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.670
 the dough is ready 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.599
 Now just let rest December 15 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.970
 minutes 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:13.050
 she will double in size and leave ready 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.239
 we open after 15 minutes our 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.560
 mass has grown and we will open it 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.390
 will prepare our pizza 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.430
 the stuff that we are going to prepare is 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.620
 Marguerita and to make this pizza 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.280
 Marguerite, people need tomatoes. 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.410
 peeled parmesan cheese mozzarella cheese 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.810
 basil and oregano 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.950
 it's a first step we're here to separate 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.769
 pasta 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:42.799
 It opens the disc will always 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.799
 using the flour of the square do not stick 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.129
 after the open mass we will measure 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.870
 then size the disk and cut it 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:04.190
 greater than our shape so that the 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.190
 people can make the stuffed border 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.510
 to leave the disk right here with 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:22.140
 this disk then we start from 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.490
 from the border to work we will use a 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.980
 Cream cheese 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.510
 then we go through here curd 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.510
 all over the edge 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.490
 now we put our 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.490
 pizza on the disk 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.350
 here on our disk so we'll go 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.920
 start filling the base first with the 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:12.370
 peeled tomato does not need to add anything 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.470
 It's just okay and peeled tomato that he 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.310
 will drop enough juice will stay with 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.150
 This little piece here to make our base 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.150
 spread through all of this 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.570
 Now we're going to put the cheese. 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.570
 mozzarella 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:54.629
 now we will add the 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:54.629
 basil and now parmesan cheese 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:06:00.000
 Parmesan cheese because it has a taste 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.000
 much stronger 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.840
 he has a very tasty head 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:15.069
 we'll get the rest of the tomato 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:24.400
 we live that is the trademark of the 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:26.259
 pizza marguerita plays well from always 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.610
