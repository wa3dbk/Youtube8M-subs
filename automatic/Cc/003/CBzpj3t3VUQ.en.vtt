00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
don't necessarily feel the movement of

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:30.880 
don't necessarily feel the movement of
the<00:00:16.880> of<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.090> boat<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.720> can<00:00:18.930> see<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.140> movement

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.490 

I<00:00:31.670> find<00:00:32.000> for<00:00:32.180> me<00:00:32.300> I<00:00:32.509> do<00:00:32.570> a<00:00:32.689> little<00:00:32.870> better<00:00:33.079> with

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
I find for me I do a little better with

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.770 
I find for me I do a little better with
twisting<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.370> knob<00:00:34.550> more<00:00:34.879> than<00:00:35.059> pushing<00:00:35.690> the

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
twisting the knob more than pushing the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.689 
twisting the knob more than pushing the
knob<00:00:35.960> yeah<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:36.650> I<00:00:36.800> get<00:00:36.949> old<00:00:37.070> better<00:00:37.250> control

the<00:00:49.850> learning<00:00:50.150> curve<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:50.600> know<00:00:50.780> board<00:00:51.110> is

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
the learning curve you know board is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.390 
the learning curve you know board is
good<00:00:51.470> because<00:00:51.980> that<00:00:52.010> means<00:00:52.129> you're

that's really something that's really
nice<00:01:05.740> it's<00:01:06.740> not<00:01:06.890> using<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:07.280> thruster<00:01:07.580> on<00:01:07.610> the

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
nice it's not using the thruster on the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.420 
nice it's not using the thruster on the
back<00:01:07.909> isn't<00:01:08.420> you<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:08.869> is<00:01:09.170> what<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.040> have<00:01:10.189> one

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
it sounds so the butters right now could

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.960 
it sounds so the butters right now could
work<00:01:12.590> independently<00:01:13.189> of<00:01:13.280> each<00:01:13.400> other<00:01:13.580> the

we put it in a dynamic positioning the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.820 
we put it in a dynamic positioning the
wind<00:01:54.330> you'll<00:01:54.630> hear<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.050> motors<00:01:55.380> kicking<00:01:55.710> up

with those forty hour winds we were on
the<00:02:02.520> other<00:02:02.700> side<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.360> turn<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.659> back

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
the other side we can turn it back

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.740 
the other side we can turn it back

according up deposition positioning is

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.080 
according up deposition positioning is
what<00:02:10.780> they<00:02:10.899> call<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.320> yes<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.490> that's<00:02:12.640> locking
