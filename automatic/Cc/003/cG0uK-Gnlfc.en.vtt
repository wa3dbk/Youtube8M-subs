show additional plans here at the bottom
and<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.630> want<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> select<00:01:25.020> high<00:01:25.560> performance

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and we want to select high performance

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.190 
and we want to select high performance
mode<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:27.270> it'll<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.869> it'll

basically<00:01:28.470> make<00:01:29.009> sure<00:01:29.130> my<00:01:29.310> computer<00:01:29.700> is

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
basically make sure my computer is

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
basically make sure my computer is
always<00:01:30.119> running<00:01:30.360> at<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> top<00:01:30.900> performance<00:01:31.560> no

always running at the top performance no
matter<00:01:32.009> what<00:01:32.460> my<00:01:32.759> system<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.240> set<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.390> for

matter what my system is set up for

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.690 
matter what my system is set up for
again<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:34.860> reduce<00:01:35.130> your<00:01:35.220> battery<00:01:35.520> life

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
again this will reduce your battery life
