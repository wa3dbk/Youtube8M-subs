00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.579 

for<00:00:05.609> drainage<00:00:06.000> in<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.210> landscape<00:00:06.839> areas<00:00:07.350> we

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
for drainage in the landscape areas we

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.919 
for drainage in the landscape areas we
use<00:00:07.770> what<00:00:08.010> are<00:00:08.040> called<00:00:08.160> catch<00:00:08.639> basins<00:00:09.300> now

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
use what are called catch basins now

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.570 
use what are called catch basins now
there<00:00:10.170> are<00:00:10.230> two<00:00:10.349> different<00:00:10.500> ways<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.160> do<00:00:11.370> this

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
there are two different ways to do this

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.060 
there are two different ways to do this
but<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.969> prefer<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.540> catch<00:00:12.750> basin<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.799> first

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
but I prefer the catch basin the first

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.519 
but I prefer the catch basin the first
way<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.089> three<00:00:15.509> or<00:00:15.660> four<00:00:15.929> inch<00:00:15.960> pipe

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
way is to have a three or four inch pipe

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.830 
way is to have a three or four inch pipe
that<00:00:17.190> comes<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.850> surface<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.660> has<00:00:18.810> a

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
that comes to the surface and it has a

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.750 
that comes to the surface and it has a
grade<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.470> top<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.100> would<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
grade on top like you would have in the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.660 
grade on top like you would have in the
patio<00:00:21.090> shot<00:00:21.740> what<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.769> prefer<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.310> what's

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
patio shot what I prefer is what's

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.000 
patio shot what I prefer is what's
called<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.060> catch<00:00:24.269> basin<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.410> main<00:00:25.619> reason

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
called a catch basin and the main reason

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.429 
called a catch basin and the main reason
we<00:00:26.130> prefer<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.029> because<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.230> catch

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
we prefer that is because in a catch

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.130 
we prefer that is because in a catch
basin<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.609> water<00:00:29.880> can<00:00:30.179> fall<00:00:30.449> into<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> catch

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
basin the water can fall into the catch

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.709 
basin the water can fall into the catch
basin<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:32.250> will<00:00:32.399> be<00:00:32.550> dirty<00:00:32.820> because<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.510> got

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
basin it will be dirty because it's got

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.170 
basin it will be dirty because it's got
different<00:00:33.930> debris<00:00:34.530> from<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> landscape<00:00:35.969> and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
different debris from the landscape and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.690 
different debris from the landscape and
the<00:00:36.960> debris<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.530> settle<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.129> bottom<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the debris can settle to the bottom of

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.330 
the debris can settle to the bottom of
the<00:00:38.820> catch<00:00:39.030> basin<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.440> water<00:00:40.710> comes<00:00:41.100> up

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the catch basin and the water comes up

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.400 
the catch basin and the water comes up
and<00:00:41.610> then<00:00:41.850> goes<00:00:42.059> out<00:00:42.270> into<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> pipe<00:00:42.960> clean

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
and then goes out into the pipe clean

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.520 
and then goes out into the pipe clean
also<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:45.000> enables<00:00:45.660> me<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.020> use<00:00:46.200> what's<00:00:46.440> called

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
also it enables me to use what's called

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.520 
also it enables me to use what's called
an<00:00:46.860> atrium<00:00:47.340> grate<00:00:47.640> an<00:00:48.180> atrium<00:00:48.899> grade<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.379> you

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
an atrium grate an atrium grade as you

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.150 
an atrium grate an atrium grade as you
can<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:49.980> raises<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.670> above<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.239> landscape

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
can see raises up above the landscape

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.209 
can see raises up above the landscape
debris<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.430> cover<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.090> sides<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.750> then

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
debris can cover the sides and then

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.160 
debris can cover the sides and then
water<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.370> still<00:00:56.850> flow<00:00:57.120> over<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.570> top<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
water can still flow over the top of the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.670 
water can still flow over the top of the
debris<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:59.340> into<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> catch<00:01:00.000> basin<00:01:00.680> when

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
debris and get into the catch basin when

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.700 
debris and get into the catch basin when
we<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.949> lawn<00:01:02.219> areas<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:03.090> use<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.660> flat<00:01:04.229> grate

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
we have lawn areas we use a flat grate

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.520 
we have lawn areas we use a flat grate
the<00:01:05.100> flat<00:01:05.400> grate<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.939> fine<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.930> lawn<00:01:07.140> area

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the flat grate is fine in a lawn area

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.950 
the flat grate is fine in a lawn area
because<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> lawn<00:01:08.250> stays<00:01:08.670> cleaner<00:01:09.119> doesn't

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
because the lawn stays cleaner doesn't

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.780 
because the lawn stays cleaner doesn't
really<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.350> leaves<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.640> that's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
really have leaves in it and so that's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.210 
really have leaves in it and so that's
not<00:01:12.090> getting<00:01:12.720> covered<00:01:13.290> with<00:01:13.470> leaves<00:01:13.740> isn't<00:01:14.159> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
not getting covered with leaves isn't a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.760 
not getting covered with leaves isn't a
real<00:01:14.430> concern<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.689> if<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:15.990> use<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
real concern but if we use this in the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.039 
real concern but if we use this in the
landscape<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.150> only<00:01:18.270> take<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:18.869> or<00:01:19.020> two

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
landscape it can only take one or two

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.140 
landscape it can only take one or two
leaves<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.799> cover<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.280> top<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
leaves to cover the top of this and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.840 
leaves to cover the top of this and
render<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.810> inoperable<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> that's<00:01:23.460> why<00:01:23.670> we

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
render it inoperable so that's why we

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.820 
render it inoperable so that's why we
use<00:01:23.880> an<00:01:24.210> atrium<00:01:24.689> grate<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> landscape

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
use an atrium grate in the landscape

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.190 
use an atrium grate in the landscape
area<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:29.509> debris<00:01:30.509> falls<00:01:30.900> into

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
area as you can see debris falls into

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.550 
area as you can see debris falls into
the<00:01:31.470> bottom<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:34.140> settles

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the bottom of this and then that settles

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.679 
the bottom of this and then that settles
at<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.890> bottom<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.610> water<00:01:35.850> comes<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
at the bottom and the water comes up and

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.380 
at the bottom and the water comes up and
goes<00:01:36.900> clean<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.579> main<00:01:38.790> reason<00:01:39.030> we

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
goes clean so this is the main reason we

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.850 
goes clean so this is the main reason we
want<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> use<00:01:39.720> catch<00:01:40.110> basins<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
want to use catch basins in the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.910 
want to use catch basins in the
landscape<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> quick<00:01:43.290> shot<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.619> an

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
landscape this is a quick shot of an

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.490 
landscape this is a quick shot of an
area<00:01:44.220> drain<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.659> main<00:01:45.810> things<00:01:46.140> here

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
area drain one of the main things here

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.770 
area drain one of the main things here
we<00:01:46.619> want<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> look<00:01:46.950> at<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.549> having<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
we want to look at is having it with a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.789 
we want to look at is having it with a
brass<00:01:49.200> cover

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
brass cover

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.490 
brass cover
now<00:01:50.220> many<00:01:50.490> patios<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.930> plastic

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
now many patios that I see have plastic

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.859 
now many patios that I see have plastic
covers<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.189> unfortunately<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> Sun<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
covers but unfortunately in the Sun the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.440 
covers but unfortunately in the Sun the
plastic<00:01:55.380> becomes<00:01:55.710> brittle<00:01:56.100> only<00:01:56.909> takes<00:01:57.180> one

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450

through one of those so I like to make

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.399 
through one of those so I like to make
sure<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.189> use<00:02:02.219> brass<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.360> also<00:02:03.540> looks<00:02:03.930> nicer

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
sure we use brass it also looks nicer

important thing about drain line is to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.770 
important thing about drain line is to
make<00:02:13.340> sure<00:02:13.550> that<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.940> water<00:02:14.240> can<00:02:14.570> move

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
make sure that the water can move

especially during high flow when it's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.770 
especially during high flow when it's
really<00:02:18.740> coming<00:02:19.220> down<00:02:19.250> we<00:02:20.120> don't<00:02:20.360> want<00:02:20.570> any

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
really coming down we don't want any

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.160 
really coming down we don't want any
debris<00:02:21.140> or<00:02:21.230> interruptions<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.400> system

older jobs this job that's being redone
right<00:02:34.160> now<00:02:34.430> they<00:02:34.730> had<00:02:34.970> this<00:02:35.180> in<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.540> ground

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.890 
right now they had this in the ground
and<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.560> can<00:02:36.770> see<00:02:37.010> some<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.550> reasons<00:02:38.000> why

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
and you can see some of the reasons why

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.640 
and you can see some of the reasons why
we<00:02:39.170> don't<00:02:39.320> use<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:41.150> been<00:02:42.050> partially

trapped in these Coria Gatien x' starts
to<00:03:01.400> build<00:03:01.580> up<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.180> then<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:02.780> get<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.320> lot<00:03:03.680> less

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
to build up and then you get a lot less

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.820 
to build up and then you get a lot less
movement<00:03:04.640> also<00:03:05.180> it's<00:03:05.780> harder<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.380> get<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.590> good

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
movement also it's harder to get a good

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.400 
movement also it's harder to get a good
slope<00:03:07.310> on<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:07.850> because<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:08.510> flexible<00:03:09.140> it

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
slope on this because it's flexible it

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.710 
slope on this because it's flexible it
will<00:03:09.739> tend<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.130> undulate<00:03:10.730> in<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.120> bottom<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.630> a

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
will tend to undulate in the bottom of a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.199 
will tend to undulate in the bottom of a
trench<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.320> again<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.100> traps<00:03:13.370> water<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.120> it

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
trench and again it traps water and it

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.540 
trench and again it traps water and it
moves<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.870> water<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.320> lot<00:03:15.620> less<00:03:15.860> efficiently

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
moves the water a lot less efficiently

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.570 
moves the water a lot less efficiently
through<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.820> system<00:03:17.830> over<00:03:18.830> here<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.310> see

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
through the system over here you see

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.820 
through the system over here you see
where<00:03:19.850> we've<00:03:20.000> tied<00:03:20.299> in<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.570> downspout<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.290> some

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
where we've tied in a downspout to some

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.550 
where we've tied in a downspout to some
drain<00:03:22.130> line<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:23.150> this<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:24.019> downspout

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
adapter once that gets into the ground

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.490 
adapter once that gets into the ground
we<00:03:28.340> like<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.760> use<00:03:29.000> what's<00:03:29.269> called<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.780> sweep<00:03:30.230> or

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
we like to use what's called a sweep or

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.600 
we like to use what's called a sweep or
a<00:03:30.530> why<00:03:31.209> this<00:03:32.209> has<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.480> 45<00:03:33.320> feeding<00:03:33.890> into<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.430> and

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
a why this has a 45 feeding into it and

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.820 
a why this has a 45 feeding into it and
the<00:03:34.670> reason<00:03:35.060> we<00:03:35.150> use<00:03:35.390> these<00:03:35.690> instead<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.320> a<00:03:36.500> tee

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
the reason we use these instead of a tee

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.640 
the reason we use these instead of a tee
is<00:03:37.130> so<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.030> water<00:03:38.299> is<00:03:38.630> moving<00:03:38.690> in<00:03:39.410> more

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
is so that the water is moving in more

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.250 
is so that the water is moving in more
of<00:03:39.739> a<00:03:39.830> fluid<00:03:40.280> way<00:03:40.519> if<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:41.360> water<00:03:41.630> can<00:03:41.959> move

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
of a fluid way if the water can move

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.620 
of a fluid way if the water can move
this<00:03:42.500> way<00:03:42.799> through<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.340> pipe<00:03:43.640> it's<00:03:44.239> going<00:03:44.540> to

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
this way through the pipe it's going to

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.630 
this way through the pipe it's going to
flow<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:44.959> lot<00:03:45.260> better<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:45.920> it's<00:03:46.070> also<00:03:46.280> going<00:03:46.579> to

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
flow a lot better and it's also going to

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.610

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
elements that I'd like to cover now

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.370 
elements that I'd like to cover now
whenever<00:04:32.760> we<00:04:33.030> have<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.270> down<00:04:33.600> slope<00:04:33.960> into<00:04:34.350> the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
back of a retaining wall what we want to

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.960 
back of a retaining wall what we want to
do<00:04:37.410> is<00:04:37.590> relieve<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.190> pressure<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.790> builds

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
do is relieve the pressure that builds

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.090 
do is relieve the pressure that builds
up<00:04:39.300> from<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.660> weight<00:04:39.870> of<00:04:39.900> water<00:04:40.320> from<00:04:40.800> behind

up from the weight of water from behind
that<00:04:41.370> wall<00:04:41.730> so<00:04:42.450> what<00:04:43.050> we<00:04:43.170> see<00:04:43.410> here<00:04:43.890> is<00:04:44.040> a

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
that wall so what we see here is a

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.030 
that wall so what we see here is a
French<00:04:44.490> drain<00:04:45.260> configuration<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.470> if<00:04:46.890> you

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
French drain configuration and if you

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.190 
French drain configuration and if you
look<00:04:47.220> at<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.490> diagram<00:04:47.700> you'll<00:04:48.570> see<00:04:48.840> some<00:04:49.080> of

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
look at the diagram you'll see some of

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.200 
look at the diagram you'll see some of
the<00:04:49.320> three<00:04:49.560> elements<00:04:49.710> that<00:04:50.130> make<00:04:50.460> that<00:04:50.700> up

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
the three elements that make that up

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.480 
the three elements that make that up
you<00:04:51.540> have<00:04:51.750> perforated<00:04:52.530> drain<00:04:52.800> line<00:04:53.130> at<00:04:53.370> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
you have perforated drain line at the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.040 
you have perforated drain line at the
bottom<00:04:53.880> of<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.150> French<00:04:54.420> drain<00:04:54.750> which

collects the water as it settles to the
bottom<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.690> this<00:04:57.870> drain<00:04:58.200> you<00:04:58.980> have<00:04:59.160> gravel

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
bottom of this drain you have gravel

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
bottom of this drain you have gravel
which<00:05:00.210> allows<00:05:00.540> air<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.050> enter<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.590> drain

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
which allows air to enter the drain

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.390 
which allows air to enter the drain
configuration<00:05:03.930> so<00:05:04.169> that<00:05:04.200> water<00:05:04.620> will<00:05:04.919> drop<00:05:05.130> to

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
configuration so that water will drop to

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.909 
configuration so that water will drop to
the<00:05:05.520> bottom<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.120> then<00:05:06.600> you<00:05:06.750> have<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.260> filter

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
the bottom and then you have a filter

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.850 
the bottom and then you have a filter
cloth<00:05:08.220> wrapping<00:05:08.910> around<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.840> gravel<00:05:10.350> bed<00:05:10.590> as

drain configuration the other element
that's<00:05:18.419> common<00:05:18.930> is<00:05:19.110> a<00:05:19.140> water<00:05:19.680> backing<00:05:20.370> or

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
that's common is a water backing or

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.720 
that's common is a water backing or
something<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.300> will<00:05:21.480> make<00:05:22.220> the<00:05:23.220> back<00:05:23.430> of<00:05:23.640> the

something that will make the back of the
wall<00:05:24.000> watertight<00:05:24.840> there's<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.590> few<00:05:25.860> different

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
wall watertight there's a few different

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.480 
wall watertight there's a few different
ways<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.640> do<00:05:26.850> that<00:05:27.090> we<00:05:27.270> can<00:05:27.480> either<00:05:27.660> use<00:05:28.020> like<00:05:28.350> a

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
ways to do that we can either use like a

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.950 
ways to do that we can either use like a
asphalt<00:05:29.490> emulsion<00:05:29.669> that<00:05:30.240> is<00:05:30.540> actually

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
asphalt emulsion that is actually

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.500 
asphalt emulsion that is actually
painted<00:05:31.470> on<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.740> back<00:05:31.950> of<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.250> wall<00:05:32.490> or<00:05:32.820> as<00:05:33.300> we

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
painted on the back of the wall or as we

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.719 
painted on the back of the wall or as we
see<00:05:33.750> here<00:05:34.229> there's<00:05:34.500> actually<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:35.160> rubber

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
see here there's actually a rubber

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.560 
see here there's actually a rubber
membrane<00:05:36.110> that's<00:05:37.110> been<00:05:37.970> nailed<00:05:38.970> to<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.360> back

or a concrete slab for that matter and
when<00:06:00.900> the<00:06:01.080> water<00:06:01.350> moves<00:06:01.500> through<00:06:01.950> the<00:06:02.190> wall

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
when the water moves through the wall

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.690 
when the water moves through the wall
surface<00:06:02.970> it<00:06:03.720> brings<00:06:04.140> lime<00:06:04.620> and<00:06:04.860> calcium<00:06:05.430> with

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
surface it brings lime and calcium with

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.820 
surface it brings lime and calcium with
it<00:06:05.910> this<00:06:06.360> is<00:06:06.419> a<00:06:06.600> clean-out<00:06:07.080> which<00:06:07.590> also

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
it this is a clean-out which also

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.920 
it this is a clean-out which also
connects<00:06:08.490> to<00:06:08.700> the<00:06:08.820> bottom<00:06:09.180> line<00:06:09.479> and<00:06:09.810> what

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
connects to the bottom line and what

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.440 
connects to the bottom line and what
this<00:06:10.110> allows<00:06:10.500> is<00:06:10.830> for<00:06:11.520> somebody<00:06:11.850> to<00:06:12.090> come<00:06:12.419> in

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
this allows is for somebody to come in

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.450 
this allows is for somebody to come in
and<00:06:12.810> maintain<00:06:13.260> that<00:06:13.290> French<00:06:13.890> drain<00:06:14.250> by

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
and maintain that French drain by

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.610 
and maintain that French drain by
flushing<00:06:14.970> water<00:06:15.210> through<00:06:15.630> it<00:06:15.780> this<00:06:15.960> goes<00:06:16.229> down

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
flushing water through it this goes down

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.920 
flushing water through it this goes down
and<00:06:16.860> forms<00:06:17.190> a<00:06:17.340> why<00:06:17.640> right<00:06:18.060> into<00:06:18.419> that<00:06:18.540> French

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
and forms a why right into that French

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.290 
and forms a why right into that French
drain<00:06:19.229> line<00:06:19.530> and<00:06:19.800> they<00:06:20.190> can<00:06:20.340> flush<00:06:20.640> water<00:06:20.940> and

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
drain line and they can flush water and

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.270 
drain line and they can flush water and
any<00:06:21.450> debris<00:06:21.690> that<00:06:21.900> may<00:06:22.200> build<00:06:22.500> up<00:06:22.710> out<00:06:22.950> of<00:06:23.160> the

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
any debris that may build up out of the

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.580 
any debris that may build up out of the
line<00:06:23.490> so<00:06:24.270> those<00:06:24.660> are<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:24.930> components<00:06:25.530> that

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
line so those are the components that

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.820 
line so those are the components that
make<00:06:25.710> up<00:06:25.890> a<00:06:26.220> French<00:06:26.490> drain
