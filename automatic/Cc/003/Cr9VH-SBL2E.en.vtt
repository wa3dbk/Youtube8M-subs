00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
okay Mike here on guns cars and digits

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.599 
okay Mike here on guns cars and digits
I'm<00:00:03.929> going<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.140> show<00:00:04.290> you<00:00:04.380> guys<00:00:04.560> how<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:05.009> tune

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
I'm going to show you guys how to tune

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.430 
I'm going to show you guys how to tune
your<00:00:05.640> car<00:00:06.120> for<00:00:06.480> top<00:00:06.720> speed<00:00:09.019> so<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.139> will<00:00:10.320> only

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
your car for top speed so this will only

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.740 
your car for top speed so this will only
set<00:00:10.860> your<00:00:11.070> sixth<00:00:11.519> gear<00:00:11.820> because<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.599> is

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
set your sixth gear because this is

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.450 
set your sixth gear because this is
usually<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.380> gear<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.799> you're<00:00:13.950> trying<00:00:14.280> to

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
usually the gear that you're trying to

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.779 
usually the gear that you're trying to
use<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.470> this<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.770> way<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.039> goes<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.670> need

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
use and this is the way it goes you need

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.230 
use and this is the way it goes you need
to<00:00:17.910> know<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:19.080> horsepower<00:00:19.650> rpm<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:21.090> need

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
to know the horsepower rpm and you need

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.970 
to know the horsepower rpm and you need
to<00:00:21.359> know<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.689> tire<00:00:21.960> size

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.769 

the<00:00:25.980> reason<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.369> tire<00:00:26.609> sizes<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.300> important

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the reason the tire sizes is important

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.630 
the reason the tire sizes is important
is<00:00:27.900> if<00:00:28.080> you'll<00:00:28.230> notice<00:00:28.470> there's<00:00:28.769> an<00:00:28.949> R<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.250> this

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
is if you'll notice there's an R in this

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.400 
is if you'll notice there's an R in this
equation<00:00:30.359> that's<00:00:30.480> radius<00:00:31.759> so<00:00:32.840> here<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.989> go

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
equation that's radius so here you go

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.620 
equation that's radius so here you go
to<00:00:34.980> find<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> radius<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.820> need<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.270> use<00:00:36.420> your

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
to find the radius you need to use your

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.330 
to find the radius you need to use your
tire<00:00:36.809> size<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.160> 235<00:00:38.879> 75<00:00:39.570> 15

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
tire size for this one it's 235 75 15

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.459 
tire size for this one it's 235 75 15
this<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> width<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> tire<00:00:42.420> right<00:00:43.140> here

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
this is the width of the tire right here

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.610 
this is the width of the tire right here
and<00:00:43.649> that's<00:00:44.219> measured<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.760> millimeters<00:00:45.620> this

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
and that's measured in millimeters this

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.100 
and that's measured in millimeters this
one<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.520> percentage<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.390> width<00:00:48.690> that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
one is the percentage of the width that

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.260 
one is the percentage of the width that
the<00:00:49.500> sidewall<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.579> side<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.090> tire

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the sidewall is the side of the tire

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.139 
the sidewall is the side of the tire
that<00:00:51.480> usually<00:00:51.750> has<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> letters<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:53.149> so

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
that usually has the letters on it so

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
that usually has the letters on it so
like<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.199> multiply<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.309> by<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
like if you multiply this one by the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.000 
like if you multiply this one by the
decimal<00:00:57.180> version<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.899> one<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.320> 235

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
decimal version of this one it's 235

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.369 
decimal version of this one it's 235
times<00:00:59.309> 0.75<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.629> give<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.079> hundred<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
times 0.75 to give you one hundred and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.979 
times 0.75 to give you one hundred and
seventy<00:01:01.680> six<00:01:01.859> point<00:01:02.039> two<00:01:02.280> five<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.870> you

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
seventy six point two five and then you

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.800 
seventy six point two five and then you
divide<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.559> by<00:01:04.890> 25<00:01:05.549> point<00:01:05.909> four<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.630> it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
divide that by 25 point four to get it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.440 
divide that by 25 point four to get it
in<00:01:06.900> inches<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.939> that's<00:01:11.939> what<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.270> little

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
in inches so that's what this little

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.070 
in inches so that's what this little
equation<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.820> kind<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.180> put

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
equation is here so you can kind of put

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.080 
equation is here so you can kind of put
it<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> good<00:01:16.350> use<00:01:21.590> if<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.340> want<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.640> find<00:01:23.880> out

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
it to good use if you want to find out

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.090 
it to good use if you want to find out
how<00:01:24.330> fast<00:01:24.659> your<00:01:25.049> car<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.560> go<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.950> particular

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
how fast your car can go in a particular

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.499 
how fast your car can go in a particular
gear<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.650> rev<00:01:28.890> limit<00:01:29.280> rpm<00:01:29.820> which

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
gear you use the the rev limit rpm which

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.270 
gear you use the the rev limit rpm which
is<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.710> gives<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.040> redline

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
is up here for as it gives you a redline

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.310 
is up here for as it gives you a redline
rpm<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.299> number<00:01:33.540> doesn't<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:33.930> anything

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
rpm but that number doesn't do anything

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.200 
rpm but that number doesn't do anything
so<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:34.770> use<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.130> rev<00:01:35.280> limit<00:01:35.579> rpm<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
so we use the rev limit rpm that you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.100 
so we use the rev limit rpm that you
find<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:36.750> own<00:01:37.640> since<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> rev<00:01:39.390> limit<00:01:39.630> rpm

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
find on your own since the rev limit rpm

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.569 
find on your own since the rev limit rpm
times<00:01:40.939> 60<00:01:41.939> times<00:01:42.150> two<00:01:43.049> times<00:01:43.470> pi<00:01:43.799> times<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
times 60 times two times pi times the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.499 
times 60 times two times pi times the
radius<00:01:44.869> that's<00:01:45.869> drawn<00:01:46.409> down<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:47.240> but<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.270> put

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
radius that's drawn down here but I put

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.090 
radius that's drawn down here but I put
circumference<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.649> know<00:01:49.860> what<00:01:50.009> I'm

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
circumference here so you know what I'm

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.940 
circumference here so you know what I'm
talking<00:01:50.490> about<00:01:51.170> then<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.290> divide<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.649> by

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
talking about then you divide that by

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.760 
talking about then you divide that by
the<00:01:53.340> gear<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.149> you're<00:01:54.329> using<00:01:54.770> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
the gear that you're using the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.389 
the gear that you're using the
differential<00:01:56.310> ratio<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.030> you're<00:01:57.240> using<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
differential ratio that you're using and

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.740 
differential ratio that you're using and
then<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.579> divide<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.880> by<00:02:00.149> 12<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
then you divide that by 12 and you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.469 
then you divide that by 12 and you
divided<00:02:00.990> by<00:02:01.170> 5,280<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.490> it'll<00:02:03.119> give<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
divided by 5,280 and it'll give you the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.319 
divided by 5,280 and it'll give you the
speed<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> car<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.500> drop<00:02:05.090> now<00:02:06.090> if

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
speed that the car can drop now if

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.119 
speed that the car can drop now if
you're<00:02:06.540> actually<00:02:07.049> wanting<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.500> pick<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.799> gear

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
you're actually wanting to pick a gear

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.850 
you're actually wanting to pick a gear
which<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.640> whole<00:02:08.819> point<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.360> video

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
which is the whole point of this video

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.940 
which is the whole point of this video
you<00:02:12.230> take<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.410> equation

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
you take this equation

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.570 
you take this equation
and<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:15.989> remember<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.580> you're

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
and you just remember that you're

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.050 
and you just remember that you're
looking<00:02:18.030> for<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.360> gear<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:18.959> instead<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:20.060> divide

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
looking for a gear so instead you divide

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.229 
looking for a gear so instead you divide
all<00:02:21.239> this<00:02:21.390> junk<00:02:21.660> up<00:02:21.900> here<00:02:22.319> by<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.280> benchmark

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
all this junk up here by the benchmark

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.479 
all this junk up here by the benchmark

straightforward<00:03:03.079> if<00:03:04.079> you<00:03:04.260> know<00:03:04.410> you're<00:03:04.560> going

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
straightforward if you know you're going

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
straightforward if you know you're going
to<00:03:04.739> top<00:03:05.010> out<00:03:05.220> up<00:03:05.849> here<00:03:05.940> somewhere<00:03:07.400> like<00:03:08.400> you

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
to top out up here somewhere like you

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.020 
to top out up here somewhere like you
know<00:03:08.819> when<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.840> use<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.260> equation<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:11.489> RPM

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
know when you use this equation the RPM

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.610 
know when you use this equation the RPM
you're<00:03:12.209> supposed<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.569> use<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.140> horsepower

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
you're supposed to use is the horsepower

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.460 
you're supposed to use is the horsepower
rpm<00:03:14.310> because<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.940> represents<00:03:15.150> how<00:03:15.870> much<00:03:16.200> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
rpm because that represents how much the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.340 
rpm because that represents how much the
car<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:16.769> able<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.670> do<00:03:17.910> at<00:03:18.090> it's<00:03:18.239> dead<00:03:18.480> maximum<00:03:19.170> I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
car is able to do at it's dead maximum I

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.520 
car is able to do at it's dead maximum I
mean<00:03:20.340> for<00:03:21.090> those<00:03:21.180> who<00:03:21.450> don't<00:03:21.660> know<00:03:21.750> horsepower

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
mean for those who don't know horsepower

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.120 
mean for those who don't know horsepower
is<00:03:22.650> force<00:03:22.950> times<00:03:23.220> speed<00:03:24.620> it's<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.769> greatest

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
is force times speed it's the greatest

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.250 
is force times speed it's the greatest
combination<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.269> force<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.780> speed<00:03:27.900> that

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
combination of force and speed that

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.420 
combination of force and speed that
you're<00:03:28.410> ever<00:03:28.620> going<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:28.889> get<00:03:29.069> out<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
you're ever going to get out of the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.960 
you're ever going to get out of the
engine<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:34.040> yeah<00:03:35.040> when<00:03:35.250> you're<00:03:35.400> using<00:03:35.639> this

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
engine so yeah when you're using this

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.740 
engine so yeah when you're using this
you<00:03:37.280> just<00:03:38.280> need<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.609> remember<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.510> car

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
you just need to remember that the car

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.740 
you just need to remember that the car
the<00:03:40.440> car<00:03:40.680> needs<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.130> be<00:03:41.359> for<00:03:42.359> this<00:03:42.510> particular

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
the car needs to be for this particular

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.280 
the car needs to be for this particular
dyno<00:03:43.530> chart<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.760> car<00:03:45.180> needs<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.540> be<00:03:45.660> topping

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
dyno chart the car needs to be topping

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.819 
dyno chart the car needs to be topping
out<00:03:46.440> at<00:03:46.500> 6,000<00:03:47.489> rpm<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.359> when<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.900> shift<00:03:49.200> it

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
out at 6,000 rpm and when you shift it

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.199 
out at 6,000 rpm and when you shift it
must<00:03:50.160> go<00:03:50.430> no<00:03:50.670> lower<00:03:50.970> than<00:03:51.380> 4000<00:03:52.519> so<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:54.000> higher

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
must go no lower than 4000 so the higher

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.800 
must go no lower than 4000 so the higher
you<00:03:54.480> go<00:03:54.690> you<00:03:54.750> kind<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.260> keep<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.680> up<00:03:55.829> here<00:03:56.810> and

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
you go you kind of keep it up here and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.839 
you go you kind of keep it up here and
if<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.109> want<00:03:58.349> for<00:03:58.650> fifth<00:03:58.920> gear<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.430> can<00:03:59.459> kind

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
if you want for fifth gear you can kind

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.699 
if you want for fifth gear you can kind
of<00:03:59.970> rub<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.209> out<00:04:00.450> past<00:04:00.810> here<00:04:01.170> somewhere<00:04:01.560> you

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
of rub it out past here somewhere you

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.490 
of rub it out past here somewhere you
know<00:04:01.829> rub<00:04:02.069> it<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.389> 6500<00:04:03.389> so<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.260> when<00:04:04.380> you

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
know rub it to 6500 so that when you

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.000 
know rub it to 6500 so that when you
shift<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:05.099> goes<00:04:05.280> down<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.959> 5500<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.260> it

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
shift it goes down to 5500 and it it

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.390 
shift it goes down to 5500 and it it
Peaks<00:04:08.519> it<00:04:08.910> hits<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.299> stops<00:04:09.569> it's<00:04:10.440> top<00:04:10.739> speed<00:04:10.950> at

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
Peaks it hits it stops it's top speed at

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.599 
Peaks it hits it stops it's top speed at
you<00:04:11.880> know<00:04:12.000> at<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.299> 6000<00:04:13.130> so<00:04:14.130> that's<00:04:14.250> kind<00:04:14.549> of

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
you know at the 6000 so that's kind of

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.719 
you know at the 6000 so that's kind of
what<00:04:14.730> this<00:04:14.910> chart<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.419> trying<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.870> demonstrate

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
what this chart is trying to demonstrate

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.930 
what this chart is trying to demonstrate
so<00:04:17.729> for<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.180> particular<00:04:18.450> engine<00:04:19.609> right<00:04:20.609> here

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
so for this particular engine right here

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.500 
so for this particular engine right here
all<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:22.140> gears<00:04:22.440> will<00:04:22.680> kind<00:04:22.979> of<00:04:23.130> will<00:04:24.030> chop<00:04:24.300> off

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
all the gears will kind of will chop off

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.990 
all the gears will kind of will chop off
right<00:04:24.870> here

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
right here

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.530 
right here
and<00:04:26.090> all<00:04:26.690> these<00:04:26.900> lines<00:04:27.230> will<00:04:27.740> be<00:04:27.770> lower<00:04:28.100> in

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
and all these lines will be lower in

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.200 
and all these lines will be lower in
fact<00:04:29.540> when<00:04:30.350> what<00:04:30.800> turn<00:04:31.010> 10<00:04:31.250> doesn't<00:04:31.850> tell<00:04:32.030> you

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
fact when what turn 10 doesn't tell you

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.790 
fact when what turn 10 doesn't tell you
is<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.360> all<00:04:32.720> these<00:04:33.020> are<00:04:33.380> aimed<00:04:34.280> at<00:04:34.490> zero<00:04:35.800> so

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
is that all these are aimed at zero so

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.500 
is that all these are aimed at zero so
if<00:04:37.010> you<00:04:37.160> were<00:04:37.280> to<00:04:37.430> not<00:04:37.610> if<00:04:37.850> you<00:04:38.060> were<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.300> just

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
if you were to not if you were to just

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.940 
if you were to not if you were to just
have<00:04:38.720> one<00:04:39.080> gear<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:40.000> it'd<00:04:41.000> be<00:04:41.480> this<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:42.470> ratio

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
have one gear and it'd be this the ratio

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.390 
have one gear and it'd be this the ratio
that<00:04:43.100> you'd<00:04:43.250> picked<00:04:43.610> here<00:04:43.990> though<00:04:44.990> it'll<00:04:45.590> go

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
that you'd picked here though it'll go

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.390 
that you'd picked here though it'll go
from<00:04:46.730> 0<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.180> 200<00:04:47.840> in<00:04:47.960> that<00:04:48.110> gear<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:48.710> this<00:04:49.220> will

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
from 0 to 200 in that gear and this will

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.240 
from 0 to 200 in that gear and this will
tell<00:04:49.610> you<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:50.000> whole<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.600> whole<00:04:51.050> thing<00:04:51.350> but

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
tell you that whole the whole thing but

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.430 
tell you that whole the whole thing but
since<00:04:52.460> you<00:04:52.700> know<00:04:52.820> how<00:04:53.030> much<00:04:53.540> it<00:04:53.720> sucks<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.260> take

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
since you know how much it sucks to take

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.370 
since you know how much it sucks to take
off<00:04:54.650> in<00:04:54.860> 6th<00:04:55.220> gear<00:04:55.490> that's<00:04:56.450> why<00:04:56.630> we<00:04:56.810> have<00:04:57.020> lower

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
off in 6th gear that's why we have lower

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.840 
off in 6th gear that's why we have lower
ones<00:05:02.170> there<00:05:03.170> are<00:05:03.350> other<00:05:03.590> cars<00:05:04.190> here<00:05:04.550> for<00:05:04.730> you

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
ones there are other cars here for you

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.280 
ones there are other cars here for you
really<00:05:05.120> want<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.420> rev<00:05:05.600> them<00:05:05.750> out<00:05:05.870> for<00:05:06.200> all

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
really want to rev them out for all

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.510 
really want to rev them out for all
they're<00:05:06.470> worth<00:05:06.680> and<00:05:07.010> that's<00:05:07.160> what<00:05:07.340> this

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
they're worth and that's what this

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.420 
they're worth and that's what this

that's for the four cars like these you

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
end up with a gear set kind of like that

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.990 
end up with a gear set kind of like that
but<00:05:24.530> that's<00:05:24.710> pretty<00:05:25.040> straightforward

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
but that's pretty straightforward

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.200 
but that's pretty straightforward
there's<00:05:26.630> no<00:05:27.400> technicality<00:05:28.400> just<00:05:28.640> just

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
there's no technicality just just

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.840 
there's no technicality just just

that<00:05:34.550> when<00:05:34.700> you<00:05:34.820> shift<00:05:35.120> you<00:05:35.360> get<00:05:35.510> the<00:05:35.660> most<00:05:35.840> of

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
that when you shift you get the most of

that when you shift you get the most of
this<00:05:36.290> as<00:05:36.500> possible<00:05:41.620> if<00:05:42.620> you<00:05:42.890> ever<00:05:43.640> want<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:43.970> set

this as possible if you ever want to set

this as possible if you ever want to set
your<00:05:44.390> gears<00:05:44.720> in<00:05:44.930> a<00:05:44.990> neat<00:05:45.229> way<00:05:45.470> or<00:05:45.830> if<00:05:46.250> you're

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
your gears in a neat way or if you're

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.640 
your gears in a neat way or if you're
curious<00:05:46.640> about<00:05:46.970> them<00:05:47.360> you<00:05:48.200> can<00:05:48.320> look<00:05:48.440> at<00:05:48.560> it

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
curious about them you can look at it

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.880 
curious about them you can look at it
this<00:05:48.800> way<00:05:49.150> if<00:05:50.150> you<00:05:50.360> have<00:05:50.660> the<00:05:50.690> old<00:05:51.169> gear<00:05:51.620> and

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
this way if you have the old gear and

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.420 
this way if you have the old gear and
you<00:05:52.400> know<00:05:52.580> what<00:05:52.960> your<00:05:53.960> shift<00:05:54.350> rpm<00:05:54.680> is<00:05:55.160> going<00:05:55.370> to

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
you know what your shift rpm is going to

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.659 
you know what your shift rpm is going to
be<00:05:55.610> if<00:05:56.240> you<00:05:57.020> multiply<00:05:57.530> that<00:05:57.740> by<00:05:57.800> a<00:05:57.979> new<00:05:58.280> gear

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
be if you multiply that by a new gear

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.610 
be if you multiply that by a new gear
ratio<00:05:59.120> that<00:05:59.300> you<00:05:59.450> want<00:05:59.630> to<00:05:59.750> pick<00:05:59.990> it'll<00:06:00.410> tell

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
ratio that you want to pick it'll tell

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.040 
ratio that you want to pick it'll tell
you<00:06:00.800> what<00:06:00.950> your<00:06:01.120> rpm<00:06:02.120> the<00:06:02.330> engines<00:06:02.750> going<00:06:02.990> to

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
you what your rpm the engines going to

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.230 
you what your rpm the engines going to
hit<00:06:03.290> when<00:06:03.530> you<00:06:03.650> finish<00:06:03.979> the<00:06:04.130> shift<00:06:04.430> and

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.420 

conversely<00:06:08.240> we<00:06:08.450> have<00:06:08.660> this<00:06:08.840> one<00:06:09.110> if<00:06:09.290> you<00:06:10.160> want

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
conversely we have this one if you want

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.930 
conversely we have this one if you want
to<00:06:10.580> shift<00:06:10.880> to<00:06:11.030> a<00:06:11.150> new<00:06:11.240> rpm<00:06:12.020> from<00:06:12.770> an<00:06:13.070> old<00:06:13.340> rpm

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
to shift to a new rpm from an old rpm

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.900 
to shift to a new rpm from an old rpm
and<00:06:14.210> an<00:06:14.900> old<00:06:15.110> gear<00:06:15.500> combo<00:06:16.010> it'll<00:06:16.610> tell<00:06:16.820> you

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
and an old gear combo it'll tell you

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.140 
and an old gear combo it'll tell you
what<00:06:17.030> the<00:06:17.090> new<00:06:17.330> gear<00:06:17.630> ratio<00:06:18.050> is<00:06:18.229> going<00:06:18.440> to<00:06:18.530> be

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
what the new gear ratio is going to be

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.330 
what the new gear ratio is going to be
so<00:06:20.150> this<00:06:20.450> is<00:06:20.600> kind<00:06:20.840> of<00:06:20.930> how<00:06:21.080> you<00:06:21.140> would<00:06:21.380> go<00:06:21.590> from

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
so this is kind of how you would go from

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:29.770 
so this is kind of how you would go from
sixth<00:06:23.180> gear<00:06:23.620> to<00:06:24.620> fifth<00:06:25.130> gear<00:06:25.460> and<00:06:28.419> you<00:06:29.419> can<00:06:29.450> use

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
sixth gear to fifth gear and you can use

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.340 
sixth gear to fifth gear and you can use
this<00:06:29.960> formula<00:06:30.550> and<00:06:31.550> so<00:06:32.240> this<00:06:32.660> would<00:06:32.840> help<00:06:33.080> you

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
this formula and so this would help you

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.100 
this formula and so this would help you
if<00:06:33.680> you're<00:06:33.919> running<00:06:34.700> out<00:06:35.000> of<00:06:35.030> steam<00:06:35.450> in<00:06:35.720> fifth

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
if you're running out of steam in fifth

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.770
