00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 surfing yourself comes to the next video 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.299
 it's monday and what does that mean exactly 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.069
 is review day i mean good as last 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.330
 week came every day as we want with it 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.969
 of course, today's tomas continue 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.490
 surovy del team offseason 86 84 final 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.160
 89 example 88 dribbling 90 defense and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.810
 79 header almost everything over 80 he is 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.689
 the third of the very close by for 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.000
 larry at 79 paces and at 79 heads 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.500
 so the cert in shape or the team often 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.539
 do not know it's not already there 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.279
 failed but so harm every case 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.260
 Nevertheless, look under the man like himself 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.630
 then split this whole city and 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.130
 while of course in his in games ted where 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.010
 because otherwise 25 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.809
 meanwhile 26 reached 81 large 75 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.430
 kilograms he is chilean can 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.530
 centrally defensive central central 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.020
 playing midfield as an intermediate and as 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.450
 defender is right foot 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.090
 worked up forster away and three 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.030
 stars it is cavaliere good 880 starts 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.070
 82 agility 84 balance 85 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.020
 leap 94 reaction to the jumps 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.030
 speed 83 strength everything 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.649
 wonderful green it must be like that 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.879
 I like the 490 reactions stings 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.309
 brought out reinach it strengthens it 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.890
 80 would not be bad 89 99 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.909
 Reactions 96 intercept 230 76 in game 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.070
 outstanding mental attributes above all 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.299
 Intercept 9 and 14 690 is for one 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.430
 Central defensive midfielder 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.409
 exceptional 91 at control 84 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.159
 Frank 989 has the remaining 80 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.020
 graduation 80 precision 74 precision 92 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.119
 long passes 94 shots 85 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.170
 Manndeckung age later that's alright 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.400
 Go on well and how are you? 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.189
 that's the big question now 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.579
 with 99 eleven meters with 94 funds with 790 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.479
 shot comes with 88 leaves with 96 4 92 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.740
 what's going on there 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.630
 is the attentive audience 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.659
 Be noticed that there are only two games 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.979
 is madness why because that should be 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.780
 We do not have that much time so fast 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.490
 for this outstanding player ore 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.930
 seen only two starts were yellow though 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.659
 he feels so on the field 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.399
 yes damn yes yes yes yes yes yes he is 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.770
 in my opinion the best central 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.119
 midfielder the whole game he 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.040
 is better now suggest of balance 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.930
 better than for legitim of the season he 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.450
 is just the absolute madness he 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.189
 anything he can act as six as 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.509
 Eighth and as ten you can wood 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.979
 defenders play the channel saint 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.420
 play as a striker 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.849
 the type does it all keeps the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.880
 do not mind his high work 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.360
 that means he hangs 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.220
 because you are in midfield 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.910
 or years in the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.860
 defensive order 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.990
 but at last he just does not care 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.160
 that makes his thing that pulls through the 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.900
 is just the absolute madness me 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.010
 went briefly to the self of a neighbor 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.260
 played in the cdm 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.360
 86 ps you feel fulfilled even so 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.220
 fast at 88 dribbling that would have to 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.030
 at least in the 90s range if 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.130
 I even higher 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.290
 that is just incredibly precise and 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.910
 well right like teenies 84 shot you 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.200
 will see some long shot his long 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.790
 short are very very precise i have 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.590
 unfortunately not met but I was very 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.300
 on the eve and also his graduation 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.950
 and yes, his longchamp out of something 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.810
 closer environment so to 25 meters 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.780
 very good, that's all 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.120
 every case clear 89 pass every pass 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.160
 really is defending every 90's 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.570
 that it is amazing he is always right 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.490
 He can play any ball but no matter 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.770
 if fashion technology ticket taxes something 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.300
 and henning it does not hurt 80 it 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.220
 he is genuinely treated the first player 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.660
 but all values over 80 have 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.030
 anyway, besides, you should have looked good 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.680
 he only gains a very large one 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.810
 many head duels and now short 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.430
 why in the zdf rain played quite 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.830
 just there you can do it the most 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.300
 inserts that's right is right 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.920
 because he can live his gunfire 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.480
 His passports are unbelievably good 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.850
 dribbling see that he is very 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.230
 many gates are dribbled at maximum and he 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.520
 can just right after the abutment 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.990
 get ball and he goes constantly 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.250
 simply by can not be stopped 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.630
 nothing and no one just that 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.110
 that's how it has to be 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.780
 his 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.610
 It just can not get any better and then 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.190
 does the good we do today despite 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.450
 he plays in central midfield 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.830
 he still helps out as a sixth but in 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.180
 the next action directly in front again 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.340
 this is crazy 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.050
 his defense is so good that he 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.640
 right after the offense if the opponent 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.470
 the ball is right next to him 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.330
 him again and that as cdu of course 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.709
 so if he is right there it is 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.170
 just awesome and that's what makes him 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.910
 to say one of the best for the best 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.260
 central midfielder better than 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.090
 all the others I played until now 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.670
 have and I'm just complete 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.740
 really completely convinced of him that 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.910
 It just insanity I can not 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.010
 Imagine that in better players 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.020
 ever will give because he can 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.030
 just everything as I said its stats 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.070
 show is and he shows it too he can 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.020
 everything and try it out so 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.450
 a lot does not cost a 300k 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.370
 many but if he buys the art 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.660
 now just the madness I already have 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.979
 Thinking about how to give you company in this 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.630
 it can not work 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.250
 but he definitely deserves it 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.230
 and thus ends the clips he can 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.250
 even free kicks like 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.320
 have seen in the end or 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.300
 if that causes a bit of bad luck that 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.850
 chic possibly as per us his 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.380
 top 5 goals of the week also fail because 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.910
 this is really worthy of becoming a goal 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.050
 but unfortunately not positive 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.540
 Negative you see a bit 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.770
 longer fast strong ag wonderful 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.780
 dribbling very strong show both 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.100
 conclusion as well as long shot defended 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.900
 bossa Hide has said he is always 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.030
 Immediately there is just everywhere in front 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.680
 Back left right everywhere became him 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.810
 does he is always there will always you 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.970
 on the side are not too small with 181 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.530
 one might think at 79 is hering though 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.730
 not that is still absolute animal 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.500
 and also had the body strength despite 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.670
 The small size can do it all 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.770
 already said this can 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.600
 matching running dribble the hands and 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.340
 forster cut off continued feels 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.680
 very much seen a gate in the beginning 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.870
 that he made fit with wii and he 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.790
 best central player in the game and it 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.380
 There is nothing negative about him 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.450
 it sounds crass but there is 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.800
 Nothing negative, I'm serious 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.760
 he knows three position but that is true 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.350
 I do not care at all 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.360
 to see the clip or have seen 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.400
 rather he simply has with these 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.070
 Three stars is considered three of the games sternen 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.260
 Everything went away and what went along with roles 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.290
 with roulette with with 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.280
 advanced ball rolls with header 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.600
 Of course, that's cool, but it's not 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.310
 negative point when he has three because he 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.290
 can still get away with it all passion 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.060
 and that is amazingly cool and 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.820
 so get away from me a rating for 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.620
 third time ten out of ten he joins 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.780
 so between club and mine 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.230
 opinion in my opinion after age 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.210
 Swede 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.460
 better than dzsudzsak but not so 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.890
 good as ronaldo but extremely extreme 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.720
 well and i really recommend you to him 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.280
 to buy because, of course, gets the thumbs 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.720
 high and he gets him so far up 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.460
 you can not imagine 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.610
 he is almost through his card 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.960
 the dom is so thick and yes he is 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.640
 just an awesome player and 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.260
 I notice how excited about the note 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.150
 I never expected that and all of those 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.530
 clips are really not all that much 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.730
 many games were created mainly because 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.990
 I really, I actually have 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.520
 not really played on them like that 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.600
 fix that I collect with them clip 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.950
 I just did what I did 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.690
 thought what works and it has everything 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.800
 works and that should be a lot 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.940
 We'll see at the end again 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.220
 Directed table reaches like 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.720
 said between klub and ronaldo and 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.590
 had 10 out of 10 a rating and I think so 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.790
 that there is no central 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.140
 Midfielder come so fast 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.230
 will be next again 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.880
 Team player coming marathon and me 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.990
 Hope you look forward to the next one I have 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.980
 failed this time 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.000
 see you next time again 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.000
 then bite into it
