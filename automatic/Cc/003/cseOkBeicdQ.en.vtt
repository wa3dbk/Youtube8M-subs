white or asian student you can still
leapfrog<00:02:14.990> over<00:02:15.170> you're<00:02:15.560> still<00:02:15.890> going<00:02:16.069> to<00:02:16.130> get

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
leapfrog over you're still going to get

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.920 
leapfrog over you're still going to get
a<00:02:16.280> minute<00:02:16.580> that's<00:02:16.760> exactly<00:02:17.150> right<00:02:17.390> in<00:02:17.660> fact

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
a minute that's exactly right in fact

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.770 
a minute that's exactly right in fact
the<00:02:18.380> highest-scoring<00:02:19.540> students<00:02:20.540> who<00:02:20.660> were

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
the highest-scoring students who were

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.470 
the highest-scoring students who were
black<00:02:21.020> or<00:02:21.290> Hispanic<00:02:21.920> actually<00:02:22.760> scored<00:02:23.150> lower

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
black or Hispanic actually scored lower

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.900 
black or Hispanic actually scored lower
than<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.990> lower<00:02:24.260> lowest<00:02:24.980> quartile<00:02:25.460> of<00:02:25.520> white

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
than the lower lowest quartile of white

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.880 
than the lower lowest quartile of white
and<00:02:26.090> Asian<00:02:26.420> students<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:26.930> it's<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.170> huge<00:02:27.200> factor

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
and Asian students so it's a huge factor

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.930 
and Asian students so it's a huge factor

it they did give you permission to come

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.460 
it they did give you permission to come
on<00:02:38.060> campus<00:02:38.360> but<00:02:38.690> they<00:02:38.810> also<00:02:38.989> gave<00:02:39.319> those

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.990 
on campus but they also gave those
students<00:02:39.890> permissions<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.459> disrupt<00:02:40.849> your

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.300 
I think they did more than give
permission<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.200> Vice<00:02:45.380> Provost<00:02:45.770> of<00:02:46.280> the
