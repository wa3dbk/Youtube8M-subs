all<00:00:05.649> right<00:00:05.830> no<00:00:06.069> we<00:00:06.250> could<00:00:06.460> just<00:00:06.700> connect<00:00:07.060> a

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
all right no we could just connect a

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.440 
all right no we could just connect a
straight<00:00:07.540> line<00:00:08.340> simplify<00:00:09.340> from<00:00:09.820> here<00:00:10.030> to<00:00:10.180> here

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
straight line simplify from here to here

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.480 
straight line simplify from here to here
and<00:00:10.780> be<00:00:11.230> really<00:00:11.590> accurate<00:00:11.770> but<00:00:12.219> what<00:00:12.340> we're

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
and be really accurate but what we're

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.770 
and be really accurate but what we're
going<00:00:12.520> to<00:00:12.639> do<00:00:12.850> is<00:00:12.969> we're<00:00:13.180> going<00:00:13.270> to<00:00:13.330> go<00:00:13.510> ahead

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
going to do is we're going to go ahead

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.330 
going to do is we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:14.110> find<00:00:14.410> the<00:00:15.279> nasal<00:00:15.520> opening<00:00:15.760> and<00:00:17.340> basically

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
and find the nasal opening and basically

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.910 
and find the nasal opening and basically
the<00:00:18.580> shape<00:00:18.760> of<00:00:19.000> the<00:00:19.119> teeth<00:00:19.330> and<00:00:19.690> chin<00:00:20.110> and<00:00:20.380> then

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
the shape of the teeth and chin and then

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.620 
the shape of the teeth and chin and then
we'll<00:00:21.040> find<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.280> eye<00:00:21.340> socket<00:00:22.000> and<00:00:22.120> the

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
we'll find the eye socket and the

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.480 
we'll find the eye socket and the
cheekbone<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:26.080> to<00:00:26.140> do<00:00:26.410> that<00:00:26.440> what<00:00:27.250> we're<00:00:27.400> going

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
cheekbone so to do that what we're going

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.830 
cheekbone so to do that what we're going
to<00:00:27.550> do<00:00:27.700> is<00:00:27.820> we're<00:00:27.970> going<00:00:28.060> to<00:00:28.120> find<00:00:28.270> this<00:00:28.450> nasal

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
to do is we're going to find this nasal

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.119 
to do is we're going to find this nasal
opening<00:00:29.200> first<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.869> starting<00:00:32.410> here<00:00:32.439> on<00:00:32.949> this

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
opening first so starting here on this

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.180 
opening first so starting here on this
East<00:00:33.460> line<00:00:33.940> on<00:00:34.329> the<00:00:34.960> centerline<00:00:35.410> on<00:00:35.650> the<00:00:36.010> east

side of the construct from the center

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.250 
side of the construct from the center
I'm<00:00:38.410> going<00:00:38.470> to<00:00:39.280> divide<00:00:39.700> down<00:00:41.340> divide<00:00:42.340> up

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
I'm going to divide down divide up

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.310 
I'm going to divide down divide up
divide<00:00:44.260> down<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.660> is<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:46.960> point<00:00:49.110> where<00:00:50.110> the

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
divide down this is the point where the

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.830 
divide down this is the point where the
nasal<00:00:50.980> opening<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.790> hole<00:00:52.000> in<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.329> skull<00:00:52.570> for

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
nasal opening the hole in the skull for

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.530 
nasal opening the hole in the skull for
the<00:00:52.960> nose<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:54.160> bottom<00:00:54.550> of<00:00:54.700> it<00:00:54.850> hits<00:00:55.270> right

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
the nose the bottom of it hits right

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.950 
the nose the bottom of it hits right
here<00:00:55.930> now<00:00:56.829> to<00:00:56.890> find<00:00:57.250> out<00:00:57.430> where<00:00:57.730> it<00:00:57.880> is<00:00:57.910> on<00:00:58.360> the

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
here now to find out where it is on the

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.319 
here now to find out where it is on the
inside<00:00:59.530> how<00:01:00.010> far<00:01:00.280> this<00:01:00.550> way<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:00.880> goes<00:01:01.059> what

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
inside how far this way it goes what

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.639 
inside how far this way it goes what
we're<00:01:01.450> going<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.600> do<00:01:01.780> is<00:01:01.870> we'll<00:01:02.020> just<00:01:02.230> X<00:01:02.440> off

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
we're going to do is we'll just X off

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.739 
we're going to do is we'll just X off
this<00:01:02.829> box<00:01:04.199> find<00:01:05.199> this<00:01:05.379> smaller<00:01:06.509> corner<00:01:07.509> box

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:07.749 
this box find this smaller corner box

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:12.029 
this box find this smaller corner box
again<00:01:08.139> and<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.780> hits<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.200> center<00:01:11.499> point<00:01:11.770> right

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
again and it hits the center point right

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.250 
again and it hits the center point right
there

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.280 

so<00:01:15.890> we<00:01:16.130> can<00:01:16.280> just<00:01:16.460> curve<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.510> line<00:01:17.750> again

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
so we can just curve a line again

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.480 
so we can just curve a line again
from<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:22.490> all

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
from there to there just like that all

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.930 
from there to there just like that all
right<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:24.980> we<00:01:25.980> need<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.250> draw<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
right so now we need to draw in the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.580 
right so now we need to draw in the
muzzle<00:01:27.360> part<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:27.990> mouth<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:30.260> what<00:01:31.260> we<00:01:31.350> can

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
muzzle part of the mouth so what we can

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.460 
muzzle part of the mouth so what we can
do<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:32.040> from<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.720> bottom<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.260> nasal

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
do is from here the bottom of the nasal

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.470 
do is from here the bottom of the nasal
bone<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:35.040> can<00:01:35.250> connect<00:01:37.550> to<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.700> centerline<00:01:39.210> of

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
bone we can connect to the centerline of

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.070 
bone we can connect to the centerline of
this<00:01:39.930> quadrant<00:01:40.730> and<00:01:41.730> to<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.480> side<00:01:42.660> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.900> box

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
this quadrant and to the side of the box

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.600 
this quadrant and to the side of the box
just<00:01:43.620> like<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:48.170> then<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.860> center

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
just like that and then to this center

00:01:50.610 --> 00:02:01.520 
just like that and then to this center
point<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:55.100> if<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.280> exit<00:01:56.730> this<00:01:56.850> off

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.520 

we<00:02:02.010> can<00:02:02.190> connect<00:02:02.520> down<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.840> then<00:02:04.020> round<00:02:04.320> out

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
we can connect down and then round out

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.060 
we can connect down and then round out
for<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> chin<00:02:06.860> just<00:02:07.860> like<00:02:08.010> that

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
for the chin just like that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.350 
for the chin just like that
all<00:02:11.070> right<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.370> let<00:02:11.520> me<00:02:11.550> show<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.850> what<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.120> did

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
all right so let me show you what I did

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.630 
all right so let me show you what I did
you<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.630> see<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:14.010> point<00:02:14.280> where

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
you can see that this the point where

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.750 
you can see that this the point where
the<00:02:14.790> chin<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.770> area<00:02:16.770> for<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.190> teeth<00:02:17.430> meet

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
the chin in the area for the teeth meet

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.620 
the chin in the area for the teeth meet
is<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.450> direct<00:02:18.810> line<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:21.120> point<00:02:21.420> that

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
is in a direct line with the point that

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.270 
is in a direct line with the point that
terminates<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.440> nasal<00:02:22.650> opening<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.830> that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
terminates the nasal opening and so that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.680 
terminates the nasal opening and so that
gives<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.390> basic<00:02:31.050> outline<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:33.150> human

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
gives you the basic outline of the human

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.330 
gives you the basic outline of the human
skull<00:02:34.070> taking<00:02:35.070> in<00:02:35.220> account<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.880> simplifying

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
skull taking in account and simplifying

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.970 
skull taking in account and simplifying
the<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.670> really<00:02:39.180> intricate<00:02:39.720> curves<00:02:40.680> and

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
the the really intricate curves and

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.250 
the the really intricate curves and
bumps<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.430> tones<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:42.510> it's<00:02:42.780> very<00:02:42.990> very

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
bumps and tones but it's very very

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.460 
bumps and tones but it's very very
accurate<00:02:43.860> even<00:02:44.490> in<00:02:44.610> its<00:02:44.790> simplification<00:02:45.660> so

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
accurate even in its simplification so

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.320 
accurate even in its simplification so
now<00:02:46.620> let's<00:02:46.860> go<00:02:47.040> ahead<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.430> find<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.060> eye

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
now let's go ahead and find the eye

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.650 
now let's go ahead and find the eye
socket

okay<00:02:51.660> now<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.290> eye<00:02:52.320> socket<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.100> draw<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
okay now the eye socket to draw in the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.460 
okay now the eye socket to draw in the
eye<00:02:53.460> socket<00:02:53.970> it's<00:02:54.420> going<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.630> fit<00:02:54.900> right<00:02:55.260> in

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
eye socket it's going to fit right in

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.910 
eye socket it's going to fit right in
this<00:02:55.710> area<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:57.480> understand<00:02:58.020> how<00:02:58.170> it

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
this area and so to understand how it

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.620 
this area and so to understand how it
fits<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.610> what<00:02:59.850> we're<00:02:59.970> going<00:03:00.210> to<00:03:00.240> do<00:03:00.450> is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
fits in what we're going to do is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.510 
fits in what we're going to do is
starting<00:03:01.050> on<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.380> horizontal<00:03:01.710> center<00:03:02.310> line

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
starting on this horizontal center line

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.910 
starting on this horizontal center line
from<00:03:03.210> Center<00:03:03.750> we<00:03:04.260> are<00:03:04.290> going<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.770> divide<00:03:05.070> East

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
from Center we are going to divide East

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.310 
from Center we are going to divide East
divide<00:03:07.920> east<00:03:09.800> divide<00:03:10.800> west<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.959> this<00:03:12.959> point

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
divide east divide west and this point

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.310 
divide east divide west and this point
right<00:03:13.530> here<00:03:14.720> represents<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.850> outside<00:03:17.850> line

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
right here represents the outside line

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.260 
right here represents the outside line
of<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.530> eye<00:03:19.560> socket<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.340> side<00:03:20.580> view<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.060> so

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
of the eye socket and a side view and so

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.120 
of the eye socket and a side view and so
it's<00:03:21.510> going<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.870> start<00:03:22.380> it's<00:03:22.620> not<00:03:22.800> going<00:03:23.010> to

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
it's going to start it's not going to

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.530 
it's going to start it's not going to
touch<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:23.700> point<00:03:24.000> right<00:03:24.120> here<00:03:24.180> it's<00:03:24.450> going

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
touch this point right here it's going

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.170 
touch this point right here it's going
to<00:03:24.600> start<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:25.260> inside<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.790> it's<00:03:26.970> going<00:03:27.090> to

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
to start just inside and it's going to

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.590 
to start just inside and it's going to
follow<00:03:27.480> up<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.380> like<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.650> curve<00:03:29.280> up<00:03:29.600> it's

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
follow up just like that curve up it's

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.420 
follow up just like that curve up it's
kind<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.870> like<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.050> c-shape<00:03:31.739> it's<00:03:32.220> going<00:03:32.370> to

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
kind of like a c-shape it's going to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.160 
kind of like a c-shape it's going to
come<00:03:32.640> down<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.060> hit<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.540> point<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:34.019> we

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
come down and hit that point that we

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.280 
come down and hit that point that we
just<00:03:34.200> found<00:03:35.060> then<00:03:36.060> it's<00:03:36.239> going<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.630> swing<00:03:36.959> down

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
just found then it's going to swing down

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.620 
just found then it's going to swing down
like<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:40.190> just<00:03:41.190> like<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.150> stays<00:03:42.420> in

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
like this just like that and it stays in

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.589 
like this just like that and it stays in
line<00:03:43.730> with<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.910> center<00:03:45.269> of<00:03:45.300> this

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.940 

box<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:50.950> box<00:03:51.219> as<00:03:51.489> well<00:03:52.469> now<00:03:53.469> it's<00:03:53.709> really

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
box and this box as well now it's really

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.009 
box and this box as well now it's really
difficult<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.639> give<00:03:54.939> precise<00:03:55.389> measurements

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
difficult to give precise measurements

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.869 
difficult to give precise measurements
they're<00:03:56.170> so<00:03:56.499> little<00:03:56.799> of<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.189> I<00:03:57.219> second<00:03:57.730> that

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
they're so little of the I second that

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.449 
they're so little of the I second that
you<00:03:57.969> actually<00:03:58.180> see<00:03:58.659> in<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:58.959> side<00:03:59.469> view<00:03:59.799> when

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
you actually see in the side view when

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.539 
you actually see in the side view when
you're<00:04:00.579> looking<00:04:00.879> at<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.150> skull<00:04:01.450> so<00:04:02.129> you<00:04:03.129> just

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
you're looking at the skull so you just

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.640 
you're looking at the skull so you just
want<00:04:03.819> your<00:04:03.939> eye<00:04:03.999> socket<00:04:04.629> to<00:04:04.780> have<00:04:04.959> this<00:04:05.230> basic

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
want your eye socket to have this basic

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.819 
want your eye socket to have this basic
shape<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.129> to<00:04:06.909> fit<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.359> this<00:04:07.599> area<00:04:07.989> it's<00:04:08.620> about

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
shape and to fit in this area it's about

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.589 
shape and to fit in this area it's about
half<00:04:09.280> way<00:04:11.489> on<00:04:12.489> either<00:04:12.760> side<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.150> this

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
half way on either side of this

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.400 
half way on either side of this
centerline<00:04:14.519> no<00:04:15.519> there's<00:04:15.849> a<00:04:15.939> ridge<00:04:16.150> of<00:04:16.299> bone

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
centerline no there's a ridge of bone

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.900 
centerline no there's a ridge of bone
that<00:04:17.410> connects<00:04:17.829> to<00:04:18.039> the<00:04:18.190> cheek<00:04:18.430> bone<00:04:18.699> and

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
that connects to the cheek bone and

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.089 
that connects to the cheek bone and
forms<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.930> cheek<00:04:20.109> bone<00:04:20.289> comes<00:04:20.530> around<00:04:20.829> and

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
forms the cheek bone comes around and

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.330 
forms the cheek bone comes around and
forms<00:04:21.639> the<00:04:22.330> temporal<00:04:22.840> Ridge<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.349> so<00:04:24.070> that

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
forms the temporal Ridge and so that

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.060 
forms the temporal Ridge and so that
Ridge<00:04:24.520> of<00:04:24.669> bone<00:04:24.699> starts<00:04:25.560> right<00:04:26.560> here<00:04:26.590> at<00:04:26.949> the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
Ridge of bone starts right here at the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.140 
Ridge of bone starts right here at the
center<00:04:28.229> so<00:04:29.229> from<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:30.009> centerline<00:04:30.370> if<00:04:30.940> you

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
center so from the centerline if you

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.310 
center so from the centerline if you
divide<00:04:31.630> East<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:33.550> can<00:04:33.729> curve<00:04:34.449> that<00:04:34.750> bit<00:04:35.199> of

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
divide East you can curve that bit of

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.909 
divide East you can curve that bit of
bone<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:36.699> it<00:04:36.789> just<00:04:37.000> follows<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.389> shape<00:04:37.919> of

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
bone and it just follows the shape of

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.360 
bone and it just follows the shape of
the<00:04:39.130> eye<00:04:39.160> socket<00:04:39.849> and<00:04:40.000> as<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:41.110> hits<00:04:41.410> this<00:04:42.009> X

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
the eye socket and as it hits this X

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.870 
the eye socket and as it hits this X
here<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:43.870> swoops<00:04:44.229> back<00:04:44.349> around<00:04:47.759> for<00:04:48.759> the

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
here it swoops back around for the

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
here it swoops back around for the
temporal<00:04:49.300> line<00:04:49.479> just<00:04:50.199> like<00:04:50.349> that<00:04:51.630> now<00:04:52.630> from

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
temporal line just like that now from

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.560 
temporal line just like that now from
this<00:04:53.080> point<00:04:55.050> if<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:56.199> start<00:04:56.530> here<00:04:56.979> you<00:04:57.570> divide

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
this point if you start here you divide

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.499 
this point if you start here you divide
down<00:04:59.400> divide<00:05:00.400> up<00:05:00.729> divide<00:05:01.659> up<00:05:03.210> that<00:05:04.210> Ridge<00:05:04.389> of

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
down divide up divide up that Ridge of

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.310 
down divide up divide up that Ridge of
bone<00:05:04.539> is<00:05:04.810> going<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:05.050> come<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:06.370> far<00:05:06.699> down<00:05:07.320> and

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
bone is going to come that far down and

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.689 
bone is going to come that far down and
then<00:05:08.440> it's<00:05:08.590> gonna<00:05:10.050> swoop<00:05:11.050> back<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.460> hinge

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
then it's gonna swoop back to the hinge

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.710 
then it's gonna swoop back to the hinge
point<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.240> jaw<00:05:13.830> just<00:05:14.830> like<00:05:15.039> that<00:05:15.599> and<00:05:16.599> now

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
point of the jaw just like that and now

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.360 
point of the jaw just like that and now
to<00:05:16.780> get<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:17.229> bottom<00:05:17.680> of<00:05:17.889> the<00:05:18.070> cheek<00:05:18.340> bone

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
to get the bottom of the cheek bone

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.939 
to get the bottom of the cheek bone
we're<00:05:19.300> going<00:05:19.449> to<00:05:19.509> go<00:05:19.659> just<00:05:20.139> above<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:20.710> hinge

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
we're going to go just above the hinge

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.920 
we're going to go just above the hinge
point<00:05:21.280> of<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:21.639> jaw<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:24.270> we're<00:05:25.270> going<00:05:25.419> to<00:05:25.479> try

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
point of the jaw and we're going to try

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.420 
point of the jaw and we're going to try
and<00:05:26.080> hit<00:05:26.320> this<00:05:26.889> part<00:05:27.250> of<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:27.430> X

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:39.050 

connects<00:05:33.150> through<00:05:33.389> just<00:05:33.840> like<00:05:33.900> that<00:05:38.060> again

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
connects through just like that again

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.800 
connects through just like that again
this<00:05:39.330> is<00:05:39.570> a<00:05:39.600> really<00:05:40.350> complex<00:05:41.160> area<00:05:41.910> of<00:05:42.479> bone

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
this is a really complex area of bone

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.879 
this is a really complex area of bone
and<00:05:43.820> so<00:05:44.820> we<00:05:45.600> are<00:05:45.750> going<00:05:46.020> to<00:05:46.169> leave<00:05:46.680> the

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
and so we are going to leave the

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.730 
and so we are going to leave the
simplification<00:05:47.820> like<00:05:48.720> this<00:05:49.050> and<00:05:49.350> we<00:05:49.560> will

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
simplification like this and we will

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.890 
simplification like this and we will
inform<00:05:50.310> ourselves<00:05:50.970> as<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.600> what's<00:05:51.810> really

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
inform ourselves as to what's really

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.290 
inform ourselves as to what's really
going<00:05:52.410> on<00:05:52.860> here<00:05:53.190> and<00:05:53.370> all<00:05:53.460> the<00:05:53.610> complexities

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
going on here and all the complexities

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.810 
going on here and all the complexities
by<00:05:54.870> looking<00:05:55.229> at<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.530> real<00:05:55.740> skull<00:05:56.070> and<00:05:56.370> the

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
by looking at the real skull and the

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.090 
by looking at the real skull and the
rendering<00:05:57.030> that<00:05:57.360> out<00:05:57.630> okay<00:05:58.500> so<00:05:58.560> now<00:05:58.800> all<00:05:58.979> we

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
rendering that out okay so now all we

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.730 
rendering that out okay so now all we
need<00:05:59.280> to<00:05:59.310> do<00:05:59.520> is<00:05:59.669> finalize<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.780> inside<00:06:01.260> corner

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
need to do is finalize the inside corner

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.760 
need to do is finalize the inside corner
inside<00:06:01.949> the<00:06:02.850> line<00:06:03.000> of<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.330> jaw<00:06:03.570> and<00:06:03.900> it<00:06:04.500> stays

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
inside the line of the jaw and it stays

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.909 
inside the line of the jaw and it stays
on<00:06:05.070> this<00:06:06.060> quadrant<00:06:06.660> it<00:06:07.110> stays<00:06:07.410> right<00:06:07.590> here<00:06:07.830> in

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
on this quadrant it stays right here in

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.610 
on this quadrant it stays right here in
the<00:06:08.010> center<00:06:08.280> line<00:06:08.490> and<00:06:09.080> angles<00:06:10.080> just<00:06:10.169> like

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
the center line and angles just like

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.290 
the center line and angles just like
that<00:06:13.160> now<00:06:14.160> I'm<00:06:14.250> not<00:06:14.370> going<00:06:14.699> to<00:06:14.789> get<00:06:15.060> into

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
that now I'm not going to get into

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.689 
that now I'm not going to get into
