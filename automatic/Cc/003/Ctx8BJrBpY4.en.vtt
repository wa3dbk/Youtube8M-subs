00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.520
 income per year 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.740

 severe acute pathology there is a pathology 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.340
 Paul and traumatics, nobody should owe them 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.759
 to learn 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.920
 besides this hospital offers an anti 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.380
 cancellation of services either within the 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.590

 so buzz and pediatric two 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.549
 cardiac employees that we do not have 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.320
 even relationship as they put services of

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.850
 the versatility is perhaps the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.390
 most important characteristics by the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.310
 geographical location or inclusion in 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.520
 a zone 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.619
 of communications like this 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.200
 Lleida we have many patients 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.899
 polytraumatized there were very 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.189
 important polytraumatisms are

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.260
 in this service to which processed they handle 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.420
 especially well at teacher level 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.310
 when the president comes to our 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.340

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.350
 individual training plan and may 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.900
 actively participate in teaching 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.330

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.220
 type of clinical review 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.870
 bibliographic mortality and having 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.370
 in mind that we are a hospital 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.910

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.840
 sent a change in the type of 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.340
 patients that we included in the 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.190

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.760
 of these post operatives I would like 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.880

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.550
 leadership in many aspects

 in nutrition in a teaching activity 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.010

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.590
 in surveillance and control to the 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.319
 channeling did not mean leadership to 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.019
 national level 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.290

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.909
 two of the most pneumonia programs 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:02.409
