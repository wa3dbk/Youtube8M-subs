00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.310 
notch here that slides into next thing
you<00:02:00.509> put<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:01.460> is<00:02:02.460> our<00:02:02.729> air<00:02:02.850> box<00:02:03.079> but<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.200> can

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you put on is our air box but you can

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.440 
you put on is our air box but you can
actually<00:02:04.439> put<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.270> rear

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
actually put this all on with the rear

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.059 
actually put this all on with the rear
subframe<00:02:06.960> which<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.320> what<00:02:07.469> we're<00:02:07.649> going<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> do

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
subframe which is what we're going to do

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.369 
subframe which is what we're going to do
but<00:02:09.410> essentially<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.530> just

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
but essentially you just

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.300 
but essentially you just
put<00:02:11.739> this<00:02:11.890> in<00:02:12.069> here<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:13.439> voila<00:02:14.439> we're<00:02:15.159> going

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
put this in here and voila we're going

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.470 
put this in here and voila we're going
to<00:02:15.370> go<00:02:15.430> ahead<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.700> put<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.909> whole<00:02:16.030> entire

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
to go ahead and put the whole entire

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.199 
to go ahead and put the whole entire
rear<00:02:16.780> subframe<00:02:17.260> on<00:02:17.469> and<00:02:17.879> we'll<00:02:18.879> do<00:02:18.999> that<00:02:19.150> all

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
rear subframe on and we'll do that all

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.670 
rear subframe on and we'll do that all
in<00:02:19.359> this<00:02:19.540> video<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.230> stay<00:02:20.590> tuned<00:02:20.889> okay<00:02:22.680> we've

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
in this video so stay tuned okay we've

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.979 
in this video so stay tuned okay we've
got<00:02:23.859> the<00:02:24.010> air<00:02:24.340> box<00:02:24.549> attached<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.840> rear

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
got the air box attached to the rear

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.020 
got the air box attached to the rear
subframe<00:02:26.530> I'm<00:02:27.129> just<00:02:27.310> going<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.459> go<00:02:27.579> ahead<00:02:27.819> and

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
subframe I'm just going to go ahead and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.229 
subframe I'm just going to go ahead and
slide<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.480> on<00:02:28.719> here<00:02:31.620> watching<00:02:32.620> out<00:02:32.709> for<00:02:32.739> our

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
slide it on here watching out for our

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.379 
slide it on here watching out for our
freshly<00:02:34.239> painted<00:02:35.700> frame<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:37.329> your

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:37.389 
freshly painted frame in for your

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:42.179 
freshly painted frame in for your
subframe<00:02:39.870> go<00:02:40.870> ahead<00:02:41.139> and<00:02:41.319> slide<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.650> boot

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
subframe go ahead and slide that boot

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.080 
subframe go ahead and slide that boot
now<00:02:42.730> this<00:02:42.909> one<00:02:43.060> does<00:02:43.239> have<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.569> clamp<00:02:44.879> which<00:02:45.879> is

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
now this one does have to clamp which is

00:02:46.090 --> 00:03:09.220 
now this one does have to clamp which is
nice

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.429 

there<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:10.379> go

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:15.439 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.490 

they're<00:03:17.000> got<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.090> get<00:03:18.180> one<00:03:18.390> end<00:03:18.569> in<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.989> then

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
they're got to get one end in and then

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.990 
they're got to get one end in and then
the<00:03:19.680> next<00:03:20.010> thing<00:03:20.099> we'll<00:03:20.250> do<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.430> we'll<00:03:20.640> put<00:03:20.879> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
the next thing we'll do is we'll put the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.479 
the next thing we'll do is we'll put the
two<00:03:21.120> screws<00:03:21.420> here<00:03:21.659> screws<00:03:22.260> there<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.829> we'll

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
two screws here screws there and we'll

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.209 
two screws here screws there and we'll
be<00:03:23.609> done<00:03:23.819> with<00:03:23.879> this<00:03:24.469> as<00:03:25.469> part<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.829> build

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:26.219 
be done with this as part of the build

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.000 
be done with this as part of the build
so<00:03:26.810> carbs<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:27.959> place<00:03:28.170> do<00:03:28.500> not<00:03:28.530> have<00:03:28.829> anything

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
so carbs in place do not have anything

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.039 
so carbs in place do not have anything
else<00:03:29.220> in<00:03:29.430> place<00:03:29.670> on<00:03:29.879> there<00:03:30.030> next<00:03:30.840> thing<00:03:30.930> we'll

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
else in place on there next thing we'll

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.460 
else in place on there next thing we'll
do<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.200> probably<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.620> rear<00:03:31.769> fender<00:03:32.189> and
