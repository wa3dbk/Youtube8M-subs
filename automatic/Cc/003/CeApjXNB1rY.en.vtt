00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:20.070
 this time he is a new tutor and 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.020
 new stations of a new tutorial 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.990
 how to use our iphone device 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.300
 or android to play in 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.289
 our screens like a webcam 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.480
 okay 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.700
 good for this we need to enter a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.800
 page called moviola dotcom 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.430
 good as you see here we appear four 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.000
 programs to which we are going to give that 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.810
 he said he moved the webcam 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.710
 in download and how they see the devices 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.710
 with whom he works 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.870
 and will ask you to keep them as you already 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.870
 I had saved here 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.130
 and good as you can see, I'm going to the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.450
 folder where you downloaded what 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.689
 and the program 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.350
 and well here is the file that 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.530
 contains two files for both 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.850
 more or for windows or that in this case 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.870
 like windows 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.300
 adn 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.880
 in a windows logger here we 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.060
 appears the language they want to occupy 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.070
 in this case I am Spanish or already 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.490
 They know how to install me they will give me the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.930
 following 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.930
 true living 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.579
 and here we will ask the deputies 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.030
 when they turn on their computers and this 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.050
 case, "he said," I will say no, 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.610
 just finish and install it 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.540
 being a part of the installation 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.940
 digital the drivers give you the same 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.240
 accept to install what are the 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.550
 drivers to run the program and 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.410
 can work for them or that may take 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.260
 a little bit in installing the drivers the 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.290
 you despair, I hope you have them 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:21.170
 it became clear what the installation and 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.170

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.360

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.970
 it is not connected 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.180

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.590
 I already have the application 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.319
 the application is called web camera and the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.300
 cost of it is 36 pesos good and 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.700
 that have the application installed before 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.010
 to enter what the application have 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.290

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.569
 what is the application in our 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.939
 web device but it was a moment 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.349
 in what it ends up loading and how they see 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.480
 Here you have already detected what is my 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.120
 computer this is going to connect 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.159
 via wifi ok 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.280
 ie they have to be connected to 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:21.860
 same wifi that they have on their computer 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.560
 only remains to give in what is 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.380
 the name of your computer and ready now 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.540
 they will access 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.800
 now we see each other so they can see how 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.280
 see this ok 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.620
 up to now good we are already here a 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.650
 computer to see what it looks like 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.410
 what is this application and good for 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.510
 this as I had told you before 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.780
 they have to give him in the name of his 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.700
 computer today I'm also giving you 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.980
 to the name of my computer are they 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.490
 connecting and as you see here it appears 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.560
 a message we will give in allowing 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.950
 and right now he is attending what 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.300
 the camera and right now I'm recording 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.390
 the league camera then 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.940
 from here we can 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:12.890
 leave a recording with what our 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:15.610
 devices take a picture and here there are 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.610
 some small 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.800
 how to see quality from scratch 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.520
 with a very good quality 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:43.790
 in this case then the quality is not 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.620
 so good depending on the device that 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.800

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.230

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.129

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.060
 for any school work and 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:08.540
 other things he had not been able to do in his life 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.730
