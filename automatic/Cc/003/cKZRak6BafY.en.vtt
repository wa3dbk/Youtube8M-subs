the<00:00:49.980> map<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.579> huge<00:00:50.760> however<00:00:51.420> this

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the map is going to be huge however this

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.840 
the map is going to be huge however this
is<00:00:52.079> still<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.320> big<00:00:52.559> deal<00:00:52.739> people<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.489> looking<00:00:53.760> at

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
this map for the first time here are a

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
this map for the first time here are a
few<00:00:55.680> things<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.219> stood<00:00:56.399> out<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.610> me<00:00:56.789> this

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
few things that stood out to me this

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.939 
few things that stood out to me this
appears<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> Griffith<00:00:58.770> Observatory

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
appears to be the Griffith Observatory

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.979 
appears to be the Griffith Observatory
that<00:00:59.730> we've<00:00:59.850> been<00:01:00.059> seeing<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.480> screenshots

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that we've been seeing in screenshots

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.479 
that we've been seeing in screenshots
and<00:01:01.140> pictures<00:01:01.500> since<00:01:01.800> grand<00:01:02.039> theft<00:01:02.129> auto<00:01:02.280> 5

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and pictures since grand theft auto 5

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.729 
and pictures since grand theft auto 5
was<00:01:02.640> announced<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.470> judging<00:01:04.470> from<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
was announced and judging from the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.200 
was announced and judging from the
overhead<00:01:05.040> view<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:05.549> that's<00:01:05.880> got<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.119> be

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
overhead view I think that's got to be

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.789 
overhead view I think that's got to be
it<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.659> then<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.170> would<00:01:07.290> mean<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.500> this

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it and then that would mean that this

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.710 
it and then that would mean that this
part<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.700> course<00:01:08.880> downtown<00:01:09.510> Los

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
part here is of course downtown Los

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.929 
part here is of course downtown Los
Santos<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.590> then<00:01:10.740> moving<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.490> saw<00:01:11.700> what

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
Santos and then moving on I saw what

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.850 
Santos and then moving on I saw what
appeared<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.479> racetrack<00:01:12.930> or<00:01:13.320> something

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
appeared to be a racetrack or something

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920 
appeared to be a racetrack or something
of<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:13.979> sort<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:15.090> I'm<00:01:15.720> wondering

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
of the sort right here I'm wondering

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.330 
of the sort right here I'm wondering
that<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.350> where<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.770> maybe<00:01:16.920> take<00:01:17.159> our

it's<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.520> some<00:01:26.790> other<00:01:26.909> sort<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> track<00:01:27.689> what

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it's just some other sort of track what

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.510 
it's just some other sort of track what
do<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.960> guys<00:01:28.049> think<00:01:28.110> about<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.369> then

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
do you guys think about that and then

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.580 
do you guys think about that and then
over<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.390> outskirts<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.079> Los<00:01:31.320> Santos

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
over here is the outskirts of Los Santos

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.980 
over here is the outskirts of Los Santos
this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.490> where<00:01:32.729> maybe<00:01:33.030> blaine<00:01:33.390> county<00:01:33.659> would

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
this is where maybe blaine county would

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.420 
this is where maybe blaine county would
start<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.380> connect<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:34.860> something<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.369> that

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
start to connect or something like that

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.370 
start to connect or something like that
and<00:01:35.909> looking<00:01:36.540> over<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:36.930> these<00:01:37.110> things

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and looking over here at these things

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230 
and looking over here at these things
jutting<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:38.040> into<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> ocean<00:01:38.460> these<00:01:38.909> are<00:01:39.090> of

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
jutting off into the ocean these are of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.910 
jutting off into the ocean these are of
course<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.659> piers<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.200> saw<00:01:40.380> once<00:01:40.710> again

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
course the piers that we saw once again

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
course the piers that we saw once again
in<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> screenshots<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> pictures<00:01:42.180> where

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
in the screenshots in the pictures where

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.060 
in the screenshots in the pictures where
people<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.810> hustling<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.320> bustling<00:01:43.619> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
people are hustling and bustling and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.609 
people are hustling and bustling and
then<00:01:44.700> finally<00:01:45.119> i<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> ask<00:01:45.750> myself<00:01:45.930> where

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
then finally i have to ask myself where

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.560 
then finally i have to ask myself where
is<00:01:46.890> michael's<00:01:47.340> house<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.180> where<00:01:48.420> is

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
is michael's house in this and where is

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.389 
is michael's house in this and where is
Franklin's<00:01:49.140> house<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.770> now<00:01:50.040> I'm<00:01:50.220> going

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
Franklin's house in this now I'm going

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.850 
Franklin's house in this now I'm going
to<00:01:50.520> assume<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.880> Trevor's<00:01:51.720> trailer<00:01:52.500> Trevor's

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
to assume that Trevor's trailer Trevor's

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.109 
to assume that Trevor's trailer Trevor's
house<00:01:53.040> whatever<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.520> want<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.729> call<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.880> is

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
house whatever you want to call it is

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.569 
house whatever you want to call it is
not<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:55.020> part<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.770> assume<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.340> he's

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
not in this part I assume that he's

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.209 
not in this part I assume that he's
farther<00:01:56.820> north<00:01:57.329> or<00:01:57.600> maybe<00:01:57.840> East<00:01:58.560> off<00:01:58.979> into

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
farther north or maybe East off into

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.410 
farther north or maybe East off into
Blaine<00:01:59.399> County<00:01:59.610> but<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> think<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.180> Michael

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
Blaine County but I think that Michael

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.330 
Blaine County but I think that Michael
and<00:02:00.600> Franklin<00:02:00.780> both<00:02:01.200> most<00:02:01.560> likely<00:02:01.619> live<00:02:02.100> in

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and Franklin both most likely live in

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.760 
and Franklin both most likely live in
this<00:02:02.460> area<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.390> guys<00:02:03.600> by<00:02:04.170> no<00:02:04.259> means<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.740> this

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
this area so guys by no means is this

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.590 
this area so guys by no means is this
analysis<00:02:05.460> those<00:02:06.060> are<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.420> few<00:02:06.450> things

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
analysis those are just a few things

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660 
analysis those are just a few things
that<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.930> thought<00:02:07.079> I'd<00:02:07.200> share<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.770> I'm

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
sure there will be other analysis of

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.350
