00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
rocket of power completely destroyed

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.470 
rocket of power completely destroyed
this<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:16.960> whole<00:02:17.140> area<00:02:17.530> okay<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:18.460> how<00:02:19.030> does

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
this this whole area okay so how does

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.680 
this this whole area okay so how does
this<00:02:19.540> work<00:02:20.230> right<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.430> one<00:02:21.970> command

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
this work right this is one command

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.160 
this work right this is one command
block<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.050> one<00:02:23.410> command<00:02:24.010> block<00:02:24.210> only<00:02:25.210> okay

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
block and one command block only okay

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.830 
block and one command block only okay
this<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:26.920> very<00:02:26.950> very<00:02:27.790> awesome<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.600> this<00:02:28.690> is

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
this is very very awesome so this is

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.600 
this is very very awesome so this is
this<00:02:28.930> command<00:02:29.260> block<00:02:29.350> over<00:02:29.650> here<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:30.340> all<00:02:30.490> it

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
this command block over here so all it

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.490 
this command block over here so all it
does<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.030> an<00:02:31.180> execute<00:02:31.630> command<00:02:31.990> that

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
does it's an execute command that

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.890 
does it's an execute command that
executes<00:02:33.070> when<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.850> finds<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.270> zombie<00:02:34.690> it's

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
executes when it finds a zombie it's

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.580 
executes when it finds a zombie it's
going<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.290> execute<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.750> it's<00:02:37.900> this<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.260> this

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
going to execute so it's this is a this

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.620 
going to execute so it's this is a this
is<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.800> nested<00:02:39.430> execute<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.240> first<00:02:40.480> thing

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
is a nested execute so the first thing

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.490 
is a nested execute so the first thing
is<00:02:40.750> any<00:02:41.080> zombie<00:02:41.830> will<00:02:42.280> execute<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:44.290> following

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
is any zombie will execute the following

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.250 
is any zombie will execute the following
command<00:02:44.680> at<00:02:45.220> any<00:02:45.640> other<00:02:45.970> non<00:02:46.600> zombie<00:02:47.080> that's

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
command at any other non zombie that's

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.110 
command at any other non zombie that's
within<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.680> two-block<00:02:48.280> radius<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.820> any<00:02:48.970> other

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
within a two-block radius so any other

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.030 
within a two-block radius so any other
so<00:02:49.510> if<00:02:49.690> there's<00:02:49.989> a<00:02:50.050> zombie<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.530> anything<00:02:50.890> else

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
so if there's a zombie and anything else

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.130 
so if there's a zombie and anything else
that<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.790> an<00:02:52.000> entity<00:02:52.270> that<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.630> within<00:02:52.870> two

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
that is an entity that is within two

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.560 
that is an entity that is within two
blocks<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.700> particular<00:02:54.700> zombie<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.209> will

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
blocks of that particular zombie it will

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.190 
blocks of that particular zombie it will
execute<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.260> summon<00:02:56.890> primed<00:02:57.580> TNT<00:02:58.480> command<00:02:59.020> on

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
execute a summon primed TNT command on

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.140 
execute a summon primed TNT command on
that<00:02:59.260> entity<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.489> if<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.700> actually<00:03:00.880> have<00:03:01.090> a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
that entity so if you actually have a

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.330 
that entity so if you actually have a
look<00:03:01.330> you'll<00:03:02.170> see<00:03:02.350> over<00:03:02.470> here<00:03:02.739> we've<00:03:02.860> got<00:03:02.890> a

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
look you'll see over here we've got a

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.610 
look you'll see over here we've got a
