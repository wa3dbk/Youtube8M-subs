eraser and a compass first start by
drawing<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:02.090> line<00:01:03.199> in<00:01:04.199> your<00:01:04.260> space<00:01:05.930> next<00:01:06.930> take

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
drawing a line in your space next take

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.539 
drawing a line in your space next take
your<00:01:07.890> compass<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.740> starting<00:01:10.740> at<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.040> point<00:01:11.400> on

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
your compass and starting at a point on

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.810 
your compass and starting at a point on
the<00:01:14.549> line<00:01:15.799> draw<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> circle

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.070 

don't<00:01:20.820> make<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.150> too<00:01:21.180> dark<00:01:21.570> because<00:01:21.960> you're

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
don't make it too dark because you're

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.580 
don't make it too dark because you're
going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.470> erase<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
going to erase it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.850 
going to erase it
next<00:01:25.590> take<00:01:26.100> your<00:01:26.130> points<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:28.939> mark

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
next take your points and mark

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.990 
next take your points and mark
up<00:01:31.760> here<00:01:32.680> on<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.860> line<00:01:34.100> where<00:01:34.400> it<00:01:34.490> intersects

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
up here on the line where it intersects

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.280 
up here on the line where it intersects
with<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.360> circumference<00:01:35.810> of<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.110> circle

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
with the circumference of the circle

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:47.140 
with the circumference of the circle
rock<00:01:36.950> up<00:01:37.190> here<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:41.420> down<00:01:41.720> here<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:46.280> here<00:01:46.910> as

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
rock up here and down here and here as

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.440 
rock up here and down here and here as
well

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.660 

next<00:01:52.900> basically<00:01:53.900> try<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:54.860> find<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.340> center

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
next basically try and find the center

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.920 
next basically try and find the center
in<00:01:56.030> between<00:01:56.330> these<00:01:56.479> two<00:01:56.750> points<00:01:57.200> here

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.570 

mark<00:02:04.770> those<00:02:05.040> two<00:02:05.250> points<00:02:06.080> there<00:02:10.310> spawn<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.490> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
mark those two points there spawn on the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.680 
mark those two points there spawn on the
outside<00:02:12.000> where<00:02:12.240> they<00:02:12.330> intersect<00:02:12.980> yeah<00:02:15.830> here

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
outside where they intersect yeah here

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:33.080 
outside where they intersect yeah here
great<00:02:25.730> basically<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:26.940> gonna<00:02:27.090> mark<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:32.090> small

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
great basically just gonna mark a small

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.449 
great basically just gonna mark a small
circle<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.720> center<00:02:35.630> using<00:02:38.480> radius<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.690> 1/2

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
circle in the center using radius of 1/2

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.180 
circle in the center using radius of 1/2
of<00:02:41.459> one<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.730> these<00:02:41.820> distances<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:43.190> little

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
of one of these distances a little

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.449 
of one of these distances a little
smaller<00:02:44.959> I'm<00:02:45.959> gonna<00:02:46.080> check<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.620> one<00:02:46.890> see<00:02:47.340> if

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
smaller I'm gonna check this one see if

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.059 
smaller I'm gonna check this one see if
it's<00:02:47.610> about<00:02:47.820> have<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:49.640> there

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.149 

remark<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.909> little<00:02:55.469> circle<00:02:56.469> in<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.799> center

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
remark a little circle in the center

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:04.470 
remark a little circle in the center
that's<00:02:57.549> your<00:02:57.790> center<00:02:58.180> boss

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:19.800 

No

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.470 

start<00:03:20.590> drawing<00:03:20.980> basically<00:03:21.790> what's<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.060> maltese

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
start drawing basically what's a maltese

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.730 
start drawing basically what's a maltese
cross<00:03:24.480> hitting<00:03:25.480> these<00:03:25.630> points<00:03:28.170> draw<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.200> slight

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
cross hitting these points draw a slight

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:37.370 
cross hitting these points draw a slight
curve<00:03:30.250> towards<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.910> center

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.470 

I'm<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.190> doing<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.520> approximately<00:03:39.150> you

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
I'm just doing this approximately you

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.630 
I'm just doing this approximately you
can<00:03:39.510> take<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> long<00:03:40.320> time<00:03:40.770> doing<00:03:41.130> this<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.490> get

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
can take a long time doing this to get

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.720 
can take a long time doing this to get
this<00:03:41.880> cross<00:03:43.070> cut<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.220> cross<00:03:44.460> shape<00:03:44.760> perfect

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
this cross cut the cross shape perfect

00:03:46.730 --> 00:04:02.309 
this cross cut the cross shape perfect
there<00:03:50.060> next<00:03:55.730> you're<00:03:56.730> just<00:03:56.910> gonna<00:03:57.030> mark

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.960 

another<00:04:02.920> circle<00:04:03.519> surrounding<00:04:04.180> this<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:05.970> then

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
another circle surrounding this and then

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.979 
another circle surrounding this and then
just<00:04:07.000> measured<00:04:07.599> in<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.780> bit<00:04:08.110> to<00:04:08.769> try<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.159> make

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
just measured in a bit to try and make

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.350 
just measured in a bit to try and make
just<00:04:10.989> a<00:04:11.110> little<00:04:11.349> bit<00:04:11.470> less<00:04:11.709> of<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.360> design

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
just a little bit less of this design

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.569 
just a little bit less of this design
there<00:04:14.260> we<00:04:14.349> go<00:04:14.470> on<00:04:16.350> like<00:04:17.350> that<00:04:17.410> it's<00:04:18.280> just<00:04:18.459> a

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
there we go on like that it's just a

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.000 
there we go on like that it's just a
little<00:04:18.820> bit<00:04:19.209> less<00:04:20.019> thickness<00:04:20.500> from<00:04:20.650> here<00:04:20.919> to

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
little bit less thickness from here to

I'm<00:04:47.979> going<00:04:48.309> to<00:04:48.399> do<00:04:48.899> is<00:04:49.899> basically<00:04:50.139> draw<00:04:50.649> a

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
I'm going to do is basically draw a

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.249 
I'm going to do is basically draw a
shape<00:04:51.399> very<00:04:51.819> similar<00:04:52.210> to<00:04:52.389> this<00:04:53.159> starting<00:04:55.259> two

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
shape very similar to this starting two

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:01.950 
shape very similar to this starting two
points<00:04:56.710> here<00:04:59.099> again<00:05:00.099> in<00:05:00.219> this<00:05:00.309> quadrant<00:05:00.610> I<00:05:01.089> can

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
points here again in this quadrant I can

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:11.359 
points here again in this quadrant I can
on<00:05:02.080> this<00:05:02.229> quadrant<00:05:03.629> again<00:05:04.629> and<00:05:05.259> this<00:05:05.499> quadrant

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:11.369 

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:15.570 

make<00:05:12.369> a<00:05:12.990> crescent<00:05:13.990> shape<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.860> try<00:05:15.219> and<00:05:15.399> match

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
make a crescent shape and try and match

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:25.189 
make a crescent shape and try and match
a<00:05:16.740> crescent<00:05:17.740> shape<00:05:17.800> in<00:05:18.339> each<00:05:20.369> quadrant

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.089

right now what we're going to do is take

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:39.280 
right now what we're going to do is take
this<00:05:29.789> point<00:05:30.680> connected<00:05:31.680> here

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.310 

this<00:05:40.290> line<00:05:40.590> here<00:05:41.100> is<00:05:41.130> where<00:05:42.260> this<00:05:43.260> little

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
this line here is where this little

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.520 
this line here is where this little
triskele<00:05:45.290> intersects<00:05:47.600> you<00:05:48.600> can<00:05:48.750> see<00:05:48.960> here<00:05:49.350> you

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
triskele intersects you can see here you

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.780 
triskele intersects you can see here you
want<00:05:49.710> that<00:05:49.920> to<00:05:50.160> intersect<00:05:50.700> right<00:05:50.880> there<00:05:51.210> to

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
want that to intersect right there to

00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:00.309 
want that to intersect right there to
and<00:05:53.790> up<00:05:53.970> to<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.240> side

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.379 

and<00:06:00.979> you<00:06:01.069> can<00:06:01.249> see<00:06:01.430> all<00:06:01.669> of<00:06:01.699> the<00:06:01.879> tres<00:06:02.119> girls

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389

and you can see all of the tres girls
we've<00:06:02.599> made<00:06:03.099> right<00:06:04.719> next<00:06:05.719> we're<00:06:05.899> going<00:06:06.110> to

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
we've made right next we're going to

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:12.279 
we've made right next we're going to
draw<00:06:06.439> the<00:06:06.469> ribbon<00:06:07.189> around<00:06:08.059> the<00:06:10.509> spine<00:06:11.509> of<00:06:12.110> the

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
draw the ribbon around the spine of the

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.859 
draw the ribbon around the spine of the
not<00:06:12.469> work<00:06:12.710> you<00:06:13.520> can<00:06:13.550> see<00:06:13.849> that<00:06:13.999> we've<00:06:14.119> got<00:06:14.300> one

00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:14.869 
not work you can see that we've got one

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:19.869 
not work you can see that we've got one
two<00:06:15.800> three<00:06:16.159> four<00:06:17.149> Tris<00:06:18.139> geld<00:06:18.460> spine<00:06:19.460> designs

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:19.879 
two three four Tris geld spine designs

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.149 
two three four Tris geld spine designs
because<00:06:20.180> this<00:06:20.330> repeats<00:06:20.629> every<00:06:20.899> one<00:06:21.110> two<00:06:21.860> and

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:22.159 
because this repeats every one two and

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:26.050 
because this repeats every one two and
then<00:06:22.639> three<00:06:23.050> steps
