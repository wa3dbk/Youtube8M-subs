00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.750
 hello all how are you and welcome to a 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.240
 new video continue with the campaign 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.099
 last of us was not lying 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.410
 let's continue testing the maps of 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.330
 this new realistic dlc already played in 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.830
 we played on the dock and it was 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.230
 pretty good so now let's see 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.170
 how is it going on this new map is called 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.670
 Water tower I hope it's a good map 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.830
 my idea in this video is going to be you can 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.840
 see the setting see also 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.550
 done this and of course I'm also going 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.430
 to try to have a good game 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.529
 truth and apparently I'm entering a 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.100
 starting started and I'm accompanied by 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.800
 well, the great simpson homero like that is 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.730
 we are playing is fine and I had in full 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.440
 christmas eve parties that you things 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.020
 you have insects 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.270
 there I think I was wrong but do not go 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.690
 out there do not go there because they're going to 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.690
 Appear 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.300
 Yes it is 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:06.000
 I think I better go, Joe, that seems to me 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.520
 perfect I look ok let's try this 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.360
 new map I have a new weapon too 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.030
 here is one up and here but soon 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.250
 We have found a milestone camper and agaves 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.630
 of the bullets the good of the good what 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.430
 good the bad thing that when a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.550
 starting already started as they give you a little 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.620
 of money to buy weapons and I bought myself 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.170
 this new weapon that is called as 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.140
 llama I do not remember the name anymore so is the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.000
 spectrum is a very good weapon stuns 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.860
 quite since I have here too 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.350
 according to the bad thing about this weapon is that 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.770
 you can shoot a lot of bullets and it's very 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.619
 likely to have the cartridge very 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.210
 very fast 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.740
 good for people who have seen 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.030
 in videos of the last of us already know 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.630
 that it's normal for me to play with the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.630
 bow and arrow 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.770
 I did not have scavengers, do not do it 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.370
 but why so much cruelty now clarified 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.370
 that our friend there 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.469
 LOL 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.819
 and I do care, I forgive you what 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.510
 had fondly but please such 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.280
 that I recovered to my regret that I had been 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.019
 previously I was 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.720
 saying that for people who have 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.129
 seen videos you will already know that the normal thing is 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.760
 that I play with the bow and arrow 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.920
 like that weapon but in this video I'm going to 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.780
 try the new weapons that they have put 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.780
 in this new update 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.660
 r you run friend wait for me 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.580
 good will also be remembered 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.870
 I already know that there are many people who hate 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.640
 cropped I am one of them 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.330
 I hate a lot that people cut out game 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.530
 but since I had a space left over 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:58.640
 good 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:03.400
 around here the scale is not going to heal and not 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.400
 dies there is 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.320
 and I have bullets and I have no longer going to 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.330
 see the box that gives me ammunition or 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.240
 at least if you give me the picks for me 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.450
 stick not here you come from my arms children 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.450
 mine 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.490
 I love how confusions look 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:30.590
 but obviously that the best execution 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:30.590
 of all time with the machete 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.200
 unlike I've seen that there are more than 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.390
 one here 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.770
 and I'm going to create a molotov and I'm going to 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:46.070
 expect him to heal in this match 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.020
 take this ha ha ha what you like to be 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.250
 a good friend, I do not like to see 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.250
 so much happiness together 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.820
 we will make our choca picks 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.040
 play what I'm looking for or what I 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.790
 I'm realizing that I do not have 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.050
 life and I wonder on this map in 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.050
 where the first aid kits are 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.360
 he also asks me if my friends 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.019
 will be with manufacturers to see friends from 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.620
 first aid kit happen to me go fuck 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.230
 team I have I do not have a support team 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.870
 so m 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.550
 well at least I can buy the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.050
 games bullets for the spectrum 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.220
 but what I want now is a first aid kit 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.220
 a fucking first aid kit 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.430
 we can not do that here there is not 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.150
 I can not find any medicine cabinet and I'm 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:46.289
 a bullet to die if you give me one or two 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.599
 bullets i am dead man 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.729
 and as this map I do not know I do not know 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.320
 even where they have put the 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:59.550
 medicine cabinets 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:01.140
 while you can not, he 's too serious 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.180
 I'm too lucky 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.910
 if I had hit I would have killed 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.680
 but even if I get a little life already 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.900
 I have absolutely nothing 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.020
 living day free 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.930
 and I still find a kit that 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.479
 can save my life, do not go there 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.300
 do not go there because they do not go there 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:25.050
 appear first aid kits 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.940
 what am I doing please good no 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.699
 there is this kit that and I'm undefeated 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.710
 they still do not kill me so I do not know what 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.660
 make me stay hidden here I hope that 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.080
 my team finish with the others 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.420
 or if I go out to the battlefield they 're going to 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.470
 kill and I will not be undefeated I found 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:48.130
 good that destiny to stay once 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.890
 more and now if I'm not going to heal anything nothing 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.370
 this meal completes again 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:06:00.210
 they will see these insects in just 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:00.210
 I saw a second while it is still 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.500
 I really just ran and happily 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.870
 is not using an expert in 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.800
 explosives because that bomb could have 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.660
 killed 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.700
 I hope that he did not do it because 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.620
 it would have been unfortunate to have suffered 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.570
 both to find a first-aid kit and to 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.460
 then die immediately to look only 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.040
 there are two left so I will go running to 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.210
 see if I can kill the last one let's go or if 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.639
 we can do it 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.530
 return never again and good friends 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.650
 until you get this video 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.090
 we won the game at least it was my 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.970
 first game on this tower map 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.280
 water is very good but I liked it better 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.199
 previous the pier so good friends 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.990
 I hope you liked this 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:46.370
 7-0 they did not kill me I think it was a 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.770
 good game, what do you think? 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.509
 you already know that put your comments here 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.180
 below and give like a study that would be 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:55.880
 I channel a lot of dismissal and we already 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.190
 we see until next time and do not go by 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:03.009
 there do not go there because they are going to 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.009
 appear I was goodbye
