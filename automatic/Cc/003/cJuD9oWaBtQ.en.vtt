purposes<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:14.530> don't<00:01:14.710> want<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:14.979> pulley<00:01:15.340> when

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
purposes you don't want the pulley when

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:17.249 
purposes you don't want the pulley when
you<00:01:16.090> squeeze<00:01:16.329> it<00:01:16.390> together<00:01:16.600> just<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.140> be

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
you squeeze it together just to be

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.080 
you squeeze it together just to be
squeezing<00:01:17.649> on<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.860> belt<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.759> want<00:01:18.939> these

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
squeezing on the belt you want these

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.730 
squeezing on the belt you want these
shims<00:01:19.329> in<00:01:19.479> there<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.750> regulate<00:01:19.990> how<00:01:20.350> tight

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
shims in there to regulate how tight

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.499 
shims in there to regulate how tight
against<00:01:21.070> against<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.490> belt<00:01:21.700> as<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.270> how<00:01:22.390> much

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
against against the belt as to how much

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.170 
against against the belt as to how much
force<00:01:22.840> it's<00:01:22.990> gonna<00:01:23.109> have<00:01:23.289> from<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:23.530> outside

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
force it's gonna have from the outside

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.249 
force it's gonna have from the outside
so<00:01:25.180> I'm<00:01:25.240> gonna<00:01:25.359> start<00:01:25.509> with<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.719> small<00:01:25.930> handful

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
so I'm gonna start with a small handful

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.740 
so I'm gonna start with a small handful
that<00:01:26.320> were<00:01:26.500> usually<00:01:26.619> about<00:01:26.859> an<00:01:27.009> 8<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.340> 10<00:01:27.750> got

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
that were usually about an 8 to 10 got

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.209 
that were usually about an 8 to 10 got
six<00:01:29.109> of<00:01:29.229> them<00:01:29.350> in<00:01:29.469> the<00:01:29.560> middle<00:01:30.180> back<00:01:31.180> on<00:01:31.390> here

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
six of them in the middle back on here

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.590 
six of them in the middle back on here
squeeze<00:01:33.219> a<00:01:33.250> little<00:01:33.460> bit<00:01:33.609> to<00:01:33.850> give<00:01:34.359> you<00:01:34.420> some

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
squeeze a little bit to give you some

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.100 
squeeze a little bit to give you some
room<00:01:34.810> on<00:01:34.990> top<00:01:35.200> here

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
pull your face put a couple shins on the

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.900 
pull your face put a couple shins on the
outside<00:01:45.490> here<00:01:47.370> again<00:01:48.370> we're<00:01:48.550> just<00:01:48.580> guessing

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
outside here again we're just guessing

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:57.770 
outside here again we're just guessing
now<00:01:49.300> to<00:01:49.360> adjust<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:49.990> you<00:01:50.080> don't<00:01:50.200> know

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.910 

I'm<00:01:58.780> gonna<00:01:58.900> take<00:01:59.080> up<00:01:59.200> some<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.500> slack<00:01:59.619> out

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
I'm gonna take up some of the slack out

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.380 
I'm gonna take up some of the slack out
of<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.160> so<00:02:00.250> I'm<00:02:00.310> gonna<00:02:00.400> put<00:02:00.580> a<00:02:00.610> couple<00:02:00.790> turns<00:02:01.150> on

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
of it so I'm gonna put a couple turns on

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.500 
of it so I'm gonna put a couple turns on
it<00:02:01.479> just<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.630> tighten<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.050> up<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:04.119> you'll<00:02:04.270> see

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
it just to tighten it up and you'll see

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.480 
it just to tighten it up and you'll see
that<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:04.840> belt<00:02:05.410> is<00:02:05.500> way<00:02:05.710> down<00:02:06.010> on<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.340> pulley

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
that the belt is way down on the pulley

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:14.130 
that the belt is way down on the pulley
there<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.730> now<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.360> belts<00:02:13.630> come<00:02:13.840> up<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.050> the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
there and now the belts come up to the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.460 
there and now the belts come up to the
top<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.590> pulley<00:02:16.050> my<00:02:17.050> stove<00:02:17.290> some

the belt up in vice versa if it was just

the belt up in vice versa if it was just
to<00:03:25.180> just<00:03:26.019> way<00:03:26.560> too<00:03:26.739> sloppy

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
I would take them out on the outside and

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.840 
I would take them out on the outside and
put<00:03:29.230> them<00:03:29.350> on<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.530> inside<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:30.040> tighten<00:03:30.459> up<00:03:30.670> on

put them on the inside to tighten up on
the<00:03:30.970> belt<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.420> not<00:03:31.870> just<00:03:32.049> on<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.260> pulley
