 its closures that allows us to take care of 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.880
 team and thus save space in our 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.910
 luggage when you walk full of boxes 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.469
 this equipment comes ready and complete for 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.730
 go out to work that acquire say 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:41.240
 more accessories we have then over here 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.680
 the case 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.710
 and I'm going to present the rest of 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.870
 products that incorporates 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.539
 have 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.980
 three umbrellas the three umbrellas are 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.579
 white translucent 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.679
 they are big umbrellas of 80 centimeters 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.210
 Perfect for blending and tinting 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.890
 the light 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.020
 the three umbrellas as it brings are 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.699
 same brings a spare because 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.100
 equally that team really consists 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.630
 of two triples and two heads that already 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.280
 I'm going to present the third umbrella of 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.820
 a spare umbrella because soon 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.030
 is made one or we lose some 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.920
 includes two tripods those tripods 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.510
 they serve for these heads or they can 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.390
 use on any device already 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.409
 are flashes in the worst case in 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.530
 a camera too 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.649
 here we have then the tripods for 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.799
 tripod these reach 2 meters in height 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.799
 enough to illuminate any 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.799
 objective 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.860
 let's put it together out here 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.860
 here we have a tripod 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.180
 you already know that they are two of these 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.010
 same 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.110
 and I'm going to present to you then the most 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.890
 important, I find it very interesting 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.990
 this team the heads that incorporates 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.110
 they are two heads each of these 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.810
 heads 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.810
 has power regulation indicator 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.010
 Sound charge modeling light and 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.900
 safety fuses 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.750
 the heads bring in their doors 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.750
 synchronizing your power cables 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.330
 and the head as such 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.190
 here we have then the head 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.860
 regulation of power 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.180
 the modeling light that remains 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.980
 on that allows us to preview 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.400
 how will the light of the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.879
 object 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.849
 the tester slaves the port of 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.140
 synchronization and the fuse the port of 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.540
 synchronization is a site where 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.000
 locate either a trigger cable for 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.439
 shoot the head by cable or some 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.780
 radio frequencies to shoot 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.670
 wirelessly likewise those computers 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.840
 you can shoot from the camera 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.150
 synchronize with the camera's flash 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.730
 we are going to build our 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:06.180
 team then to go see what it is 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.180
 and how our package is made 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.780
 Here then the tripod will 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.270
 we lower the height 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.010
 we put 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.010
 one of our heads 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.049
 ready 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.950
 there is 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:37.230
 we press a remove the equalizer 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.050
 we know then that they are two of 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.190
 these heads 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.370
 two of these tripods 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.110
 three umbrellas and brings a plus pretty 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.560
 interesting I think a point in favor 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.750
 gigantic and is that it incorporates a box 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.610
 of light the light box to while that 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.720
 study carlos that will allow us 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.300
 tint and blur a lot 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.340
 more nice here you have a plate 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.290
 adapter is a plate which adheres to 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.099
 the head brings its 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.790
 four rods let's put it together here 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.340
 quickly 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.480
 before we cut the click that 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.480
 lets us are you tube 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.720
 let's see if we can put it together then 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.550
 the time here is the base appointment is a 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.039
 Pressure base fits perfectly 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.030
 to our lighting team and it's 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.030
 original of this system 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.950
 I'm going to put the first rod are 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.950
 four rods obviously 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.449
 It goes without saying that there are many people who 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.889
 prefers to work only with 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.840
 umbrellas because there they have three 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.280
 umbrellas one more but when 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.680
 we want a little more lighting 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.690
 controlled to better control the shadows 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.060
 prevent light from reaching points where 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.630
 we do not want to arrive we work with 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.810
 the light boxes here we have one then 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.960
 that brings us the equipment and saves us a 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.440
 good money because it is a point in favor 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.440
 we have one 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.669
 the second rod 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.180
 and this we are going to put 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.180
 I'm here 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.110
 mount the boxes of illusions 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:31.659
 inconvenient and that is always a 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.349
 little complex to do it but it's something 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:35.679
 what we have to get used to 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:39.699
 because I do not know a light box that 

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:43.719
 is designed to assemble easily and 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.189
 fast then the inconvenience is worth it 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:49.179
 because the final result is something that 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:52.659
 can produce a single umbrella to a 

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:54.839
 beauty is a different outcome to 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.839
 the rest 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:02.240
 and diffuser products 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.240
 the only one rod missing 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.600
 and if they are doing it because the race 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.600
 it's much more complex 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.360
 they bring some velcros that are going 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.849
 opening to facilitate more the 'armada' 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.979
 of the same 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.569
 already having the 'armada' simply 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.349
 close the vehicles to prevent them from 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:22.349
 let us escape the light 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.050
 yes 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:35.560
 and ride 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.560
 our external diffuser 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.550
 here we have it 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.210
 it was not so hard you really see that it 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.530
 makes more complex 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.530
 the weapon of it 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.300
 and I just have the box and the 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:02.030
 we put and we put 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:05.210
 directly in our team 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.070
 lighting that equipment then it remains 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.200
 presented 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.840
 as they could observe includes their two 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.240
 180 watt heads each the two 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.640
 types of lighting of 2 meters the 3 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.890
 translucent white umbrellas a box 

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.740
 of light or an easy transport bag 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.660
 the power cables and the cables 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.670
 synchronization for a pretty price 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.650
 economic the price can see it 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.010
 published here on the web if you have any 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.180
 question should not do it on our website 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.310
 directly or if you want to acquire it 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.690
 simply to bid, finding us 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.800
 as warehouse or subway cameras in the 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.800
 City of Medellín Colombia
