this<00:01:21.670> demonstration<00:01:22.950> ok<00:01:23.950> what<00:01:24.159> gave<00:01:24.310> me<00:01:24.399> a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
this demonstration ok what gave me a

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.219 
this demonstration ok what gave me a
message<00:01:24.759> sending<00:01:25.060> failed<00:01:25.119> there<00:01:25.719> so<00:01:26.079> let's

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
message sending failed there so let's

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:36.980 
message sending failed there so let's
try<00:01:26.380> sending<00:01:26.679> it<00:01:26.770> again

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.510 

let's<00:01:37.619> try<00:01:37.740> sending<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.189> again

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:59.460 

what<00:01:43.119> I'll<00:01:43.390> probably<00:01:43.899> find<00:01:44.409> is<00:01:45.009> that

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.160 

what<00:02:00.040> will<00:02:00.160> probably<00:02:00.460> find<00:02:00.730> is<00:02:01.060> that<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.510> I

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
what will probably find is that it I

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.080 
what will probably find is that it I
didn't<00:02:02.680> have<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:03.070> number<00:02:03.250> in<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.700> phone<00:02:03.880> as
