00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.099 

today<00:00:02.310> we're<00:00:02.490> going<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:04.640> take<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.779> wave<00:00:06.779> pattern

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
today we're going to take a wave pattern

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.970 
today we're going to take a wave pattern
that<00:00:07.560> was<00:00:09.559> created<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:11.120> Microsoft<00:00:12.120> Excel<00:00:12.630> and

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
that was created in Microsoft Excel and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.779 
that was created in Microsoft Excel and
import<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.429> into<00:00:14.580> picture<00:00:15.000> we've<00:00:15.350> now<00:00:16.789> there's

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
import it into picture we've now there's

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.570 
import it into picture we've now there's
no<00:00:18.000> direct<00:00:18.449> link<00:00:18.710> between<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.100> two<00:00:20.279> programs

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
no direct link between the two programs

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.089 
no direct link between the two programs
so<00:00:21.270> what<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.570> need<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.779> do<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:23.750> open<00:00:24.750> our<00:00:25.099> wave

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
so what we need to do is open our wave

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.029 
so what we need to do is open our wave
pattern<00:00:27.289> and<00:00:28.289> we're<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.619> create<00:00:28.859> an

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
pattern and we're going to create an

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.490 
pattern and we're going to create an
image<00:00:29.369> from<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.000> excel<00:00:30.480> spreadsheet<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
image from this excel spreadsheet so to

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.250 
image from this excel spreadsheet so to
do<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.340> need<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:34.200> zoom<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.940> our

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
do that we just need to zoom out on our

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.540 
do that we just need to zoom out on our
spreadsheet<00:00:37.260> until<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.829> see<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.190> entire

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
spreadsheet until you can see the entire

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.330 
spreadsheet until you can see the entire
pattern<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.469> 77<00:00:41.040> by

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
pattern and you can see here it's 77 by

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.720 
pattern and you can see here it's 77 by
99<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:43.070> we<00:00:44.070> select<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:46.860> grids<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.250> make<00:00:47.550> up

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
99 and we select the grids that make up

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.430 
99 and we select the grids that make up
the<00:00:47.940> pattern<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:49.579> go<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.640> edit<00:00:51.270> copy<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.170> what

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the pattern and go to edit copy and what

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.069 
the pattern and go to edit copy and what
they<00:00:52.590> will<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.100> copy<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.780> image<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
they will do is copy and image that

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.889 
they will do is copy and image that
pattern<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> clipboard<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.719> they<00:00:57.719> will

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
pattern to the clipboard and they will

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.040 
pattern to the clipboard and they will
start<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.530> our<00:00:59.460> image<00:01:00.180> software<00:01:00.449> which<00:01:00.870> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
start to our image software which is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.929 
start to our image software which is
earth<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:03.409> we<00:01:04.409> go<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> edit<00:01:05.129> paste

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
earth in there and we go to edit paste

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
earth in there and we go to edit paste
and<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> pasted<00:01:07.229> save<00:01:07.530> image

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
and you can see it pasted save image

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.390 
and you can see it pasted save image
into<00:01:08.670> Earth<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.090> view<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.890> simply<00:01:11.100> need

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
into Earth and view and we simply need

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.460 
into Earth and view and we simply need
to<00:01:11.430> resize<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.540> image<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:15.049> make<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.259> width

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
to resize the image and make the width

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.310 
to resize the image and make the width
of<00:01:16.619> multiple<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.220> 99<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.150> I'll<00:01:18.270> make<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.600> 990<00:01:21.320> we

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
of multiple of 99 so I'll make it 990 we

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.570 
of multiple of 99 so I'll make it 990 we
can<00:01:22.470> go<00:01:22.619> ahead<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.009> save<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:24.619> image<00:01:25.619> now<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
can go ahead and save this image now and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.740 
can go ahead and save this image now and
we'll<00:01:26.880> call<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.330> Pass<00:01:27.810> Excel<00:01:32.329> okay<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.570> can

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
we'll call it Pass Excel okay we can

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.480 
we'll call it Pass Excel okay we can
close

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.149 

Excel<00:01:39.490> now<00:01:40.299> we<00:01:40.360> can<00:01:40.659> go<00:01:41.409> straight<00:01:41.680> ahead<00:01:41.890> and

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
Excel now we can go straight ahead and

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.800 
Excel now we can go straight ahead and
set<00:01:42.490> up<00:01:42.610> our<00:01:42.990> grid<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.439> correct<00:01:44.770> size

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
set up our grid to the correct size

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.230 
set up our grid to the correct size
which<00:01:46.810> is<00:01:48.690> 99<00:01:49.690> or<00:01:49.900> 77<00:01:50.740> so<00:01:51.100> we'll<00:01:51.250> give<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.460> 77

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
which is 99 or 77 so we'll give it 77

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.530 
which is 99 or 77 so we'll give it 77
rows<00:01:52.479> take<00:01:53.049> off<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.380> aspect<00:01:53.770> ratio<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.580> then

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
rows take off the aspect ratio and then

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.789 
rows take off the aspect ratio and then
continue<00:01:56.110> out<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.670> 99<00:01:57.670> columns

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
continue out to 99 columns

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.170 
continue out to 99 columns
now<00:01:59.799> this<00:02:00.009> point<00:02:00.220> we<00:02:00.369> need<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.640> check<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.149> make

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
now this point we need to check to make

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.300 
now this point we need to check to make
sure<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:01.630> our<00:02:01.840> stretch<00:02:02.320> factor<00:02:02.680> is<00:02:03.670> set<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.180> 1

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
sure that our stretch factor is set to 1

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.479 
sure that our stretch factor is set to 1
because<00:02:06.840> Excel<00:02:07.840> sheets<00:02:08.380> are<00:02:08.800> 1<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.250> 1<00:02:09.399> ratio

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
because Excel sheets are 1 to 1 ratio

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.170 
because Excel sheets are 1 to 1 ratio
and<00:02:12.489> now<00:02:12.880> we<00:02:12.940> can<00:02:13.209> go<00:02:13.390> ahead<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:14.010> import<00:02:15.180> our

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and now we can go ahead and import our

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.949 
and now we can go ahead and import our
image<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.519> see<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.209> come

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
image and you can see that it's come

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.040 
image and you can see that it's come
straight<00:02:20.350> in<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:22.110> lines<00:02:23.110> up<00:02:23.440> perfectly<00:02:24.160> with

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
straight in and lines up perfectly with

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.970 
straight in and lines up perfectly with
our<00:02:28.200> grids<00:02:29.200> in<00:02:30.000> picture<00:02:31.000> wave<00:02:31.470> very<00:02:32.470> very<00:02:32.739> easy

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
our grids in picture wave very very easy

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.660 
our grids in picture wave very very easy
to<00:02:33.340> get<00:02:33.459> a<00:02:34.530> such<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.560> square<00:02:35.980> grid<00:02:36.010> pattern<00:02:36.549> as

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
to get a such a square grid pattern as

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.150 
to get a such a square grid pattern as
an<00:02:36.790> excel<00:02:37.120> sheet<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:38.680> then<00:02:38.860> it's<00:02:39.010> just

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
an excel sheet in so then it's just

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.509 
an excel sheet in so then it's just
simply<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.519> matter<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:40.590> selecting<00:02:41.590> our<00:02:44.519> chosen

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
simply a matter of selecting our chosen

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:53.370 
simply a matter of selecting our chosen
colors<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.870> starting<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.959> paint<00:02:53.230> our

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
colors and starting to to paint our

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:05.530 
colors and starting to to paint our
image

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.500 

very<00:03:06.110> simple
