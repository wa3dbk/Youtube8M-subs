00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.830
 very good everyone had the gamer and a 1 to 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.870
 0 is a small guide and demonstration of 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.040
 tusk that is the explorer rifle 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.110
 that is achieved by making the incursion 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.580
 from the end of created so difficult I'm going to 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.870
 teach little by little the skills and 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.670
 then if I'm going to hit a couple of shots 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.830
 so you can see the skills in action 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.839
 and the aesthetic way of this weapon as 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.539
 you see it has damage from arcs the damage 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.800
 electric is how you know in the front 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.050
 previous explorer rifle that 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.880
 get in the glass camera was of 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.060
 sun damage and this one is arc so 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.679
 I guess the next dlc will be arc 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.029
 but we do not know anything about that we are here 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.219
 to talk about this so little to 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.890
 I'm a little here passing the sights 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.870
 advantage is good is not bad prepare 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.699
 depends on which cases mark targets that 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.769
 briefly briefly highlights the 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.210
 enemies accepted by this weapon makes 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.339
 that a small flash appears 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.079
 vertical on top of the enemy 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.579
 you are shooting at that moment if 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.079
 shoot at another enemy will appear in the 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.809
 another enemy so it's more basically 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.969
 to focus on an enemy in question 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.399
 and that the rest of the enemies or 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.530
 allies shoot him goes well if you are 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.420
 playing alone without anyone to 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.510
 random is with those who are given 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.180
 account of who you have to shoot 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.190
 Finally you already have an idea of ​​what 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.230
 you can do with that later we have 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.690
 large caliber ammunition that good does 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.370
 that I staggered in the whites and such 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.500
 This is one of the ones I like the most 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.990
 Perfect balance that gives you enough 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.700
 more stability to the weapon and it's going well now 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.460
 I have a field explorer because 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.310
 this weapon without the skill is that it gives 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.410
 more ammunition only has 15 bullets but no 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.240
 they do not go bad, that is, they do not need 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.920
 stability because also as you see 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.450
 has stability that makes the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.250
 recharge increases when the charger is 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.270
 empty so you can spend bullets and 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.770
 spend bone this advantage and this in 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.870
 not really I do not know why would gather 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.760
 because I had them together but I mean because 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.710
 having more ammo does not need either 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.720
 download fast but in order 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.729
 you will do what you want and then third 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.800
 eye that makes the radar stay 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.020
 active when aiming with this weapon at this 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.200
 advantage is another advantage that I know there's 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.670
 in others I do not know if in other weapons in 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.440
 other weapons I do not know if there are but in 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.660
 armor so I've seen at least in the 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.970
 hunter I think the helmet in fact I think that 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.170
 I have it here if in this case and good 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.000
 now let's hit a couple of shots 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.810
 let's mark whites will not bring I have 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.910
 equipped load 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.380
 the advantage that makes it recharge more 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.330
 Quick the charger when empty 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.950
 I also have it that way so that you go 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.420
 a little bit and also the skill is that 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.910
 makes the radar remain active 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.520
 when you pointed this way you see a bit how 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.650
 is the thing and as you see bone specs 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.480
 and it's amazing in fact I'm not sure 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.250
 but this weapon gives me the impression that 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.230
 when shooting at the head even though it does not 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.090
 point well at the head the shot 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.700
 go to your head look at this I'm going to 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.230
 point a little to the left by 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.260
 example now I am pointing well to 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.780
 head but now no longer but it gives in 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.230
 the head or you see that I am giving 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.120
 a little left to that still failed 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.590
 anyway I do not know I do not know if you see more or less 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.360
 what I mean what I mean but 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.519
 I think this weapon has a bit of 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.440
 accuracy as cheat aims 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.000
 directly in the end I do not know if you have 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.860
 seen the recharge I'm going to empty again 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.360
 the charger so you can see it truthfully 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.690
 I need to look for enemies but it's 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.910
 fuck they seem very few right now 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.440
 Finally, as you can see, it's a quick charge 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.360
 I told you that it is not really necessary 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.030
 it was another skill is to have more bullets 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.220
 because they take less than a second in 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.380
 load over there and now I'm going to put the 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.120
 ability to mark enemies so that 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.670
 see how it works 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.319
 that is, it is good, that is called 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.900
 now I'm going to directly give this 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.329
 best 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.030
 As you can see, there is a kind of brand that 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.739
 there you can see it vertically that at 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.260
 be tall for example what can you see 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.360
 through that over there but I do not know 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.730
 go through the walls and that's something 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.110
 that many people have asked when they have 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.000
 seen that he had this weapon with this 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.250
 skill and such but do not look behind 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.379
 of the walls simply the marks and 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.840
 aesthetically, it's not bad or 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.819
 is beautiful with the bones that the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.890
 chalk armor or whatever it takes 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.150
 in short guys I hope you like this
