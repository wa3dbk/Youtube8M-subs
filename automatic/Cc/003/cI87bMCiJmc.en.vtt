00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.740
 hi my name is leonid shvets 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.679
 I have these Russian record holder in the marathon 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.240
 running a participant in two Olympic Games for 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.220
 this time I had several injuries 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.350
 which made you think about 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.850
 end of sports career however 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.189
 after getting acquainted with the technique 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.789
 natural running I was able to resume 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.050
 workout is now the power of my age 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.560
 they are no longer professional 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.439
 character 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.350
 but I continue to keep active 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.510
 living and most importantly enjoying your 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.510
 running more with less 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.010
 power consumption 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.010
 the purpose of this technique is to increase efficiency 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.170
 running and reduce the risk of injury moving 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.480
 right we start to run faster and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.800
 putting less effort into 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.289
 The principle of natural running is very 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.149
 simple first principle is consciously 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.760
 using the elasticity of our body 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.219
 it is known that with effective running all 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.730
 energy is accumulated by the tendons and 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.160
 muscles 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.019
 for better understanding, imagine that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.460
 the base of your foot is spring 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.610
 which is unclamping 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.619
 returns energy which sting her this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.070
 natural mechanism reduces impact and 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.689
 optimizes muscle activity for this 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.340
 same principle runs an animal in the wild 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.720
 to nature 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.909
 let's look at the whole race cycle 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.610
 movement when the foot touches 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.590
 surface of the earth then abdominal femoral and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.259
 the gluteal muscles are activated for 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.180
 body stabilization 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.500
 It is important that this stage is carried out quickly and 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.420
 with tension back with direct 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.120
 everything works very resilient achilles 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.910
 tendon calf and thigh muscles 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.229
 if the hips start completely the knee 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.630
 while moving forward 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.550
 the faster the runner performs this action 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.500
 the more actively they use 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.479
 knees and the better the return will be 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.940
 as soon as your knees and move forward 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.440
 release his recoil will allow the foot 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.390
 just under the thigh 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.550
 need to hip maximum 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.030
 then divorced the muscle is activated and 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.350
 tightens the legs in the correct position 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.600
 The next moment is very important for technology. 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.850
 running if the foot moves after 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.310
 knee and fits under the center of gravity 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.530
 it saves a lot of energy and momentum in 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.180
 spring surrenders correct vector than 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.350
 more energy is directed down the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.970
 greater momentum will return 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.920
 body should be slightly tilted 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.260
 forward to keep correct 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.420
 the direction of the force vector to achieve 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.930
 proper tilt movement of the ankle 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.400
 of and hips should be very active in 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.100
 human level is natural 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.410
 frequency of contraction of muscles and tendons and he 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.810
 is about 180 steps per minute with 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.209
 such frequency for example children jump 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.220
 through the rope this rhythm provides 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.890
 elastic recoil and saves up to 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.330
 50 percent energy to understand 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.150
 try running on the spot 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.370
 but at a different pace the most important thing in running 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.130
 this is learn how to put a foot on 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.230
 the sopa surface should touch the ground in 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.570
 areas under the center of gravity she is not 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.519
 should go ahead to improve 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.959
 try to reduce this indicator 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.299
 total time of foot contact with 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.209
 the surface of the spring has only shrunk and 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.620
 hands should be born immediately help us 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.350
 keep your balance when running 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.310
 nails must be bent killed no more 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.290
 90 degrees 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.230
 they should move as if chopping 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.000
 firewood if you run down the frequency of movement 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.650
 the same increases only them 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.840
 amplitude and due to this steps 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.150
 getting longer foot still 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.920
 lands under the thigh with this case 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.380
 on voltage to maintain everything 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.010
 body if you run uphill step 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.810
 shortened again let's go over 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.540
 the basic principle of natural running 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.209
 back should be a straight body 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.980
 must be strong and stable hips 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.629
 must be diluted to the maximum 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.150
 possible distance to set 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.290
 correct vector gluteus muscles 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.840
 must be active 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.330
 momentum only comes back if 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.180
 ask him in our sedentary world these 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.410
 muscles mostly not working now 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.930
 let's look at typical errors 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.010
 allowed when running 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.989
 note that the foot 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.780
 lands noticeably ahead of the hip 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.610
 not enough and breeding thighs such 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.230
 the manner of running we call the harz its not and 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.120
 foot in front 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.550
 elasticity and recoil no energy 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.050
 much is spent in cases when 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.360
 running body tilted forward 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.410
 lost balance and body involuntarily 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.690
 bent at the waist 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.180
 which leads to loss of energy and loss 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.669
 body stability run with a deviation 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.830
 hull back is also ineffective since 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.789
 the angle of the divorce hips is minimal is lost 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.539
 balance and energy skills development needed 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.060
 in any business 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.580
 and running is no exception good exercise 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.960
 to activate the gluteus muscles producing 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.890
 rhythms and foot settings 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.300
 running on the spot or on a small trampoline 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.039
 A good addition to this exercise 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.090
 is fixing the body using 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:49.039
 special sling or rubber harness 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.220
 barefoot running is the best way to feel 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.110
 the essence of natural running 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.880
 when you run without shoes then 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.020
 will instinctively land on 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.140
 forefoot 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.510
 as intended by nature it will work out 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.000
 you have the right movement stereotype 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.160
 but include it in your arsenal is necessary 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.870
 with great care since without 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.990
 preparation there is a possibility 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.520
 injury and 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.040
 scooter is very good for honing 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.980
 techniques of foot setting and training 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.630
 breeding trouble with this foot indulges 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.120
 correct landing vector and 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.960
 repulsion as necessary when 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.210
 natural running 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.130
 as well as practiced the movement of the thigh 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.170
 back try to do it 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.590
 push off the heel it's just 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.660
 impossible jumping rope simple 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.760
 developmental exercise springy 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.150
 properties of the foot and strengthen the calf 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.940
 the muscles 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.940
 you can perform it anytime in 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.710
 anyway rope jumper is excellent 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.410
 exercise to develop balance and 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.240
 sense of rhythm she lets you learn not 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:53.530
 splash shin and let and shoot 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.960
 leg with legs lean forward ask 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.380
 yourself direction vector and start 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.380
 motion
