00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.990 

I<00:01:04.800> said<00:01:05.800> biggest<00:01:06.100> similarity<00:01:06.550> with<00:01:06.670> sailing

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
I said biggest similarity with sailing

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.580 
I said biggest similarity with sailing
is<00:01:07.120> that<00:01:07.300> when<00:01:07.420> you<00:01:07.510> going<00:01:08.080> very<00:01:08.320> very<00:01:08.410> fast

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
is that when you going very very fast

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.230 
is that when you going very very fast
and<00:01:09.160> because<00:01:09.400> you've<00:01:09.520> got<00:01:09.610> someone's<00:01:09.880> helmet

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
and because you've got someone's helmet

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.430 
and because you've got someone's helmet
in<00:01:10.300> front<00:01:10.510> of<00:01:10.600> you<00:01:10.750> can't<00:01:10.990> actually<00:01:11.140> see

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
in front of you can't actually see

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.260 
in front of you can't actually see
what's<00:01:11.590> coming<00:01:11.770> so<00:01:12.190> it's<00:01:12.400> like<00:01:12.820> sailing<00:01:13.180> at

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
what's coming so it's like sailing at

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.670 
what's coming so it's like sailing at
night<00:01:13.450> you're<00:01:13.810> going<00:01:13.960> down<00:01:14.020> a<00:01:14.140> wave<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.410> don't

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680
