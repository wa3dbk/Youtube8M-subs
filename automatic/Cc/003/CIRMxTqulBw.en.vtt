Richmond<00:02:01.110> than<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.479> if<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.689> wait<00:02:03.990> 10

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
Richmond than that so if you wait 10

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.800 
Richmond than that so if you wait 10
hours<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.070> then

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
hours and then

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.770 
hours and then
I<00:02:05.869> guess<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.770> know<00:02:06.860> what<00:02:06.979> that<00:02:07.310> would<00:02:07.460> make<00:02:07.610> it

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
I guess you know what that would make it

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.520 
I guess you know what that would make it

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
mitchrichman are much increased and I've

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.229

seen that play out I've seen up ten our
rotation<00:02:20.870> but<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.739> don't<00:02:22.040> think<00:02:22.250> that's

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
rotation but I don't think that's

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.339 
rotation but I don't think that's
exactly<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.030> case<00:02:23.209> so<00:02:23.660> when<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.019> see<00:02:24.170> people

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
exactly the case so when you see people

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.620 
exactly the case so when you see people
asking<00:02:24.980> what's<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.580> best<00:02:25.760> time<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.209> get<00:02:26.360> AI

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
actually a specific time because i don't

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.140 
actually a specific time because i don't
think<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:37.010> rotations<00:02:37.700> are<00:02:38.000> player<00:02:38.930> specific

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
think the rotations are player specific

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.880 
think the rotations are player specific
here's<00:02:41.150> my<00:02:41.390> thoughts<00:02:41.660> on<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.959> rotation<00:02:42.260> it

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
here's my thoughts on the rotation it

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.110 
here's my thoughts on the rotation it
definitely<00:02:43.310> is<00:02:43.430> real<00:02:43.700> but<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.480> rotation<00:02:45.110> is<00:02:45.290> I

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
definitely is real but the rotation is I

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.910 
definitely is real but the rotation is I
like<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.150> think<00:02:47.360> about<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.690> as<00:02:47.989> waves<00:02:48.650> on<00:02:48.890> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
like to think about it as waves on the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.600 
like to think about it as waves on the
ocean<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:50.360> have<00:02:50.510> waves<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.110> they<00:02:51.890> rise<00:02:52.190> and

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
ocean you have waves and they rise and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.880 
ocean you have waves and they rise and
they<00:02:52.760> fall<00:02:53.090> meaning<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.200> likelihood<00:02:54.860> that

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
they fall meaning the likelihood that

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.130 
they fall meaning the likelihood that
you're<00:02:55.160> going<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.370> get<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.519> gold<00:02:55.790> legend<00:02:56.180> rises

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
you're going to get a gold legend rises

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.550 
you're going to get a gold legend rises
and<00:02:57.319> falls<00:02:57.590> as<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.760> time<00:02:59.000> passes<00:02:59.560> sometimes

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
and falls as the time passes sometimes

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.320 
and falls as the time passes sometimes
you'll<00:03:00.830> have<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.980> big<00:03:01.220> wave<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.760> when<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.180> big

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
you'll have a big wave and when that big

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.440 
you'll have a big wave and when that big
wave<00:03:02.510> comes<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:03.400> associate<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.519> with<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:05.150> lot

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
wave comes I associate that with a lot

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.660 
wave comes I associate that with a lot
of<00:03:05.480> gold<00:03:05.840> legends<00:03:06.230> becoming<00:03:06.830> available<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:07.400> lot

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
of gold legends becoming available a lot

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.039 
of gold legends becoming available a lot
of<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.910> higher<00:03:08.150> rated<00:03:08.510> gold<00:03:08.720> legends

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
of the higher rated gold legends

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.840 
of the higher rated gold legends
becoming<00:03:09.440> available<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:10.010> sometimes<00:03:10.760> you

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
becoming available and sometimes you

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.060 
becoming available and sometimes you
have<00:03:11.000> small<00:03:11.329> waves<00:03:11.570> in<00:03:12.230> those<00:03:12.380> small<00:03:12.530> waves<00:03:12.859> or

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
have small waves in those small waves or

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.949 
have small waves in those small waves or
when<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.400> get<00:03:13.609> you<00:03:14.420> know<00:03:14.540> you're<00:03:14.690> Rudy

larusso's and the golden troll James
Worthy<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.519> need<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:20.000> understand<00:03:21.340> the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
Worthy so you need to understand the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.949 
Worthy so you need to understand the
frame<00:03:22.609> of<00:03:22.790> mind<00:03:22.940> associated<00:03:23.720> with<00:03:23.840> the

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
frame of mind associated with the

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.440 
frame of mind associated with the
rotations<00:03:24.530> as<00:03:25.090> 2k<00:03:26.090> presents<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.400> so

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
rotations as 2k presents it to you so

experienced it like I have you don't
want<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.530> repeat<00:04:00.680> that<00:04:00.950> experience<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.700> want

want to repeat that experience you want
to<00:04:01.940> go<00:04:02.060> out<00:04:02.209> and<00:04:02.389> get<00:04:02.569> you<00:04:03.470> know<00:04:03.590> on<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.709> roll<00:04:04.060> so

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
to go out and get you know on a roll so

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.699 
to go out and get you know on a roll so
if<00:04:05.209> you're<00:04:05.359> following<00:04:05.540> me<00:04:05.900> you'll<00:04:06.079> know<00:04:06.319> now

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
if you're following me you'll know now

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.129 
if you're following me you'll know now
that<00:04:06.739> I<00:04:07.250> believe<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.850> there's<00:04:08.060> better<00:04:08.720> times

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
that I believe that there's better times

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.650 
that I believe that there's better times
to<00:04:09.410> buy<00:04:09.590> packs<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.340> get<00:04:10.430> gold<00:04:10.639> legends<00:04:11.060> but<00:04:11.600> I

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
to buy packs and get gold legends but I

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.619 
to buy packs and get gold legends but I
also<00:04:11.840> believe<00:04:12.049> there's<00:04:12.470> a<00:04:12.530> second<00:04:13.180> layer<00:04:14.180> to

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
also believe there's a second layer to

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.849 
also believe there's a second layer to
the<00:04:15.349> issue<00:04:15.530> of<00:04:15.769> when<00:04:16.310> these<00:04:16.459> rotations<00:04:16.940> work

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
the issue of when these rotations work

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.850 
the issue of when these rotations work
and<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.549> think<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:19.500> based<00:04:20.500> on<00:04:20.919> days<00:04:21.699> or<00:04:22.180> weeks

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
and I think that based on days or weeks

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.939 
and I think that based on days or weeks
I<00:04:23.860> don't<00:04:24.669> really<00:04:24.849> think<00:04:24.969> it's<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.300> set

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
I don't really think it's a set

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.649 
I don't really think it's a set
measurement<00:04:26.949> of<00:04:27.069> time<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:27.610> we<00:04:28.090> use<00:04:28.389> that<00:04:28.629> I

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
measurement of time that we use that I

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.300 
measurement of time that we use that I
think<00:04:29.050> there<00:04:29.169> may<00:04:29.349> be<00:04:29.379> like<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.680> six<00:04:30.039> day

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
think there may be like a six day

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.480 
think there may be like a six day
rotation<00:04:31.270> or<00:04:31.509> something<00:04:31.780> like<00:04:31.900> that<00:04:32.490> those

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
rotation or something like that those

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.420 
rotation or something like that those
different<00:04:34.080> time<00:04:35.080> periods<00:04:35.530> allow<00:04:35.889> you<00:04:35.949> to<00:04:36.250> get

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
different time periods allow you to get

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.640 
different time periods allow you to get
different<00:04:37.030> types<00:04:37.449> of<00:04:37.569> gold<00:04:37.750> legends<00:04:38.139> and<00:04:38.379> if

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
different types of gold legends and if

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.589 
different types of gold legends and if
you<00:04:38.740> go<00:04:38.860> on<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.069> forums<00:04:39.460> you'll<00:04:39.639> witnesses

that's<00:05:59.620> a<00:05:59.800> time<00:06:00.279> where<00:06:00.639> you<00:06:00.819> want<00:06:01.000> to<00:06:01.060> go

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
that's a time where you want to go

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.589 
that's a time where you want to go
beyond<00:06:01.689> spending<00:06:02.680> just<00:06:02.710> 4.5<00:06:03.430> DC<00:06:03.909> if<00:06:04.330> you've

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
beyond spending just 4.5 DC if you've

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.309 
beyond spending just 4.5 DC if you've
got<00:06:04.629> more<00:06:05.469> I<00:06:05.860> would<00:06:06.669> you<00:06:07.479> know<00:06:07.509> I<00:06:07.629> would<00:06:07.839> blow

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 
got more I would you know I would blow

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.170 
got more I would you know I would blow
it<00:06:08.439> all<00:06:08.589> right<00:06:08.979> at<00:06:09.099> that<00:06:09.250> point<00:06:09.610> because<00:06:09.819> I

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
it all right at that point because I

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.610 
it all right at that point because I
know<00:06:10.240> that<00:06:10.509> there's<00:06:10.689> players<00:06:11.020> in<00:06:11.199> a<00:06:11.259> rotation

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
know that there's players in a rotation

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.339 
know that there's players in a rotation
and<00:06:11.979> those<00:06:12.669> players<00:06:13.000> tend<00:06:13.539> to<00:06:13.629> be<00:06:13.750> centers<00:06:14.139> a

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
and those players tend to be centers a

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:17.369 
and those players tend to be centers a
lot<00:06:14.979> of<00:06:15.069> times<00:06:15.250> you<00:06:15.370> go<00:06:15.520> and<00:06:15.759> buy<00:06:15.990> packs<00:06:16.990> and

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
lot of times you go and buy packs and

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.589 
lot of times you go and buy packs and
you'll<00:06:17.680> see<00:06:17.889> that<00:06:18.099> every<00:06:18.789> player<00:06:18.939> you<00:06:19.210> get<00:06:19.419> is

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
you'll see that every player you get is

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:20.909 
you'll see that every player you get is
a<00:06:19.629> shooting<00:06:19.990> guard<00:06:20.139> or<00:06:20.319> every<00:06:20.500> player<00:06:20.710> you<00:06:20.830> get

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
a shooting guard or every player you get

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:22.589 
a shooting guard or every player you get
is<00:06:21.039> the<00:06:21.069> center<00:06:21.430> now<00:06:21.789> this<00:06:21.909> is<00:06:22.060> not<00:06:22.240> a<00:06:22.270> hard<00:06:22.569> and

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
is the center now this is not a hard and

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.050 
is the center now this is not a hard and
fast<00:06:22.719> rule<00:06:23.020> there<00:06:23.979> are<00:06:24.129> fluctuations<00:06:24.430> you'll

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
fast rule there are fluctuations you'll

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.719 
fast rule there are fluctuations you'll
see<00:06:25.300> that<00:06:25.810> a<00:06:26.199> lot<00:06:26.709> of<00:06:26.919> times<00:06:27.190> you'll<00:06:27.370> get<00:06:27.520> a

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
see that a lot of times you'll get a

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.370 
see that a lot of times you'll get a
player<00:06:28.149> of<00:06:28.300> one<00:06:28.539> position<00:06:28.930> and<00:06:29.110> another

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
player of one position and another

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.410 
player of one position and another
player<00:06:29.620> of<00:06:29.740> a<00:06:29.800> totally<00:06:30.069> different<00:06:30.339> position

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
player of a totally different position

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.870 
player of a totally different position
but<00:06:31.510> in<00:06:31.780> general<00:06:32.200> I<00:06:32.950> have<00:06:33.220> noticed<00:06:33.580> that

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
but in general I have noticed that

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.970 
but in general I have noticed that
there's<00:06:34.210> a<00:06:34.270> greater<00:06:34.690> tendency<00:06:34.960> for<00:06:35.590> people<00:06:35.620> to

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
there's a greater tendency for people to

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.430 
there's a greater tendency for people to
get<00:06:36.130> gold<00:06:36.700> legends<00:06:37.120> of<00:06:37.390> the<00:06:37.540> same<00:06:37.780> position<00:06:38.260> at

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
get gold legends of the same position at

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.260 
get gold legends of the same position at
the<00:06:38.590> same<00:06:38.800> time<00:06:39.070> one<00:06:39.640> of<00:06:39.700> the<00:06:39.760> hardest<00:06:40.060> things

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
the same time one of the hardest things

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.780 
the same time one of the hardest things
to<00:06:40.390> realize<00:06:41.320> is<00:06:41.560> that<00:06:41.710> this<00:06:42.010> method<00:06:42.370> also

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
to realize is that this method also

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.730 
to realize is that this method also
requires<00:06:43.330> some<00:06:43.600> discipline<00:06:44.110> because<00:06:44.440> if<00:06:44.620> you

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
requires some discipline because if you

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.650 
requires some discipline because if you
go<00:06:44.770> out<00:06:45.130> there<00:06:45.160> are<00:06:45.640> you<00:06:45.940> read<00:06:46.360> about<00:06:46.390> other

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
go out there are you read about other

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.180 
go out there are you read about other
people<00:06:46.960> getting<00:06:47.260> gold<00:06:47.710> legend<00:06:48.040> power

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
people getting gold legend power

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.710 
people getting gold legend power
forwards<00:06:48.670> and<00:06:48.820> you're<00:06:48.940> satisfied<00:06:49.180> because

you've got great gold legend pal affords
you're<00:06:52.390> not<00:06:52.510> looking<00:06:52.720> for<00:06:52.840> anyone<00:06:52.990> else<00:06:53.230> you

just need to hold off you shouldn't be

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.540 
just need to hold off you shouldn't be
buying<00:06:54.910> packs<00:06:55.210> at<00:06:55.450> that<00:06:55.570> time<00:06:55.810> and<00:06:56.020> then<00:06:56.950> when

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
buying packs at that time and then when

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.760 
buying packs at that time and then when

available you hear about people getting

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.880 
available you hear about people getting
Bill<00:07:01.240> Russell<00:07:01.450> or<00:07:01.720> Dave<00:07:01.900> Robson<00:07:02.170> it's<00:07:02.590> time<00:07:02.770> to

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890 
Bill Russell or Dave Robson it's time to

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.280 
Bill Russell or Dave Robson it's time to
go<00:07:03.010> all<00:07:03.250> in<00:07:03.460> with<00:07:03.490> your<00:07:03.730> BC<00:07:04.120> so<00:07:04.900> that's<00:07:05.050> my

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.290 
go all in with your BC so that's my

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.030 
go all in with your BC so that's my
theory<00:07:05.710> on<00:07:06.070> the<00:07:07.030> rotation<00:07:07.930> what<00:07:08.710> I<00:07:08.740> like<00:07:08.920> to

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.040 
theory on the rotation what I like to

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.880 
theory on the rotation what I like to
call<00:07:09.070> the<00:07:09.640> waves<00:07:09.880> that<00:07:10.180> happen<00:07:10.570> next<00:07:11.320> video

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:11.890 
call the waves that happen next video

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.820 
call the waves that happen next video
I'm<00:07:12.160> going<00:07:12.340> to<00:07:12.400> talk<00:07:12.460> to<00:07:12.640> you<00:07:12.910> about<00:07:13.420> the<00:07:14.410> times

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830 
I'm going to talk to you about the times

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.830 
I'm going to talk to you about the times
that<00:07:15.220> I've<00:07:15.700> noticed<00:07:15.970> that<00:07:16.390> the<00:07:16.570> waves

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 
that I've noticed that the waves

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.530 
that I've noticed that the waves
typically<00:07:17.590> are<00:07:17.830> at<00:07:18.730> their<00:07:18.910> highest<00:07:18.940> point

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:19.540 
typically are at their highest point

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.910 
typically are at their highest point
which<00:07:19.990> i<00:07:20.170> think<00:07:20.230> is<00:07:20.470> very<00:07:20.560> valuable

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:20.920 
which i think is very valuable

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.400 
which i think is very valuable
information
