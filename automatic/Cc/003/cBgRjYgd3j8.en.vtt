00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hello everyone, today I would like to 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.610
 talk about updating android 4 4 2 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.160
 for samsung galaxy s4 gt and 9500 this 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.719
 exynos octa 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.420
 the first big change is that immediately 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.020
 striking when we turn on the screen 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.949
 blocking 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:27.090
 we will see a camera icon when done 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:28.680
 In with in 7 it is taken out on loxgrin to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.930
 unlock it you need to pull the bottom 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.000
 world as for camera camera too 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.620
 runs much faster but more about that 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.770
 we'll talk later one more 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.440
 a small feature that was added in the new 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.800
 firmware is when you listen for example 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.870
 some music for example vkontakte yes 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.870
 how do i do it here and here 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.260
 what more striking since 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.530
 yes sawn effect of the sun when 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:43.440
 Unlocking he became a little drank 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.440
 did much better than it did 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.399
 unlocked machine and see on 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.159
 the main work screen in the status bar 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.570
 finally made white icons 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.759
 instead of the usual us tear out eye 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.350
 green in my opinion is not bad 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.039
 This decision looks like something much 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.550
 better more interesting than it was 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.370
 don't pull out your eyes 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.940
 not as it catches the eye in general not 

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:15.920
 I know more like the following 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.390
 change concern keyboard 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.970
 let's go google and we see 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.090
 she also became a little keyboard 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.100
 redesigned it became really more convenient 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.950
 get and fingers now on everything 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:37.670
 small letters 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:42.720
 English has also become more convenient 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:47.730
 landscape mode version is like this 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.040
 that's the way we will be next 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.680
 changes and i will demonstrate that 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.690
 really android 4 4 2 turn into 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.330
 settings 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.240
 with regard to setting well, why should they 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:06.500
 remained the same all the same as 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:11.280
 It was basically everything remained as it was in 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.489
 device and we see the version of android 4 4 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.489
 2 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:22.640
 castrated kitkat cool letter 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.990
 and here it is android 4 4 2 a 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.410
 mini game such next change 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:50.230
 probably wanted to show about 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.480
 ram night we shall not cleanse everything 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.560
 will need RAM too 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.769
 became available and more 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.640
 Now for some reason it shows 19 15 but 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:10.599
 that's the average of my use of me 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:14.950
 free about 1 gigabyte 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:18.609
 downloaded 1 gigabyte 15 i.e. approximately 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:22.150
 about 700 megabytes free of it 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.590
 enough for a good device 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.600
 so that it does not slow down 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.169
 touchwiz has finally become real 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.300
 fast it does not lag everything works 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:41.250
 as smoothly as it should be 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:43.800
 work let's go to the camera 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.410
 the camera has not undergone on some 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.750
 changes she stayed the same 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:54.400
 except he focuses 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.490
 faster now and what's the cool thing 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.030
 they did let's bring and 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:04.800
 the coolest thing they did is 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.800
 The status bar will not be visible now 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.560
 status bar now we have 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.210
 transparent that is in some 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.340
 applications for example when you watch 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.240
 there youtube watch some video 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.370
 example in the player and decided 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.789
 look friend time you pull out 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:28.320
 the curtain and it is transparent so small 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.320
 change but it's cool 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.400
 samsung is getting rid of 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:40.950
 already annoying black stripes have long been 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.820
 not interesting to anyone generally speaking 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.370
 firmware began to work much 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.210
 more stable while using it 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.400
 from February 14 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.130
 now March 3 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.259
 these days the firmware has never lagged 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.780
 never there were no flights 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:03.490
 no phone reboots arbitrary 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:07.229
 also was not and yes yes yes samsung all the same 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:13.330
 yes whitewash its firmware made it more 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:18.100
 quality pro preinstalled 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.990
 application say well what's up with android 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.500
 4 3 principle nothing has changed everything 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.350
 as it was, but remained but Knox and 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.760
 stayed about him separately talk in 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.460
 another video 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.889
 what else I wanted to show probably this 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.100
 let's go through the synthetic 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:40.530
 test antutu benchmark show his scores 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:45.310
 which dialed the device we see 28,000 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:46.900
 378 parrots a good result for 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.000
 compared to previous firmware 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:54.490
 the device scored a decent amount 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.810
 points out of the application due to 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.510
 battery saving 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:02.199
 well here with my use and 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.690
 the device lives about two days it 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:09.360
 surfing the internet before passed 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.360
 listening to music and watching youtube 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.650
 battery 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.560
 Here we see that the device is a robot 10 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.300
 o'clock 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.590
 which is basically not bad given that 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:25.659
 82 percent of the charge remains 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:33.039
 very well probably you can live and 

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:35.020
 longer internal vkontakte media server 

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:37.320
 some of course vest 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:40.840
 screen it is clear this is super amolid us 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:44.080
 all already known but something already somehow 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.810
 too long review everyone thanks for 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.090
 view this video subscribe to 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:53.410
 channel soon 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:55.990
 I will lay out the review of comparison of a firmware with 3 4 3 

00:07:53.410 --> 00:08:01.650
 and 4 4 2 of 4 

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:04.510
 and also as promised lay out review Knox 

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:07.660
 let's see why it is needed and whether 

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:11.910
 he is all thanks to everyone for watching 

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.910
 one more time bye
