00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.580
 from bioluminescent waves to 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.700
 swirls of fire these are the 15 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.790
 natural phenomena of the world more 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.190
 awesome number 15 lightning the 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.259
 Catatumbo occur in the basin 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.090
 lake of maracaibo in venezuela 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.980
 this phenomenon is characterized by the 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.900
 appearance of a series of lightning 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.240
 almost continuously and practically 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.859
 silent because of the great distances that 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.949
 you need to observe the phenomenon 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.019
 they are electric shocks between 2 and 10 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.910
 kilometers in height the origin of this 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.590
 phenomenon is in the graphic gold effect 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.969
 of these mountain ranges that enclose and 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.620
 slow down to the northeasterly winds 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.750
 producing vertical clouds 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.190
 concentrated mainly in the basin 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.180
 of the catatumbo river number 14 cloud 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.000
 lenticular a cloud in the form of 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.890
 saucer or convergent lens these 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.199
 clouds are stationary and are formed to 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.789
 high altitudes in mountainous areas and 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.920
 isolated from other clouds 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.590
 belong in the cumulus cycle forms 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.390
 high cumulus stratocumulus pilots 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.579
 of aerolines avoid them due to the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.420
 turbulence create the rotor systems 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.770
 number 3 rainbow of fire is a 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.750
 atmospheric phenomenon 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.880
 in the form of something similar to a rainbow 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.859
 but it differs in that it is shorter 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.140
 thicker and is not caused by the 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:19.119
 refraction of light in drops of water but 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.520
 through ice crystals in clouds 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.679
 and rush occurs only when the sun is 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.429
 at least 58 degrees on the 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:29.619
 horizon number 12 penitents or snow 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:33.009
 penitents written for the first time by 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.810
 Charles Darwin in 1839 are in 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.610
 the mountains of the Andes have the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.619
 form of thin and tall blades of 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.780
 snow or hardened ice with direction 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.189
 towards the sun well from 2 to 4 meters from 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.380
 height and according to the French glaciologist 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.329
 louis lee but true 'the condition 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.770
 climatic key to the ablation that 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.140
 leads to the formation of these 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.119
 penitentes is that the dew point is 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.849
 always below zero what 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.750
 causes the snow sublime number 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:02:00.610
 11 swirl of fire or tornado of fire 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.770
 it's a rare phenomenon in which fire 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.289
 acquires a vertical vortex and a 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.450
 swirl shape or a column of air 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.759
 similar a tornado have to emerge to 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.340
 starting from wildfires well of 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.200
 10 to 50 meters high and last only about 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.190
 minutes however some may have 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.500
 more than one kilo 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.110
 high and contain winds higher than 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.640
 the 160 kilometers per hour these 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.040
 swirls of fire can reach 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.550
 destroy trees up to 15 meters 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.040
 high number 10 the icicles of 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.200
 brine are hollow tubes of ice that 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.450
 arise under the frozen seas 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.550
 when an extremely cold current 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.920
 of saline water an area of 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.660
 Oceanic water is a deadly phenomenon 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.850
 It destroys everything that is in 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.220
 contact with the acquaintance only from 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.500
 the 60's a bbc team 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.450
 filmed this phenomenon for the first time in 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.470
 the story in 2011 under the ice 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.540
 of the Antarctic number 9 rolls of snow 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.700
 it's a strange phenomenon that is formed by 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.980
 snowballs being dragged by the 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.930
 surface by the action of the wind to 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.760
 difference of the snowballs made 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.070
 for the people the snow rolls have 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.780
 cylindrical shape and often present a 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.850
 hollow in the inner layers that are 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.470
 the first to form these layers 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.760
 interiors are thinner and weaker 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.620
 that the outer layers so 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.480
 they can easily disappear by the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.970
 wind action giving an aspect of 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.300
 Donald is known in rolls of up to 70 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.080
 centimeters in diameter 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.120
 8 for the self or the self is a phenomenon 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.400
 optical associated with reflection or 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.440
 refraction of light product a great 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.990
 amount of ice particles in the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.000
 clouds and ruth very much like the halos of 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.160
 fact can and usually happen at the same 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.470
 time they manifest around 22 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.390
 degrees to the left or to the right of 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.990
 sun like bright spots and up 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.150
 colorful in the sky number 7 goats of 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.890
 climbers of morocco goat in the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.720
 You can only find trees in 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.460
 morocco but it is not any tree the 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.190
 that attracts these creatures only the tree 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.750
 Argan is able to resist as much as 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.820
 of attracting their branches these big 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.830
 quadrupeds the argan tree has a 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.360
 irresistible fruit for the goats that 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.860
 consists of a nut that the goats are 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.290
 unable to digest which 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.970
 blame up or excrete these 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.130
 nuts are taken by people to 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.400
 produce argan which is an oil sold 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.620
 worldwide for cosmetic purposes number 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.239
 6 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.040
 eucalyptus de glup is the only 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.989
 eucalyptus species that is in 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.420
 natural form in the northern hemisphere 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.010
 It has a bark of different colors 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.590
 which is the most distinctive feature 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.660
 of the tree patches from the outside of the 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.280
 bark dry annually in different 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.620
 moments what a bark shows 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.390
 inside this bright green 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.700
 then it darkens and matures to stay 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.030
 blue purple orange and so on these 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.780
 trees and measure up to 75 meters high 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.150
 Number 5 sandstorm or dust area 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.980
 It is a common meteorological phenomenon 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.960
 Sahara desert in the great 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.030
 plains of North America in arabia and 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.590
 even in Argentina the storms of 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.930
 villages can often be observed in 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.100
 photographs taken from satellites 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.140
 When the dust in suspension is 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.730
 dragged by strong currents of 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.530
 air to other places and it rains 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.330
 says that it rains mud because everything 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.540
 full of mud droplets that dry and 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.030
 It ends up messing up the whole number 4 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.820
 blue hole is an underwater cave 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.350
 also called vertical cave his name 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.270
 it is due to the marked contrast between the 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.890
 dark blue of deep water and the 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.639
 lighter shade of deep water 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.650
 around 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.629
 poor water circulation 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.460
 waters are commonly anoxic without 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.530
 oxygen from a certain depth 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.779
 this generates an unfavorable environment for 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.639
 most of the seaway without 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:34.349
 However, it may be inhabited by 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.120
 variety of bacteria the blue hole 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.819
 deeper in the world is the hole 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.069
 blue tim a depth of 202 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.830
 meter number 3 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:46.409
 fox fire is a term used to 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.389
 refer to the bioluminescence created 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.310
 for some species of fungi of the 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.289
 decaying wood the 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.870
 luminescence is observed in members of the 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.849
 genus armillaria the honey fungus 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.050
 although there are reports that are presented 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.389
 in other species having 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.659
 identified about 40 different species 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:06.449
 who manifest this phenomenon number 2 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.279
 the buzz is a phenomenon or a 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.229
 phenomena collection that involves a 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:12.509
 series of reports or bruce a video 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.520
 persistent low frequency no 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.349
 audible to all people 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.669
 buzzing has been widely reported 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:19.979
 by the media 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.509
 nationals of britain and usa up 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.460
 today do not know why 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.379
 produces and it has been reported that the 2 by 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.240
 percent of the population can hear it if 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:31.229
 you search the internet you can find 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.940
 Number 1 hum or lip luminescent 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.919
 this brightness is a reaction of a 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.630
 species of micro plankton that emits a 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.729
 flash is about a reaction 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.380
 similar to fireflies although in 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.300
 this case occurs when these 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.639
 microorganisms are moved by the sea and 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.199
 comes in contact with oxygen this what 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.720
 we can find in batu beach 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.819
 this has been all for today if you liked the 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.710
 video, I like to subscribe and 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:54.710
