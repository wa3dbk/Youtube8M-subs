00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
three of my favourite balanced training

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.550 
three of my favourite balanced training
exercises<00:01:07.850> balance<00:01:08.299> training<00:01:08.899> is<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:09.229> simple

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
exercises balance training is so simple

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.190 
exercises balance training is so simple
and<00:01:10.369> I<00:01:10.670> want<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.119> do<00:01:11.240> it<00:01:11.360> in<00:01:11.479> bare<00:01:11.689> feet<00:01:11.720> to

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
and I want you to do it in bare feet to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.200 
and I want you to do it in bare feet to
start<00:01:12.740> with<00:01:12.890> because<00:01:13.130> I<00:01:13.520> don't<00:01:13.880> want<00:01:14.000> your

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
start with because I don't want your

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.499 
start with because I don't want your
shoes<00:01:14.799> giving<00:01:15.799> you<00:01:15.890> some<00:01:16.100> support<00:01:16.939> or<00:01:17.270> giving

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
shoes giving you some support or giving

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.539 
shoes giving you some support or giving
you<00:01:17.570> feedback<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:18.619> isn't<00:01:18.950> typically<00:01:19.280> there

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
you feedback that isn't typically there

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.010 
you feedback that isn't typically there
so<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:19.789> really<00:01:20.030> want<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.270> just<00:01:20.359> train<00:01:20.810> that

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
so we really want to just train that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.379 
so we really want to just train that
balance<00:01:21.499> system<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:22.069> a<00:01:22.460> lot<00:01:22.609> of<00:01:22.639> balance<00:01:22.939> is

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:23.389 
balance system and a lot of balance is

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:25.629 
balance system and a lot of balance is
getting<00:01:24.049> feedback<00:01:24.319> from<00:01:24.889> your<00:01:25.340> joint

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639 
getting feedback from your joint

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:27.700 
getting feedback from your joint
position<00:01:26.119> sensors<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:27.020> your<00:01:27.109> muscle<00:01:27.499> tension

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
position sensors and your muscle tension

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.919 
position sensors and your muscle tension
sensors<00:01:28.429> and<00:01:28.670> then<00:01:29.179> that<00:01:29.450> going<00:01:29.719> to<00:01:29.810> your

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
sensors and then that going to your

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:31.239 
sensors and then that going to your
brain<00:01:30.079> and<00:01:30.139> your<00:01:30.469> brain<00:01:30.619> learning<00:01:30.979> to

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:31.249 
brain and your brain learning to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:33.669 
brain and your brain learning to
interpret<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:31.969> so<00:01:32.420> we're<00:01:32.689> gonna<00:01:32.780> start<00:01:33.170> just

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
interpret it so we're gonna start just

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.489 
interpret it so we're gonna start just
with<00:01:33.740> single<00:01:34.159> leg<00:01:34.280> balance<00:01:34.600> for<00:01:35.600> 60<00:01:35.990> seconds

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:36.499 
with single leg balance for 60 seconds

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:38.020 
with single leg balance for 60 seconds
on<00:01:36.590> each<00:01:36.619> leg<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:37.280> should<00:01:37.459> be<00:01:37.670> able<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.880> do

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
on each leg and you should be able to do

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.569 
on each leg and you should be able to do
that<00:01:38.240> without<00:01:38.719> having<00:01:38.929> to<00:01:39.350> touch<00:01:40.130> your<00:01:40.429> other

training is to take away some of your
visual<00:02:05.749> input<00:02:06.319> so<00:02:06.799> for<00:02:07.579> example<00:02:07.969> if<00:02:08.090> I'm

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
visual input so for example if I'm

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.120 
visual input so for example if I'm
balancing<00:02:08.810> on<00:02:08.929> one<00:02:08.959> leg<00:02:09.080> with<00:02:09.440> my<00:02:09.560> eyes<00:02:09.679> open

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
balancing on one leg with my eyes open

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.730 
balancing on one leg with my eyes open
and<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.090> room<00:02:11.300> tilt<00:02:11.690> this<00:02:11.930> way<00:02:11.990> well<00:02:12.709> I

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
and I see the room tilt this way well I

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.400 
and I see the room tilt this way well I
know<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.040> I'm<00:02:13.690> moving<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.230> I'm

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
know that I'm moving and that I'm

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.960 
know that I'm moving and that I'm
getting<00:02:15.770> out<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.010> balance<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.520> it<00:02:16.640> gives<00:02:16.819> me

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
getting out of balance so it gives me

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.410 
getting out of balance so it gives me
feedback<00:02:17.240> on<00:02:17.660> which<00:02:18.230> way<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.680> up<00:02:19.030> if<00:02:20.030> we<00:02:20.180> take

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
feedback on which way is up if we take

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.539 
feedback on which way is up if we take
that<00:02:20.599> away<00:02:20.810> we<00:02:21.349> have<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.590> rely<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.069> much<00:02:22.310> more

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
that away we have to rely that much more

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.460 
that away we have to rely that much more

to be a little more in tune with that

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.040 
to be a little more in tune with that

our body to get better at interpreting

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.089 
our body to get better at interpreting
that<00:02:34.819> so<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:35.720> know<00:02:36.050> what<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.230> even<00:02:36.440> think<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:36.770> a

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
that so you know what I even think of a

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.309 
that so you know what I even think of a
goalie<00:02:37.700> who's<00:02:37.940> moving<00:02:38.450> but<00:02:38.660> having<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.110> look

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
goalie who's moving but having to look

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.589 
goalie who's moving but having to look
and<00:02:39.650> watch<00:02:39.980> for<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.370> play<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:41.180> their<00:02:41.330> heads

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
and watch for the play so their heads

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.420 
and watch for the play so their heads
moving<00:02:41.959> their<00:02:42.290> their<00:02:42.620> eyes<00:02:42.860> can't

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
moving their their eyes can't

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.970 
moving their their eyes can't
necessarily<00:02:43.670> be<00:02:44.330> focused<00:02:44.810> on<00:02:44.989> what's<00:02:45.709> around

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
necessarily be focused on what's around

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.089 
necessarily be focused on what's around
them<00:02:46.239> so<00:02:47.239> again<00:02:47.540> hands<00:02:48.230> on<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.440> hips<00:02:48.680> or

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
them so again hands on the hips or

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.280 
them so again hands on the hips or
crossed<00:02:49.519> in<00:02:49.790> front<00:02:50.060> you're<00:02:50.599> going<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.989> start

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
crossed in front you're going to start

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.280 
crossed in front you're going to start
off<00:02:51.410> by<00:02:51.470> closing<00:02:51.920> just<00:02:52.280> one<00:02:52.519> eye<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:54.110> then

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
off by closing just one eye but then

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.140 
off by closing just one eye but then
when<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:54.739> do<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.160> balance<00:02:55.640> for<00:02:55.819> 60

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
when you can do that and balance for 60

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.170 
when you can do that and balance for 60
seconds<00:02:56.630> you'll<00:02:57.170> close<00:02:57.440> both<00:02:57.830> eyes<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.430> if

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
seconds you'll close both eyes and if

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.009 
seconds you'll close both eyes and if
you<00:02:59.300> look<00:02:59.480> at<00:02:59.630> my<00:03:00.640> lower<00:03:01.640> leg<00:03:02.000> you'll<00:03:02.720> see<00:03:02.989> a

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
you look at my lower leg you'll see a

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.860 
you look at my lower leg you'll see a
lot<00:03:03.440> more<00:03:03.470> activity<00:03:04.299> there<00:03:05.299> with<00:03:05.540> my<00:03:05.750> eyes

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
lot more activity there with my eyes

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.020 
lot more activity there with my eyes
closed<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:07.060> now<00:03:08.060> I'll<00:03:08.209> open<00:03:08.330> my<00:03:08.540> eyes<00:03:10.030> and

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
closed and now I'll open my eyes and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.360 
closed and now I'll open my eyes and
there's<00:03:11.600> a<00:03:11.660> lot<00:03:11.840> less<00:03:12.110> activity<00:03:12.799> it's<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.190> much

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
there's a lot less activity it's a much

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.309 
there's a lot less activity it's a much
calmer<00:03:13.670> because<00:03:14.180> I'm<00:03:14.569> getting<00:03:14.989> that<00:03:15.080> much

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
calmer because I'm getting that much

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.080 
calmer because I'm getting that much
more<00:03:15.560> feedback<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.459> there<00:03:16.760> are<00:03:16.849> fewer

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
more feedback and there are fewer

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.720 
more feedback and there are fewer
Corrections<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.530> should<00:03:19.220> be<00:03:19.370> able<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.580> balance

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
Corrections so should be able to balance

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.390 
Corrections so should be able to balance
for<00:03:20.269> 60<00:03:20.660> seconds<00:03:21.110> with<00:03:21.410> your<00:03:21.560> eyes<00:03:21.709> closed<00:03:22.160> on

for 60 seconds with your eyes closed on
each<00:03:23.060> leg<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.900> third<00:03:24.140> simple<00:03:24.620> balance

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
each leg the third simple balance

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.400 
each leg the third simple balance
technique<00:03:25.430> again<00:03:26.120> relates<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:26.959> idea

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
technique again relates to that idea

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.440 
technique again relates to that idea

a very quick accurate response so we're

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.240 
a very quick accurate response so we're

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
gonna come back to single leg balance

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.580 
gonna come back to single leg balance
this<00:03:59.120> time<00:03:59.359> we're<00:03:59.450> gonna<00:03:59.510> bring<00:03:59.750> our<00:03:59.930> arms<00:04:00.139> out

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
thumb come out to the side moving your

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.800 
thumb come out to the side moving your
head<00:04:12.730> with<00:04:13.730> your<00:04:13.970> hand

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.749 

again<00:04:18.810> really<00:04:19.229> important<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.829> be<00:04:19.979> focusing<00:04:20.579> on

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 
again really important to be focusing on

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.570 
again really important to be focusing on
the<00:04:20.909> thumb<00:04:21.319> not<00:04:22.319> sort<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.889> having<00:04:23.189> a<00:04:23.280> blank

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
the thumb not sort of having a blank

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.540 
the thumb not sort of having a blank
gaze<00:04:23.970> past<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.319> and<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:26.009> would<00:04:26.129> do<00:04:26.280> each

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
gaze past it and you would do each

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.999 
gaze past it and you would do each
direction<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.419> then<00:04:27.780> as<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:28.080> get<00:04:28.199> better<00:04:28.469> you

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
direction and then as you get better you

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.350 
direction and then as you get better you
could<00:04:29.189> make<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.639> quicker

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
could make it quicker

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.140 
could make it quicker
stop<00:04:32.150> quick<00:04:33.150> in<00:04:33.360> stop<00:04:34.550> you<00:04:35.550> could<00:04:35.789> read<00:04:36.000> and

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
stop quick in stop you could read and

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.149 
stop quick in stop you could read and
react<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:36.810> someone<00:04:37.319> could<00:04:37.439> stand<00:04:37.740> in<00:04:37.860> front<00:04:38.009> of

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
react so someone could stand in front of

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.610 
react so someone could stand in front of
you<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.520> they<00:04:38.909> could<00:04:38.969> point<00:04:39.389> right<00:04:40.199> or<00:04:40.379> left

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
you and they could point right or left

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.450 
you and they could point right or left
so<00:04:41.219> if<00:04:41.310> they<00:04:41.430> point<00:04:41.729> this<00:04:41.909> way<00:04:42.210> then<00:04:42.719> you<00:04:42.960> would

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
so if they point this way then you would

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.809 
so if they point this way then you would
pause<00:04:45.199> pause<00:04:46.199> or<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:47.370> know<00:04:47.430> you<00:04:47.520> can<00:04:47.699> be

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
pause pause or you know you can be

pause pause or you know you can be
following<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.509> and<00:04:48.719> then<00:04:49.050> at<00:04:49.199> some<00:04:49.379> point<00:04:49.440> they

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
following it and then at some point they

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.070 
following it and then at some point they
could<00:04:49.889> yell<00:04:50.250> stop<00:04:50.639> and<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.330> have<00:04:51.449> to<00:04:51.539> stop<00:04:51.840> and

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
could yell stop and you have to stop and

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.990 
could yell stop and you have to stop and
maintain<00:04:52.469> your<00:04:52.500> balance<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.550> those<00:04:53.699> are<00:04:53.879> some
