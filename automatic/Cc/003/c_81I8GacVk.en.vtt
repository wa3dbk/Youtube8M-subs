we've<00:01:07.149> actually<00:01:07.509> had<00:01:08.110> some<00:01:08.350> negative<00:01:08.520> energy

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
we've actually had some negative energy

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.840 
we've actually had some negative energy
so<00:01:10.330> it<00:01:11.170> actually<00:01:11.710> pulls<00:01:12.070> and<00:01:12.490> push

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
so it actually pulls and push
