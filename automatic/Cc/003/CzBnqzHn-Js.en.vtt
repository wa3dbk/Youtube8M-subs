other<00:03:36.580> side<00:03:36.850> of<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.030> screen<00:03:37.240> and<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.690> won't

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
other side of the screen and you won't

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.780 
other side of the screen and you won't
get<00:03:38.020> hurt<00:03:38.080> I<00:03:38.500> mean<00:03:39.040> what<00:03:39.310> they<00:03:39.430> could<00:03:39.670> have

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
get hurt I mean what they could have

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.070 
get hurt I mean what they could have
done<00:03:39.970> they<00:03:40.120> could<00:03:40.180> have<00:03:40.420> made<00:03:40.570> it<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:40.870> when<00:03:40.990> you

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
done they could have made it so when you

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.570 
done they could have made it so when you
got<00:03:41.200> big<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.590> could<00:03:41.770> run<00:03:41.950> around<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.370> little

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
got big you could run around a little

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.240 
got big you could run around a little
kind<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.820> like<00:03:42.880> Giga<00:03:43.180> Bowser<00:03:43.390> but<00:03:43.990> I<00:03:44.290> mean<00:03:45.010> I

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
kind of like Giga Bowser but I mean I

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.230 
kind of like Giga Bowser but I mean I
guess<00:03:46.090> it's<00:03:46.300> more<00:03:46.510> effective<00:03:46.810> just<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.530> grow

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
guess it's more effective just to grow

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.500 
guess it's more effective just to grow
then<00:03:49.240> don't<00:03:49.810> do<00:03:50.170> anything<00:03:51.150> yeah<00:03:52.150> I<00:03:52.210> don't<00:03:52.300> know

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
then don't do anything yeah I don't know

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.110 
then don't do anything yeah I don't know
this<00:03:52.720> is<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:52.960> pretty<00:03:53.200> bad<00:03:53.440> final<00:03:53.890> smash<00:03:54.160> but<00:03:55.030> it

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
this is a pretty bad final smash but it

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.400 
this is a pretty bad final smash but it
gets<00:03:55.270> back<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.660> Nintendo<00:03:56.050> they're<00:03:56.200> probably

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
gets back in Nintendo they're probably

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.520 
gets back in Nintendo they're probably
thinking<00:03:56.560> hmm<00:03:57.460> Jigglypuff<00:03:58.000> well<00:03:58.660> no<00:03:59.380> one

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
thinking hmm Jigglypuff well no one

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.590 
thinking hmm Jigglypuff well no one
really<00:03:59.560> uses<00:03:59.980> Jigglypuff<00:04:00.640> let's<00:04:01.330> just<00:04:01.480> give

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
really uses Jigglypuff let's just give

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.320 
really uses Jigglypuff let's just give
her<00:04:01.960> fine<00:04:02.170> smash<00:04:02.440> who<00:04:02.590> gives<00:04:02.830> a

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
her fine smash who gives a

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.900 
her fine smash who gives a
then<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.480> lead<00:04:04.630> guys<00:04:04.870> like<00:04:05.140> hell<00:04:05.680> yeah<00:04:06.250> I

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
then the lead guys like hell yeah I

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.940 
then the lead guys like hell yeah I
guess<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.900> right<00:04:08.080> I<00:04:08.140> don't<00:04:08.440> play<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.620> Julie

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
guess the right I don't play is Julie

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:16.650 
guess the right I don't play is Julie
puffs

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.940 

you

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.680 

Oh<00:04:24.390> peach<00:04:26.040> peaches<00:04:27.040> final<00:04:27.400> smash<00:04:27.640> is<00:04:28.030> kind<00:04:28.600> of

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
Oh peach peaches final smash is kind of

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.860 
Oh peach peaches final smash is kind of
interesting<00:04:30.090> unlike<00:04:31.090> all<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.390> other<00:04:31.510> final

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
interesting unlike all the other final

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.660 
interesting unlike all the other final
smashes<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:32.380> are<00:04:32.500> based<00:04:32.710> around<00:04:32.890> Kay<00:04:33.370> owing

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
smashes that are based around Kay owing

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.480 
smashes that are based around Kay owing
people<00:04:33.820> peaches<00:04:34.810> is<00:04:34.960> based<00:04:35.170> around<00:04:35.490> healing

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
people peaches is based around healing

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.910 
people peaches is based around healing
herself<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.410> then<00:04:38.410> falling<00:04:39.130> people<00:04:39.520> asleep

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
herself and then falling people asleep

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.650 
herself and then falling people asleep
okay<00:04:41.920> I<00:04:41.950> guess<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.460> idea<00:04:42.640> behind<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.300> is<00:04:43.420> good

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
okay I guess the idea behind it is good

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.300 
okay I guess the idea behind it is good
because<00:04:43.870> peach<00:04:44.320> can<00:04:44.530> heal<00:04:44.710> herself<00:04:44.830> all<00:04:45.220> the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
because peach can heal herself all the

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.710 
because peach can heal herself all the
way<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.700> then<00:04:45.790> go<00:04:45.940> get<00:04:46.090> a<00:04:46.150> free<00:04:46.330> hit<00:04:46.600> on

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
way and then go get a free hit on

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.110 
way and then go get a free hit on
someone<00:04:47.010> but<00:04:48.010> if<00:04:48.100> you<00:04:48.190> think<00:04:48.460> about<00:04:48.640> it<00:04:49.000> this

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
someone but if you think about it this

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.630 
someone but if you think about it this
isn't<00:04:49.390> very<00:04:49.750> effective<00:04:50.140> first<00:04:51.070> of<00:04:51.280> all<00:04:51.400> the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
isn't very effective first of all the

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.580 
isn't very effective first of all the
peaches<00:04:51.850> don't<00:04:52.240> even<00:04:52.450> healer<00:04:52.690> up<00:04:52.930> that<00:04:53.260> much

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
peaches don't even healer up that much

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.100 
peaches don't even healer up that much
and<00:04:53.920> if<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:54.520> hit<00:04:54.700> someone<00:04:54.970> they<00:04:55.300> wake<00:04:55.750> up<00:04:55.780> the

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
and if you hit someone they wake up the

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.570 
and if you hit someone they wake up the
second<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:56.500> touch<00:04:56.680> them<00:04:56.920> so<00:04:57.100> they<00:04:57.220> can<00:04:57.370> most

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
second you touch them so they can most

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.330 
second you touch them so they can most
likely<00:04:57.670> save<00:04:58.210> themselves<00:04:58.390> from<00:04:58.720> dying<00:04:59.020> and

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
likely save themselves from dying and

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.950 
likely save themselves from dying and
also<00:05:00.340> you're<00:05:01.120> not<00:05:01.330> going<00:05:01.510> to<00:05:01.570> get<00:05:01.690> all<00:05:01.840> the

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
also you're not going to get all the

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.480 
also you're not going to get all the
peaches<00:05:02.200> they're<00:05:02.530> kind<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:02.740> spread<00:05:02.920> out<00:05:03.100> and

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
peaches they're kind of spread out and

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.980 
peaches they're kind of spread out and
other<00:05:03.850> people<00:05:04.240> can<00:05:04.390> pick<00:05:04.510> up<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.780> peaches

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
other people can pick up the peaches

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.760 
other people can pick up the peaches
once<00:05:05.350> they<00:05:05.530> wake<00:05:05.650> up<00:05:06.330> so<00:05:07.330> I<00:05:07.660> guess<00:05:08.050> if<00:05:08.350> you<00:05:08.410> want

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
once they wake up so I guess if you want

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.860 
once they wake up so I guess if you want
to<00:05:08.890> help<00:05:09.190> other<00:05:09.490> people<00:05:10.030> you<00:05:10.060> can<00:05:10.420> use<00:05:10.450> peaches

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
to help other people you can use peaches

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.830 
to help other people you can use peaches

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.320
