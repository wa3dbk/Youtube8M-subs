getting better but that's all y'all do

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.470 
getting better but that's all y'all do
is<00:04:13.160> snap<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:13.640> back<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:13.940> if<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.030> look<00:04:14.239> on<00:04:14.330> the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
is snap the back and if you look on the

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.949 
is snap the back and if you look on the
internet<00:04:14.980> say<00:04:15.980> iPad<00:04:16.790> red<00:04:17.090> screen<00:04:17.359> problem<00:04:17.840> and

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
internet say iPad red screen problem and

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.420 
internet say iPad red screen problem and
that's<00:04:18.020> what<00:04:18.230> comes<00:04:18.410> up<00:04:18.590> just<00:04:18.620> slap<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.040> back<00:04:19.280> of

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
that's what comes up just slap a back of

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.969 
that's what comes up just slap a back of
it<00:04:19.549> I<00:04:19.760> think<00:04:20.239> isn't<00:04:20.359> it<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:20.780> know<00:04:20.930> is<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.530> chip

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
it I think isn't it I know is a chip

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.620 
it I think isn't it I know is a chip
that<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:22.250> gets<00:04:22.430> loose<00:04:22.669> in<00:04:22.970> there

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
that it gets loose in there

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.650 
that it gets loose in there
yes<00:04:24.790> like<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:28.130> don't<00:04:28.880> want<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.090> slap<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.330> again

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
yes like I don't want to slap it again

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.140 
yes like I don't want to slap it again
cuz<00:04:29.900> moves<00:04:30.230> it<00:04:30.410> gets<00:04:30.650> even<00:04:30.860> worse<00:04:31.150> yeah

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
cuz moves it gets even worse yeah

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.830 
cuz moves it gets even worse yeah
exactly

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
exactly

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.600 
exactly
so<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.290> think<00:04:33.560> it's<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:33.740> risk<00:04:33.860> gonna<00:04:34.130> take<00:04:34.430> it

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
so I think it's a risk gonna take it

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.730 
so I think it's a risk gonna take it
right<00:04:34.820> now<00:04:34.880> but<00:04:35.840> I<00:04:35.990> don't<00:04:36.200> want<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:36.380> slap<00:04:36.590> it

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740
