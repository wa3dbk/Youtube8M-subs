00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
so Paul maybe if you tell us just a

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.040 
so Paul maybe if you tell us just a
little<00:01:05.650> bit<00:01:05.950> about<00:01:06.340> what<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.360> get<00:01:07.510> over<00:01:07.690> quite

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
little bit about what you get over quite

little bit about what you get over quite
to<00:01:08.230> the<00:01:08.380> spirit<00:01:08.770> all<00:01:09.310> right

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
to the spirit all right

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.200 
to the spirit all right
Percy<00:01:11.980> said<00:01:12.310> is<00:01:12.550> a<00:01:12.580> good<00:01:12.670> weapon<00:01:13.000> for

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
Percy said is a good weapon for

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.760 
Percy said is a good weapon for
practicing<00:01:14.310> Jimmy<00:01:15.310> before<00:01:15.940> getting<00:01:16.630> you<00:01:17.590> get

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
practicing Jimmy before getting you get

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.440 
practicing Jimmy before getting you get
into<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.580> weapon<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.640> simple<00:01:22.270> weapon

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
into the weapon and it's a simple weapon

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.590 
into the weapon and it's a simple weapon
statistics<00:01:23.410> with<00:01:23.620> the<00:01:23.710> spear<00:01:23.980> end<00:01:24.190> but<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.450> has

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
statistics with the spear end but it has

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.320 
statistics with the spear end but it has
a<00:01:25.630> lot<00:01:25.900> of<00:01:25.930> complexity<00:01:26.530> with<00:01:27.130> cutting<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:30.330> so

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
a lot of complexity with cutting and so

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.770 
a lot of complexity with cutting and so
the<00:01:31.720> main<00:01:31.990> main<00:01:32.740> goal<00:01:33.460> in<00:01:33.760> our<00:01:34.090> lineage<00:01:34.360> I

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
the main main goal in our lineage I

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.810 
the main main goal in our lineage I
would<00:01:35.380> say<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.890> develop<00:01:36.369> focus<00:01:38.250> oh<00:01:39.250> maybe

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
would say is to develop focus oh maybe

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.070 
would say is to develop focus oh maybe
we<00:01:40.060> can<00:01:40.240> go<00:01:40.450> through<00:01:41.170> some<00:01:41.380> of<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:45.930> basic<00:01:46.930> on

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
we can go through some of the basic on

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.350 
we can go through some of the basic on
guard<00:01:47.320> position<00:01:47.380> is<00:01:48.009> keeping<00:01:49.000> in<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.119> sphere

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
guard position is keeping in the sphere

00:01:49.360 --> 00:02:01.950 
guard position is keeping in the sphere
like<00:01:49.509> this<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.869> opponent<00:01:59.350> comes<00:01:59.560> in<00:01:59.740> low
