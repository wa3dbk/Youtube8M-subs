the<00:00:25.350> neckline<00:00:25.830> from<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.310> original<00:00:26.880> pattern

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the neckline from this original pattern

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.330 
the neckline from this original pattern
I<00:00:27.480> laid<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.170> top<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.410> my<00:00:28.529> sloper<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.279> I

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
I laid it on top of my sloper and I

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.939 
I laid it on top of my sloper and I
copied<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> scalloped<00:00:30.269> edges<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.590> same<00:00:31.619> at

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
copied the scalloped edges the same at

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.180 
copied the scalloped edges the same at
the<00:00:32.070> front<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.489> back<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.540> sleeve

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
the front in the back and the sleeve

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.639 
the front in the back and the sleeve
scallops<00:00:35.190> had<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.640> resized<00:00:36.649> slightly

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
scallops had to be resized slightly

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.100 
scallops had to be resized slightly
because<00:00:37.920> my<00:00:38.520> sleeve<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.300> my<00:00:39.450> neckline<00:00:39.899> is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
because my sleeve and my neckline is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.560 
because my sleeve and my neckline is
larger<00:00:40.500> than<00:00:40.620> their<00:00:40.860> original<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.420> would

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
larger than their original so it would

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.850 
larger than their original so it would
actually<00:00:42.600> wasn't<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.320> much<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.710> problem

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
actually wasn't that much of a problem

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.439

whenever you do this I cut out my
regular<00:01:23.900> fashion<00:01:24.900> fabric<00:01:25.140> from<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.860> bodice

and I don't bother to mark the scallops
on<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.869> because<00:01:30.869> when<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.200> sew<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.590> you're

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
on that because when you sew this you're

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.390 
on that because when you sew this you're
going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.579> place<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.720> facing<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.860> outside

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.550 
with with the good sides matching and
then<00:01:38.610> you're<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> sew<00:01:39.360> not<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> regular

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
then you're going to sew not a regular

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.080 
then you're going to sew not a regular
5/8<00:01:40.979> seam<00:01:41.220> allowance<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.790> you're<00:01:41.909> going<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.630 
5/8 seam allowance but you're going to
sew<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.869> stitching<00:01:43.290> line<00:01:43.470> how<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> know

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
sew the stitching line how do you know

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.469 
sew the stitching line how do you know
how<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> do<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
how to do that

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.039 
how to do that
when<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.079> cut<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.409> your<00:01:46.680> facing<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:48.840> use

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
when you cut out your facing you use

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.819 
when you cut out your facing you use
tracing<00:01:49.590> paper<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> wheel<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:52.140> trace<00:01:52.560> these

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
tracing paper and a wheel to trace these

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.100 
tracing paper and a wheel to trace these
scallops<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.229> would<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.470> your<00:01:55.590> pattern

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
scallops so this would be your pattern

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
scallops so this would be your pattern
should<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.170> you're<00:01:58.320> facing<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:59.610> literally

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
should be you're facing and literally

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.160 
should be you're facing and literally
take<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> little<00:02:00.630> wheel<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
take the little wheel and this is the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.749 
take the little wheel and this is the
tricky<00:02:04.530> part<00:02:04.560> when<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.100> get<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> corners

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
tricky part when you get to the corners

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.169 
tricky part when you get to the corners
I<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.180> pivot<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.659> this

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
I just pivot like this

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.120 
I just pivot like this
follow<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.509> line<00:02:10.940> give<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.480> again

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
follow the line give it like that again

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.120 
follow the line give it like that again
I'm<00:02:14.130> doing<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.459> one-handed<00:02:15.739> until<00:02:16.739> you<00:02:16.920> get

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
I'm doing this one-handed until you get

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.040 
I'm doing this one-handed until you get
your<00:02:18.980> shoulder<00:02:19.980> seams<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.360> same<00:02:21.630> with

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
your shoulder seams and the same with

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.940 
your shoulder seams and the same with
the<00:02:22.230> face<00:02:22.440> inch<00:02:22.709> for<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.160> underarms<00:02:24.950> that's

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
the face inch for the underarms that's

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.970 
the face inch for the underarms that's
how<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.130> would<00:02:26.370> create<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:27.569> facing<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.920> how

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
how you would create the facing and how

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.370 
how you would create the facing and how
you<00:02:29.790> would<00:02:30.120> follow<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.630> stitching<00:02:31.110> lines

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
you would follow the stitching lines

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.070 
you would follow the stitching lines
whenever<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.280> create<00:02:32.519> scallop<00:02:33.180> if<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.930> can

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
whenever you create scallop if you can

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.089 
whenever you create scallop if you can
see<00:02:34.230> there's<00:02:34.440> not<00:02:34.560> really<00:02:34.739> that<00:02:34.830> many

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
see there's not really that many

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.630 
see there's not really that many
scallops<00:02:35.730> there<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.349> it's<00:02:37.349> not<00:02:37.500> too<00:02:38.040> tricky<00:02:38.370> to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
scallops there so it's not too tricky to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.090 
scallops there so it's not too tricky to
do<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:41.209> I'd<00:02:42.209> say<00:02:42.450> beginning<00:02:43.350> sewers<00:02:43.830> might

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
do but I'd say beginning sewers might

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.530 
do but I'd say beginning sewers might
have<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> little<00:02:44.519> bit<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.760> an<00:02:44.910> issue<00:02:45.060> with<00:02:45.360> it

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
have a little bit of an issue with it

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.330 
have a little bit of an issue with it
one<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.650> other<00:02:46.680> tricks<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.400> use<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:48.060> after

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
one of the other tricks I use is after

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.309 
one of the other tricks I use is after
when<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.370> got<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.880> facing<00:02:51.330> slapped<00:02:51.720> on<00:02:51.930> top<00:02:52.140> of

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
when I got the facing slapped on top of

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.460 
when I got the facing slapped on top of
the<00:02:52.440> outside<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.160> bodice<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.640> arranged<00:02:53.910> so

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
the outside the bodice and arranged so

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.280 
the outside the bodice and arranged so
set<00:02:55.470> your<00:02:55.680> sewing<00:02:56.069> machine<00:02:56.100> stitch<00:02:56.940> length<00:02:57.360> to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
set your sewing machine stitch length to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.949 
set your sewing machine stitch length to
a<00:02:58.319> really<00:02:58.890> small<00:02:59.310> setting<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.540> use<00:03:02.690> maybe<00:03:03.690> three

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
a really small setting I use maybe three

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.690 
a really small setting I use maybe three
or<00:03:04.019> four<00:03:04.080> clicks<00:03:04.590> below<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.220> standard

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
or four clicks below the standard

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.080 
or four clicks below the standard
setting<00:03:06.090> on<00:03:06.209> my<00:03:06.330> machine<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.670> reason<00:03:08.940> why

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
setting on my machine so the reason why

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.180 
setting on my machine so the reason why
I<00:03:09.150> want<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.510> do<00:03:09.630> this<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:10.019> because<00:03:10.190> whenever

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
I want to do this is because whenever

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.250 
I want to do this is because whenever
you're<00:03:11.340> sewing<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.790> curve<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.660> you're<00:03:12.810> using<00:03:13.049> a

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
you're sewing a curve and you're using a

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.550 
you're sewing a curve and you're using a
wide<00:03:13.530> stitch<00:03:14.150> what<00:03:15.150> happens<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:15.930> when<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.380> try

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
wide stitch what happens is when you try

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.340 
wide stitch what happens is when you try
to<00:03:16.590> get<00:03:16.769> around<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.160> tight<00:03:18.109> circumference<00:03:19.109> of

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
to get around the tight circumference of

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.310 
to get around the tight circumference of
that<00:03:19.500> curve<00:03:19.859> that<00:03:20.190> long<00:03:20.459> stitch<00:03:21.030> makes<00:03:21.989> it

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
that curve that long stitch makes it

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.130 
that curve that long stitch makes it
appear<00:03:22.859> less<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.940> smooth<00:03:24.359> curve<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.109> a

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
appear less like a smooth curve and a

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.890 
appear less like a smooth curve and a
little<00:03:25.320> bit<00:03:25.440> more<00:03:25.680> choppy<00:03:26.359> if<00:03:27.359> that<00:03:27.570> makes<00:03:27.750> any

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
little bit more choppy if that makes any

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.130 
little bit more choppy if that makes any
sense<00:03:28.049> I've<00:03:28.560> found<00:03:28.859> that<00:03:29.070> whenever<00:03:29.280> I

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
sense I've found that whenever I

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.970 
sense I've found that whenever I
decrease<00:03:31.140> my<00:03:31.170> stitch<00:03:32.030> length<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.980> whenever

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
decrease my stitch length that whenever

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.059 
decrease my stitch length that whenever
I<00:03:35.220> sewed<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.510> really<00:03:36.840> tight<00:03:37.260> little<00:03:37.680> inside

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
I sewed that really tight little inside

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.640 
I sewed that really tight little inside
between<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.609> scalloped<00:03:38.970> parts<00:03:39.329> it<00:03:40.200> came<00:03:40.470> out

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
between the scalloped parts it came out

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.970 
between the scalloped parts it came out
looking<00:03:40.980> much<00:03:41.310> better<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.120> whenever<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:42.980> laid

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
looking much better and whenever I laid

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.539 
looking much better and whenever I laid
the<00:03:44.130> fabric<00:03:44.579> around<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.260> curve<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:47.160> came<00:03:47.370> out

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
the fabric around the curve it came out

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.420 
the fabric around the curve it came out
much<00:03:47.819> smoother<00:03:48.569> because<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.829> spaces<00:03:50.310> in

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
much smoother because the spaces in

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.970 
much smoother because the spaces in
between<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.790> stitches<00:03:51.060> aren't<00:03:51.720> as<00:03:51.930> big<00:03:52.170> so

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
between the stitches aren't as big so

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.930 
between the stitches aren't as big so
that's<00:03:53.190> tip<00:03:53.519> one<00:03:53.850> decrease<00:03:54.810> your<00:03:55.940> stitch

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
that's tip one decrease your stitch

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.940 
that's tip one decrease your stitch
width<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.510> second<00:03:57.989> one<00:03:58.139> is<00:03:58.319> after<00:03:58.620> you've<00:03:58.739> got

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
width the second one is after you've got

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.729 
width the second one is after you've got
everything<00:03:59.250> sewn<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.750> turn<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.319> phases

you're<00:04:57.060> where<00:04:57.240> I'm<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.480> they<00:04:57.540> don't<00:04:57.780> want

you're where I'm and they don't want
pretty<00:04:58.170> so<00:04:59.130> one<00:04:59.340> thing<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.640> do<00:04:59.700> now<00:05:00.000> at<00:05:00.810> every

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
pretty so one thing I do now at every

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.180 
pretty so one thing I do now at every
meeting<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.850> a<00:05:02.940> scallop<00:05:03.240> point<00:05:03.750> I<00:05:04.020> put<00:05:04.920> fray

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
meeting of a scallop point I put fray

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.870 
meeting of a scallop point I put fray
check<00:05:05.220> on<00:05:05.910> the<00:05:06.210> inside<00:05:07.250> right<00:05:08.250> where<00:05:08.490> I<00:05:08.520> clip

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
check on the inside right where I clip

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
check on the inside right where I clip
to<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.390> scene<00:05:09.680> so<00:05:10.680> this<00:05:10.860> stops<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.900> fabric

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
to the scene so this stops the fabric

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.790 
to the scene so this stops the fabric
from<00:05:13.050> fraying

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
from fraying

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.730 
from fraying
during<00:05:14.280> wash<00:05:14.520> or<00:05:14.880> when<00:05:15.000> it<00:05:15.120> gets<00:05:15.270> old<00:05:15.740> because

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
during wash or when it gets old because

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.770 
during wash or when it gets old because
that<00:05:16.950> stitch<00:05:17.250> is<00:05:17.430> such<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.640> tight<00:05:18.000> little<00:05:18.330> area

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
that stitch is such a tight little area

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.630 
that stitch is such a tight little area
it<00:05:19.410> can<00:05:20.040> be<00:05:20.600> prone<00:05:21.600> to<00:05:21.630> damage<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.380> washing<00:05:22.980> so

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
it can be prone to damage and washing so

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.120 
it can be prone to damage and washing so
I<00:05:23.670> use<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.090> fray<00:05:24.240> check<00:05:24.270> I<00:05:24.780> get<00:05:25.410> it<00:05:25.530> at<00:05:25.770> my

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
I use the fray check I get it at my

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.930 
I use the fray check I get it at my
local<00:05:26.670> sewing<00:05:27.180> store<00:05:27.450> and<00:05:28.550> it<00:05:29.550> smells<00:05:30.090> pretty

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
local sewing store and it smells pretty

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.670 
local sewing store and it smells pretty
doesn't<00:05:32.940> take<00:05:33.090> long<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.360> dry<00:05:33.690> at<00:05:33.870> all<00:05:33.990> put<00:05:34.590> it

doesn't take long to dry at all put it
in<00:05:34.710> between<00:05:34.860> every<00:05:35.280> little<00:05:35.490> scallop<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.200> then

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
in between every little scallop and then

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.320 
in between every little scallop and then
wait<00:05:38.010> about<00:05:38.160> five<00:05:38.490> minutes<00:05:38.820> for<00:05:38.910> it<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.060> dry

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
wait about five minutes for it to dry

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.390 
wait about five minutes for it to dry
and<00:05:39.600> turn<00:05:40.110> my<00:05:40.230> facings<00:05:40.650> to<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.920> right<00:05:41.100> side

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
and turn my facings to the right side

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.130 
and turn my facings to the right side
and<00:05:43.460> pull<00:05:44.460> out<00:05:44.700> every<00:05:45.000> little<00:05:45.240> scallop<00:05:45.660> I<00:05:45.840> use

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
and pull out every little scallop I use

and pull out every little scallop I use
my<00:05:47.040> tracing<00:05:47.490> wheel<00:05:47.670> fits<00:05:48.270> nicely<00:05:48.570> up<00:05:48.900> into<00:05:49.140> the

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
my tracing wheel fits nicely up into the

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.250 
my tracing wheel fits nicely up into the
scallops<00:05:49.710> to<00:05:49.950> poke<00:05:50.610> out<00:05:50.760> the<00:05:50.790> shape<00:05:51.120> and<00:05:51.360> then

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
scallops to poke out the shape and then

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.220 
scallops to poke out the shape and then
of<00:05:52.380> course<00:05:52.650> I<00:05:53.010> use<00:05:53.370> a<00:05:53.400> steam<00:05:53.910> iron<00:05:54.120> to<00:05:54.720> set<00:05:55.020> the

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
of course I use a steam iron to set the

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.220 
of course I use a steam iron to set the
shape<00:05:55.500> I<00:05:56.030> manipulate<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.180> facing<00:05:57.720> so<00:05:58.050> it's

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
shape I manipulate the facing so it's

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.980 
shape I manipulate the facing so it's
not<00:05:58.440> bulging<00:05:59.340> out<00:05:59.490> in<00:05:59.730> some<00:05:59.940> point<00:06:00.210> you<00:06:00.810> can

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
not bulging out in some point you can

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.020 
not bulging out in some point you can
hide<00:06:01.230> some<00:06:01.710> errors<00:06:02.190> when<00:06:02.460> you're<00:06:02.580> doing<00:06:02.880> this

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
hide some errors when you're doing this

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.240 
hide some errors when you're doing this
too<00:06:03.300> if<00:06:03.810> there's<00:06:04.350> like<00:06:04.500> a<00:06:04.530> corner<00:06:05.070> that's

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
too if there's like a corner that's

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.550 
too if there's like a corner that's
poking<00:06:05.670> out<00:06:05.820> it's<00:06:06.000> not<00:06:06.180> a<00:06:06.210> perfect<00:06:06.720> circle<00:06:06.960> you

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
poking out it's not a perfect circle you

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.040 
poking out it's not a perfect circle you
can<00:06:07.830> manipulate<00:06:08.370> the<00:06:08.760> fabula<00:06:09.270> fabric<00:06:09.900> with

can manipulate the fabula fabric with

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.620 
can manipulate the fabula fabric with
your<00:06:10.200> fingers<00:06:10.620> or<00:06:10.860> a<00:06:11.040> small<00:06:11.820> implement<00:06:12.390> and

your fingers or a small implement and

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
shape it into a nicer circle and then

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.650 
shape it into a nicer circle and then
iron<00:06:15.720> it<00:06:15.960> flat<00:06:16.490> in<00:06:17.490> most<00:06:17.790> cases<00:06:18.060> it<00:06:18.360> stays<00:06:18.630> that

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
iron it flat in most cases it stays that

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.500 
iron it flat in most cases it stays that
way<00:06:18.900> because<00:06:19.350> once<00:06:20.250> you<00:06:20.490> iron<00:06:20.790> at<00:06:21.210> with<00:06:21.390> the

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
way because once you iron at with the

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.410 
way because once you iron at with the
steam<00:06:21.810> iron<00:06:22.080> even<00:06:23.010> just<00:06:23.640> your<00:06:23.820> regular<00:06:24.000> wash
