be able to say first because if the eyes
are<00:02:33.690> melt<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.560> know<00:02:34.709> if<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.040> pole<00:02:35.610> or<00:02:35.970> melt

out and then if the sea is warm then the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.530 
out and then if the sea is warm then the
gas<00:02:40.260> will<00:02:40.620> be<00:02:40.680> released<00:02:41.250> from<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.940> ocean<00:02:42.060> and

gas will be released from the ocean and
we<00:02:43.140> all<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.470> poisoned<00:02:44.040> by<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:45.540> gas<00:02:45.840> from<00:02:46.560> the

everyone if you see the the Singapore
lecture<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.860> already<00:02:56.220> want<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.850> we<00:02:56.970> have<00:02:57.090> to

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
lecture I already want that we have to

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.850 
lecture I already want that we have to
change<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.630> way<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:57.930> live<00:02:58.080> in<00:02:58.230> other<00:02:58.380> ways<00:02:58.590> too

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860

that<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:03.060> always<00:03:03.360> talked<00:03:03.600> about<00:03:03.720> how<00:03:04.140> we

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
that I always talked about how we

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.990 
that I always talked about how we
DeForest<00:03:05.730> our<00:03:06.090> planet<00:03:06.959> yeah<00:03:07.610> meat-eating<00:03:08.610> and

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
DeForest our planet yeah meat-eating and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.970 
DeForest our planet yeah meat-eating and
all<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.330> it's<00:03:09.540> contribute<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> lot<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.709> for

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
all that it's contribute to a lot of for

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.620 
all that it's contribute to a lot of for
damage<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.400> our<00:03:12.080> family<00:03:14.150> scientists<00:03:15.150> say<00:03:15.269> many

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
damage to our family scientists say many

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.500 
damage to our family scientists say many
things<00:03:15.989> they're<00:03:16.950> listening<00:03:17.160> now<00:03:17.610> but<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.300> just

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
things they're listening now but it just

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.420 
things they're listening now but it just
hope<00:03:18.690> they<00:03:18.959> do<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.380> fast<00:03:19.620> it's<00:03:20.040> just<00:03:20.250> take

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
hope they do it fast it's just take

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.670 
hope they do it fast it's just take
action<00:03:20.910> all<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.840> governments<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.560> world

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
action all the governments in the world

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.920 
action all the governments in the world
really<00:03:23.070> take<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.580> now<00:03:23.760> seriously<00:03:24.330> it's<00:03:24.720> just

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
really take it now seriously it's just

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.720 
really take it now seriously it's just
I'm<00:03:25.140> worried<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.680> action<00:03:26.010> might<00:03:26.190> be<00:03:26.340> too<00:03:26.519> slow

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
I'm worried the action might be too slow

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.780 
I'm worried the action might be too slow
that's<00:03:27.030> all<00:03:27.290> because<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.440> eyes<00:03:28.650> are

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
that's all because the eyes are

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.750 
back into the space but the eyes are
melting<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:35.850> fast<00:03:35.880> now<00:03:37.160> that<00:03:38.160> there<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.549> not
