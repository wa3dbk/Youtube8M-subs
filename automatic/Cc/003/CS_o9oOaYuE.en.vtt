00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
volume you don't want it to trail off on

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.520 
volume you don't want it to trail off on
the<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.200> three<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:11.840> next<00:02:11.990> fill<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.290> want

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
the the three and the next fill I want

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.530 
the the three and the next fill I want
to<00:02:12.590> go<00:02:12.709> over<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.250> measure<00:02:13.580> 90<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:14.270> is<00:02:14.330> the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
to go over is on measure 90 this is the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.750 
to go over is on measure 90 this is the
fill<00:02:14.780> into<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.290> bridge

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.800 

now<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:22.849> don't<00:02:22.910> want<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.150> start<00:02:23.330> too<00:02:23.540> loud

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
now you don't want to start too loud

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.089 
now you don't want to start too loud
with<00:02:24.020> that<00:02:24.200> crescendo<00:02:24.680> because<00:02:24.920> then<00:02:25.010> you're

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
with that crescendo because then you're

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.800 
with that crescendo because then you're
going<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.250> have<00:02:25.370> nowhere<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.700> go<00:02:25.790> start<00:02:26.660> real

going to have nowhere to go start real

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.040 
going to have nowhere to go start real
soft<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:28.459> you<00:02:28.790> don't<00:02:28.970> want<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.599> all<00:02:29.870> the

99 and i'll start by playing this one

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.050 
99 and i'll start by playing this one
for<00:02:41.900> you

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
this one's a little more syncopated

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.140 
this one's a little more syncopated
because<00:02:51.410> we've<00:02:51.560> got<00:02:51.710> some<00:02:52.250> ease<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.790> ahhs<00:02:52.940> on
