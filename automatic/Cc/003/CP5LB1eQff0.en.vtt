there's a site dedicated to Chromebook
pixel<00:00:51.570> customer<00:00:52.260> support<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.710> that's<00:00:52.890> cool

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
pixel customer support so that's cool

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.279

then<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.820> course<00:00:54.030> below<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> charger

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
then of course below that is the charger

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.959 
then of course below that is the charger
it's<00:00:55.530> very<00:00:55.710> reminiscent<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> Asus

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it's very reminiscent of the Asus

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.150 
it's very reminiscent of the Asus
Zenbook<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.660> MacBook<00:00:57.930> chargers<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.920> plug

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
Zenbook and MacBook chargers that plug

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.590 
Zenbook and MacBook chargers that plug
directly<00:00:59.309> into<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.850> wall<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.390> pretty

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
directly into the wall so it's a pretty

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.450 
directly into the wall so it's a pretty
small<00:01:00.750> brick<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.649> does<00:01:01.800> say<00:01:01.980> Chrome<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.430> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
small brick and it does say Chrome on it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.759 
small brick and it does say Chrome on it
which<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> nice<00:01:03.359> touch<00:01:03.660> then<00:01:04.290> again<00:01:04.559> you

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
which is a nice touch then again you

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.950 
which is a nice touch then again you
also<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.430> larger<00:01:06.060> cable<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.659> if<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.840> want

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
also get the larger cable so if you want

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.240 
also get the larger cable so if you want
to<00:01:07.020> plug<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.290> into<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> wall<00:01:07.530> further<00:01:08.040> away

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
to plug it into the wall further away

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.250 
to plug it into the wall further away
from<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.150> totally<00:01:09.570> cool<00:01:09.810> too<00:01:10.110> and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.380 
from you that is totally cool too and
then<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:11.100> safety<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.790> warranty

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
unboxing is done so taking a closer look

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.859 
unboxing is done so taking a closer look
at<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> laptop<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.909> immediately<00:01:18.509> apparent

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
glossy though so you'll have to angle it

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.790 
glossy though so you'll have to angle it
properly<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.840> get<00:02:54.990> rid<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.350> lights<00:02:55.560> but

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
then again it is a touchscreen too so

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.810 
then again it is a touchscreen too so
there<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.560> some<00:02:58.770> fun<00:02:59.040> thrown<00:02:59.280> into<00:02:59.430> there<00:02:59.670> I

hopefully<00:03:37.620> will<00:03:37.920> come<00:03:38.070> together<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.670> make

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
hopefully will come together to make

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.550 
hopefully will come together to make
this<00:03:38.910> feel<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.300> more<00:03:39.570> complete<00:03:39.960> operating

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
this feel like a more complete operating

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.860 
this feel like a more complete operating
system<00:03:40.890> experience<00:03:41.400> plus<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.360> touch<00:03:42.540> screens

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
system experience plus the touch screens

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.080 
system experience plus the touch screens
so<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.380> really<00:03:43.620> gives<00:03:43.770> you<00:03:43.980> sort<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:44.910> new

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
so that really gives you sort of a new

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.300 
so that really gives you sort of a new
