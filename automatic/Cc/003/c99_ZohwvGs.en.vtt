00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
much more ink down you printed a lower

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.889 
much more ink down you printed a lower
resolution<00:00:59.609> which<00:01:00.149> means<00:01:00.180> your<00:01:00.510> printer<00:01:00.809> will

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
resolution which means your printer will

and opaque image also you never have to

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.030 
and opaque image also you never have to
replace<00:01:05.939> color<00:01:06.420> cartridges<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.500> not<00:01:07.710> only<00:01:07.860> do

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
replace color cartridges so not only do

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.710 
replace color cartridges so not only do
you<00:01:08.130> print<00:01:08.340> faster<00:01:08.790> print<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> darker<00:01:09.630> image

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
you print faster print a darker image

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.140 
you print faster print a darker image

typically you'd only need more ink if
you're<00:01:31.950> only<00:01:32.070> using<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.430> cartridge<00:01:33.030> Ameet

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
you're only using one cartridge Ameet

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.120 
you're only using one cartridge Ameet
bidirectional<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:34.530> print<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> little<00:01:35.009> bit

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
bidirectional will print a little bit

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.620 
bidirectional will print a little bit
faster<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.030> typically<00:01:36.329> don't<00:01:36.509> recommend

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
faster but we typically don't recommend

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.319 
faster but we typically don't recommend
printing<00:01:37.140> bidirectional<00:01:38.009> then<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.180> do

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
printing bidirectional then all you do

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.580 
printing bidirectional then all you do
is<00:01:39.360> select<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.900> type<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.170> printer<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.470> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
is select the type of printer that you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
is select the type of printer that you
have<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.009> select<00:01:41.280> Alex<00:01:41.549> connected<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.509> I'm

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
have and select Alex connected so if I'm

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.330 
have and select Alex connected so if I'm

and<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.520> after<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.909> it's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and all you have to do after that it's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.580 
and all you have to do after that it's
telling<00:01:48.299> how<00:01:48.509> you'd<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:48.960> screen<00:01:49.350> the

way to tell a big your dots are is

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.050 
way to tell a big your dots are is
coming<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.530> accurate<00:02:29.920> set<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.340> frequency<00:02:30.520> and

coming to accurate set the frequency and

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.720 
coming to accurate set the frequency and
then<00:02:31.660> come<00:02:32.260> over<00:02:32.290> here<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.950> do<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> test<00:02:33.550> print

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
then come over here and do a test print

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.729 
then come over here and do a test print
that'll<00:02:34.390> print<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:34.660> simple<00:02:34.930> test<00:02:35.140> page<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.620> can

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
that'll print a simple test page you can

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.559 
that'll print a simple test page you can
mark<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.400> size<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.940> LPI<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.480> you

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
mark the size of the LPI that you

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.120 
mark the size of the LPI that you
printed<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.440> way<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.650> can<00:02:38.950> use<00:02:39.100> that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
printed and that way you can use that

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.370

for<00:02:39.400> future<00:02:39.760> comparison<00:02:39.940> here's<00:02:40.900> ask<00:02:41.200> an

for future comparison here's ask an

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.170 
for future comparison here's ask an
example<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:41.890> an<00:02:41.980> accurate<00:02:42.220> test<00:02:42.550> file<00:02:42.760> this

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
example of an accurate test file this

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.690 
example of an accurate test file this
was<00:02:43.360> printed<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.780> 55<00:02:44.200> line<00:02:44.440> halftone<00:02:44.860> 22.5

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.490 
was printed in 55 line halftone 22.5
degrees<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.810> would<00:02:46.989> be<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.230> size<00:02:47.440> of

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
degrees so this would be the size of

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.809 
degrees so this would be the size of
half<00:02:47.620> time<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.920> use<00:02:48.069> for<00:02:48.280> four-color<00:02:48.610> process
