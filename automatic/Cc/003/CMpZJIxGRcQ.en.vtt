 nights to unlock the truth 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.870
 final excuse the cut but for 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.550
 getting to the minigames was really a 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.890
 casino so I had to shorten the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.460

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:30.330

 we think these children are 56 a 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.840
 that would be cold and golden with 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:47.520
 sadness will be with the balloons towards 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:51.840

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.540
 game so I cut it because it was 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.729
 really complicated to get to the budel 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.869
 in complicated then I did must only 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.350
 a little bit all the other mini games 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:28.009

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.009
 while things drink too much pietro de corato 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.579
 but let it be laugh now and 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.579

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.490
 then falls us children stalking ad 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.500

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:56.590
 I do n't remember if they are even bening 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:02:00.280

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.250
 ok finally I'm free I 'm more 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.539
 souls trying to persecute every 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.310
 least gentleman who goes to work there 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.260
 because from what you have made it understood 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.190
 the trolley xvi soul that a cinema was 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.090

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.280
 that which seems to them that 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.739
 there is still much of them and they can 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.060
 instead they were just ghosts that 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.820
 they look for overwhelming vineyards and that's it 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.060
