00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
so here's what it looks like on the top

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.620 
so here's what it looks like on the top
I'll<00:02:23.110> just<00:02:23.260> put<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.500> down<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:25.450> that

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
I'll just put that down just like that

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.759 
I'll just put that down just like that
and<00:02:25.959> then<00:02:26.830> you're<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.700> simply<00:02:28.269> going<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:31.769> go

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
and then you're just simply going to go

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.910 
and then you're just simply going to go
like<00:02:32.950> that

losing my brain okay that's it and then

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.630 
losing my brain okay that's it and then
we're<00:02:55.319> going<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.500> put<00:02:55.650> these<00:02:55.770> two<00:02:56.069> screws<00:02:56.370> back

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.949 
we're going to put these two screws back
in<00:02:57.140> pretty<00:02:58.140> simple<00:03:02.540> after<00:03:03.540> we<00:03:03.630> have<00:03:03.780> this

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
in pretty simple after we have this

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.390 
in pretty simple after we have this
thing<00:03:04.140> laid<00:03:04.290> on<00:03:04.440> there<00:03:04.620> there<00:03:04.890> really<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.250> not

thing laid on there there really is not

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.710 
thing laid on there there really is not
rocket<00:03:05.819> science<00:03:06.030> just<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.180> little<00:03:06.360> line<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.660> up

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
rocket science just a little line it up

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.160 
rocket science just a little line it up
so<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.959> screws<00:03:07.200> going<00:03:07.500> that's<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:09.170> we're

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
so the screws going that's it and we're

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.360 
so the screws going that's it and we're
about<00:03:11.010> halfway<00:03:11.340> done<00:03:12.530> okay<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:13.860> here's<00:03:14.310> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
about halfway done okay so here's the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.470 
about halfway done okay so here's the
other<00:03:14.730> screw<00:03:15.470> pretty<00:03:16.470> simple<00:03:16.770> stuff<00:03:17.480> all

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
other screw pretty simple stuff all

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.820 
other screw pretty simple stuff all
right<00:03:18.510> hopefully<00:03:18.930> this<00:03:19.080> demystifies<00:03:19.800> the

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
right hopefully this demystifies the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.410 
right hopefully this demystifies the
process<00:03:20.070> for<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.580> lot<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.760> people<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.030> know<00:03:21.150> what

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
process for a lot of people to know what

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.810 
process for a lot of people to know what
what<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.350> deal<00:03:22.530> here<00:03:22.680> pretty<00:03:23.310> simple<00:03:23.670> and

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
what is the deal here pretty simple and

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.140 
what is the deal here pretty simple and
now<00:03:23.970> we<00:03:24.030> have<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.870> clicker<00:03:25.110> on<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.500> bottom

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
now we have the clicker on the bottom

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.400 
now we have the clicker on the bottom
right<00:03:27.150> like<00:03:27.360> it's<00:03:27.510> supposed<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.780> function<00:03:27.959> we

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
right like it's supposed to function we

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.670 
right like it's supposed to function we
have<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.709> home<00:03:28.890> wing<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.970> now<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.840> attaching

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
have the home wing and now the attaching

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.040 
have the home wing and now the attaching
cable<00:03:32.100> now<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.519> can<00:03:32.640> attach<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.209> back<00:03:33.810> to

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
cable now you can attach this back to

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.190 
cable now you can attach this back to
the<00:03:34.170> digitizer<00:03:34.590> plug<00:03:35.489> this<00:03:35.970> end<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.569> inside

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
the digitizer plug this end of it inside

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.460 
the digitizer plug this end of it inside
of<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.410> motherboard<00:03:37.680> here<00:03:38.900> where<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.230> other

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
of the motherboard here where the other

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.830 
of the motherboard here where the other
one<00:03:40.800> is<00:03:41.069> plugged<00:03:41.640> in<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:42.090> just<00:03:42.300> have<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.540> lift

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
one is plugged in you just have to lift

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.949 
one is plugged in you just have to lift
up<00:03:43.080> with<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:44.600> plastic<00:03:45.600> tool<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:48.300> small<00:03:48.660> little

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
up with a plastic tool the small little

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.630 
up with a plastic tool the small little
component<00:03:49.470> right<00:03:49.620> here<00:03:49.799> small<00:03:50.340> little

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
component right here small little

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.020 
component right here small little
plastic<00:03:51.540> thing<00:03:51.720> see<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.350> then<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.640> can

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
plastic thing see and then you can

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.330 
plastic thing see and then you can
proceed<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:56.150> pull<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.299> out<00:03:57.769> see<00:03:58.769> just<00:03:59.130> pulled

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
proceed to pull it out see just pulled

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.319 
proceed to pull it out see just pulled
it<00:03:59.430> up<00:03:59.519> that's<00:03:59.850> how<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.000> do<00:04:00.090> it
