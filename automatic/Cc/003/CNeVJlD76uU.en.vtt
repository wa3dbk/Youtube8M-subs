game I loved world at war zombies but

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.370 
game I loved world at war zombies but

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
personally black ops zombies for me at

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.960 
personally black ops zombies for me at
least<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> letdown<00:01:11.130> compared<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> World

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
least was a letdown compared to World

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.550 
least was a letdown compared to World
War<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.270> didn't<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.689> maps<00:01:12.960> too<00:01:13.170> much<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
War I didn't like the maps too much and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.780 
War I didn't like the maps too much and
there<00:01:13.740> seemed<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.159> lot<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.400> unnecessary

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
there seemed to be a lot of unnecessary

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.179 
there seemed to be a lot of unnecessary
equipment<00:01:15.420> perks<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.259> bosses<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.860> whatnot

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
equipment perks and bosses and whatnot

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.950 
equipment perks and bosses and whatnot
in<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.369> game<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.360> first<00:01:18.540> thing<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.780> wanted

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
in the game but the first thing I wanted

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.749 
in the game but the first thing I wanted
to<00:01:19.020> say<00:01:19.110> about<00:01:19.350> black<00:01:19.560> ops<00:01:19.799> 2<00:01:19.979> zombies<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.490> make

gameplay I'm not saying that I don't
rape<00:02:19.290> train<00:02:19.560> anymore<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.160> that's<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.520> my

rape train anymore but that's just my

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.310 
rape train anymore but that's just my
opinion<00:02:20.700> on<00:02:21.120> rape<00:02:21.300> training<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.810> doesn't<00:02:22.140> make

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
opinion on rape training it doesn't make

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.350 
opinion on rape training it doesn't make
it<00:02:22.740> doesn't<00:02:23.040> allow<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.670> good<00:02:23.850> players<00:02:24.060> to

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
it doesn't allow the good players to

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.940 
it doesn't allow the good players to
shine<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.840> show<00:02:24.990> their<00:02:25.170> full<00:02:25.320> potential<00:02:25.680> i

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
shine and show their full potential i

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.290 
shine and show their full potential i
want<00:02:26.130> them<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.490> coming<00:02:26.820> from<00:02:26.940> like<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
want them to be coming from like the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.810 
want them to be coming from like the
floors<00:02:27.740> ripping<00:02:28.740> on<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> floor<00:02:29.220> boards<00:02:29.640> the

floors ripping on a floor boards the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.670 
floors ripping on a floor boards the
ground<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.510> windows<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.080> stealing<00:02:31.500> like

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
ground the windows and stealing like

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.500 
ground the windows and stealing like
maniacs<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.490> i<00:02:32.670> would<00:02:33.000> actually<00:02:33.330> have<00:02:33.480> to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
maniacs so i would actually have to

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.210 
maniacs so i would actually have to
watch<00:02:33.840> my<00:02:34.080> back<00:02:34.110> when<00:02:34.530> i'm<00:02:34.620> playing<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.040> game

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
watch my back when i'm playing the game

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.430 
watch my back when i'm playing the game
rather<00:02:35.730> than<00:02:35.880> actually<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:36.840> having<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.230> run

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
rather than actually just having to run

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.930 
rather than actually just having to run
backwards<00:02:37.980> without<00:02:38.340> having<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.670> worry<00:02:38.850> about

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
backwards without having to worry about

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.690 
backwards without having to worry about
people<00:02:39.510> or<00:02:39.870> zombies<00:02:40.470> coming<00:02:40.980> at<00:02:41.190> me<00:02:41.340> from<00:02:41.610> a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
people or zombies coming at me from a

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.700 
people or zombies coming at me from a

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
different angle I mean a lot of the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.440 
different angle I mean a lot of the
players<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.130> shine<00:02:44.370> who<00:02:44.610> are<00:02:44.700> really<00:02:45.000> good<00:02:45.030> and

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
players to shine who are really good and

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.360 
players to shine who are really good and
it<00:02:46.140> would<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.290> really<00:02:46.500> fun<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.860> see<00:02:47.100> who's

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.730 
all maps to be a challenge i don't want
some<00:05:35.940> easy<00:05:36.150> ones<00:05:36.420> like<00:05:36.720> ascension<00:05:37.110> was<00:05:37.440> way

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
some easy ones like ascension was way

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.340 
some easy ones like ascension was way
too<00:05:37.800> easy<00:05:38.010> the<00:05:38.340> map<00:05:38.490> was<00:05:38.670> huge<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.450> no<00:05:39.930> zombie

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
too easy the map was huge and no zombie

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.950 
too easy the map was huge and no zombie
spawned<00:05:40.620> that<00:05:40.740> map<00:05:40.980> would<00:05:41.130> have<00:05:41.250> been<00:05:41.340> amazing

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
spawned that map would have been amazing

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.810 
spawned that map would have been amazing
if<00:05:42.960> um<00:05:43.530> if<00:05:44.960> more<00:05:45.960> zombies<00:05:46.380> spawned<00:05:46.680> or<00:05:47.010> if<00:05:47.400> they

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
if um if more zombies spawned or if they

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.670 
if um if more zombies spawned or if they
came<00:05:48.030> from<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.480> every<00:05:48.960> angle<00:05:49.290> pretty<00:05:49.560> much

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
came from the every angle pretty much

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.230 
came from the every angle pretty much
like<00:05:49.890> I<00:05:49.980> said<00:05:50.220> earlier<00:05:50.370> I<00:05:50.640> want<00:05:50.910> them<00:05:51.030> to<00:05:51.150> be

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
like I said earlier I want them to be

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.760 
like I said earlier I want them to be
like<00:05:51.420> dropping<00:05:51.900> down<00:05:52.230> from<00:05:52.290> the<00:05:52.620> ceiling

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
like dropping down from the ceiling

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.920 
like dropping down from the ceiling
ripping<00:05:53.250> out<00:05:53.370> of<00:05:53.490> floorboards<00:05:54.180> just<00:05:54.720> coming

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
ripping out of floorboards just coming

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.040 
ripping out of floorboards just coming
behind<00:05:55.170> me<00:05:55.470> all<00:05:55.980> angles<00:05:56.730> unexpected<00:05:57.570> ways<00:05:57.810> and

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
behind me all angles unexpected ways and

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.830 
behind me all angles unexpected ways and
whatnot<00:05:58.350> but<00:05:58.620> that's<00:05:59.610> pretty<00:05:59.790> much<00:05:59.910> part<00:06:00.450> 1<00:06:00.660> I

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
whatnot but that's pretty much part 1 I

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.900 
whatnot but that's pretty much part 1 I
might<00:06:01.110> have<00:06:01.320> a<00:06:01.350> part<00:06:01.620> 2<00:06:01.740> not<00:06:01.950> guaranteed<00:06:02.430> if<00:06:02.790> I

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
might have a part 2 not guaranteed if I

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.660 
might have a part 2 not guaranteed if I
think<00:06:03.120> with<00:06:03.270> more<00:06:03.600> zombie<00:06:04.230> ideas<00:06:04.590> I<00:06:04.800> might

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
think with more zombie ideas I might

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.880 
think with more zombie ideas I might
have<00:06:05.790> a<00:06:05.820> part<00:06:06.060> 2<00:06:06.210> for<00:06:06.480> zombies<00:06:06.810> but<00:06:07.290> there

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
have a part 2 for zombies but there

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.430 
have a part 2 for zombies but there
probably<00:06:08.280> will<00:06:08.850> be<00:06:08.910> a<00:06:09.360> part<00:06:09.840> 2<00:06:09.930> for<00:06:10.320> my

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
probably will be a part 2 for my

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.830 
probably will be a part 2 for my
