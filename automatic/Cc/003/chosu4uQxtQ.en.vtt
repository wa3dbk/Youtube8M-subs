00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.650 
Bowser jr. are likely to come back as
well<00:01:28.050> so<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.380> makes<00:01:28.560> 16<00:01:29.119> -<00:01:30.119> more<00:01:30.270> likely

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
well so that makes 16 - more likely

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.389 
well so that makes 16 - more likely
characters<00:01:31.080> Rosalina<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.800> dried<00:01:32.160> bones

characters Rosalina and dried bones

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.570 
characters Rosalina and dried bones
would<00:01:32.670> make<00:01:32.850> 18<00:01:33.479> add<00:01:33.950> dry<00:01:34.950> Bowser

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
would make 18 add dry Bowser

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.580 
would make 18 add dry Bowser
did<00:01:35.759> he<00:01:35.880> call<00:01:36.060> King<00:01:36.539> Boo<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.960> middle<00:01:37.200> Mario

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
did he call King Boo and middle Mario

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.160 
did he call King Boo and middle Mario
now<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.789> 22<00:01:39.270> characters<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.840> our<00:01:39.960> roster

now I have 22 characters on our roster

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.590 
now I have 22 characters on our roster
these<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.280> likely<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.880> back<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.210> well<00:01:42.420> so

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
these are likely to be back as well so

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270 
these are likely to be back as well so
that<00:01:42.750> would<00:01:42.869> leave<00:01:43.050> room<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.289> 7<00:01:43.770> newcomers

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that would leave room for 7 newcomers

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.889 
that would leave room for 7 newcomers
there<00:01:44.429> a<00:01:44.580> Tiffany's<00:01:45.030> lock<00:01:45.270> counting<00:01:45.660> with<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
there a Tiffany's lock counting with the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.200 
there a Tiffany's lock counting with the
rest<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.289> roster<00:01:46.710> since<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.850> Mario

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
rest of the roster since this is Mario

rest of the roster since this is Mario
Kart<00:01:48.479> 8<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.020> think<00:01:49.500> eight<00:01:49.710> newcomers<00:01:50.369> would<00:01:50.549> be

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
Kart 8 I think eight newcomers would be

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.149 
Kart 8 I think eight newcomers would be
perfect<00:01:51.150> for<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.420> game<00:01:51.799> let's<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.070> we

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
perfect for this game let's see what we

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.020 
perfect for this game let's see what we
can<00:01:53.250> come<00:01:53.369> up<00:01:53.520> with

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
can come up with

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.179 
can come up with
first<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.689> all<00:01:54.750> toadsworth<00:01:55.259> has<00:01:55.650> surprisingly

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
first of all toadsworth has surprisingly

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.640 
first of all toadsworth has surprisingly
never<00:01:56.490> raced<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.970> Mario<00:01:57.299> Kart<00:01:57.360> before<00:01:57.930> he

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
never raced in Mario Kart before he

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.590 
never raced in Mario Kart before he
appeared<00:01:58.920> as<00:01:59.070> an<00:01:59.159> NPC<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.759> double<00:02:00.090> dash<00:02:00.270> but

never<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> racer<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.310> means<00:02:02.490> he<00:02:02.610> may<00:02:02.759> be

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
never as a racer so that means he may be

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.780
