00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.310
 i wish that grandfather help me 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.930
 Would you you should not ask for it 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.310
 ask 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.720
 why not I do not understand that 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:53.320
 just need to mention the treasure 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:55.389
 he goes to the blanket baby yours 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.010
 Grandfather himself was once the gold 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:02.320
 fever is over, you know why 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:05.350
 It is about 30 years since he was born 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.300
 first time drove by the gold and from there 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.020
 he was at day and night behind these 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.910
 stupid darling really and he has 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.200
 also solved the riddle except for the 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.300
 last rows 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.860
 he has to exhaustion 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.479
 Fiddled and then he had to 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.180
 admit that he can not do it 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.130
 and since that time genie one needs 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.169
 to mention the gold of the ancient romano 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.960
 and he's on the ceiling like you 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.970
 now that should probably explain a lot 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.700
 we'll be late , we'll keep going 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.430
 black too late where to dance treasure 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.539
 We said it yesterday 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.250
 probably thoughtful 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:43.060
 to be 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:44.740
 Martelly gets rid of her that's us 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.000
 adult and the boys went here 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.130
 fight together 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.260
 this is a small town clearly everyone 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.830
 his extra sausage will have our dancing 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.210
 to offer something young and old 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.250
 but probably not me 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.669
 I'm surprised all the boys go here 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.270
 dancing meeting, for example, still has 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:05.500
 never missed 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:07.900
 Oh really well if that is so common 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.070
 I can not say no I need 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.070
 only a few minutes okay 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.139
 in a barn 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:36.520
 i want to run this kind of music 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:36.520
 do you know what will happen
