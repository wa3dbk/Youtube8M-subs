00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
we can see here let's just pop this one

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.580 
we can see here let's just pop this one
off<00:00:50.899> so<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.140> read<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.649> little<00:00:52.920> bit<00:00:53.070> easier

let's<00:02:08.489> take<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> quick<00:02:08.880> look<00:02:09.179> here<00:02:09.239> at<00:02:09.860> this

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
let's take a quick look here at this

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.000 
let's take a quick look here at this
little<00:02:11.610> case<00:02:11.910> here<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:13.019> you<00:02:13.230> can<00:02:13.380> see<00:02:13.410> have

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
little case here so you can see have

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.339 
little case here so you can see have
like<00:02:14.250> cool<00:02:14.790> exploit<00:02:15.209> them<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.569> look<00:02:15.690> no<00:02:16.080> maybe

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
like cool exploit them and look no maybe

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.949 
like cool exploit them and look no maybe
not<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.950> very<00:02:17.430> cool<00:02:17.730> pattern<00:02:18.209> here<00:02:18.569> on<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
not but a very cool pattern here on the

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.020 
not but a very cool pattern here on the
inside<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:20.130> see<00:02:20.310> here<00:02:20.519> it's<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.880> take

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
inside the see here it's going to take

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.259 
inside the see here it's going to take
it<00:02:21.180> off<00:02:21.269> yes<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.459> frozen<00:02:23.819> kind<00:02:24.150> of

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
it off yes so this is frozen kind of

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.559 
it off yes so this is frozen kind of
silicon<00:02:24.750> layer<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:29.400> can<00:02:29.430> see<00:02:29.700> there<00:02:30.150> we<00:02:30.420> have

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
silicon layer you can see there we have

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.199 
silicon layer you can see there we have
