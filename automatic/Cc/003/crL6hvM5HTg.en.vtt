00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.820
 hello to all the guys who came here in 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.740
 third episode of childhood games 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.289
 I think you can hear me from now on 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.330
 better because I'm using the 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.680
 voice recording to stereo then 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.779
 it should be a right and a 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.000
 left so it is not mono and stereo 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.130
 so i hope it feels even better and 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.679
 let's start with the video today I went to 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.300
 gamestop of my country while watching 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.250
 among the shelves the games they are 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.070
 out and which must still go out I 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.050
 having seen this title chasing humans there 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.570
 fury of the furious as soon as I saw the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.300
 cover where the character is 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.120
 looks like easter with my feet came into me 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.890
 the first right chapter 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.260
 all humans that would be precisely the 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.930
 english version english names to kutcher 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.540
 Italianized human should be the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.580
 destruction of humans or something of the 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.040
 kind not to human hunters than cabbage 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.520
 of title is one of the few titles that it is 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.530
 really hate that they go into italian 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.720
 weirdness we still leave the game 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.330
 lose the irrepressible of the name e 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.600
 let us base ourselves on the right game io 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.030
 humans is a game he discovered by chance 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.100
 practically one day I bought one 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.680
 magazine of the official magazine of the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.990
 xbox and as usual we find the 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.030
 disc that contained some theme between 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.640
 these demos were the game 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.640
 right all humans and I liked it that way 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.740
 so much but so much that I had to 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.020
 force to get it looking long e 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.820
 off real proxy and I am not 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.159
 basically completed around one hundred 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.090
 percent bonus weapons bonus levels 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.460
 Initial secondary was a game indeed it is 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.040
 a game that still persists in the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.780
 my memory a beautiful game one 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.380
 of the best of the best of mine 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.020
 childhood 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.970
 if I remember correctly this game is based 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.690
 on 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.060
 movie of aliens from the 50s 40 torrent 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.690
 this the game point starts with one 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.490
 intro that computerized but refers 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.860
 to a film in fact at the same scene 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.119
 now I can't say which signatures but during 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.130
 the video that I do a little to see 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.110
 basically this game is based on 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.000
 40s and 50s that talks about an alien who 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.690
 with his flying saucer and whistled 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.720
 on earth precisely in area 51 o 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.060
 similar rica mind after this alien 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.550
 crashes and remain unto the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.680
 humans kill it shine to do 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.140
 of experiments and stuff like that here 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.240
 we want to say the leader of the aliens 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.310
 revenge you want more information 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.230
 on this fallen alien because not not 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.480
 he can contact him like this when 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.090
 another lien on earth and the alien 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.520
 punto does everything to find out where 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.920
 it is precisely this line that has fallen 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.590
 silos or explanation so done a little 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.050
 the cabbage however is really a plot is 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.140
 already disappointment because, as I said, it seems to me 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.090
 is based on a film but it is really a lot 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.400
 exciting because usually we are 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.170
 the humans who fight the aliens don't 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.180
 aliens fight humans the game 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.250
 despite the traits a serious topic 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.959
 that the earth is attacked by 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.600
 an alien that makes a killing 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.650
 well it is told quite ironic there 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.660
 many funny scenes are many scenes that 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.650
 indeed they make you laugh or some 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.250
 bad words 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.230
 a game not recommended for children but 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.989
 I played beaver creek and enjoyed it 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.580
 above all because I am the animals 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.680
 in the sense it doesn't happen badly you don't 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.170
 enough then we had one 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.370
 Wimp culminating's just who 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.400
 the enemies were integrated 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.200
 now I had a preferred level and it was 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.549
 that of the peasant now I do not know if it 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.680
 I find it because our using 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.299
 gameplay me and mine is this farmer 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.470
 obviously like all the sops that 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.720
 respect each other 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.890
 these animals were from animals 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.200
 right there disintegrates but every time 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.260
 let's see a cow or do it 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.030
 fly or is 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.159
 integral tease gun I do not remember 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.769
 with more what it's called and then be able to 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.420
 integrate minutes and then I had fun then 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.280
 I saw the humans attacking me all 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.379
 he integrated himself to take a record 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.540
 flying because then it was like a 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.940
 little mention if then there was very 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.099
 casinos arrived the military and then yes 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.470
 comes a thing of waves majestic agents 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.169
 which made me think it seems to me 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.510
 majestic brands about majestic 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.050
 morning did the majestic do not see it 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.690
 anyway, be majestic people 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.510
 practically they were over pawa in the sense 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.060
 they had armored cars we can say 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.820
 it's also had their own armored 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.070
 those that can robots were just a 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.970
 one of the most difficult things and for 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.010
 because you will kill them all home 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.710
 even lightning guns culminate there 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.320
 because obviously a robot kills itself with 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.850
 lightning the lightning I give you peace was 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.789
 an absurd stuff in fact I am 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.729
 speaking with emphasis because it really was 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.949
 nice then came those moments that 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.080
 I feel pissed because they have so 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.180
 powerful but so powerful that I took 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.039
 flying saucer and I said I'll get you out 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.770
 all happen to you right in you 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.660
 city themes like you can't love a 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.470
 game in which out of the cities makes a 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.960
 flying saucer 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.330
 but then came to the two precisely I'm blog 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.280
 I called to hunt humans who 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.680
 played among other things on playstation 3 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.320
 because I tell you that I had time between 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.500
 a playstation 3 but then sold it e 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.740
 store or bomerano had no crap 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.160
 I don't know I didn't have a serious plot there 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.770
 transmitted emotions in the sense was kind 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.979
 mafia more than anything else there seemed to be a 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.820
 mafia alien ie asking for money for 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.830
 one because 10 but crap they really have 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.139
 ruined one of the most beautiful titles that 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.849
 for me, there have never been worse than cod 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.490
 and nice company and I went to play 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.050
 first of them is not that I am perhaps 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.970
 I grew up it seems to me the story 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.760
 squalid own game that was sharks 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.320
 it really had to be an irony that you didn't 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.159
 it made people laugh but who does it just said 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.740
 drop your arms 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:03.380
 if you liked this title this 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.740
 I also like putting a nice video on it 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.729
 the Russian one and we talk to each other 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.729
 I give you hello
