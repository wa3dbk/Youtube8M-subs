00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.970
 happy friday beautiful people in the video 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.129
 today where we decided to do something 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.890
 different because something in which we 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.630
 we identify the two is that we are very 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.850
 perfectionists when it comes to 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.080
 youtube so we have several videos 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.849
 that then we like that we 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.339
 we try hard but we do not use 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.169
 because we do not like it for some reason or 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:24.710
 does not have the quality that we would like 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.570
 they had so we decided some of 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.849
 your videos instead of just disappearing 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.949
 those on the face of the earth see what 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.870
 our spouses think what we do 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.379
 when we are putting on makeup so 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.260
 today vic who are going to narrate a 9 thousand 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.910
 tutorials that you do not use to see how it's going to 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.769
 big bets in the comments if 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.929
 they want it to go well or badly and then 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.760
 today I brought them here with me to do 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.670
 this introduction because today is Friday 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.550
 and I want you to relax and I want you to 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.010
 they did not have the best week know that 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.899
 everything will be fine take a break and 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.940
 go ahead I did not have the best 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.070
 week but I know that everything that comes 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.780
 everything that comes is going to be better for 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.949
 you also just repeat it 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.450
 We were going to do very well and good 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.520
 to see what he thinks to see what I do when 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.170
 me maquillo we started making a 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.799
 mental list of our process 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.469
 makeup but before I remembered that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.000
 He made big and he's going to pay me later 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:22.190
 using your finger details the mouth 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.620
 you grab the lightest paint and the 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.900
 parents shows a painting of the size 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.850
 of the hand of five pesos and continues 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.090
 painting your eye on top of what you had 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.049
 painted 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.049
 ah 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.690
 do not forget to spend a lot of time on this already 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.490
 which is the key to smoky eyes 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.220
 then help yourself with a cotonete 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.260
 special fine tip if you do not have a 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.900

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.580
 regular complement and a pencil sharpener and 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.040

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.040

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.320
 start to remove the makeup that already 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.650
 you had put on then you start to 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.630
 hit the face 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.360
 just remember that it's with a sponge 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.000
 now you take out your biggest brush 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.740
 you think I'm doing and you start 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.330
 delineate for this next part 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.580

 tongs as if it were a lobster and if 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.270

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.580
