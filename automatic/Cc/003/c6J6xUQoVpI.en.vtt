00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
a little bit in there at a time and I

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.650 
a little bit in there at a time and I
worked<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.400> my<00:02:11.550> face<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.060> worked<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.510> N

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
worked it in on my face I worked the N

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.350 
worked it in on my face I worked the N
on<00:02:12.780> my

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
on my

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.619 
on my
and<00:02:13.660> what<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.080> did<00:02:14.410> was<00:02:14.650> if<00:02:15.099> I<00:02:15.640> kind<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.330> felt

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
and what I did was if I kind of felt

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.830 
and what I did was if I kind of felt
like<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:17.140> wasn't<00:02:17.739> showing<00:02:18.640> up<00:02:19.000> what<00:02:19.300> wasn't

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
like it wasn't showing up what wasn't

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.320 
like it wasn't showing up what wasn't
looking<00:02:20.319> like<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.800> had<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.190> on<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.640> didn't<00:02:22.120> apply

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
looking like I had it on I didn't apply

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.930 
looking like I had it on I didn't apply
a<00:02:22.629> little<00:02:22.930> bit<00:02:23.080> more<00:02:23.170> darker<00:02:23.769> powder<00:02:23.980> as<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.640> go

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
a little bit more darker powder as I go

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.880 
a little bit more darker powder as I go
the<00:02:25.209> only<00:02:25.599> reason<00:02:26.080> why<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.200> did<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.709> is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
the only reason why I did that is

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.100 
the only reason why I did that is
because<00:02:27.129> it's<00:02:27.610> custom<00:02:28.180> coverage<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:29.050> you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
because it's custom coverage so you

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.680 
because it's custom coverage so you
could<00:02:29.410> make<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.709> as<00:02:29.830> light<00:02:30.190> or<00:02:30.430> as<00:02:30.910> dark<00:02:31.209> as<00:02:31.420> you

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
could make it as light or as dark as you

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.780 
could make it as light or as dark as you
like<00:02:31.900> now<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.500> want<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:32.980> try<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.370> answer<00:02:33.610> a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
like now I want to try and answer a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.309 
like now I want to try and answer a
couple<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.150> questions<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.569> I<00:02:34.690> think<00:02:34.750> you

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319
