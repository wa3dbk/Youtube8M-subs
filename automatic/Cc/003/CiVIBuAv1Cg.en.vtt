00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:39.200
 and quite a practical game that we have 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.000
 done with the selection and well hopefully 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.010
 can serve us for Sunday and be able 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.320
 win if we know we have played and 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.940
 We hope to beat him and we will go with 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.489
 everything to be able to beat that team 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.400
 also the one who scored a goal but the 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.920
 Sunday to be able to put that class much more 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.789
 of matches we need 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.089
 and learn little by little to give us 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.640
 realize that what we lack and what is good 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.500
 is that we have turned the marker and 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.360
 we have obtained a positive result for 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.040
 us exactly as you gave 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.190
 account there are several girls who have missed 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.909
 in this match for the injuries 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.430
 they had but we are trying to 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.920
 accommodate us little by little power this 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.900
 for planting the posts of the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.000
 compaÃ±eras that are mentioned for 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.730
 to get right to Sunday's game 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.860
 and they got another positive result for 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.190
 go adding little by little really not 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.200
 a lot because what little we've seen is 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.010
 which is a new team that is just 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.440
 starting there are several teams that have 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.450
 won by a greater number of goals 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.119
 then the same thing we are going to do 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.140
 but without belittling the rival try to 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.660
 make them the goals you can and be able to 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.660
 get a positive and good result in 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.119
 truth this now with these casualties that 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.710
 we have in the team concentrating and 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.790
 training well this preparation 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.759
 this game that we have had with the 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.890
 selection for the before to the Sunday and 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.200
 preparing and watching the team as 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.180
 It was how it arrives and good more than anything 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.310
 field work and structures 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.620
 what do we do really good 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.180
 it's good how everything is sad for the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.760
 eyes that we have had in the championship 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.010
 but 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.810
 I think we 're all a team and I think 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.709
 that we can take on this challenge because 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.799
 there are girls who can also give in the 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.090
 field and I think it's good to wait 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.459
 also to the girls who are in this 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.200
 that are bad and hopefully recover 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.370
 it seemed to bring more than all the uvi 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.560
 to get the three points out of each 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.230
 clear party always giving everything in the 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.180
 court helping in the uv the symbol that 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.540
 we have in the chest and good to give everything 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.920
 also here and always this not only 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.720
 in the field outside also that 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.030
 representing university and I think that 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.489
 it is necessary good even if it is for me it is 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.060
 quite big and give everything in the field 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.630
 fact 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.610
 and speaking of the rival in turn that 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.760
 did professor talk about it or do you guys 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.730
 who already know about rivals already know how 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.290
 they play this good team really not 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.400
 we have still had the good thing so 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.380
 least I had the opportunity to speak 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.810
 with the professor the rival that we have 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.459
 right now is Colombia and really 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.080
 this good what we have seen changed 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.650
 everything I've seen changing is a 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.349
 equipment that does not feed is not so much 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.459
 at a level that compared to the profit that 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:33.380
 we have had better matches but 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.780
 do not underestimate de facto but colombia 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.430
 it remains is still a team at 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.269
 that we have to get him out 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.269
 three points per day
