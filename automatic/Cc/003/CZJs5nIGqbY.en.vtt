hundred<00:04:09.560> bucks<00:04:09.709> less<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.340> then<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:10.970> would<00:04:11.090> go

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
hundred bucks less and then you would go

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.610

and maybe play the games to me just make
so<00:04:39.500> much<00:04:39.620> sense<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:40.010> would<00:04:40.160> help<00:04:40.310> with<00:04:40.430> both

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
so much sense it would help with both

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.330 
so much sense it would help with both
selling<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.510> Wii<00:04:41.660> U<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.140> 3ds<00:04:42.410> now<00:04:42.920> the<00:04:42.980> Wii<00:04:43.190> U

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.100 
selling the Wii U and 3ds now the Wii U
gamepad<00:04:43.820> maybe<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.060> little<00:04:44.420> bit<00:04:44.540> more<00:04:44.690> powerful

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
gamepad maybe a little bit more powerful

that new Nintendo 30s came function with

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.880 
that new Nintendo 30s came function with
that<00:04:55.430> Wii<00:04:55.730> U<00:04:55.910> technology<00:04:56.780> is<00:04:56.930> too<00:04:57.410> much<00:04:57.620> it's

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
that Wii U technology is too much it's

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:58.540 
that Wii U technology is too much it's
too<00:04:57.920> powerful

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
too powerful

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.280 
too powerful
I<00:04:58.700> don't<00:04:59.030> know<00:04:59.150> but<00:04:59.360> Nintendo<00:04:59.480> even<00:05:00.230> though

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
I don't know but Nintendo even though

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.480 
I don't know but Nintendo even though
they've<00:05:00.410> made<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:00.680> couple<00:05:00.860> slip-ups<00:05:01.220> ain't

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
they've made a couple slip-ups ain't

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.990 
they've made a couple slip-ups ain't
stupid

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
stupid

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.450 
stupid
so<00:05:02.390> I<00:05:02.720> wouldn't<00:05:03.020> be<00:05:03.080> surprised<00:05:03.440> if<00:05:03.770> it<00:05:04.160> wasn't

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
so I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.490 
so I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't
able<00:05:04.580> to<00:05:04.730> do<00:05:04.820> it<00:05:04.940> or<00:05:05.120> at<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:05.600> very<00:05:05.630> least<00:05:06.020> if

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
able to do it or at the very least if

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.050 
able to do it or at the very least if
there<00:05:06.680> ain't<00:05:06.860> some<00:05:07.010> kind<00:05:07.190> of<00:05:07.220> cartridge<00:05:07.850> or

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
there ain't some kind of cartridge or

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.760 
there ain't some kind of cartridge or
adapter<00:05:08.540> that<00:05:08.660> you<00:05:08.780> can<00:05:08.900> put<00:05:09.080> into<00:05:09.230> it<00:05:09.410> that

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
adapter that you can put into it that

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.620 
adapter that you can put into it that
would<00:05:10.130> make<00:05:10.190> it<00:05:10.580> where<00:05:10.730> it<00:05:10.820> could<00:05:10.910> read<00:05:11.150> the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
would make it where it could read the

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.080 
would make it where it could read the
Wii<00:05:11.810> U<00:05:11.990> and<00:05:12.020> be<00:05:12.320> compatible<00:05:12.860> but<00:05:13.760> of<00:05:13.850> course

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
Wii U and be compatible but of course

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.640 
Wii U and be compatible but of course
you<00:05:14.240> know<00:05:14.360> Nintendo<00:05:14.810> they<00:05:14.900> only<00:05:15.050> tell<00:05:15.380> nobody

secret
regi<00:05:17.360> ain't<00:05:17.630> talking<00:05:17.930> but<00:05:18.290> so<00:05:18.560> we<00:05:18.710> don't<00:05:18.890> know

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
regi ain't talking but so we don't know

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.160 
regi ain't talking but so we don't know
so<00:05:19.490> but<00:05:19.670> I'm<00:05:19.760> just<00:05:19.940> wondering<00:05:20.660> if<00:05:20.870> that's<00:05:21.020> just

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
so but I'm just wondering if that's just

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.360 
so but I'm just wondering if that's just
something<00:05:21.410> that<00:05:21.530> could<00:05:21.860> possibly<00:05:22.160> see

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
something that could possibly see

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.740 
something that could possibly see
happening<00:05:22.790> in<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:22.970> future<00:05:23.090> and<00:05:23.240> if<00:05:23.390> it<00:05:23.480> is<00:05:23.600> I

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
happening in the future and if it is I

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.640 
happening in the future and if it is I
think<00:05:23.930> it's<00:05:24.050> a<00:05:24.110> great<00:05:24.260> idea

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
think it's a great idea

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.870 
think it's a great idea
because<00:05:24.950> that's<00:05:25.100> what<00:05:25.250> Sony<00:05:25.490> trying<00:05:25.730> to<00:05:25.790> do

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
because that's what Sony trying to do

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.000 
because that's what Sony trying to do
with<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.390> PS<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.080> Vita<00:05:27.260> and<00:05:27.500> only

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
with the PS and the Vita and only

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.830 
with the PS and the Vita and only
problem<00:05:28.220> with<00:05:28.340> that<00:05:28.430> was<00:05:28.670> no<00:05:29.330> one<00:05:29.450> had<00:05:29.600> a<00:05:29.630> Vita

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
problem with that was no one had a Vita

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.480 
problem with that was no one had a Vita
but<00:05:30.080> people<00:05:30.290> had<00:05:30.440> 3d<00:05:30.770> s's<00:05:31.070> or<00:05:31.190> at<00:05:31.280> least<00:05:31.430> they

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
but people had 3d s's or at least they

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.430 
but people had 3d s's or at least they
