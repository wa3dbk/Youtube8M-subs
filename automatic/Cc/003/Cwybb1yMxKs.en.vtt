and just really being able to just let

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.060 
and just really being able to just let
my<00:01:11.670> hair<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:12.240> free<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> reason

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
my hair be free and that is the reason

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.969 
my hair be free and that is the reason
why<00:01:14.369> I've<00:01:14.760> revisited<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.049> water<00:01:16.259> only<00:01:16.500> method

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
why I've revisited the water only method

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.249 
why I've revisited the water only method
I've<00:01:17.100> looked<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.640> more<00:01:18.390> information<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
I've looked up more information and

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.010 
I've looked up more information and
tried<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.150> delve<00:01:21.150> into<00:01:21.509> water

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
tried to like really delve into water

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.170 
tried to like really delve into water
and<00:01:22.290> limit<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.860> them<00:01:22.950> figure<00:01:23.340> out<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.759> method

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and limit for them figure out a method

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.580 
and limit for them figure out a method
that<00:01:24.540> would<00:01:24.720> work<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.200> me

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that would work for me

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.060 
that would work for me
so<00:01:26.420> when<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> first<00:01:27.840> started<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.470> water<00:01:28.650> only

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
so when I first started the water only

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.910 
so when I first started the water only
method<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.700> told<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> few<00:01:30.720> videos<00:01:30.840> back<00:01:31.290> but

months post picture so had it be natural
very<00:01:39.420> long<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> first<00:01:40.590> two<00:01:40.799> months<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.220> was

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
very long so the first two months I was

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.569 
very long so the first two months I was
just<00:01:41.490> using<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.060> know<00:01:42.659> normal<00:01:43.579> conditioners

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
just using you know normal conditioners

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.910 
just using you know normal conditioners
and<00:01:44.790> shampoos<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.600> then<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> products<00:01:46.200> then

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and shampoos and then the products then

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.370 
and shampoos and then the products then
I<00:01:47.040> thought<00:01:47.280> about<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:47.820> fully<00:01:48.720> natural<00:01:48.960> with

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
I thought about going fully natural with

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.870 
I thought about going fully natural with
my

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
my

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.920 
my
so<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.580> month<00:01:52.759> of<00:01:52.909> January<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:53.600> learned

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
so in the month of January I learned

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.830 
so in the month of January I learned
water<00:01:54.229> only<00:01:54.500> for<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.920> month<00:01:55.130> I<00:01:55.460> found<00:01:56.390> it<00:01:56.600> very

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
water only for the month I found it very

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.630 
water only for the month I found it very
very<00:01:57.020> hard<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.799> go<00:01:57.950> water<00:01:58.190> only

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
very hard to go water only

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.570 
very hard to go water only
my<00:01:58.909> head<00:01:59.119> was<00:01:59.270> feeling<00:02:00.200> quite<00:02:00.470> dry<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.190> I<00:02:01.340> just

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
my head was feeling quite dry and I just

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.120 
my head was feeling quite dry and I just
didn't<00:02:01.909> feel<00:02:02.000> like<00:02:02.150> it<00:02:02.299> was<00:02:02.360> working<00:02:02.810> for<00:02:02.990> me

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
didn't feel like it was working for me

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.539 
didn't feel like it was working for me
so<00:02:04.130> then<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.700> transitioned<00:02:05.450> over<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:06.020> a

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
so then I transitioned over to a

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.430 
so then I transitioned over to a
all-natural<00:02:07.549> regimen<00:02:08.390> where<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.050> was<00:02:09.289> just

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
all-natural regimen where I was just

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.040

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
using her or products to wash my hair

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
say month or so so it's like been about

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.030 
say month or so so it's like been about
four<00:02:55.100> weeks<00:02:55.810> it's<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.870> past<00:02:57.170> four<00:02:57.470> weeks<00:02:57.500> I

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
four weeks it's the past four weeks I

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.310 
four weeks it's the past four weeks I
have<00:02:58.370> been<00:02:58.579> doing<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.269> water<00:02:59.540> only<00:02:59.959> method

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
have been doing the water only method

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.430 
have been doing the water only method
only<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.070> revisited<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.180> idea<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.380> think

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
only I revisited the idea and I think

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.830 
only I revisited the idea and I think
it's<00:03:03.709> doing<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.100> lot<00:03:04.370> better<00:03:04.730> now<00:03:05.239> maybe<00:03:05.570> it's

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
it's doing a lot better now maybe it's

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.930 
it's doing a lot better now maybe it's
because<00:03:05.989> I've<00:03:06.890> had<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.130> little<00:03:07.310> bit<00:03:07.489> more<00:03:07.519> time

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
because I've had a little bit more time

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.599 
because I've had a little bit more time
to<00:03:08.049> learn<00:03:09.049> what's<00:03:09.739> going<00:03:10.010> on<00:03:10.100> with<00:03:10.220> my<00:03:10.370> hair

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
to learn what's going on with my hair

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.360 
to learn what's going on with my hair
and<00:03:11.440> maybe<00:03:12.440> it's<00:03:12.620> because<00:03:12.769> I've<00:03:13.010> just<00:03:13.040> like

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
and maybe it's because I've just like

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.569 
and maybe it's because I've just like
not<00:03:13.640> been<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.150> strict<00:03:14.540> with<00:03:14.630> it<00:03:14.840> when<00:03:15.019> I<00:03:15.109> first

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
not been so strict with it when I first

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.530 
not been so strict with it when I first
started<00:03:16.579> out<00:03:16.700> with<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.030> water<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.450> the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
started out with the water and the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.190 
started out with the water and the
method<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:17.959> tried<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.410> in<00:03:18.470> January<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:20.200> just

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
just put an oil on top when I'd finished

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.569 
just put an oil on top when I'd finished

and I wasn't really used to my hair my
hair<00:03:31.609> was<00:03:32.060> very<00:03:32.359> dry<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:33.109> it<00:03:33.200> needed<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.680> little

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
hair was very dry so it needed a little

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.479 
hair was very dry so it needed a little
bit<00:03:34.010> more<00:03:34.070> than<00:03:34.519> just<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:36.140> light<00:03:36.680> oil<00:03:36.980> like

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
bit more than just a light oil like

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.680 
bit more than just a light oil like
coconut<00:03:37.970> oil

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
coconut oil

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.710 
coconut oil

and from using this water only method I

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.110 
and from using this water only method I
use<00:03:41.960> heavier<00:03:42.500> oil<00:03:42.740> like<00:03:43.160> volleyball<00:03:43.820> and<00:03:44.030> it

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
use heavier oil like volleyball and it

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.780 
use heavier oil like volleyball and it
really<00:03:44.390> helps<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.780> keep<00:03:44.900> my<00:03:45.200> hair<00:03:45.410> moisturized
