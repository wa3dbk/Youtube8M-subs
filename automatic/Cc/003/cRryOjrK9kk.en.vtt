00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.340 
that I've driven the car it particularly
into<00:01:41.270> perspective<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.780> I<00:01:41.840> think<00:01:41.869> it<00:01:42.200> will

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
into perspective and I think it will

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.100 
into perspective and I think it will
allow<00:01:43.159> me<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.430> be<00:01:43.640> much<00:01:43.820> more<00:01:44.060> helpful<00:01:44.390> in<00:01:44.840> all

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
allow me to be much more helpful in all

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.870 
allow me to be much more helpful in all
the<00:01:45.229> work<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.500> do<00:01:45.560> for<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.890> team<00:01:46.100> because<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.640> can

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
the work I do for the team because I can

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.880 
the work I do for the team because I can
relate<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.390> much<00:01:47.540> more<00:01:47.840> as<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.410> what<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.710> car

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
relate to much more as to what the car

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.350 
relate to much more as to what the car
is<00:01:48.920> actually<00:01:49.340> like<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.610> drive

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.170 

I<00:01:52.740> think<00:01:53.740> overall<00:01:54.040> I<00:01:54.070> was<00:01:54.250> very<00:01:54.430> lucky<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.850> get

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
I think overall I was very lucky to get

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.080 
I think overall I was very lucky to get
wet<00:01:55.810> running<00:01:56.590> this<00:01:56.710> morning<00:01:56.980> and<00:01:57.430> then<00:01:57.640> 6:00

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
wet running this morning and then 6:00

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.610 
wet running this morning and then 6:00
in<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.270> afternoon<00:01:58.360> when<00:01:59.020> I<00:01:59.050> saw<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.410> weather

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
in the afternoon when I saw the weather

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.410 
in the afternoon when I saw the weather
forecaster<00:02:00.250> today<00:02:00.490> it<00:02:00.550> was<00:02:00.790> expected<00:02:01.330> to

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
forecaster today it was expected to

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.990 
forecaster today it was expected to
enter<00:02:01.720> in<00:02:01.900> so<00:02:02.200> I'm<00:02:02.710> very<00:02:02.920> lucky<00:02:03.040> to<00:02:03.310> have<00:02:03.430> got<00:02:03.970> a

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
enter in so I'm very lucky to have got a

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.610 
enter in so I'm very lucky to have got a
run<00:02:04.180> on<00:02:04.210> slicks<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:04.840> think<00:02:05.080> in<00:02:05.230> some<00:02:05.260> ways

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
run on slicks and I think in some ways

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.350 
run on slicks and I think in some ways
allowing<00:02:06.610> me<00:02:06.730> to<00:02:06.760> start<00:02:07.000> in<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.150> way<00:02:07.240> it's

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
allowing me to start in the way it's

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.820 
allowing me to start in the way it's
allowed<00:02:07.570> me<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.720> build<00:02:07.900> up<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.289> it<00:02:08.320> a<00:02:08.530> little

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
allowed me to build up to it a little

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.200 
allowed me to build up to it a little
bit<00:02:08.920> more<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.340> conditions<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:10.060> morning

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
bit more the conditions this morning

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.820 
bit more the conditions this morning
were<00:02:10.450> quite<00:02:10.660> tricky<00:02:10.929> parts<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.440> track<00:02:11.650> were

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
were quite tricky parts the track were

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.290 
were quite tricky parts the track were
completely<00:02:12.220> dry<00:02:12.460> but<00:02:12.670> other<00:02:12.790> parts<00:02:13.150> were

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
completely dry but other parts were

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.390 
completely dry but other parts were
still<00:02:13.510> quite<00:02:13.690> them<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.710> by<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.890> afternoon<00:02:15.040> it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
still quite them but by the afternoon it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.650 
still quite them but by the afternoon it
was<00:02:15.490> completely<00:02:15.910> dry<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.300> was<00:02:16.420> able<00:02:16.630> to

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
was completely dry and I was able to

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.950 
was completely dry and I was able to
push<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.960> bit<00:02:17.170> harder

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.380 

my<00:02:20.960> biggest<00:02:21.530> feeling<00:02:21.890> was<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.490> have<00:02:22.850> got<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.270> get

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
my biggest feeling was I have got to get

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.700 
my biggest feeling was I have got to get
back<00:02:23.600> in<00:02:23.750> this<00:02:23.870> car<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:24.170> have<00:02:24.350> got<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.620> put

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
back in this car I have got to put

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.740 
back in this car I have got to put
everything<00:02:24.920> in<00:02:25.100> hand<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:26.120> make<00:02:26.300> sure<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.690> I

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
everything in hand to make sure that I

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.310 
everything in hand to make sure that I
get<00:02:26.840> more<00:02:27.140> opportunity<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.770> drive<00:02:28.100> this<00:02:28.250> car
