 in others as 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.579
 fiction for him

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.119
 the housing of a full bag 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.359
 black with white 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.089
 remembering also all the other pieces will follow this pattern of game 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.660

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.880
 three days 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.950
 to be pushed back into the wall 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.950

 six and ten days 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.930
 in three steel bars 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.070
 with the largest number being smaller than the others 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.470
 which we will explain the reason 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.090
 the series 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.090

 the manager for this a product brightness 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.540
 with this system can verify the existence of any 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.110
 script 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.750

 How are we following? 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.340
 for use of finished products if

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.989
 When he arrives 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.459
 the piece having the name involved in that same period was easier for ourselves 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.409
 that is not used 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.409

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:41.519
 not just by a wall 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.900
 thus allowing 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.739

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:18.859
 from back to front 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.509
 breathe the same operation 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:23.609

 he did not come 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:38.100
