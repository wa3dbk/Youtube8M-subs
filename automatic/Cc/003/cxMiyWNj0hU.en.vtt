00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.150
 hello youtube friends how are you waiting 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.509
 that they are fine as I always wish you what 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.190
 best 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.629
 good good now I come with a new 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.490
 tutorial in which I'm going to teach you 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.469
 well since this tutorial I had done it 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.929
 before but now it's going to be more improved and 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.510
 summarized good for a lot for everyone 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.120
 those who tax or download 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.520
 videos either from youtube or etcetera and 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.380
 they want to record it to a divide because many 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.880
 of you or many has happened to you 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.620
 have problems when playing it in a 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.360
 good dvd player i 'm going to 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.340
 teach them how to convert the video 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.129
 downloaded or recorded from a camera 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.440
 to record it and see it in any 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.589
 player of / or on TV with 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.030
 your family and so on etc. and so on 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.710
 good for that we are going to 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.269
 obviously need the video in a 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.339
 certain format in which I have this 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.929
 which is in mp4 format can be in 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:52.879
 abbey can be in rmvb also etcetera 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:55.280
 and now we are going to convert it to 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.160
 divide in this case we're going to need 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.310
 the help of a converter 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.010
 already then now I propose this 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.770
 video or this video does not matter this 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.840
 now I propose this converter 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.250
 video can be anyone really in 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.050
 which only the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.729
 following properties you have the 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.170
 video for example I'm going to put this video 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.610
 let's suppose it's a movie that lasts 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.750
 a lot and there it is in good mp4 format 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.840
 now you buy it in this 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.500
 program or they get it over there and then 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.770
 this one has to be used in this way 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.180
 you go to the profile and go where 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:42.540
 says mpeg-2 ok good mpeg-2 has to 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:45.570
 be the mpeg-2 format with one with one 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.830
 with a low with an audio codec mp of 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.560
 2 mp 2 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.560
 and with a maximum resolution of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:02.290
 720 x 576 with 720 x 480 also with 720 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.660
 570 and it also works with a 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.450
 maximum resolution I propose to leave it to 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.160
 this resolution or that resolution in 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.830
 Any case is the same and I will leave it to 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.200
 is after doing that you go 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.400
 where you assure the codecs by 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.550
 example the audio codec has to 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.650
 be in mp2 ok this does not matter much and 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.020
 then connect video that does not already 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.810
 it matters a lot this is already this is the 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.490
 general way normal video quality 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.160
 normal audio quality and ready now 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.890
 we proceed to obviously I 'm going to put 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.740
 examine I will put in the part where 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.080
 I have things transformed for 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.580
 record and ready ready and we will 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.580
 wait for this to end the 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.100
 conversion 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.380
 already seen cut the video there for 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.440
 speed up the conversion a bit and you're done 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.600
 we have the video now here in here 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.640
 transformed now let's watch the video 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.210
 that's a video that I made 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.480
 there is the video but you too 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.890
 you can see that I may go down 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.890
 a bit the quality because 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.530
 because the true conversion for 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.810
 mpeg-2 in its format in which it requires 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.750
 a lot of bit rate to maintain quality 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.910
 well if the conversion says it's a 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.590
 appears as very blurry or things like that the 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.680
 conversion because you have the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.480
 solution here you have to go to mpeg-2 and 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.240
 raise the amount of bits treats that 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.370
 means that the video will weigh more 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.410
 but there you have to go experimenting 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.880
 for example if I put 1600 quality 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.630
 will go up the quality will keep the 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.430
 more but it's going to start 52 mega if you 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.200
 they put for example 1200 is going to improve a 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.170
 little more quality but despite 40 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.110
 megas because the higher the 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.690
 quality with a vibrato more is going to be going to 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.520
 be the weight why I say this because the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.580
 videos downloaded from youtube either mp4 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:01.459
 I have had the experience since 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.860
 will become mp4 to 292 mpg or low javi 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.680
 video quality by transforming it 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.130
 but I feel that from addis to mpg to or 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.160
 be it from avi divx format to mpg 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.020
 does not lower almost anything the quality could be 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.030
 improve obviously but not low 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.090
 but the most important thing of the resolution 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.560
 you have to have it there today I say it like that 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.870
 well obviously if it's a 7 360 p a 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.290
 downloaded video 360 p then you 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.390
 they can keep it but watch out because 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.990
 I insist because for example there are videos 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.950
 that are in hd you want to tell a 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.670
 permission resolution like this one that I have 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:47.410
 which is a resolution of 700 1280 x 720 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:50.020
 if they managed directly without changing 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.720
 the resolution 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.340
 Do not be paid at all 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.180
 split players are only 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.460
 will see them in the players 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.490
 Blu-ray is not going to look at all 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.960
 dividers ok ok that's 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.389
 all 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.040
 then suppose we already have the 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.660
 transformed video here 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.810
 Now what we are going to do is 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.690
 record it to record it we are going to 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.000
 back for example here I will split data 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.740
 with the express grouper they can also do 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.870
 in any or any recorder 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.889
 has the black express selection in the 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.840
 converted file there mpeg-2 with a 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.570
 resolution with the appropriate resolution of 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.510
 all that and then you go to a like 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.880
 it's a movie that lasts much 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.250
 it weighs a lot they put next and then 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.220
 record at a speed obviously not 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.680
 be so fast because if I'm not going to have 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.100
 problems of the moment of recording says I 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.630
 to prevent any good problem and 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.850
 that's all then they put it record in the 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:56.220
 which now I can not record because I do not 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:58.610
 I have to divide I do not have to divide and ready 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.699
 good good good good 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.520
 the disgrace for having seen my video if 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:06.650
 you have doubts then you can write to me 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.180
 can you write me on facebook 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.400
 if you can add it to facebook you can 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.409
 subscribe to my channel can also 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.520
 I like if this video was useful to you 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:18.620
 and you can follow me on twitter good 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.050
 thanks for watching the video that 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.000
 be careful, take care of anything 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.759
 propose or tutorial that you want that 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.219
 I do then the comments are 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.469
 open for you to tell me there oo 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:32.919
 write me ok take care that you are well 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:32.919
 bye
