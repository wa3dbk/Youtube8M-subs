the heading 678 to 67 but apart from
that<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:22.019> know<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.200> rest<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.530> stats<00:03:22.739> -

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
that you know the rest of the stats -

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.810

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
passing the pace and yet shooting I

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.890 
passing the pace and yet shooting I
think<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.459> said<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.790> they're<00:03:27.510> all<00:03:27.630> pretty

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
think I said that they're all pretty

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.050 
think I said that they're all pretty
similar<00:03:28.110> for<00:03:28.620> all<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.370> predictions<00:03:29.820> so

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
similar for all of the predictions so

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.509 
similar for all of the predictions so
next<00:03:30.540> player<00:03:30.810> we<00:03:31.050> have<00:03:31.080> up<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.769> Gary<00:03:32.400> Schutt

where one of his legs is actually longer
than<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.540> other<00:04:06.690> or<00:04:07.080> you<00:04:07.110> could<00:04:07.290> even<00:04:07.380> say<00:04:07.620> one

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
than the other or you could even say one

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.190 
than the other or you could even say one
leg<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.130> shorter<00:04:08.160> than<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.640> other<00:04:08.730> but<00:04:09.420> he<00:04:10.080> had

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
leg is shorter than the other but he had

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.900 
leg is shorter than the other but he had

insane dribbling so a lot of people said

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.940 
insane dribbling so a lot of people said
that<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.299> actually<00:04:12.630> better<00:04:13.140> not<00:04:13.620> made<00:04:13.799> him

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950

better but you know there's something
different<00:04:15.660> about<00:04:16.200> that

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
different about that

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.860 
different about that
now<00:04:17.130> for<00:04:17.310> most<00:04:17.489> athletes<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:18.269> get<00:04:18.419> through<00:04:18.720> you

defending<00:05:04.580> I<00:05:04.700> don't<00:05:05.090> think<00:05:05.450> a<00:05:05.720> legend<00:05:06.410> would

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
defending I don't think a legend would

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.710 
defending I don't think a legend would
have<00:05:06.950> that<00:05:07.370> low<00:05:07.790> defending<00:05:08.240> I<00:05:08.330> know<00:05:08.450> it's<00:05:08.600> not

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
have that low defending I know it's not

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.170 
have that low defending I know it's not
a<00:05:08.780> in<00:05:09.440> any<00:05:09.950> way<00:05:10.070> shape<00:05:10.280> or<00:05:10.430> form<00:05:10.490> a<00:05:10.730> defender

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
a in any way shape or form a defender

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.090 
a in any way shape or form a defender
but<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.630> just<00:05:11.810> don't<00:05:11.960> see<00:05:12.110> his<00:05:12.560> stats<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:12.980> be

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
but I just don't see his stats to be

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.570 
but I just don't see his stats to be
that<00:05:13.340> low<00:05:13.550> that's<00:05:14.390> just<00:05:14.600> my<00:05:14.840> opinion<00:05:14.930> and

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
that low that's just my opinion and

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.850 
that low that's just my opinion and
anyway<00:05:16.580> let's<00:05:17.180> move<00:05:17.360> on<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:18.140> next<00:05:18.410> player

moment<00:05:57.440> that<00:05:58.160> obviously<00:05:58.640> that<00:05:58.730> won't<00:05:58.820> play

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
moment that obviously that won't play

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.970 
moment that obviously that won't play
any<00:05:59.540> part<00:05:59.870> of<00:05:59.960> his<00:06:00.080> rating<00:06:00.470> overall<00:06:00.800> but

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
any part of his rating overall but

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.140 
any part of his rating overall but
that's<00:06:01.130> just<00:06:01.280> kind<00:06:01.430> of<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:01.580> first<00:06:01.850> thing<00:06:02.060> I

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
that's just kind of the first thing I

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.850 
that's just kind of the first thing I
think<00:06:02.210> of<00:06:02.510> when<00:06:02.720> I<00:06:03.050> think<00:06:03.110> of<00:06:03.380> Maradona

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
think of when I think of Maradona

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.440 
think of when I think of Maradona
exceptional<00:06:04.760> football<00:06:05.030> or<00:06:05.150> I<00:06:05.180> guess<00:06:05.360> you

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
exceptional football or I guess you

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.970 
exceptional football or I guess you
could<00:06:05.630> kind<00:06:05.780> of<00:06:05.870> relate<00:06:05.960> him<00:06:06.290> to<00:06:06.530> a<00:06:06.560> messy

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
could kind of relate him to a messy

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.970 
could kind of relate him to a messy
especially<00:06:07.280> as<00:06:07.880> he's<00:06:08.000> a<00:06:08.030> 94<00:06:08.660> cents<00:06:09.380> he<00:06:09.500> sent<00:06:09.919> a

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
especially as he's a 94 cents he sent a

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.350 
especially as he's a 94 cents he sent a
forward<00:06:10.220> I've<00:06:10.340> only<00:06:10.460> just<00:06:10.550> four<00:06:10.820> thousand<00:06:11.270> in

very<00:06:30.470> very<00:06:30.770> big<00:06:30.980> difference<00:06:31.340> in<00:06:31.490> that<00:06:31.610> I<00:06:31.790> get

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
very very big difference in that I get

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.570 
very very big difference in that I get
to<00:06:32.900> be<00:06:32.990> honest<00:06:33.230> very<00:06:33.350> very<00:06:34.190> big<00:06:34.400> difference

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
to be honest very very big difference

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.520 
to be honest very very big difference
because

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
because

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.890 
because
93<00:06:36.530> is<00:06:36.740> an<00:06:37.039> insane<00:06:37.610> kind<00:06:37.820> of<00:06:37.970> agility<00:06:38.330> kind<00:06:38.810> of

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
93 is an insane kind of agility kind of

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.589 
93 is an insane kind of agility kind of
speed

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
speed

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.419 
speed
whereas<00:06:39.990> 85<00:06:40.499> is<00:06:40.649> just<00:06:40.860> if<00:06:41.009> you<00:06:41.129> get<00:06:41.219> in<00:06:41.309> front

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:41.429 
whereas 85 is just if you get in front

00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:42.769 
whereas 85 is just if you get in front
of<00:06:41.550> the<00:06:41.610> defender<00:06:41.879> if<00:06:42.119> they're<00:06:42.270> quite<00:06:42.479> quick

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:42.779 
of the defender if they're quite quick

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:44.149 
of the defender if they're quite quick
they<00:06:42.990> will<00:06:43.169> start<00:06:43.409> to<00:06:43.499> pull<00:06:43.649> you<00:06:43.740> back<00:06:43.770> so

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 
they will start to pull you back so

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:45.799 
they will start to pull you back so
really<00:06:44.909> does<00:06:44.999> make<00:06:45.179> a<00:06:45.210> difference<00:06:45.270> between

00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:45.809 
really does make a difference between

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:49.609 
really does make a difference between
those<00:06:45.929> two<00:06:46.069> shooting<00:06:47.069> 87-84<00:06:47.999> passing<00:06:48.719> 84<00:06:49.139> 81
