start looking at one of his abilities

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.080 
start looking at one of his abilities
already<00:00:34.980> his<00:00:35.130> second<00:00:35.550> ability<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:36.030> called

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
already his second ability is called

already his second ability is called
teleportation<00:00:36.930> which<00:00:37.020> I'm<00:00:37.170> going<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> be

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
teleportation which I'm going to be

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830 
teleportation which I'm going to be
using<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:37.980> fairly<00:00:38.280> shortly<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.660> does

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
using here fairly shortly what it does

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.540 
using here fairly shortly what it does
is<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.469> sounds<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.129> should<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
is what it sounds like it should do it

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.190 
is what it sounds like it should do it
teleports<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.210> lets<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.540> teleport<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.989> any

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
teleports it lets you teleport to any

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.590 
teleports it lets you teleport to any
place<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:44.100> explored<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> map<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.450> if

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
place that is explored on the map so if

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.150 
place that is explored on the map so if
I<00:00:45.719> try<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.050> target<00:00:46.200> over<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:46.770> which<00:00:47.039> I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
I try and target over here which I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.000 
I try and target over here which I
haven't<00:00:47.370> even<00:00:47.460> seen<00:00:47.730> yet<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.969> can't<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.420> that

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
haven't even seen yet I can't do that

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.590 
haven't even seen yet I can't do that
which<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.039> also<00:00:50.399> similar<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.030> blink<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.480> this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
which is also similar to blink in this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
which is also similar to blink in this
game<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.199> can't<00:00:52.440> blink<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.160> places<00:00:53.550> where<00:00:53.730> you

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
game you can't blink to places where you

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.510 
game you can't blink to places where you
have<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.210> discovered<00:00:54.600> yet

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
have not discovered yet

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.540 
have not discovered yet
so<00:00:56.930> let's<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.320> say<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> want<00:00:58.860> to<00:00:58.980> top<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.370> right

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
so let's just say I want to top or right

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.580 
so let's just say I want to top or right
here<00:00:59.820> you'll<00:01:00.150> see<00:01:00.240> a<00:01:00.390> little<00:01:00.630> bit<00:01:00.840> some<00:01:01.290> trees

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
here you'll see a little bit some trees

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.250 
here you'll see a little bit some trees
spotting<00:01:02.130> right<00:01:02.310> here<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.570> BAM<00:01:04.020> I'm

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
spotting right here and then BAM I'm

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.430 
spotting right here and then BAM I'm
there<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.090> has<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.570> minute<00:01:07.050> cooldown<00:01:07.260> at

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
there so it has a minute cooldown at

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.950 
there so it has a minute cooldown at
level<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.160> they're<00:01:09.060> 50<00:01:09.480> second<00:01:09.780> cooldown

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
level one and they're 50 second cooldown

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.560 
level one and they're 50 second cooldown
at<00:01:10.170> level<00:01:10.410> one<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.800> it's<00:01:10.920> already<00:01:11.190> better<00:01:11.370> than

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
at level one so it's already better than

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.420 
at level one so it's already better than
portal<00:01:12.570> scroll<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.410> only<00:01:13.530> has<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.740> 50<00:01:14.070> mana

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
portal scroll and it only has a 50 mana

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.250 
portal scroll and it only has a 50 mana
cost<00:01:14.670> which<00:01:14.940> again<00:01:15.150> better<00:01:15.570> than<00:01:15.720> town<00:01:15.900> portal

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
cost which again better than town portal

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.779 
cost which again better than town portal

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
yeah okay and his first ability is

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.139 
yeah okay and his first ability is
called<00:01:22.469> sprout<00:01:23.469> what<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.009> does<00:01:24.159> is<00:01:24.340> on<00:01:24.759> it

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
called sprout what it does is on it

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.330 
called sprout what it does is on it
targets<00:01:25.539> the<00:01:25.689> ground<00:01:25.960> and<00:01:26.200> or<00:01:26.409> a<00:01:26.439> target<00:01:26.979> and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
targets the ground and or a target and

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.090 
targets the ground and or a target and
what<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.729> does<00:01:27.909> is<00:01:28.149> that<00:01:28.689> it<00:01:28.929> spawns<00:01:29.770> trees

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
what it does is that it spawns trees

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.309 
what it does is that it spawns trees
around<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.490> for<00:01:30.909> three<00:01:31.569> to<00:01:31.600> five<00:01:31.899> seconds

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
around it for three to five seconds

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.419 
around it for three to five seconds
based<00:01:32.920> on<00:01:33.159> level<00:01:33.869> now<00:01:34.869> that's<00:01:35.829> really

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
based on level now that's really

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.069 
based on level now that's really
important<00:01:36.880> for<00:01:36.939> ganks<00:01:37.509> but<00:01:37.659> it<00:01:37.780> does<00:01:37.929> not

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
important for ganks but it does not

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.559 
important for ganks but it does not
stunned<00:01:38.679> silence<00:01:39.159> or<00:01:39.369> slow<00:01:39.729> in<00:01:39.880> any<00:01:40.090> way<00:01:40.270> shape

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
stunned silence or slow in any way shape

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.120 
stunned silence or slow in any way shape
or<00:01:40.750> form<00:01:40.810> so<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:44.110> kind<00:01:44.409> of<00:01:44.530> that's<00:01:44.979> why

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
or form so it's it's kind of that's why

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.459 
or form so it's it's kind of that's why
the<00:01:45.189> duration<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:45.969> so<00:01:46.119> long<00:01:46.329> because<00:01:46.719> they<00:01:47.259> can

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
the duration is so long because they can

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:48.929 
the duration is so long because they can
still<00:01:47.770> get<00:01:48.069> out<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.459> fairly<00:01:48.700> easily

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
still get out of it fairly easily

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.179 
still get out of it fairly easily
without<00:01:49.420> too<00:01:49.810> many<00:01:50.020> repercussions<00:01:50.799> after

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
without too many repercussions after

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.199 
without too many repercussions after
they<00:01:51.429> get<00:01:51.640> sprouted<00:01:52.200> now<00:01:53.789> his<00:01:54.789> third<00:01:55.000> ability

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
they get sprouted now his third ability

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.779 
they get sprouted now his third ability
is<00:01:55.539> called<00:01:55.689> nature's<00:01:56.470> call<00:01:56.920> what<00:01:57.220> it<00:01:57.340> does<00:01:57.489> is

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
is called nature's call what it does is

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.600 
is called nature's call what it does is
you<00:01:58.090> target<00:01:58.750> an<00:01:58.899> area<00:01:59.200> with<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.619> at<00:02:00.099> least<00:02:00.340> one

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
you target an area with a at least one

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.929 
you target an area with a at least one
tree<00:02:00.849> and<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.239> will<00:02:01.420> spawn<00:02:01.689> as<00:02:02.079> many<00:02:02.770> trends<00:02:03.670> as

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
tree and it will spawn as many trends as

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.440 
tree and it will spawn as many trends as
the<00:02:04.780> level<00:02:05.110> allows<00:02:05.439> so<00:02:06.009> I'm<00:02:06.130> at<00:02:06.489> level<00:02:07.000> four<00:02:07.390> of

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
the level allows so I'm at level four of

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.059 
the level allows so I'm at level four of
this<00:02:07.569> ability<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.259> just<00:02:08.470> want<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.860> pretty

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
this ability and I just want to pretty

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.190 
this ability and I just want to pretty
much<00:02:09.250> target<00:02:09.670> one<00:02:09.880> tree<00:02:10.179> just<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.989> show<00:02:11.049> you

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
much target one tree just to show you

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.330 
much target one tree just to show you
guys<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.829> it<00:02:12.400> will<00:02:12.730> spawn<00:02:13.090> all<00:02:13.299> five<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.500> only

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
guys that it will spawn all five so only

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.210 
guys that it will spawn all five so only
one<00:02:15.640> tree<00:02:15.910> was<00:02:16.120> destroyed<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:16.810> then<00:02:17.590> all<00:02:17.829> five

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
one tree was destroyed and then all five

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.240 
one tree was destroyed and then all five
transports<00:02:19.120> created<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:20.950> great<00:02:21.220> for

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
transports created so this is great for

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.490 
transports created so this is great for
tower<00:02:21.549> pushing<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.090> another<00:02:22.900> thing<00:02:23.139> you<00:02:23.290> can

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
tower pushing and another thing you can

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.400 
tower pushing and another thing you can
do<00:02:23.739> is<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.190> can<00:02:24.220> summon<00:02:24.639> your<00:02:25.329> youth<00:02:26.079> sprout

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
do is you can summon your youth sprout

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.080 
do is you can summon your youth sprout
on<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.709> ground<00:02:26.920> anywhere<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.519> then<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.880> can

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
on the ground anywhere and then you can

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.230 
on the ground anywhere and then you can
just<00:02:28.299> use<00:02:28.510> nature's<00:02:28.900> call

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
just use nature's call

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.470 
just use nature's call
BAM<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:31.290> get<00:02:31.500> more<00:02:31.740> chance<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.880> cooldown

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
BAM you get more chance and the cooldown

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.920 
BAM you get more chance and the cooldown
for<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.490> nature's<00:02:35.490> call<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:36.090> shorter<00:02:36.900> than

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
for the nature's call is shorter than

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.480 
for the nature's call is shorter than
the<00:02:37.830> duration

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
the duration

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.420 
the duration
so<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.150> can<00:02:40.600> spawn<00:02:40.900> more<00:02:41.260> Trent's<00:02:41.830> before<00:02:42.280> the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
so you can spawn more Trent's before the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.300 
so you can spawn more Trent's before the
duration<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.780> transits<00:02:44.200> already<00:02:44.530> up<00:02:44.740> so

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
duration of the transits already up so

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.180 
duration of the transits already up so
let's<00:02:45.550> say<00:02:45.790> if<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.450> just<00:02:46.990> sprout<00:02:47.440> on<00:02:47.710> top<00:02:48.010> of

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
let's say if I just sprout on top of

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.070 
let's say if I just sprout on top of
this<00:02:48.400> creep<00:02:48.790> here<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.450> then

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
this creep here and then

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.370 
this creep here and then
use<00:02:51.770> my<00:02:52.340> matrix<00:02:52.790> call<00:02:53.000> then<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:53.720> will<00:02:54.020> have<00:02:54.200> even

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
use my matrix call then I will have even

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.980 
use my matrix call then I will have even
more<00:02:54.560> trance<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.760> look<00:02:56.000> at<00:02:56.090> all<00:02:56.210> this<00:02:56.360> this<00:02:56.840> is

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
more trance so look at all this this is

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.850 
more trance so look at all this this is
ridiculous<00:02:57.110> for<00:02:57.560> tower<00:02:57.860> pushing<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.860> that's

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
ridiculous for tower pushing so that's

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.930 
ridiculous for tower pushing so that's
pretty<00:03:01.130> cool<00:03:01.220> note<00:03:03.310> anything<00:03:04.310> else<00:03:04.520> oh<00:03:04.760> yeah

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
pretty cool note anything else oh yeah

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.790 
pretty cool note anything else oh yeah
you<00:03:05.000> can<00:03:05.240> use<00:03:05.450> these<00:03:05.660> trends<00:03:06.050> after<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:06.530> use<00:03:06.770> a

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
you can use these trends after you use a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.770 
you can use these trends after you use a
sprout<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.670> try<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.060> surround<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.630> enemy

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
sprout to try and surround the enemy

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.020 
sprout to try and surround the enemy
hero<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.380> you're<00:03:09.500> ganking<00:03:09.920> as<00:03:10.040> well<00:03:10.220> just<00:03:10.880> to

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
hero that you're ganking as well just to

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.610 
hero that you're ganking as well just to
make<00:03:11.270> it<00:03:11.300> even<00:03:11.540> more<00:03:11.690> difficult<00:03:11.900> for<00:03:12.470> them<00:03:12.560> to

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
make it even more difficult for them to

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.490 
make it even more difficult for them to
get<00:03:12.860> away<00:03:12.980> but<00:03:13.130> again<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:14.660> is<00:03:14.720> because<00:03:15.260> it

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
get away but again this is because it

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.850 
get away but again this is because it
does<00:03:15.740> not<00:03:15.980> silence<00:03:16.370> stun<00:03:16.850> or<00:03:16.880> slow<00:03:17.240> so<00:03:17.860> it's

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
does not silence stun or slow so it's

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.730 
does not silence stun or slow so it's
pretty<00:03:19.070> cool<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.280> milk<00:03:20.020> okay<00:03:21.020> so<00:03:21.470> that's

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
pretty cool to milk okay so that's

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.320 
pretty cool to milk okay so that's
pretty<00:03:21.950> much<00:03:22.040> all<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.490> his<00:03:22.610> abilities<00:03:23.060> now

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
pretty much all of his abilities now

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.740 
pretty much all of his abilities now
let's<00:03:23.660> look<00:03:24.050> at<00:03:24.230> his<00:03:24.410> ultimate<00:03:24.890> ability<00:03:25.750> when

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
let's look at his ultimate ability when

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.450 
let's look at his ultimate ability when
his<00:03:26.870> ultimate<00:03:27.290> does<00:03:27.470> is<00:03:27.710> it<00:03:27.860> bounces<00:03:28.250> between

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
his ultimate does is it bounces between

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.920 
his ultimate does is it bounces between
all<00:03:28.850> visible<00:03:29.240> enemy<00:03:29.660> units<00:03:29.990> on<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.440> map<00:03:30.620> and

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
all visible enemy units on the map and

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.500 
all visible enemy units on the map and
it<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.500> old<00:03:33.740> damage<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:34.760> this<00:03:35.000> pretty<00:03:35.360> much

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
it is the old damage so this pretty much

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.500 
it is the old damage so this pretty much
prevents<00:03:36.080> any<00:03:36.910> creep<00:03:37.910> pushing<00:03:38.390> from

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
prevents any creep pushing from

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.350 
prevents any creep pushing from
happening<00:03:38.959> while<00:03:39.470> he's<00:03:39.680> on<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.980> field<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:41.090> as

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
happening while he's on the field so as

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.270 
happening while he's on the field so as
you<00:03:41.570> can<00:03:41.690> see<00:03:41.870> all<00:03:42.080> user<00:03:42.350> on<00:03:42.590> this<00:03:42.830> creep<00:03:43.100> it

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
you can see all user on this creep it

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.980 
you can see all user on this creep it
should<00:03:43.580> bounce<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:44.120> these<00:03:44.330> creeps<00:03:44.660> in<00:03:44.840> the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
should bounce to these creeps in the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.449 
should bounce to these creeps in the
middle<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.410> then<00:03:45.770> after<00:03:46.100> that<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:46.430> should

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
middle and then after that it should

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.430 
middle and then after that it should
bounce<00:03:46.850> down<00:03:47.180> all<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.630> way<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.780> these<00:03:48.140> creeps

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
bounce down all the way to these creeps

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.059 
bounce down all the way to these creeps
at<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.800> bottom<00:03:49.240> so<00:03:50.240> it<00:03:50.450> bounces<00:03:50.690> a

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.010 

bounces<00:03:55.069> a<00:03:55.100> maximum<00:03:55.580> of<00:03:55.640> 16<00:03:56.120> times<00:03:56.390> it<00:03:56.959> is

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
bounces a maximum of 16 times it is

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.010 
bounces a maximum of 16 times it is
scepter<00:03:57.590> upgradable<00:03:58.190> so<00:03:58.819> increases<00:03:59.750> the

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
scepter upgradable so increases the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.540 
scepter upgradable so increases the
amount<00:04:00.110> of<00:04:00.410> damage<00:04:00.709> and<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:00.950> amount<00:04:01.490> of

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
amount of damage and the amount of
