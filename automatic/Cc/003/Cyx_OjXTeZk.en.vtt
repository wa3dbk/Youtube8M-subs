00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
ah it is time for the cooking class

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.300 
ah it is time for the cooking class
today<00:00:13.010> we<00:00:14.010> are<00:00:14.250> going<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.700> do<00:00:14.879> the<00:00:15.780> chef<00:00:16.310> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
today we are going to do the chef the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.050 
today we are going to do the chef the
chef<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:18.570> know<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> nice<00:00:20.040> thing<00:00:20.790> when

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
chef you know is a nice thing when

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.609 
chef you know is a nice thing when
you're<00:00:21.210> cooking<00:00:21.419> you've<00:00:21.810> got<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.169> have<00:00:22.349> some

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
you're cooking you've got to have some

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.370 
you're cooking you've got to have some
heat<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> way<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> get<00:00:24.869> some<00:00:25.109> heat

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
heat and this is a way to get some heat

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.500 
heat and this is a way to get some heat
chemically<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.250> can<00:00:26.550> imagine<00:00:26.880> you're<00:00:27.330> out

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
chemically I can imagine you're out

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.810 
chemically I can imagine you're out
there<00:00:27.930> camping<00:00:28.439> somewhere<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.160> your<00:00:29.550> stove

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
there camping somewhere and your stove

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.150 
there camping somewhere and your stove
won't<00:00:30.210> work<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.199> carry<00:00:31.470> along<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
won't work what you just carry along a

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.030 
won't work what you just carry along a
bottle<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.970> calcium<00:00:33.449> oxide<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.260> get<00:00:34.769> a<00:00:34.800> little

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
bottle of calcium oxide and get a little

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.180 
bottle of calcium oxide and get a little
water<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.180> still<00:00:36.449> do<00:00:36.720> your<00:00:36.750> cooking

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
water and you can still do your cooking

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.470 
water and you can still do your cooking
out<00:00:38.190> there<00:00:38.519> now<00:00:39.620> my<00:00:40.620> setup<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> I

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
out there now my setup here I have a I

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.319 
out there now my setup here I have a I
like<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.379> put<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> box<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.489> we're<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
like to put it on a box if we're in a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
like to put it on a box if we're in a
classroom<00:00:45.600> I'd<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> Box<00:00:46.950> be

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
classroom I'd like to have the Box be

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160 
classroom I'd like to have the Box be
quite<00:00:47.399> high<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.059> audience<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.809> end<00:00:49.079> up

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
quite high so the audience can end up

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.490 
quite high so the audience can end up
seeing<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.860> because<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.570> little<00:00:51.780> nice

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
seeing it and because it's a little nice

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.410 
seeing it and because it's a little nice
to<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.860> able<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.070> carry<00:00:53.550> things<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.149> take<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
to be able to carry things and take it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.250 
to be able to carry things and take it
away<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.829> take<00:00:56.329> your<00:00:57.329> ten<00:00:57.809> gallon

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
away I like to take your ten gallon

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.319 
away I like to take your ten gallon
kitchen<00:00:58.770> bags<00:00:58.980> and<00:01:00.079> turn<00:01:01.079> them<00:01:01.440> inside<00:01:01.739> out

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
kitchen bags and turn them inside out

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.249 
kitchen bags and turn them inside out
which<00:01:03.329> I've<00:01:03.539> done<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:04.460> place<00:01:05.460> them

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
which I've done here place them

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.380 
which I've done here place them
underneath<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.940> bottom<00:01:09.360> pan<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:11.330> try<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
underneath the bottom pan and try to

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.210 
underneath the bottom pan and try to
then<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:13.319> it<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.800> I<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.750> later<00:01:16.220> hold

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
then have it so that I can later hold

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.440 
then have it so that I can later hold
the<00:01:17.490> bag<00:01:17.700> around<00:01:18.319> the<00:01:19.319> final<00:01:19.590> reaction<00:01:20.450> you

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the bag around the final reaction you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.620 
the bag around the final reaction you
know<00:01:21.979> environmentally<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.759> want<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.060> keep<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
know environmentally we want to keep it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.940 
know environmentally we want to keep it
all<00:01:24.750> collected<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.630> here<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.840> are<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.740> got

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
all collected so here we are we got

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.150 
all collected so here we are we got
calcium<00:01:29.580> oxide<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.530> should<00:01:31.740> realize

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
calcium oxide now you should realize

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.139 
calcium oxide now you should realize
calcium<00:01:32.819> oxide<00:01:33.300> is<00:01:33.539> actually<00:01:34.050> looked<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:35.149> lot

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
calcium oxide is actually looked a lot

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.330 
calcium oxide is actually looked a lot
of<00:01:36.360> times<00:01:36.599> people<00:01:36.899> think<00:01:37.349> they<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.830> bottle

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
of times people think they have a bottle

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.719 
of times people think they have a bottle
of<00:01:38.459> calcium<00:01:38.940> oxide<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.440> actually

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
of calcium oxide in it it's actually

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.300 
of calcium oxide in it it's actually
calcium<00:01:41.729> hydroxide<00:01:42.599> because<00:01:43.440> calcium<00:01:43.830> oxide

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
calcium hydroxide because calcium oxide

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.639 
calcium hydroxide because calcium oxide
picks<00:01:44.550> up<00:01:44.700> moisture<00:01:44.910> from<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.479> air<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.200> if

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
picks up moisture from the air and if

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.430 
picks up moisture from the air and if
it's<00:01:46.800> calcium<00:01:47.039> hydroxide<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.720> won't<00:01:49.020> get<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
it's calcium hydroxide you won't get the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.270 
it's calcium hydroxide you won't get the
heat<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.880> gotta<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.539> lump<00:01:52.289> calcium

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
heat so you gotta have the lump calcium

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:02.400 
heat so you gotta have the lump calcium
oxide<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.450> let's<00:01:54.929> use<00:01:55.259> some

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.090 

can<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:03.500> see<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.830> lumps<00:02:04.900> there<00:02:05.900> we<00:02:06.080> are<00:02:06.110> that

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
can you see the lumps there we are that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.440 
can you see the lumps there we are that
should<00:02:07.400> be<00:02:07.580> sufficient<00:02:08.080> yeah<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.410> little<00:02:09.650> more

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
should be sufficient yeah a little more

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.820 
should be sufficient yeah a little more
we're<00:02:11.450> trying<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.750> be<00:02:11.840> get<00:02:12.350> a<00:02:12.380> good<00:02:12.620> amount

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
we're trying to be get a good amount

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.610 
we're trying to be get a good amount
heat<00:02:13.130> today<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:14.390> there<00:02:14.690> we<00:02:14.870> are<00:02:14.900> we<00:02:15.230> got<00:02:15.410> our

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
heat today so there we are we got our

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.370 
heat today so there we are we got our
calcium<00:02:16.610> oxide<00:02:16.970> now<00:02:17.210> we<00:02:17.270> have<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.810> react<00:02:18.140> it

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
calcium oxide now we have to react it

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.140 
calcium oxide now we have to react it
we're<00:02:18.920> going<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.100> react<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.550> with<00:02:19.580> some<00:02:19.880> water

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
we're going to react it with some water

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.740 
we're going to react it with some water
and<00:02:21.070> water<00:02:22.070> will<00:02:22.370> react<00:02:22.670> with<00:02:22.850> calcium<00:02:23.060> oxide

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
and water will react with calcium oxide

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.780 
and water will react with calcium oxide
that's<00:02:24.170> what<00:02:24.500> happens<00:02:24.890> slowly<00:02:25.100> that's<00:02:25.640> why

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
that's what happens slowly that's why

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.670 
that's what happens slowly that's why
you<00:02:25.850> normally<00:02:26.300> don't<00:02:26.480> have<00:02:26.570> lumped<00:02:26.990> calcium

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
you normally don't have lumped calcium

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.130 
you normally don't have lumped calcium
oxide<00:02:28.100> but<00:02:29.030> we're<00:02:29.480> going<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.660> need<00:02:29.780> some<00:02:29.960> water

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
oxide but we're going to need some water

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.260 
oxide but we're going to need some water
so<00:02:30.950> we're<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:31.220> going<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.700> put<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.030> little<00:02:32.150> bit

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
so we're just going to put a little bit

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.220 
so we're just going to put a little bit

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
want our cook egg to stick so we're

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.420 
want our cook egg to stick so we're
gonna<00:02:47.260> give<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:48.410> little<00:02:48.500> vegetable<00:02:48.860> spray

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
gonna give it a little vegetable spray

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.780 
gonna give it a little vegetable spray
and<00:02:50.590> gee<00:02:51.590> wonder<00:02:51.980> how<00:02:52.100> hot<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.490> not<00:02:53.500> bad

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
and gee wonder how hot it is not bad

the<00:03:16.280> egg<00:03:16.489> is<00:03:16.790> starting<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.330> go<00:03:17.510> notice<00:03:18.550> this

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
the egg is starting to go notice this

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.650 
the egg is starting to go notice this
this<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.750> actually<00:03:20.900> levitation<00:03:21.800> look<00:03:21.980> at<00:03:22.130> this

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660

this is actually levitation look at this
it's<00:03:23.660> being<00:03:23.900> levitated<00:03:25.450> okay<00:03:26.450> there<00:03:27.260> we<00:03:27.380> are

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
it's being levitated okay there we are

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.300 
it's being levitated okay there we are
we're<00:03:30.019> going<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.230> use<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.410> right-handed<00:03:31.100> glove

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
starting to get our egg in good shape

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.660 
starting to get our egg in good shape
now<00:03:39.380> I<00:03:39.410> don't<00:03:39.709> know<00:03:39.800> how<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.010> like<00:03:40.280> your<00:03:40.459> eggs

more one of the things you might note
remember<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.759> lumps<00:04:20.389> that<00:04:20.419> were<00:04:20.750> there<00:04:20.989> that

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
remember the lumps that were there that

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.920 
remember the lumps that were there that
you<00:04:21.350> saw<00:04:21.560> earlier<00:04:21.970> let's<00:04:22.970> lift<00:04:23.240> this<00:04:23.419> up<00:04:23.479> and

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
you saw earlier let's lift this up and

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.860 
you saw earlier let's lift this up and
take<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.199> look<00:04:24.470> at<00:04:24.560> what<00:04:24.680> we<00:04:24.800> have<00:04:24.949> underneath

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
take a look at what we have underneath

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.550 
take a look at what we have underneath
notice<00:04:26.870> how<00:04:27.050> much<00:04:27.289> larger<00:04:28.120> our<00:04:29.120> pan<00:04:29.479> is<00:04:29.870> filled

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
notice how much larger our pan is filled

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.490 
notice how much larger our pan is filled
now<00:04:30.889> with<00:04:31.729> calcium<00:04:32.210> hydroxide<00:04:32.330> a<00:04:33.050> lot<00:04:33.320> of

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
now with calcium hydroxide a lot of

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.029 
now with calcium hydroxide a lot of
calcium<00:04:33.680> hydroxide<00:04:33.919> is<00:04:34.789> now<00:04:34.940> there<00:04:35.270> and

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
calcium hydroxide is now there and

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.800 
calcium hydroxide is now there and
during<00:04:37.039> the<00:04:37.160> heat<00:04:37.370> theme<00:04:38.060> was<00:04:38.330> made<00:04:38.570> which

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
during the heat theme was made which

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.529 
during the heat theme was made which
pumped<00:04:39.229> it<00:04:39.320> up<00:04:39.440> actually<00:04:39.800> as<00:04:40.580> it<00:04:40.820> was<00:04:41.000> made<00:04:41.270> but

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
pumped it up actually as it was made but

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.060 
pumped it up actually as it was made but
it<00:04:41.660> should<00:04:41.840> also<00:04:41.990> be<00:04:42.169> larger<00:04:42.680> as<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.800> molecule

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
it should also be larger as a molecule

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.510 
it should also be larger as a molecule
than<00:04:43.490> calcium<00:04:43.699> oxide<00:04:44.240> was<00:04:44.710> so<00:04:45.710> we<00:04:46.220> gained

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
than calcium oxide was so we gained

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.300 
than calcium oxide was so we gained
quite<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:47.030> bit<00:04:47.270> there<00:04:47.630> our<00:04:48.590> egg<00:04:48.919> is<00:04:49.699> not<00:04:49.970> too<00:04:50.210> bad

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
quite a bit there our egg is not too bad

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.430 
quite a bit there our egg is not too bad
