00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:09.480
 Sinkevich show how to shoot 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.230
 out of town I was looking for so long 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.219
 you're on a tuba 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:21.539
 found him for this you will need 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:26.640
 I looked for mobile games for such a search and 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:31.640
 suddenly the base found it easy just 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.140
 you go in this example program as it was then necessary to 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.920
 to register 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:41.160
 then release get to the top then 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.270
 started setting let's go here I do not remember 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.270
 Dima line, I'll look 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:01:11.460
 no, now let's look for a zero and then 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:23.240
 should be couscous remember here 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:30.500
 Now here's how it would get stuck there though 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:35.900
 but I have a microphone and sects here 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:39.479
 Well, it probably at the same time and can show 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:43.579
 maps on minecraft and I give it to us 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.579
 will need the main program maps 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:02:08.580
 come evaporated let's assume 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.580
 this installation is on 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:45.720
 this program is by the way mobizen to play 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:03:03.120
 click this i connect to the program 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:03:03.120
 go straight in to write in flour and 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:17.799
 look for this program mobizen here 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:23.410
 for this you still need this program 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:26.260
 shorter than mobizen itself here it is still here 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.099
 they will be many but it will be the most 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.049
 the first one is this is about mobis and on this 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:37.199
 Probably everyone thanks for watching 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.199
 put your fingers up and all bye bye 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.110
 although wait
