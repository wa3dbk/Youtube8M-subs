00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
heat plate at the end of it which

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.060 
heat plate at the end of it which
ignites<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.260> chippings<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.800> makes<00:04:12.950> them

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
ignites the chippings and makes them

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.740 
ignites the chippings and makes them
smooth<00:04:13.370> underneath<00:04:14.150> there's<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.570> bowl<00:04:14.720> of

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
smooth underneath there's a bowl of

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.410 
smooth underneath there's a bowl of
water<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.260> catch<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.710> ash<00:04:15.940> also<00:04:16.940> hear<00:04:17.209> there's

water to catch the ash also hear there's
a<00:04:17.480> drip<00:04:17.750> tray<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:18.080> anything<00:04:18.560> dripping<00:04:19.010> down

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
a drip tray so anything dripping down

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.860 
a drip tray so anything dripping down
there<00:04:19.459> gets<00:04:19.700> funneled<00:04:20.030> through<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.540> hole<00:04:20.720> and

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
there gets funneled through the hole and

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.050 
there gets funneled through the hole and
into<00:04:20.989> that<00:04:21.200> pot<00:04:21.380> of<00:04:21.530> water<00:04:21.709> nice<00:04:22.370> clean<00:04:22.730> simple

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
into that pot of water nice clean simple

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.240 
into that pot of water nice clean simple
system<00:04:23.570> i<00:04:23.780> turn<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.500> heating<00:04:24.680> element<00:04:25.100> at<00:04:25.190> the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
system i turn the heating element at the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.180 
system i turn the heating element at the
back<00:04:25.430> off<00:04:25.670> which<00:04:26.450> is<00:04:26.540> here<00:04:26.870> then<00:04:27.560> I'm<00:04:27.860> left

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
back off which is here then I'm left

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.190 
back off which is here then I'm left
with<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.490> relatively<00:04:28.910> cold<00:04:29.210> smoke<00:04:29.600> which<00:04:30.080> is

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
with a relatively cold smoke which is

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.100

what<00:04:30.350> we're<00:04:30.470> doing<00:04:30.680> now<00:04:31.360> okay<00:04:32.360> our<00:04:32.570> veterans

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
what we're doing now okay our veterans

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.350 
what we're doing now okay our veterans
had<00:04:33.260> about<00:04:33.470> 10<00:04:33.800> minutes<00:04:34.010> at<00:04:34.310> 80<00:04:34.520> degrees<00:04:35.120> I

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
had about 10 minutes at 80 degrees I

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.540 
had about 10 minutes at 80 degrees I
think<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.630> should<00:04:35.780> be<00:04:35.840> just<00:04:35.930> right<00:04:36.550> most

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.060 
think it should be just right most
