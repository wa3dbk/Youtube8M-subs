if you look when you mine on level 10

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.560 
if you look when you mine on level 10

you probably won so if everybody's like
level<00:02:21.270> 12<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.690> everything<00:02:22.080> well<00:02:22.350> they<00:02:22.560> mostly

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
level 12 and everything well they mostly

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.720 
level 12 and everything well they mostly
spawn<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.430> levels<00:02:23.930> like<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.350> think<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.400> was<00:02:26.580> like

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
spawn on levels like I think it was like

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.850 
spawn on levels like I think it was like
8<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.209> 12<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:28.080> mine<00:02:28.380> in<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> middle<00:02:28.830> of

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
8 to 12 if you mine in the middle of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.530 
8 to 12 if you mine in the middle of
them<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.250> then<00:02:29.430> you've<00:02:29.550> got<00:02:29.700> much<00:02:30.270> more

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
them that then you've got much more

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.110 
them that then you've got much more
likely<00:02:30.810> chance<00:02:31.200> or<00:02:31.530> finding<00:02:32.160> them<00:02:32.430> things

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
likely chance or finding them things

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.790 
likely chance or finding them things
that<00:02:33.300> we<00:02:33.450> all<00:02:33.600> called<00:02:33.840> diamonds<00:02:34.410> which<00:02:34.560> like

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
that we all called diamonds which like

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.740 
that we all called diamonds which like
everyone<00:02:35.250> wants<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.700> game<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.209> make

come into a lot of lava basically which

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.240 
come into a lot of lava basically which
is<00:02:45.690> kind<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.930> annoying<00:02:46.170> because<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.950> know<00:02:47.070> it

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
is kind of annoying because you know it

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.770 
is kind of annoying because you know it
spawns<00:02:47.550> on<00:02:47.730> level<00:02:48.030> 12<00:02:48.239> or<00:02:48.390> something<00:02:48.690> like

spawns on level 12 or something like

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.840 
spawns on level 12 or something like
that<00:02:48.840> but<00:02:49.680> if<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.340> get<00:02:50.489> out<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.730> way

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
that but if you can get out of the way

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.180 
that but if you can get out of the way
of<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.000> lava<00:02:51.590> just<00:02:52.590> block<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:52.830> off<00:02:53.040> or

just kept them blocking it off here or
going<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.340> another<00:02:56.550> mine<00:02:56.880> I'm<00:02:57.209> not<00:02:57.720> it's

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
going to another mine I'm not it's

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.150 
going to another mine I'm not it's
pretty<00:02:57.989> annoying<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:58.500> I've<00:02:58.620> actually<00:02:58.830> found

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
pretty annoying but I've actually found

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.680 
pretty annoying but I've actually found
so<00:02:59.400> many<00:02:59.519> diamonds<00:02:59.820> doing<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.450> it's<00:03:00.570> the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
so many diamonds doing this and it's the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.050 
so many diamonds doing this and it's the
actual<00:03:00.810> most<00:03:01.230> efficient<00:03:01.709> way<00:03:01.850> people<00:03:02.850> done

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
actual most efficient way people done

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.509 
actual most efficient way people done
like<00:03:03.269> science<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.170> stuff<00:03:04.500> minecraft<00:03:05.220> science

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
like science and stuff minecraft science

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.920 
like science and stuff minecraft science
essentially<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.269> most<00:03:06.300> efficient<00:03:06.810> way<00:03:06.870> to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
essentially the most efficient way to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.240 
essentially the most efficient way to
find<00:03:07.230> diamond<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:07.709> if<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.920> guys<00:03:08.070> are<00:03:08.220> looking

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.009 
find diamond so if you guys are looking
to<00:03:08.550> find<00:03:08.730> diamonds<00:03:08.940> make<00:03:09.600> sure<00:03:09.750> you're<00:03:09.870> mine

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
to find diamonds make sure you're mine

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.990 
to find diamonds make sure you're mine
level<00:03:10.590> 10<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.250> make<00:03:11.640> sure<00:03:11.670> you're<00:03:11.910> doing

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
level 10 and make sure you're doing

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.479 
level 10 and make sure you're doing
those<00:03:12.239> every<00:03:12.900> recall<00:03:13.320> strip<00:03:13.620> mines<00:03:13.800> if<00:03:14.040> you

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
those every recall strip mines if you

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.160 
those every recall strip mines if you
