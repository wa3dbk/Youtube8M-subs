00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.280
 juba cabrio servus people what's up 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.700
 is my first battlefield 4 classes 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.010
 guide 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.100
 I address my cordial welcome I 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.080
 imagine today diaz 52 that is 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.170
 in my opinion the best weapon in 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.660
 the carbine class and on operation 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.820
 loose or operations band which card 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.949
 yes , she is the most played 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.860
 weapon par excellence and by no 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.469
 replaceable you turn it off with 37,000 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.730
 karabiners score points for what you then 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.440
 first play a bit pioneer 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.910
 so that you can get the cabin 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.620
 But then it is then relatively 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
 fast she is in the midfield of 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.489
 all unlockable carabiners what 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.860
 means that they will be in the future 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.260
 for all classes is available for 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.180
 the sniper lead supporter etc 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.670
 Generally it can be said that they are in the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.739
 melee is a real beast and up 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.570
 ideal for medium distances 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.730
 it is a bit on distance 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.930
 harder because she is relatively heavy 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.880
 to control 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.770
 but if you are in two or three bars 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.570
 shoots or changes the fire mode 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.140
 then the opponents fall very fast 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.850
 around 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.740
 the damage can be said that the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.780
 he is very high 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.930
 Fully automatic range above all 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.060
 other weapons outside the ska with the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.409
 she is on par with the rate of fire 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.320
 can be said that more in the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.080
 the lower range is 650 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.700
 spam in something at her caliber 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.009
 size is not that bad because if 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.240
 she would have been so high then 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.340
 go up and then it would be 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.060
 uncontrollable so that with her already 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.710
 pretty good 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.530
 She has a relative already 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.450
 Strong recoil the but to the sides 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.610
 a little bit on both sides 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.159
 just about this inference 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.680
 better to be able to control 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.079
 I always have a fishing grip that does that 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.659
 reduce first shot as you yes 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.149
 mostly brushing on removal anyway 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.850
 this is very very important you can 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.189
 as an alternative also the po tattoo grip 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.780
 or take the short handle but the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.270
 I do not like it that way 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.489
 Well, that reduces the spread 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.590
 make something more accurate after each weapon 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.790
 shot well to this recall 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.330
 he needs to be able to control 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.700
 of course, a good visor 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.070
 luckily I turn it on 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.830
 52 right at the beginning i believe myself ten 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.390
 kills the coyote visor free what 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.910
 actually in my opinion the best 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.640
 is the running the verbund changeable 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.140
 I do not like the flash haider on it 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.720
 actually causes what nothing 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.450
 Except that he has the lightning from the weapon 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.640
 hiding what concede in dark 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.620
 some can give my advantage what 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.330
 In no case should do is out 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.190
 old habit the heavy run too 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.070
 assemble the worsens the weapon 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.960
 in automatic driving mode extremely as 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.430
 conclusion can be said that the magpie 1 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.560
 5 certainly among the top three 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.810
 Weapons is and it is worth this free 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.370
 to play and try out so we 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.990
 it arrived here at the end of me 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.790
 Hope you liked my guide 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.010

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.000
