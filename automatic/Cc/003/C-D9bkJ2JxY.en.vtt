hey Rachel
either<00:00:10.679> what's<00:00:11.130> up<00:00:11.250> I'm<00:00:12.120> wanting<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.480> learn

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
either what's up I'm wanting to learn

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.079 
either what's up I'm wanting to learn
how<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.840> make<00:00:13.080> games<00:00:13.380> but<00:00:13.799> have<00:00:14.400> no<00:00:14.580> idea<00:00:14.910> where

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
how to make games but have no idea where

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.210 
how to make games but have no idea where
to<00:00:15.179> begin<00:00:15.350> what<00:00:16.350> sort<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.619> language<00:00:16.800> should<00:00:17.160> I

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
to begin what sort of language should I

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.689 
to begin what sort of language should I
use<00:00:17.460> what<00:00:17.699> websites<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.570> books<00:00:18.779> are<00:00:18.990> there

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
use what websites and books are there

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:28.939 
use what websites and books are there
well<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.730> really<00:00:21.240> depends<00:00:27.199> first<00:00:28.199> off<00:00:28.470> you

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
well that really depends first off you

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.740 
well that really depends first off you
need<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.160> get<00:00:29.310> an<00:00:29.460> idea<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.789> what<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.300> actually

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
need to get an idea of what you actually

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.200 
need to get an idea of what you actually
want<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> be<00:00:31.109> doing<00:00:31.430> lots<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.550> people<00:00:32.850> say<00:00:33.059> they

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
want to be doing lots of people say they

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.479 
want to be doing lots of people say they
want<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.420> make<00:00:33.750> games<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.829> are<00:00:34.950> really<00:00:35.219> only

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
want to make games but are really only

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.520 
want to make games but are really only
interested<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.120> stuff<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.480> design<00:00:37.079> rather

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
interested in stuff like design rather

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.740 
interested in stuff like design rather
than<00:00:37.680> programming

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
than programming

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.900 
than programming
so<00:00:39.750> design<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.590> stuff<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.129> planning<00:00:41.640> out<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
so design is stuff like planning out the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.940 
so design is stuff like planning out the
games<00:00:42.120> elements<00:00:42.690> such<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.410> storyline

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
games elements such as the storyline

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.779 
games elements such as the storyline
gameplay<00:00:44.730> levels<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.629> puzzles<00:00:46.789> preferably

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
gameplay levels and puzzles preferably

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.520 
gameplay levels and puzzles preferably
they<00:00:48.270> should<00:00:48.450> know<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.719> bit<00:00:49.050> about<00:00:49.350> what

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
they should know a little bit about what

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.380 
they should know a little bit about what
goes<00:00:49.710> into<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> programming<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.700> artwork<00:00:51.059> so

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
goes into the programming in artwork so

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.819 
goes into the programming in artwork so
they<00:00:51.570> are<00:00:51.629> able<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.870> plan<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.289> stuff<00:00:52.620> that

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
they are able to plan out stuff that

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.819 
they are able to plan out stuff that
actually<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.460> doable<00:00:54.559> programming<00:00:55.559> would<00:00:55.680> be

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
actually is doable programming would be

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.189 
actually is doable programming would be
actually<00:00:56.309> handling<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> game<00:00:57.149> code<00:00:57.420> there

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
actually handling the game code there

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.689 
actually handling the game code there
are<00:00:58.350> varying<00:00:58.710> degrees<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.100> difficulty

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
are varying degrees of difficulty

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.700 
are varying degrees of difficulty
depending<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> language<00:01:00.989> libraries<00:01:01.260> or

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
depending on the language libraries or

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.429 
depending on the language libraries or
engine<00:01:02.100> being<00:01:02.280> used<00:01:02.989> programming<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> lot

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
engine being used programming is a lot

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.260 
engine being used programming is a lot
of<00:01:04.589> work<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.280> takes<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.549> lot<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.790> practice

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
of work and it takes a lot of practice

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
of work and it takes a lot of practice
to<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.510> able<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.650> not<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.070> waving<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
to be able to do it is not just waving a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.240 
to be able to do it is not just waving a
magic<00:01:08.850> wand<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> game<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.689> yours<00:01:10.010> one<00:01:11.010> must

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
magic wand and a game of yours one must

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.710 
magic wand and a game of yours one must
understand<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> essentially<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
understand that you essentially have to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.830 
understand that you essentially have to
tell<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> program<00:01:13.140> how<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:14.010> everything

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
tell the program how to do everything

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
tell the program how to do everything
how<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> character<00:01:16.200> moves<00:01:16.590> when<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.890> walks<00:01:17.100> how

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
how a character moves when it walks how

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.120 
how a character moves when it walks how
the<00:01:17.759> animation<00:01:18.570> works<00:01:18.750> how<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.320> physics<00:01:20.009> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the animation works how the physics of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.460 
the animation works how the physics of
the<00:01:20.250> world<00:01:20.280> works<00:01:20.759> how<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.330> load<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.810> Maps<00:01:22.080> how

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the world works how to load in Maps how

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.580 
the world works how to load in Maps how
to<00:01:22.530> draw<00:01:22.890> maps<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.490> many<00:01:23.970> other<00:01:24.180> things<00:01:24.590> well

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
to draw maps and many other things well

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.679 
to draw maps and many other things well
with<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> way<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> make<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> game<00:01:27.119> designs

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
with that a way to make a game designs

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.950 
with that a way to make a game designs
just<00:01:27.990> designs<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.130> how<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> actually<00:01:30.390> make<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
just designs so how I actually make a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.090 
just designs so how I actually make a
game<00:01:35.659> well<00:01:36.659> there<00:01:37.110> are<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.259> lot<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> choices<00:01:37.740> as

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
game well there are a lot of choices as

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.120 
game well there are a lot of choices as
far<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.340> languages<00:01:38.909> or<00:01:39.119> even<00:01:39.299> engines<00:01:39.780> go

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
far as languages or even engines go

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.109 
far as languages or even engines go
there<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> few<00:01:41.369> things<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.820> should<00:01:42.000> ask

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
there are a few things you should ask

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.580 
there are a few things you should ask
yourself<00:01:42.509> first<00:01:42.750> though<00:01:43.220> like<00:01:44.220> one<00:01:45.110> like<00:01:46.110> do

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
yourself first though like one like do

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.780 
yourself first though like one like do
you<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.710> any<00:01:47.009> prior<00:01:47.250> programming

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
you have any prior programming

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.310 
you have any prior programming
experience<00:01:49.340> well<00:01:50.630> if<00:01:52.159> you<00:01:53.159> use<00:01:53.369> C++<00:01:54.329> Java<00:01:54.570> or<00:01:55.110> C

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
experience well if you use C++ Java or C

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.660 
experience well if you use C++ Java or C
sharp<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.799> past<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.340> are<00:01:56.460> comfortable

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
sharp in the past and are comfortable

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.940 
sharp in the past and are comfortable
with<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.930> suggest<00:01:58.320> maybe<00:01:58.500> starting

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
with it and I suggest maybe starting

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.280 
with it and I suggest maybe starting
with<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.219> yes<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.450> make<00:02:00.659> more<00:02:00.869> than<00:02:00.930> DOS

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
with that yes you can make more than DOS

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.100 
with that yes you can make more than DOS
prompt<00:02:01.710> style<00:02:01.950> games<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.960> there<00:02:03.960> are

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
prompt style games with it there are

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.929 
prompt style games with it there are
