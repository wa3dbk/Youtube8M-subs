00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.530
 start 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.870
 video 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.940
 and with 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.570
 they are usually very 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.640
 it's not asking 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.349
 special training not having 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.960
 opportunities to train 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:29.400
 spend a long time on it 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.619
 long so tough time we force 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.199
 carried out the main idea 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.170
 this use as a means 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.720
 Madara various items this can 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.519
 be like specially made 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:50.129
 items and those that are 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:53.640
 around us in ordinary life today in 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.489
 in this video in this tutorial video we 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.070
 consider the most frequently asked of us 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.550
 questions of its use of such means 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.539
 as climatic gas director 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.890
 shock weapon its pros cons 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:13.910
 advantages and disadvantages as well 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.190
 back to consider in more detail those 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.600
 questions that were associated with 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.600
 applying times other various 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.400
 items as a trace of the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.549
 since our first instructional videos 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.720
 core people 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.110
 learning and applying tools 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.329
 self defense was something that ordinary 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.280
 a person who did not pass the special 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.860
 preparation is not forever 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.229
 they spend a lot of time training 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.539
 either whose can 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.140
 such that it is not possible hard 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:50.679
 to train we promoted the idea of 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.899
 that you need to be able to protect yourself when 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.850
 help is really important when 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.429
 aid items use them like 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.270
 the remedy itself really typed 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:03.069
 nature has created a man's hand survive 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.460
 first of all in order for something to me 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.920
 keep and ancient times known about 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.720
 that people have different warrior conflicts 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.940
 rejection always used some 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.030
 items as specially made 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.079
 so is it that surrounded them everyday 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.660
 life more than that during its existence 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:25.480
 of our project we are received very much 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.510
 a large number of questions about problems 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.700
 the use of such species is traditional 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.540
 consider defensive weapons as 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.630
 gas 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:39.190
 electric shock and pneumatic our 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.769
 today's video we will go through the main 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.690
 moments 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.450
 consider the main positive and 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.200
 negative aspects of data application 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.840
 items 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.410
 and also more expanded consider 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:03:01.780
 some other options are the cylinders itself 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:04.760
 using items and weapons items 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.970
 weapons that belong to the defense price 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.480
 and specially made and 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:15.650
 widely used, we his 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.349
 course not based on how this 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.079
 theoretical developments 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:26.239
 sections methods and techniques that we give 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:28.940
 they are born of life itself they are taken from 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.420
 private service training systems 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.569
 guard 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:38.480
 various night clubs therefore 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.590
 often waited for the usual 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.720
 non -martial man 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.970
 non professional in this 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.750
 question very often tries 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.379
 use as self defense either 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.030
 just has a variety of 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.579
 defensive weapons not 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.180
 prohibited by law to them 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:06.680
 applies gas well callary 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.359
 pneumatic in order to 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.340
 characterize each of these 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:14.090
 elements need to first understand 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:18.820
 what situation and how will you be 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:22.000
 let's start using them with gas weapons 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.840
 one of the most common 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.580
 available and frequently used as 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.900
 self defense is gas 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.669
 first and foremost is the gas cylinder 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.879
 addition of these shelves can be 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.300
 different gas may be caused by pumping 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:42.650
 the action is called joke this 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.289
 from our practice we recommend gas 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.349
 cans of red pepper match 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.970
 they are equally effective at 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:55.069
 the enemy is 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:57.400
 about any drug intoxication but 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:01.039
 use of gas cartridges 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.530
 limited by the fact that the situation in which 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.950
 You are in the first place can not apply 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.840
 g 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.950
 ballon in a closed room in this 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.640
 case gas can jump in while 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.690
 second you need to learn 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.670
 automatically if you want 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.400
 use for cans film you 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.830
 carry with you automatically detect 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.040
 wind direction and corresponding 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.730
 way to move in the case of holding 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.500
 periods 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:32.600
 if some kind of vile happens if 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.880
 you have not done what the attack 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.800
 you will need besides that 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.380
 will prepare for the application of gas 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.990
 spray cans and for that you have to decide 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.160
 how will you wear it and 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.960
 quickly extract 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.670
 generally need to learn 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.530
 automatically determine directions 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.600
 wind because jet 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.550
 efficiency my thunderstorm shell 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.770
 extends no more than one 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.670
 meter that is practically flour 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.890
 close and with strong wind I will meet 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:04.780
 either you will not achieve the desired effect 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:08.860
 or worse , you yourself will fall under 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:13.400
 jet tied up drag the same time 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:15.870
 gas shell from our practice we 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.320
 can say they serve 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:23.730
 and are quite effective but 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.910
 while taking into account the shortcomings of which I 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:29.670
 said the gun needs to clearly understand where 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:34.370
 in which places jazz and wax 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:36.650
 the main thing if we are talking about weapons 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.100
 gas pneumatic and electric 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:43.040
 the main problem and the sprout that 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.670
 every day you can have him 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:50.930
 wear everyday and apply any 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.930
 emergency situation
