00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.560
 Hello, welcome to other videos 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.080
 of the teacher good day that our 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.610
 website we have thousands of exercises 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.799
 to try and get very good grades from 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.660
 mathematical physics and chemistry for you 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.240
 the playlist that you can see 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.029
 all my videos well in the channel 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.099
 youtube or also better in my blog the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.189
 teacher's blog seven mates where 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.890
 you will have all the sentences also 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.110
 the pdf with 2013 exercises so 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.059
 visit me over there that we will not spend 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.829
 very good, let's do this 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.530
 exercise that a follower has sent me 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.570
 which says the following what strength there will be 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.309
 to make in the small plunger of a 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.969
 hydraulic lift to lift a 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.969
 15,000 kilogram truck 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:50.399
 it weighs because the radii of the symbols 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.719
 It's 2 meters and 10 centimeters to remember 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.149
 that the hydraulic press us 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.320
 we have a large plunger we have to 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.200
 perform a large force 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.160
 and a small plunger if it will be a cat 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.770
 I suppose 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.580
 not the small thing we are going to look for a small 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.590
 here a small force is worth then to 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.330
 this one here we're going to call this 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.680
 emulus from here then you will have the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.970
 section of nothing yes and a force to 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.190
 remember that it always goes great with 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.950
 big and here we have a force in b 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.330
 that would be small and a section b 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.280
 small is worth what is the formula that 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.640
 let's use the hydraulic press 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.820
 or hydraulic or hydraulic lift 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.710
 it's a match 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.229
 sda is equal to efe dv 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.060
 party is the thread that they ask me is 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.670
 the force on the small plunger are me 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.340
 asking people do it upside down the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.540
 drawing is also the same is to say that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.090
 there could be place that the little one here 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.330
 the big one that said it's the same if 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.610
 I do not know how this good equation would be 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.500
 we go there then first thing we go to 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.540
 procure sections the section of 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.750
 nothing is to be a circumference which 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.850
 is the equation of the section or the area 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.520
 of a circumference very well at home 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.690
 the sections and by the radius squared 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.300
 that is , it will be pib for 2 squared 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.910
 then it would be 4 p and 4 pi 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.850
 it gives me what I have done here 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.239
 when I get four pi old 12 57 meters 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.239
 squared 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.590
 would be the section in a we're going to do to the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.910
 section instead of section in b speed by 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.460
 10 squared 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.250
 direct to the square not because this I what 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.350
 they give in centimeters then the first 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.130
 What I have to do is pass the meters 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.370
 then we know that 100 centimeters 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.710
 they are 1 meter centimeters with centimeters 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.470
 it goes away and it would be 0.1 eye with the 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.760
 units that can roll us up so that 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.040
 come then we have that section 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.910
 well go to me gave me but like to 0 31 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.600
 square meters 0 0 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.880
 31 meters since we already have the sections 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.500
 ok well now let's see it efe a 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.140
 how much is the sphere worth we have 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.270
 here the truck well drawn as all 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.590
 my perfect drawings 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.690
 I can put a couple of wheels this tube 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.360
 escape then we have here is 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.700
 the truck what strength we have to exercise 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.040
 come important today the forces are 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.190
 1500 kilograms no no no no this is a 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.310
 more is not a force worth us 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.680
 we have to lift a truck what 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.440
 we have to count is that the weight of the 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.910
 truck then the force that we 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.720
 we have to exert force nothing 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.540
 It really is the weight of the truck and how much 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.860
 is the weight is the mass by gravity 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:48.490
 important is worth eye eye with this is 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.580
 It is important not to confuse mass with 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.110
 then weight is mass per tier that is 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.680
 say 15,000 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.230
 by 9-8 and we take the calculator that 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.250
 for that we bought it third year and 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.530
 half 147 minutes almost nothing 147 thousand 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.230
 euros well then we have the strength 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.170
 in which we have now we have the strength 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.450
 nothing if we have the surface of well 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.579
 we have the surface of bessie and that 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.530
 we have to calculate the fd then the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.570
 we cleared the equation and it would already be 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.110
 let's put the equation back here 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.560
 the unequal match sda pda 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.570
 efe db match the surface should like 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.669
 we want to clear it if we must have it 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.560
 leave alone the sdb that is 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.780
 making the surface should the plunger 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.810
 It is as small as dividing passes 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.160
 another side have very well at home 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.290
 multiplying then it would be 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.610
 there would be clear the force of a 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:51.930
 how much is the door of aes 147 thousand 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:57.180
 newtons per surface must 0.0 31 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:59.130
 today the surface of a 12.57 we take 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.950
 the calculator 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:06.940
 and to me that gave me 362 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:09.940
 about five minutes what we underscore 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.680
 we put a good and I want you to give 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.020
 account of an important thing for 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.240
 exercise here on the big plunger a 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.220
 brutal force totally great of 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.750
 one hundred forty-seven minutes in the 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.680
 small funnel we just need 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.750
 300 of 25 minutes you realize yes 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.860
 it's like raising more or less 36 37 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.260
 kilograms you see how good and effective 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.850
 is this machine 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.360
 well then come see you in the 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.360
 next video
