00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320 

as<00:00:00.060> I<00:00:00.810> was<00:00:01.079> in<00:00:01.319> training<00:00:01.560> for<00:00:01.770> epilepsy<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.730> took

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
as I was in training for epilepsy I took

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.170 
as I was in training for epilepsy I took
care<00:00:03.480> of<00:00:03.570> many<00:00:03.780> children<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:05.029> one<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.120> the

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
care of many children and one of the

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.880 
care of many children and one of the
most<00:00:06.330> common<00:00:06.629> questions<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.230> parents<00:00:07.500> have

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
most common questions that parents have

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.919 
most common questions that parents have
when<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.760> diagnose<00:00:09.360> their<00:00:09.570> child<00:00:09.780> with

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
when I diagnose their child with

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.240 
when I diagnose their child with
epilepsy<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.530> whether<00:00:10.769> or<00:00:10.889> not<00:00:10.950> they'll<00:00:11.130> be

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
epilepsy is whether or not they'll be

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.879 
epilepsy is whether or not they'll be
able<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.580> come<00:00:11.730> off<00:00:11.759> medicine<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.620> that

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
able to come off medicine and so that

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.490 
able to come off medicine and so that
prompted<00:00:14.549> me<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.700> think<00:00:14.790> about<00:00:15.059> what<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
prompted me to think about what the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.680 
prompted me to think about what the
risks<00:00:16.890> are<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.730> children<00:00:18.119> as<00:00:18.300> they<00:00:18.510> come<00:00:18.660> off

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
risks are for children as they come off

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.570 
risks are for children as they come off
medicine<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.380> think<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.740> most<00:00:20.160> concerning

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
medicine and I think the most concerning

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.700 
medicine and I think the most concerning
one<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.449> their<00:00:21.900> seizures<00:00:22.230> will<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.529> hard

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
one is that their seizures will be hard

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.040 
one is that their seizures will be hard
to<00:00:22.859> control<00:00:23.180> for<00:00:24.180> example<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> child

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
to control for example you have a child

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.230 
to control for example you have a child
who<00:00:25.350> comes<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> first<00:00:26.340> medication<00:00:26.730> and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
who comes on the first medication and

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.570 
who comes on the first medication and
they're<00:00:27.599> doing<00:00:28.320> very<00:00:28.439> very<00:00:28.650> well<00:00:28.890> their

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
they're doing very very well their

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.250 
they're doing very very well their
seizure<00:00:29.789> free<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.510> come<00:00:30.689> off<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.140> now

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
seizure free and come off and now

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.200 
seizure free and come off and now
suddenly<00:00:31.500> they're<00:00:32.130> on<00:00:32.309> three<00:00:33.090> different

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
suddenly they're on three different

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.060 
suddenly they're on three different
medications<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.989> still<00:00:34.140> having<00:00:34.410> seizures<00:00:34.890> I

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
medications and still having seizures I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.340 
medications and still having seizures I
think<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.430> was<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.270> parents<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.020> frankly

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
think that was the parents and frankly

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.369 
think that was the parents and frankly
my<00:00:37.500> main<00:00:38.370> concern<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> decided<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
my main concern so I decided to do a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.110 
my main concern so I decided to do a
population-based<00:00:41.160> study<00:00:41.610> using<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
population-based study using the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.900 
population-based study using the
Rochester<00:00:42.629> epidemiology<00:00:43.440> project<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.579> look

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
Rochester epidemiology project to look

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.549 
Rochester epidemiology project to look
at<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.180> very<00:00:45.390> question<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> risk

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
at that very question what is the risk

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.709 
at that very question what is the risk
of<00:00:46.739> intractable<00:00:47.129> epilepsy<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:48.210> children<00:00:48.600> who

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
of intractable epilepsy in children who

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.540 
of intractable epilepsy in children who
have<00:00:48.899> well<00:00:49.170> controlled<00:00:49.680> seizures<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.370> then

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
have well controlled seizures and then

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.950 
have well controlled seizures and then
have<00:00:50.730> their<00:00:50.940> anti-seizure<00:00:51.329> medication

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
have their anti-seizure medication

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.200 
have their anti-seizure medication
withdrawn<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.920> there<00:00:53.129> was<00:00:53.280> initially<00:00:53.579> about

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
withdrawn so there was initially about

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.470 
withdrawn so there was initially about
305<00:00:55.070> children<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.250> looked<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.000> then

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
305 children that I looked at and then

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.959 
305 children that I looked at and then
of<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.960> about<00:00:58.199> 250<00:00:59.100> really<00:00:59.399> fulfilled<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
of that about 250 really fulfilled the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.840 
of that about 250 really fulfilled the
criteria<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:00.480> epilepsy<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.820> that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
criteria for epilepsy and then of that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.469 
criteria for epilepsy and then of that
number<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:04.489> close<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.640> 40%<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.450> children

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
number about close to 40% of children

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.800 
number about close to 40% of children
actually<00:01:07.290> became<00:01:08.130> seizure<00:01:08.520> free<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.180> had

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
actually became seizure free and had

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.039 
actually became seizure free and had
their<00:01:10.020> seizure<00:01:10.290> medication<00:01:11.159> withdrawn<00:01:11.610> I

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
their seizure medication withdrawn I

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.929 
their seizure medication withdrawn I
then<00:01:13.049> looked<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.470> those<00:01:13.680> who<00:01:14.430> were<00:01:14.580> followed

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
then looked at those who were followed

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.840 
then looked at those who were followed
for<00:01:15.119> five<00:01:15.390> years<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.020> left<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:17.070> first<00:01:17.759> of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
for five years and left to see first of

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.399 
for five years and left to see first of
all<00:01:17.970> how<00:01:18.150> many<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.450> them<00:01:18.630> would<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.780> seizure

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
all how many of them would have seizure

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.580 
all how many of them would have seizure
recurrence<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.340> about<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> third<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.720> them<00:01:21.900> had

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
recurrence and about a third of them had

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.380 
recurrence and about a third of them had
seizure<00:01:22.860> recurrence<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.060> third

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
seizure recurrence and of that third

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.390 
seizure recurrence and of that third
more<00:01:24.810> than<00:01:24.960> half<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.320> them<00:01:25.500> occurred<00:01:25.860> within

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
more than half of them occurred within

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.760 
more than half of them occurred within
the<00:01:26.520> first<00:01:26.670> year<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.320> really<00:01:28.619> that

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the first year so that was really that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.200 
the first year so that was really that
that's<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> time<00:01:29.820> frame<00:01:30.030> where<00:01:30.180> we

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
that's really the time frame where we

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.600 
that's really the time frame where we
worry<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> most<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> first<00:01:31.200> year

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
worry the most is the first year

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.580 
worry the most is the first year
interestingly<00:01:32.610> enough<00:01:33.229> 20%<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.409> those

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
interestingly enough 20% of those

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.830 
interestingly enough 20% of those
children<00:01:35.009> had<00:01:35.579> seizure<00:01:35.880> recurrence<00:01:36.299> after

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
children had seizure recurrence after

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.219 
children had seizure recurrence after
being<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.259> number<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.860> years<00:01:38.100> seizure<00:01:38.369> free<00:01:39.229> so

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
being a number of years seizure free so

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
being a number of years seizure free so
then<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.590> looked<00:01:40.860> at<00:01:41.070> those<00:01:41.280> children<00:01:41.700> who<00:01:41.820> had

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
then I looked at those children who had

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.910 
then I looked at those children who had
seizure<00:01:42.270> recurrence<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.020> then<00:01:43.350> restarted

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
seizure recurrence and then restarted

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859 
seizure recurrence and then restarted
their<00:01:44.070> medication<00:01:44.579> which<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.909> about<00:01:45.119> 15<00:01:45.600> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
their medication which is about 15 and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.260 
their medication which is about 15 and
which<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.829> those<00:01:47.189> would<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.790> fulfill<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
which of those would really fulfill the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.450 
which of those would really fulfill the
criteria<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.810> having<00:01:49.439> intractable<00:01:50.009> epilepsy

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
criteria for having intractable epilepsy

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.440 
criteria for having intractable epilepsy
and<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.990> those<00:01:52.229> 15<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.740> was<00:01:52.829> 20%<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and of those 15 it was 20% so if the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690 
and of those 15 it was 20% so if the
overall<00:01:55.020> number<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.560> children<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.219> about<00:01:56.460> a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
overall number of children it's about a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.170 
overall number of children it's about a
5%<00:01:57.570> risk<00:01:58.100> now<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.310> may<00:01:59.399> seem<00:01:59.670> really<00:01:59.909> high

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
5% risk now that may seem really high

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.810 
5% risk now that may seem really high
but<00:02:00.719> that's<00:02:01.189> similar<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> risk<00:02:02.640> of

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
but that's similar to the risk of

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.420 
but that's similar to the risk of
intractable<00:02:03.180> epilepsy<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.439> any<00:02:05.130> child

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
intractable epilepsy just in any child

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.730 
intractable epilepsy just in any child
just<00:02:05.880> starting<00:02:06.210> medication

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
just starting medication

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.550 
just starting medication
and<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.400> solves<00:02:07.700> it's<00:02:08.000> also<00:02:08.179> pretty<00:02:08.420> similar<00:02:08.929> to

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
and I solves it's also pretty similar to

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.040 
and I solves it's also pretty similar to
the<00:02:09.950> risk<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.759> intractable<00:02:11.150> epilepsy<00:02:11.480> that's

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
the risk of intractable epilepsy that's

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.750 
the risk of intractable epilepsy that's
been<00:02:12.590> shown<00:02:12.770> in<00:02:12.950> other<00:02:13.040> population-based

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
been shown in other population-based

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.540 
been shown in other population-based
studies<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:15.110> it's<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> pretty<00:02:15.410> low<00:02:15.620> risk<00:02:15.830> so

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
studies so it's a pretty low risk so

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.089 
studies so it's a pretty low risk so
there's<00:02:16.819> two<00:02:17.390> terms<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:18.230> parents<00:02:18.860> will<00:02:18.980> hear

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
there's two terms that parents will hear

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.100 
there's two terms that parents will hear
the<00:02:19.280> most<00:02:19.459> one<00:02:19.849> a<00:02:19.880> seizure<00:02:20.270> disorder

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
the most one a seizure disorder

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.559 
the most one a seizure disorder
the<00:02:21.620> other<00:02:21.770> one<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.069> epilepsy<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.269> what<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.390> lot

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
the other one is epilepsy and what a lot

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:24.790 
the other one is epilepsy and what a lot
of<00:02:23.690> people<00:02:23.959> don't<00:02:24.080> know<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:24.680> the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
of people don't know is that it's the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.460 
of people don't know is that it's the
exact<00:02:25.010> same<00:02:25.040> thing<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.780> all<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.989> have<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.260> do

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
exact same thing and all you have to do

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.410 
exact same thing and all you have to do
to<00:02:27.680> get<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:27.860> diagnosis<00:02:28.519> of<00:02:28.670> seizure<00:02:28.970> disorder

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
to get a diagnosis of seizure disorder

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.110 
to get a diagnosis of seizure disorder
or<00:02:29.540> epilepsy<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:30.290> have<00:02:30.500> two<00:02:30.739> or<00:02:30.890> more

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
or epilepsy is have two or more

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.600 
or epilepsy is have two or more
recurrent<00:02:32.120> unprovoked<00:02:32.780> seizures<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.310> may

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
recurrent unprovoked seizures so you may

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.070 
recurrent unprovoked seizures so you may
say<00:02:34.790> well<00:02:34.970> what's<00:02:35.150> an<00:02:35.300> unprovoked<00:02:35.660> seizure

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
say well what's an unprovoked seizure

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.170 
say well what's an unprovoked seizure
that's<00:02:36.470> something<00:02:37.280> that's<00:02:37.430> not<00:02:37.610> caused<00:02:37.910> by<00:02:38.060> a

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
that's something that's not caused by a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.789 
that's something that's not caused by a
high<00:02:38.450> fever<00:02:38.750> in<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.140> small<00:02:39.350> child<00:02:39.590> like<00:02:39.769> a

high fever in a small child like a

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.220 
high fever in a small child like a

of those to get you the diagnosis of

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.350 
of those to get you the diagnosis of
epilepsy<00:02:54.220> anyone<00:02:55.220> who<00:02:55.370> has<00:02:55.580> one<00:02:55.790> seizure<00:02:56.090> has

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
epilepsy anyone who has one seizure has

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.210 
epilepsy anyone who has one seizure has
about<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.630> 50%<00:02:57.260> risk<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.560> having<00:02:57.650> another<00:02:58.010> one

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
about a 50% risk of having another one

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.699 
about a 50% risk of having another one
but<00:02:59.060> by<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.239> time<00:02:59.450> you've<00:02:59.630> had<00:02:59.660> more<00:03:00.290> than<00:03:00.530> two

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
but by the time you've had more than two

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.559 
but by the time you've had more than two
the<00:03:01.220> risk<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.549> having<00:03:01.670> another<00:03:02.030> seizure<00:03:02.299> is

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
the risk of having another seizure is

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.380 
the risk of having another seizure is
very<00:03:02.780> high<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:04.549> as<00:03:04.760> far<00:03:04.940> as<00:03:05.000> what's

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
very high and as far as what's

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.320 
very high and as far as what's
considered<00:03:05.830> intractable<00:03:06.830> that<00:03:07.790> definition

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
considered intractable that definition

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.770 
considered intractable that definition
can<00:03:08.660> vary<00:03:08.930> depending<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.470> where<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.769> are<00:03:09.920> but

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
can vary depending on where you are but

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.690 
can vary depending on where you are but
the<00:03:11.780> big<00:03:11.930> picture<00:03:12.140> is<00:03:12.380> that<00:03:12.890> these<00:03:13.519> are

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
the big picture is that these are

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.699 
the big picture is that these are
children<00:03:13.970> or<00:03:14.390> adults<00:03:14.600> who<00:03:14.810> have<00:03:15.200> recurrent

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
children or adults who have recurrent

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.030 
children or adults who have recurrent
seizures<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:16.880> have<00:03:17.090> not<00:03:17.299> responded<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:18.079> at

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
seizures that have not responded to at

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.370 
seizures that have not responded to at
least<00:03:19.310> two<00:03:19.579> usually<00:03:19.880> three<00:03:20.450> medications<00:03:21.140> at

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
least two usually three medications at

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.310 
least two usually three medications at
the<00:03:21.829> highest<00:03:22.040> tolerated<00:03:22.760> doses<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:23.989> these<00:03:24.140> are

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
the highest tolerated doses so these are

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.170 
the highest tolerated doses so these are
seizures<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.519> are<00:03:25.609> very<00:03:25.730> hard<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:25.970> control

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
seizures that are very hard to control

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.130 
seizures that are very hard to control
so<00:03:26.750> when<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.019> started<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.560> child<00:03:27.829> on<00:03:28.040> medication

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
so when I started a child on medication

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.210 
so when I started a child on medication
for<00:03:30.140> most<00:03:30.290> parents<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.769> is<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.010> first

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
for most parents that is the first

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.920 
for most parents that is the first
question<00:03:31.609> they<00:03:31.880> ask<00:03:32.030> how<00:03:32.359> long<00:03:32.480> does<00:03:32.750> my<00:03:32.900> child

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
question they ask how long does my child

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.750 
question they ask how long does my child
need<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.350> take<00:03:33.500> this<00:03:33.620> medication<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.370> what

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
need to take this medication and what

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.039 
need to take this medication and what
are<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.940> long-term<00:03:35.120> side<00:03:35.480> effects<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:35.870> can't

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
are the long-term side effects and can't

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.660 
are the long-term side effects and can't
they<00:03:36.200> stop<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:37.069> I<00:03:37.130> think<00:03:37.160> there's<00:03:37.489> a<00:03:37.549> number

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
they stop and I think there's a number

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.690 
they stop and I think there's a number
of<00:03:37.880> reasons<00:03:38.030> why<00:03:38.720> they<00:03:38.989> ask<00:03:39.170> that<00:03:39.470> for<00:03:40.459> one

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
of reasons why they ask that for one

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.030 
of reasons why they ask that for one
which<00:03:40.880> is<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.120> most<00:03:41.239> basic<00:03:41.500> it's<00:03:42.500> sometimes

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
which is the most basic it's sometimes

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.680 
which is the most basic it's sometimes
difficult<00:03:43.250> to<00:03:43.549> get<00:03:43.760> medication<00:03:44.209> into

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
difficult to get medication into

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.630 
difficult to get medication into
children<00:03:45.140> they<00:03:45.799> don't<00:03:45.920> like<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.220> take<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.489> and

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
children they don't like to take it and

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.000 
children they don't like to take it and
they<00:03:46.700> don't<00:03:46.880> understand<00:03:47.269> why<00:03:47.390> they<00:03:47.510> have<00:03:47.630> to

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
they don't understand why they have to

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.199 
they don't understand why they have to
the<00:03:49.010> other<00:03:49.160> thing<00:03:49.400> is<00:03:49.609> it's<00:03:49.880> sometimes

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
the other thing is it's sometimes

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.180 
the other thing is it's sometimes
difficult<00:03:50.389> to<00:03:50.840> remember<00:03:51.109> to<00:03:51.620> give<00:03:51.769> medication

difficult to remember to give medication
to<00:03:52.519> children<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.769> we<00:03:54.769> don't<00:03:54.950> like<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.340> give

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
to children so we don't like to give

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.039 
to children so we don't like to give
them<00:03:55.609> any<00:03:55.790> more<00:03:55.910> medicine<00:03:56.389> than<00:03:56.420> necessary

and<00:03:58.000> another<00:03:59.000> thing<00:03:59.329> to<00:03:59.480> think<00:03:59.510> about<00:03:59.720> is<00:04:00.049> up

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
and another thing to think about is up

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.340 
and another thing to think about is up
to<00:04:00.590> this<00:04:00.739> point<00:04:01.450> very<00:04:02.450> few<00:04:02.810> if<00:04:02.900> any<00:04:03.019> of<00:04:03.170> the

to this point very few if any of the

ten<00:04:07.700> days<00:04:07.850> of<00:04:07.970> antibiotics<00:04:08.090> for<00:04:08.540> an<00:04:08.630> ear

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
infection and then that makes the ear

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.640 
infection and then that makes the ear
infection<00:04:10.519> go<00:04:10.670> away<00:04:10.910> so<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:12.139> lot<00:04:12.350> of<00:04:12.440> times

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
should make the seizures go away and

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.129 
should make the seizures go away and
that's<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.259> that's<00:04:20.009> a<00:04:20.130> misnomer<00:04:20.400> for

they're<00:04:32.460> anti-seizure<00:04:33.030> medications<00:04:33.720> so

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
they're anti-seizure medications so

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.050 
they're anti-seizure medications so
that's<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.800> first<00:04:35.009> part<00:04:35.130> it's<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.430> chronic

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
that's the first part it's a chronic

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.129 
that's the first part it's a chronic
medication<00:04:36.539> and<00:04:36.690> it's<00:04:36.780> their<00:04:36.930> first

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
medication and it's their first

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.370 
medication and it's their first
experience<00:04:37.669> the<00:04:38.669> second<00:04:39.240> part<00:04:39.449> is<00:04:39.810> none<00:04:40.349> of

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
these medications are without side

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.850 
these medications are without side
effects<00:04:42.120> these<00:04:43.080> are<00:04:43.199> medications<00:04:43.530> that

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
effects these are medications that

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.529 
effects these are medications that
affect<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.190> brain<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:44.789> they're<00:04:44.910> very<00:04:44.940> likely

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
affect the brain so they're very likely

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.779 
affect the brain so they're very likely
to<00:04:45.780> have<00:04:45.930> high<00:04:46.110> side<00:04:46.380> effects<00:04:46.740> if<00:04:47.099> you<00:04:47.580> think

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
to have high side effects if you think

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.939 
to have high side effects if you think
about<00:04:47.970> how<00:04:48.210> anti-seizure<00:04:48.870> medications<00:04:49.590> work

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
about how anti-seizure medications work

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.740 
about how anti-seizure medications work
their<00:04:50.729> goal<00:04:50.940> is<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.210> decrease<00:04:51.389> the

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
their goal is to decrease the

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.320 
their goal is to decrease the
excitability<00:04:52.139> of<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.710> brain<00:04:53.030> well<00:04:54.030> it's<00:04:54.210> that

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
excitability of the brain well it's that

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.969 
excitability of the brain well it's that
same<00:04:54.570> excitability<00:04:55.080> that's<00:04:55.470> important<00:04:55.860> for

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
same excitability that's important for

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.670 
same excitability that's important for
learning<00:04:56.570> so<00:04:57.570> we<00:04:57.599> always<00:04:57.870> worry<00:04:58.229> that<00:04:58.320> it

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
learning so we always worry that it

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.650 
learning so we always worry that it
might<00:04:59.009> cause<00:04:59.250> some<00:04:59.280> cognitive<00:04:59.669> slowing<00:05:00.419> and

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
might cause some cognitive slowing and

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.270 
might cause some cognitive slowing and
difficulty<00:05:01.229> learning<00:05:01.410> that's<00:05:01.949> a<00:05:02.070> pretty

difficulty learning that's a pretty

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.610 
order to keep them safe like I said it
was<00:05:43.620> a<00:05:44.360> vast<00:05:45.360> minority<00:05:45.570> of<00:05:46.050> children<00:05:46.080> who

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
was a vast minority of children who

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.129 
was a vast minority of children who
developed<00:05:47.039> intractable<00:05:47.430> epilepsy<00:05:47.789> and<00:05:48.509> still

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
developed intractable epilepsy and still

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.659 
developed intractable epilepsy and still
a<00:05:49.169> minority<00:05:49.620> who<00:05:49.830> even<00:05:50.159> had<00:05:50.370> seizure

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
a minority who even had seizure

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.029 
a minority who even had seizure
recurrence<00:05:51.270> but<00:05:51.990> the<00:05:52.080> next<00:05:52.320> step<00:05:52.500> is<00:05:52.710> to<00:05:52.889> look

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
recurrence but the next step is to look

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.029 
recurrence but the next step is to look
at<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.310> risk<00:05:53.520> factors<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.150> go<00:05:54.300> back<00:05:54.539> even<00:05:55.259> ten

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
at the risk factors to go back even ten

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:57.710 
at the risk factors to go back even ten
years<00:05:56.220> prior<00:05:56.400> to<00:05:56.639> increase<00:05:56.970> our<00:05:57.150> numbers<00:05:57.479> and

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
years prior to increase our numbers and

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.959 
years prior to increase our numbers and
see<00:05:58.469> if<00:05:58.560> we<00:05:58.650> can<00:05:58.830> predict<00:05:59.190> who<00:05:59.580> would<00:05:59.729> be<00:05:59.849> the

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
see if we can predict who would be the

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:01.879 
see if we can predict who would be the
children<00:06:00.360> who<00:06:01.080> are<00:06:01.139> more<00:06:01.349> likely<00:06:01.530> to<00:06:01.740> have

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
children who are more likely to have

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.550 
children who are more likely to have
seizure<00:06:02.159> recurrence<00:06:03.050> there's<00:06:04.050> a<00:06:04.139> lot<00:06:04.440> of

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
something that's not very well known we

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.290 
something that's not very well known we
don't<00:06:10.949> know<00:06:11.099> what<00:06:11.340> makes<00:06:11.580> this<00:06:12.000> child
