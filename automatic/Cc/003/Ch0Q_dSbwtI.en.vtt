00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
a really pretty color that I figured I

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.280 
a really pretty color that I figured I
would<00:00:44.760> go<00:00:44.910> ahead<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.270> swatch<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.840> then<00:00:46.050> I

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
would go ahead and swatch it then I

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.380 
would go ahead and swatch it then I
don't<00:00:46.920> think<00:00:47.130> it's<00:00:47.280> worth<00:00:47.490> uploading<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.270> video

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
don't think it's worth uploading a video

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.690 
don't think it's worth uploading a video
about<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.870> entire<00:00:49.200> kit<00:00:49.590> because<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.310> mostly

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
about the entire kit because it's mostly

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.150 
about the entire kit because it's mostly
sample<00:00:51.240> size<00:00:51.450> stuff<00:00:51.900> some<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.010> I've

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
sample size stuff some of it I've

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.220 
sample size stuff some of it I've
already<00:00:53.520> done<00:00:53.640> reviews<00:00:54.090> about<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.050> one

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
already done reviews about like the one

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.540 
already done reviews about like the one
that<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> chose<00:00:55.740> it's<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.340> has<00:00:56.400> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
that I chose it's the one that has the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.840 
that I chose it's the one that has the
Murad<00:00:57.150> cleanser<00:00:57.690> which<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.050> really<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.850> but

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
Murad cleanser which I really like but

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.150 
Murad cleanser which I really like but
this<00:01:00.150> is<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.690> thing<00:01:00.900> that<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.140> thought<00:01:01.380> I'd<00:01:01.950> go

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
this is one thing that I thought I'd go

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.770 
this is one thing that I thought I'd go
ahead<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.550> upload<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.850> video<00:01:03.090> about<00:01:03.390> because

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
ahead and upload a video about because

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.450 
ahead and upload a video about because
then<00:01:04.050> you<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.380> swatch<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.220> what<00:01:05.370> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
then you can swatch it and see what it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.140 
then you can swatch it and see what it
looks<00:01:05.640> like

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
looks like

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.250 
looks like
so<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.670> an<00:01:08.850> actual<00:01:09.150> pencil<00:01:09.570> so

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
so it's this it is an actual pencil so

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.109 
so it's this it is an actual pencil so
you're<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.160> like<00:01:11.490> shave<00:01:11.880> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
down eventually kind of thing it doesn't

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.940

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
this beautiful color and it's kind of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.490 
this beautiful color and it's kind of
along<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.990> lines<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.800> NARS<00:01:23.280> orgasm<00:01:24.080> but<00:01:25.080> it's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
along the lines of NARS orgasm but it's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.710 
along the lines of NARS orgasm but it's
more<00:01:26.490> pink<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.479> than<00:01:27.990> NARS<00:01:28.320> orgasm<00:01:29.720> so

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
more pink I think than NARS orgasm so

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.210 
more pink I think than NARS orgasm so
it's<00:01:30.869> kind<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.140> large<00:01:31.350> swatch<00:01:31.680> there<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.190> I

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
it's kind of a large swatch there so I

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.770 
it's kind of a large swatch there so I
just<00:01:32.460> wanted<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.910> make<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.210> big<00:01:33.360> enough<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.750> you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
just wanted to make it big enough so you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.130 
just wanted to make it big enough so you
could<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> color<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> reminded<00:01:37.080> me

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
could see the color but it reminded me

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.800 
could see the color but it reminded me
of<00:01:37.350> NARS<00:01:37.800> orgasm<00:01:38.100> when<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:38.790> first<00:01:39.120> watched<00:01:39.480> it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
of NARS orgasm when I first watched it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.230 
of NARS orgasm when I first watched it
but<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:40.500> after<00:01:40.890> kind<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.220> looking<00:01:41.580> at<00:01:41.760> it<00:01:41.970> it

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
but then after kind of looking at it it

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.530 
but then after kind of looking at it it
looks<00:01:42.480> a<00:01:42.690> little<00:01:42.810> bit<00:01:43.050> more<00:01:43.350> darker<00:01:44.280> more<00:01:45.150> pink

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
looks a little bit more darker more pink

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.720 
looks a little bit more darker more pink
in<00:01:45.780> my<00:01:46.020> mind<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.680> still<00:01:46.950> has<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> really

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
in my mind it still has a really

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.870 
in my mind it still has a really
beautiful<00:01:48.150> gold<00:01:48.840> sheen<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:49.680> which<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.760> why

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
beautiful gold sheen to it which is why

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.180 
beautiful gold sheen to it which is why
it<00:01:50.940> reminds<00:01:51.330> me<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.540> NARS<00:01:51.810> orgasm<00:01:52.080> but<00:01:53.040> it's

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
it reminds me of NARS orgasm but it's

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.670
