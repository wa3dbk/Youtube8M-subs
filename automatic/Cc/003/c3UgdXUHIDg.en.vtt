bad as you know it's definitely not as

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.910 
bad as you know it's definitely not as

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
bad as it would normally would be if I

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.219 
bad as it would normally would be if I

with a lot of the volumizing mousse and
gels<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.700> everything<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.300> they<00:03:12.510> women<00:03:12.720> weigh

my hair down which kind of defeats the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.440 
my hair down which kind of defeats the
purpose<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:16.190> volumizing<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.700> does<00:03:18.000> not<00:03:18.180> do

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
purpose of volumizing this does not do

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.690 
purpose of volumizing this does not do
this<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:19.170> put<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.440> ton<00:03:19.830> of<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.160> in<00:03:20.340> my<00:03:20.459> hair<00:03:20.670> I

Revlon ionizer I don't know it's this

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.140 
Revlon ionizer I don't know it's this
little<00:03:39.829> gosh<00:03:40.829> it's<00:03:41.040> got<00:03:41.190> hair<00:03:41.400> in<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.610> but<00:03:42.000> it's

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
hair I flip my hair upside down and I

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.159 
hair I flip my hair upside down and I
blow-dry<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.430> 100%<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.359> way<00:04:17.479> upside<00:04:17.959> down

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
blow-dry it 100% of the way upside down

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.349 
blow-dry it 100% of the way upside down
and<00:04:18.500> then<00:04:18.919> when<00:04:19.039> I<00:04:19.070> flip<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.430> back<00:04:19.549> over<00:04:19.759> I<00:04:19.970> comb

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
and then when I flip it back over I comb

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.629 
and then when I flip it back over I comb
it<00:04:20.479> out<00:04:20.660> and<00:04:20.959> what<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.500> does<00:04:21.709> is<00:04:21.979> because<00:04:22.490> of

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
it out and what it does is because of

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.850 
it out and what it does is because of
the<00:04:22.729> thickening<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.449> kind<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:23.930> softens<00:04:24.440> the

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
the thickening it kind of softens the

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.460 
the thickening it kind of softens the
layers<00:04:25.400> out<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:26.120> that<00:04:26.630> way<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:26.840> don't<00:04:27.050> have<00:04:27.289> to

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
layers out and that way I don't have to

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.770 
layers out and that way I don't have to
do<00:04:27.590> step<00:04:27.889> two<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.759> cell<00:04:28.970> phone<00:04:29.180> out<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.539> kind

obviously if you have wavy or curly hair
you<00:05:19.099> might<00:05:19.250> have<00:05:19.460> to<00:05:19.550> deal<00:05:19.729> with<00:05:19.759> something<00:05:20.150> a

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
you might have to deal with something a

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.300 
you might have to deal with something a
little<00:05:20.449> bit<00:05:20.599> more<00:05:21.320> with<00:05:21.500> it<00:05:21.680> but<00:05:22.159> I'm<00:05:22.280> pretty

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
little bit more with it but I'm pretty

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.070 
little bit more with it but I'm pretty
sure<00:05:22.580> if<00:05:22.820> you<00:05:22.849> have<00:05:23.000> curly<00:05:23.360> hair<00:05:23.389> you<00:05:23.599> already

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
sure if you have curly hair you already

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.899 
sure if you have curly hair you already
have<00:05:24.259> some<00:05:24.530> kind<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.800> natural<00:05:25.009> volume<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.729> it

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909 
have some kind of natural volume to it

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.879 
have some kind of natural volume to it
see<00:05:26.300> this<00:05:26.659> probably<00:05:26.900> won't<00:05:27.169> work<00:05:27.320> for<00:05:27.590> you<00:05:27.680> but

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
see this probably won't work for you but

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.430 
see this probably won't work for you but
if<00:05:27.979> you<00:05:28.070> do<00:05:28.220> have<00:05:28.460> fine<00:05:28.789> straight<00:05:29.210> hair<00:05:29.449> I

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
if you do have fine straight hair I

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.930 
if you do have fine straight hair I
think<00:05:30.710> this<00:05:31.070> is<00:05:31.220> a<00:05:31.250> really<00:05:31.520> really<00:05:31.820> great

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
think this is a really really great

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.120 
think this is a really really great
product<00:05:32.419> the<00:05:32.900> second<00:05:33.289> thing<00:05:33.440> I<00:05:33.530> love<00:05:33.740> about<00:05:33.949> it

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
product the second thing I love about it

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.589 
product the second thing I love about it
is<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:34.370> fact<00:05:34.729> that<00:05:34.789> it<00:05:34.970> doesn't<00:05:35.270> weigh<00:05:35.330> your

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
is the fact that it doesn't weigh your

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.629 
is the fact that it doesn't weigh your
hair<00:05:35.659> down<00:05:35.840> like<00:05:36.320> I<00:05:36.409> said<00:05:36.620> I<00:05:36.650> tried<00:05:37.280> a<00:05:37.310> lot<00:05:37.520> of

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
hair down like I said I tried a lot of

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.089 
hair down like I said I tried a lot of
products<00:05:38.000> before<00:05:38.419> and<00:05:38.720> they<00:05:39.380> all<00:05:39.560> tend<00:05:39.949> to

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
products before and they all tend to

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.810 
products before and they all tend to
maybe<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:41.090> know<00:05:41.240> make<00:05:41.479> this<00:05:41.720> look<00:05:42.250> fuller<00:05:43.250> but

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
maybe you know make this look fuller but

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.810 
maybe you know make this look fuller but
then<00:05:44.000> here<00:05:44.630> it's<00:05:45.470> kind<00:05:45.710> of<00:05:45.770> flat<00:05:46.099> and<00:05:46.430> I<00:05:46.639> mean

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
then here it's kind of flat and I mean

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.760 
then here it's kind of flat and I mean
literally<00:05:47.090> like<00:05:47.300> this<00:05:47.690> so<00:05:48.020> it's<00:05:48.169> like<00:05:48.320> defeats

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
literally like this so it's like defeats

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.740 
literally like this so it's like defeats
the<00:05:48.919> purpose<00:05:49.099> of<00:05:49.520> having<00:05:49.880> that<00:05:50.240> you<00:05:50.509> know

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
the purpose of having that you know

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.210 
the purpose of having that you know
volume<00:05:51.320> and<00:05:51.470> stuff<00:05:51.620> like<00:05:51.710> that<00:05:51.889> throughout

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
volume and stuff like that throughout

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.370 
volume and stuff like that throughout
the<00:05:52.370> whole<00:05:52.520> hair<00:05:52.759> I<00:05:53.000> had<00:05:53.659> that<00:05:53.870> with<00:05:54.139> the

put my hair up in a ponytail because it

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.779

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:06.580 
did give fullness out of the bottom but
it<00:06:04.880> didn't<00:06:05.180> give<00:06:05.300> any<00:06:05.479> fullness<00:06:05.960> or<00:06:06.229> anything

fact<00:06:14.750> that<00:06:14.900> it<00:06:15.080> does<00:06:15.289> not<00:06:15.469> make<00:06:15.979> my<00:06:16.190> hair

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
the fourth thing I like about it is it

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.630 
the fourth thing I like about it is it
is<00:06:48.110> cheap<00:06:48.440> it's<00:06:48.950> something<00:06:49.310> that<00:06:49.430> you<00:06:49.490> can

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640

is cheap it's something that you can
pick<00:06:49.760> up<00:06:49.940> anywhere<00:06:50.570> I<00:06:50.600> picked<00:06:50.990> it<00:06:51.080> up<00:06:51.170> at

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.380 
pick up anywhere I picked it up at
Walmart<00:06:51.530> I've<00:06:51.920> seen<00:06:52.160> that<00:06:52.310> CVS<00:06:52.760> I've<00:06:53.030> seen<00:06:53.240> it

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
Walmart I've seen that CVS I've seen it

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.480 
Walmart I've seen that CVS I've seen it
at<00:06:53.510> Walgreens<00:06:53.720> so<00:06:54.620> it's<00:06:54.770> definitely<00:06:55.220> a

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
at Walgreens so it's definitely a

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.360 
at Walgreens so it's definitely a
product<00:06:55.940> that<00:06:56.120> you<00:06:56.300> can<00:06:56.330> get<00:06:56.720> at<00:06:57.530> a<00:06:57.770> drugstore

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
product that you can get at a drugstore

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.010 
product that you can get at a drugstore
whatever<00:06:58.910> you<00:06:59.060> don't<00:06:59.150> necessarily<00:06:59.840> have<00:06:59.990> to

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
whatever you don't necessarily have to

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.690 
whatever you don't necessarily have to
go<00:07:00.200> to<00:07:00.230> Ulta<00:07:00.680> for<00:07:00.920> it

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700 
go to Ulta for it

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.130 
go to Ulta for it
but<00:07:01.970> it's<00:07:02.210> cheap<00:07:02.480> but<00:07:02.660> like<00:07:02.750> I<00:07:02.840> said<00:07:02.900> I<00:07:03.020> think

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.140 
but it's cheap but like I said I think

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.160 
but it's cheap but like I said I think
it<00:07:03.380> was<00:07:03.530> five<00:07:04.160> six<00:07:04.520> seven<00:07:05.030> dollars<00:07:05.150> I<00:07:05.690> don't

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.170 
it was five six seven dollars I don't

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.750 
it was five six seven dollars I don't
think<00:07:06.320> it<00:07:06.410> was<00:07:06.470> more<00:07:06.680> than<00:07:06.860> seven<00:07:07.160> dollars<00:07:07.250> so

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
think it was more than seven dollars so

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.200 
think it was more than seven dollars so
I<00:07:07.790> really<00:07:08.300> really<00:07:08.420> like<00:07:08.720> that<00:07:09.400> so<00:07:10.400> that<00:07:10.820> is<00:07:11.000> it

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
I really really like that so that is it

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.060

that OH
over<00:07:27.290> time<00:07:27.560> it's<00:07:27.770> gonna<00:07:27.890> help<00:07:28.100> your<00:07:28.310> hair

anything<00:07:28.700> like<00:07:28.910> that<00:07:28.970> if<00:07:29.390> that's<00:07:29.750> where<00:07:29.870> the

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020 
anything like that if that's where the

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.050 
anything like that if that's where the
first<00:07:30.320> or<00:07:30.530> second<00:07:30.890> try<00:07:31.070> you<00:07:31.130> don't<00:07:31.400> like<00:07:31.670> it

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.060

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:33.410 
you're probably not gonna like it after

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.310 
you're probably not gonna like it after
the<00:07:33.650> fifth<00:07:33.860> six<00:07:34.160> or<00:07:34.370> tenth<00:07:34.700> time<00:07:35.140> so<00:07:36.140> it's

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:36.320 
the fifth six or tenth time so it's

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.720 
the fifth six or tenth time so it's
definitely<00:07:36.650> something<00:07:36.710> that<00:07:37.100> you<00:07:37.310> can<00:07:37.490> try
