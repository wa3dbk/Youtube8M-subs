pliers instead of round nose pliers
definitely<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.549> can<00:03:28.699> make<00:03:28.879> loops<00:03:29.359> with<00:03:29.599> round

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
definitely you can make loops with round

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.080 
definitely you can make loops with round
nose<00:03:30.079> pliers<00:03:30.319> but<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.680> love<00:03:31.069> these<00:03:31.819> wire

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
nose pliers but I love these wire

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.369 
nose pliers but I love these wire
looping<00:03:32.389> pliers<00:03:32.449> because<00:03:32.930> they<00:03:33.049> do<00:03:33.109> some<00:03:33.349> of

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
looping pliers because they do some of

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.720 
looping pliers because they do some of
the<00:03:33.500> work<00:03:33.530> for<00:03:33.919> me<00:03:33.949> I'm<00:03:34.310> sure<00:03:34.519> you've<00:03:34.699> seen

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
the work for me I'm sure you've seen

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.589 
the work for me I'm sure you've seen
them<00:03:35.060> in<00:03:35.090> my<00:03:35.269> other<00:03:35.480> videos<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:38.120> am<00:03:38.299> going<00:03:38.510> to

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
them in my other videos so I am going to

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.300 
them in my other videos so I am going to
actually<00:03:38.690> make<00:03:39.079> a<00:03:39.109> simple<00:03:39.530> wrapped<00:03:39.769> wire<00:03:40.040> loop

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
actually make a simple wrapped wire loop

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.580 
actually make a simple wrapped wire loop
in<00:03:40.489> this<00:03:40.609> case<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.239> could<00:03:42.019> have<00:03:42.139> made<00:03:42.349> a<00:03:42.530> simple

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
in this case I could have made a simple

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.430 
in this case I could have made a simple
loop<00:03:43.129> if<00:03:43.480> you're<00:03:44.480> going<00:03:44.629> to<00:03:44.810> do<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.109> just

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
loop if you're going to do that just

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.439 
loop if you're going to do that just
make<00:03:45.560> sure<00:03:45.829> your<00:03:46.040> loop<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:46.459> big<00:03:46.760> enough<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.299> get

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
make sure your loop is big enough to get

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:56.099 
make sure your loop is big enough to get
around<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.019> wire<00:03:48.260> part<00:03:48.919> of<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.250> bracelet<00:03:49.579> I

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.069 

do<00:03:57.109> that<00:03:57.260> with<00:03:57.410> my<00:03:57.530> other<00:03:57.560> baubles<00:03:58.190> as<00:03:58.400> well

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
think that's a nice thing to do see I

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.430 
think that's a nice thing to do see I
made<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.480> loop<00:04:59.630> a<00:04:59.720> little<00:04:59.930> bit<00:05:00.050> different<00:05:00.380> I

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
made that loop a little bit different I

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.800 
made that loop a little bit different I
grabbed<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:00.830> with<00:05:00.950> my<00:05:01.190> pliers<00:05:01.850> which<00:05:02.390> is<00:05:02.570> a

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
grabbed it with my pliers which is a

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.290 
grabbed it with my pliers which is a
good<00:05:03.169> way<00:05:03.290> of<00:05:03.320> doing<00:05:03.470> it<00:05:03.710> to<00:05:04.060> clean<00:05:05.060> up<00:05:05.180> my

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
good way of doing it to clean up my

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.430 
good way of doing it to clean up my
loops<00:05:05.510> as<00:05:05.690> I<00:05:05.840> go<00:05:07.690> now<00:05:08.690> I've<00:05:08.990> got<00:05:09.169> everything

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
loops as I go now I've got everything

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.290 
loops as I go now I've got everything
ready<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:09.950> attach<00:05:10.280> normally<00:05:10.880> I'd<00:05:10.970> let<00:05:11.150> that

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
ready to attach normally I'd let that

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.830 
ready to attach normally I'd let that
dry<00:05:11.720> for<00:05:11.960> you<00:05:12.710> know<00:05:12.800> an<00:05:12.890> hour<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.810> before<00:05:14.810> I

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840
