00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
there are the bacteria the viruses and

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.599 
there are the bacteria the viruses and
all<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.269> thing<00:00:48.589> they<00:00:49.589> still<00:00:50.069> learn<00:00:50.339> how<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
all this thing they still learn how to

all this thing they still learn how to
be<00:00:50.999> war<00:00:51.799> okay<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.760> tumor<00:00:54.409> like<00:00:55.409> this<00:00:55.709> they<00:00:56.370> do

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:56.549 
be war okay like tumor like this they do

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:01.309 
be war okay like tumor like this they do
a<00:00:56.579> wall<00:00:57.620> that<00:00:58.620> means<00:00:59.179> our<00:01:00.179> defense<00:01:01.019> system

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:01.319 
a wall that means our defense system

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:04.009 
a wall that means our defense system
cannot<00:01:01.649> break<00:01:01.920> through<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.839> they<00:01:03.839> cannot

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
cannot break through it they cannot

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.289 
cannot break through it they cannot
break<00:01:04.260> through<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.640> don't<00:01:05.700> know<00:01:05.970> they

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
break through it and I don't know they

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.200 
break through it and I don't know they
don't<00:01:06.540> develop<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:07.320> cannon<00:01:08.040> okay<00:01:08.700> they<00:01:09.120> don't

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
don't develop a cannon okay they don't

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.420 
don't develop a cannon okay they don't
develop<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.690> can<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.110> anything<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.860> break<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
develop I can on anything to break the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.210 
develop I can on anything to break the
wall<00:01:11.640> okay<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.230> they<00:01:13.380> still<00:01:13.680> cannot<00:01:14.070> do

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
wall okay so they still cannot do

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.040 
wall okay so they still cannot do
anything<00:01:14.690> so<00:01:15.690> assist<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.650> keep<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:16.980> growing

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
anything so assist you keep on growing

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.560 
anything so assist you keep on growing
so<00:01:19.050> they<00:01:19.440> discover<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.760> project

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
so they discover that if we can project

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.170 
so they discover that if we can project
a<00:01:21.840> chin<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.620> when<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.400> cut<00:01:23.670> into<00:01:23.940> it<00:01:24.060> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
a chin I and when you cut into it you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.040 
a chin I and when you cut into it you
can<00:01:24.630> actually<00:01:24.780> penetrate<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.760> okay<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:27.050> that

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
can actually penetrate it okay and that

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.810 
can actually penetrate it okay and that
is<00:01:28.230> why<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.560> chin<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.100> are<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.580> powerful

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
is why the chin I are so powerful

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.380 
is why the chin I are so powerful
anything<00:01:30.510> anything<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:31.260> want<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.210> call

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
knife had the power to penetrate to it

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.780 
knife had the power to penetrate to it
okay<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:51.480> your<00:01:51.780> Chi<00:01:52.190> so<00:01:53.190> it<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:53.640> hurt

okay and is your Chi so it don't hurt

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.180 
okay and is your Chi so it don't hurt
ourselves<00:01:54.710> okay<00:01:55.790> but<00:01:56.790> its<00:01:57.090> bacteria<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
ourselves okay but its bacteria or the

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.000 
ourselves okay but its bacteria or the
thing<00:01:59.400> not<00:01:59.550> right<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.120> break<00:02:00.510> through<00:02:00.690> it

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
thing not right you break through it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.370 
thing not right you break through it
okay<00:02:02.010> it<00:02:02.130> seemed<00:02:02.370> like<00:02:02.580> our<00:02:03.300> Chi<00:02:04.220> has

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
okay it seemed like our Chi has

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.589 
okay it seemed like our Chi has
intelligence<00:02:07.519> they<00:02:08.519> have<00:02:08.670> intelligence<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
intelligence they have intelligence and

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.860 
intelligence they have intelligence and
they<00:02:09.959> know<00:02:10.140> what<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.349> do<00:02:10.590> okay<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.389> that's<00:02:12.599> what

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
they know what to do okay so that's what

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.789 
they know what to do okay so that's what
the<00:02:12.989> chin<00:02:13.200> Nava

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
the chin Nava

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.000 
the chin Nava
so<00:02:14.659> everything<00:02:15.659> are<00:02:15.870> asked<00:02:16.409> did<00:02:16.590> she

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
so everything are asked did she

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.490 
so everything are asked did she
so<00:02:17.519> if<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:17.819> understand<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.540> you're<00:02:19.050> taking<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
so if we understand it you're taking the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.850 
so if we understand it you're taking the
chi<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.159> you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.180> use<00:02:21.360> them<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.530> theory

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
chi and you can use them so the theory

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.630 
chi and you can use them so the theory
is<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.040> same<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.879> cut<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.360> club<00:02:24.569> line<00:02:24.780> and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
is the same if you cut the club line and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.390 
is the same if you cut the club line and
take<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.730> out<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.690> hold<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.560> Chi<00:02:28.830> you

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
take it out and you hold the Chi you

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.240 
take it out and you hold the Chi you
think<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:30.030> Chi<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:31.560> protect<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> cheat

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250
