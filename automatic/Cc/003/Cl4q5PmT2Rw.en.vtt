00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.380
 ah 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.080
 or the woman at 106 gamer welcome a 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.090
 new video of pv the ward warcraft and 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.830
 I'm going to show you today to nothing that Mr. 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.070
 of the storm this dragon nimbus 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.829
 pretty cool that is in the 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.730
 thunder island an area that came out in the 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:31.219
 5.2 park of mishor pandaria where 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.770
 are the ruins of the ancient 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.690
 good empire the old citadel or 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.430
 as you want to call that I do not know 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.550
 of the king of thunder because there 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.989
 they find alak is a world boss who 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.660
 the truth is not very complicated either 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.730
 honestly it does not give us much problem of 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.140
 express the deep energy until I believe 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.390
 that there are no world bosses that really 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.929
 pose a challenge unless now in 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.460
 the patch 5.4 have come some boss 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:59.120
 of the world that yes that supposes him but of 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.249
 moment as I have not seen them then 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.710
 that there is before the peaceful point 4 no longer 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.570
 they are no challenge to the people and I'm going to 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.310
 tell you a little bit like that over the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.710
 skills that have this world leader 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.920
 which is not very complicated I repeat one of 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.180
 them is the arc of nova is a pulse of 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.400
 electric electrical energy that influences 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.940
 350,000 of harm nature is worth in a 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.010
 35 meter radius besides that repels 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.890
 to the players now I'm going to teach the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.290
 skill another skill is the collar of 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.300
 lightning let's say that in alak 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.550
 this is the lightning necklace tied 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.130
 several to several players likewise what 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.020
 that inflicts 10,000 look at this you have 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.600
 seen that's the big circle in the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.900
 ground because that is the arc of the nova 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.460
 lightning tutorial is those let's say 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.830
 those lightning bolts that you loose on 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.050
 random players and influences them well 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.420
 thousand damage nature every one second 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.390
 also 20,000 damage of nature 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.600
 extra if they are more than 30 meters from 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.300
 nothing and lasts approximately 15 seconds 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.670
 so it's an attack that is really 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.350
 for the damage that does not have to be 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.630
 keep it in mind if there are real 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.610
 there should not be much problem 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.410
 now you have to have that is the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.990
 necklace but yes you have to be careful 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.030
 with the nova bow you have to have 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.920
 careful looking at the ground the shield 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.010
 static the energy surrounding that 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.890
 inflicts 50,000 in the wild 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.010
 a second to a good orator player 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.390
 that yes can be also significant 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.349
 but neither so much storm cloud this 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.239
 place storm clouds over 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.269
 several players inform them that 50,000 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.640
 of damage every three seconds to all 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.959
 that are within a radius of 10 meters this 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.680
 yes you have to keep it in mind because 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.940
 if you stay in the storm cloud 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.799
 let's say that in the end it will end 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.319
 killing so you have to move it's worth 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.599
 well I repeat inflicts 50,000 of the year the 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.080
 new storm to the players to whom 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.000
 I put the cloud 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.630
 and in a radius of 10 meters then 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.400
 any player will take damage this 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.220
 what you see seeing again I repeat is 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.910
 the arc of nova and good and nothing falls and 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.740
 I think I would not let anything not the son 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.540
 the pro that is understood well more or less 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.280
 the skills that have what 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.020
 inflict the damage they do and what 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.000
 you have to do it's pretty simple 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.830
 because the nova arc simply 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.050
 you have to avoid it when you see what 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.490
 will punish leaving the big circle 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.100
 so that does not involve that amount of 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.450
 damage healing of lightning that almost 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.400
 you can not do anything but the damage that 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.040
 so it is not significant 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.870
 static shield well we could say 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.180
 Yes, but you do not have to look 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.040
 too much if the cables are attentive and 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.840
 the storm cloud there are also there 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.330
 to be fixed because you have to get rid of 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.330
 in the middle of it , a fucking man appears 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.319
 fuck 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.530
 this is the lord of the storm a video 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.900
 short but I wanted to settle the issue of 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.110
 the heads of the world and I will explain the 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.040
 new from park 5.4 made people 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.040
 enjoy chao
