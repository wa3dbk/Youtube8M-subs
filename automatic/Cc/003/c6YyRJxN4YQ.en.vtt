00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 crafter is said from a video review of 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.980
 mox for asia brush or point 5 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.290
 it is very well known that it is between super 8 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.509
 but and what can be the product of the two 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.030
 ways that the tri capi has been 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.640
 Hector for the PC and the trick per for the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 for minecraft and nothing will I show as 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.029
 always the installation below I leave you the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.250
 the download link that my way and 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.779
 I leave the link where I got the mode 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.170
 from an application of the place toriyama 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.050
 the sturdy bikes that's where he got it 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.640
 the mods and below I leave the link 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.710
 download of my a fire of the mo have to 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.920
 more is a mode and without package textures nor 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.370
 nothing will occupy the whole world 1.7 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.550
 points 7 minecraft 0.9 point 5 alpha and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.750
 so nothing now just here in the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.050
 key if it is above the seat 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.039
 at kraft amos we manage scripts and 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.170
 we import the motorcycle where we have it 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.390
 downloaded reiterated that we do not occupy now 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.550
 in this case unzip unzip 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.550
 sorry the mod then practically 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.050
 the moment you download it you do not have 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.690
 that unzip are not zip files 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.160
 but a point js good looking is the mod 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.440
 that as you can see here I have several 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.550
 modes and good as I downloaded here 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.940
 most of the many that's why I have 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.620
 so many just give a touch the 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.240
 mod that you want if for some reason 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.340
 it did not work for you because it's not 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.840
 compatible with your terminal or because it does not 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.670
 you have the updated version or because 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.770
 you have practically the mode activated 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.890
 sure or you just do not have 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.960
 currently or you do not have forgiveness in the 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.580
 video that will not be last and for nothing I'm going to 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.000
 show I'm going to make a quickie world 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.790
 guys here in new advanced flight and I'm going 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.590
 to review it mods i get isabel 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.590
 they take and we have guys to 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.780
 and I do not know why it says the previous one and everything 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.780
 that 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.920
 and I'm going to give you a word, I'm going to put it here 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 some links 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.650
 of different trees so why do they see 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.049
 that the mod serves and how it goes more or less 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.409
 the dynamics of it to put here not 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.349
 I know if I put some like this together this will grow 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.580
 it's my bullshit, you do not have to do it 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:13.650
 it's usually to grow some 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.650
 trees is 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.450
 de boer has set other uplinq 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.930
 I'm going to put enough trees for what 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.450
 you can put this better 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.390
 ok this does not grow this grows only 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.690
 in different land in which it grows 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.510
 is here 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.190
 I do not know where it grows that has me very 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.960
 estranged has never known where it grows 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.190
 but well, I'm going to try these 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.400
 trees when I already have that I'm going to 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.490
 change the survival mode I'm going to 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.430
 add me here with the take items e 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.710
 instruments I'm going to add me an ax 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.020
 of wood 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.550
 yes yes yes yes to see if later add 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.690
 wood 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.500
 stone add made of iron 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.670
 add 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.160
 ax of gold add and finally ax 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.420
 of diamond add now that we're going to 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.460
 do with this engine as you can see 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.400
 we are are five axes that are 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.910
 originally in minecraft and if I 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.220
 for example I want to cut this tree 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.440
 we see that from a metal nudge to all the 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.540
 tree if I want to cut with this 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.580
 it also cuts me what 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.860
 difference and you use some eight of 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.360
 some fact of another type there is no 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.650
 difference what happens is that well then 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.320
 practically some are faster 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.440
 that others or minecraft if you choose what 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.989
 here you can see what I eat is part 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.640
 of the tree if I am what I eat here 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.060
 this part but as you can see the 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.459
 gold is super fast 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.140
 the super fast euros look like 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.180
 cut the gold 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.560
 short super fast the gold and we see that 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.770
 we have all the wood pile 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.000
 Now I come and I take everything practically 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.310
 is an engine that saves us having to 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.410
 climb do not put blocks and have to 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.959
 cut trees that are large or trees 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.030
 that you do not simply have to webb to cut 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.370
 the grass so that metals everything 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.959
 just pull and throw them works 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.300
 with any type of tree and also 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.680
 any kind of fact works and 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.660
 they could do it was the whole reason I know that 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.640
 I have a little bit simple but good sumo 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.040
 great the simple truth is good from below 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.040
 everything they need for the mod 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.240
