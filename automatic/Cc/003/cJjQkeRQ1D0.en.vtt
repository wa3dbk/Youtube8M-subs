I<00:00:07.620> discovered<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:08.790> order<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.330> measure<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
I discovered in order to measure the

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.919 
I discovered in order to measure the
light<00:00:10.110> intensity<00:00:10.620> for<00:00:10.980> your<00:00:11.160> orchids<00:00:11.639> of

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
light intensity for your orchids of

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.360 
light intensity for your orchids of
course<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.139> can<00:00:13.349> go<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.799> buy<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> special

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
course you can go and buy a special

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.279 
course you can go and buy a special
device<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.480> measures<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.470> but<00:00:17.630> well<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.930> just

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
device that measures it but well I just

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.859 
device that measures it but well I just
burned<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.920> Katwe<00:00:20.279> leaf<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.060> I'm<00:00:21.330> very<00:00:21.539> bummed

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
burned a Katwe leaf and I'm very bummed

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.080 
burned a Katwe leaf and I'm very bummed
about<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.470> just<00:00:22.680> wanted<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.160> know<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
about it and I just wanted to know the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.230 
about it and I just wanted to know the
light<00:00:24.269> intensity<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.199> my<00:00:25.439> shade<00:00:26.599> now<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.930> SAP<00:00:28.320> so

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
light intensity of my shade now a SAP so

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.150 
light intensity of my shade now a SAP so
what<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.269> did<00:00:30.390> was<00:00:30.720> go<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.619> app<00:00:31.830> store<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
what I did was go to the app store and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.720 
what I did was go to the app store and
actually<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.090> discovered<00:00:33.840> an<00:00:33.989> app<00:00:34.610> which<00:00:35.610> is

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
actually I discovered an app which is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.440 
actually I discovered an app which is
called<00:00:36.710> light<00:00:37.710> meter<00:00:38.329> from<00:00:39.329> white<00:00:39.600> goods<00:00:41.450> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
called light meter from white goods and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.910 
called light meter from white goods and
it<00:00:42.629> actually<00:00:42.780> uses<00:00:43.410> your<00:00:43.950> iPhone<00:00:44.309> camera<00:00:44.629> to

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
it actually uses your iPhone camera to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.979 
it actually uses your iPhone camera to
measure<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.190> light<00:00:47.340> intensity<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.149> think<00:00:48.899> you

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
measure the light intensity I think you

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.930 
measure the light intensity I think you
can<00:00:49.170> find<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.829> Android<00:00:50.340> store<00:00:50.610> I'm

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
can find this in the Android store I'm

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.580 
can find this in the Android store I'm
not<00:00:51.180> sure<00:00:51.390> though

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
not sure though

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.880 
not sure though
it's<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.949> free<00:00:53.190> app<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:54.079> it<00:00:55.079> works<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.649> this

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
it's a free app and it works like this

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.139 
it's a free app and it works like this
turn<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:58.760> measure<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.000> light

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
turn it on and measure the light

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.490 
turn it on and measure the light
intensity<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:02.570> don't<00:01:03.570> no<00:01:03.660> way<00:01:03.809> holding<00:01:04.290> like

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
intensity I don't no way holding like

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.480 
intensity I don't no way holding like
that<00:01:06.200> you<00:01:07.200> know<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.500> move<00:01:07.830> around<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:10.490> see

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that you know like move around and see

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.850 
that you know like move around and see
the<00:01:11.729> light<00:01:11.909> intensity<00:01:12.409> now<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the light intensity now this is the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.670 
the light intensity now this is the
light<00:01:14.010> intensity<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.670> my<00:01:14.850> shade<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.409> my

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
light intensity of my shade and of my

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.200 
light intensity of my shade and of my
shades<00:01:20.390> I'm<00:01:21.390> going<00:01:21.689> down<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:23.210> don't

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
shades I'm going down going up I don't

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.660 
shades I'm going down going up I don't
know<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:25.110> accurate<00:01:25.380> though<00:01:25.860> but

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
know if this is very accurate though but

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.440 
know if this is very accurate though but
it<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.930> give<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.320> some<00:01:28.530> idea<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.040> them<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it can give you some idea on them on the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.200 
it can give you some idea on them on the
light<00:01:30.630> intensity<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:35.210> switch

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
light intensity you have you can switch

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.170 
light intensity you have you can switch
to<00:01:36.240> back<00:01:37.110> camera<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.619> well<00:01:37.939> but<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.119> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
to back camera as well but this is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.109 
to back camera as well but this is
really<00:01:39.570> enough<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.079> buddy<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> point<00:01:40.799> it

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
really enough so buddy have to point it

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.899 
really enough so buddy have to point it
at<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.950> light<00:01:43.950> source<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:45.060> see<00:01:45.619> what<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.710> does

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
at the light source and see what it does

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.899 
at the light source and see what it does
I<00:01:48.259> have<00:01:49.259> here<00:01:49.530> some<00:01:49.590> settings<00:01:50.189> as<00:01:50.340> well<00:01:50.369> you

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
I have here some settings as well you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.240 
I have here some settings as well you
can<00:01:51.090> measure<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.509> lux<00:01:51.780> or<00:01:52.289> actually<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> can

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
can measure the lux or actually you can

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.300 
can measure the lux or actually you can
measure<00:01:53.399> light<00:01:53.789> intensity<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.539> lux<00:01:55.130> or<00:01:56.130> in

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
measure light intensity in the lux or in

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.830 
measure light intensity in the lux or in
foot-candles<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.390> set<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.659> light

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
foot-candles you can set the light

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.399 
foot-candles you can set the light
conditions<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:01.520> yeah<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.789> is<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.090> app<00:02:03.409> again

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
conditions so yeah this is the app again

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.229 
conditions so yeah this is the app again
I'm<00:02:04.590> not<00:02:04.710> sure<00:02:04.920> how<00:02:05.070> good<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.429> is<00:02:06.409> but<00:02:07.409> um<00:02:08.239> you
