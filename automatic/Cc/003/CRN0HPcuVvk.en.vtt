00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
with reveal inside this is probably out

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.609 
with reveal inside this is probably out
of<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> whole<00:01:24.119> entire<00:01:24.450> collection<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.380> over

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
of the whole entire collection of over

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.630 
of the whole entire collection of over
the<00:01:25.710> tops<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.220> probably<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.549> hardest

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the tops this is probably the hardest

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.899 
the tops this is probably the hardest
one<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:26.970> find<00:01:28.009> I'm<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.159> particularly<00:01:29.640> sure

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
one to find I'm not particularly sure

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.520 
one to find I'm not particularly sure
why<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.840> don't<00:01:31.079> know<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.350> seems<00:01:31.500> like

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
why it's just I don't know it seems like

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.289 
why it's just I don't know it seems like
a<00:01:31.619> lot<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.860> people<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.490> black<00:01:32.700> ones<00:01:32.970> more

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
a lot of people like the black ones more

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.270 
a lot of people like the black ones more
and<00:01:33.540> they<00:01:33.659> wore<00:01:33.930> them<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:35.070> are

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and they wore them so these are

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
and they wore them so these are
extremely<00:01:35.939> hard<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> find<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.840> I've<00:01:37.259> never

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
extremely hard to find and I've never

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.810 
extremely hard to find and I've never
seen<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.549> good<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.729> condition

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
seen up here in this good of condition

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.590 
seen up here in this good of condition
ever<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> whole<00:01:40.200> life<00:01:40.729> so<00:01:41.729> might<00:01:42.390> even

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
ever in the whole life so might even

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.330 
ever in the whole life so might even
have<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> original<00:01:43.350> plastic<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.009> came<00:01:44.159> on
