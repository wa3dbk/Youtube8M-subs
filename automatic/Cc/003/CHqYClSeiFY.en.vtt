 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.220
 on agen today match opposing the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.630
 canada in the united states cash match 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.099
 for the qualifications of group g in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.470
 this group we also saw fighting 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.449
 Germany and Portugal a little bit 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.059
 earlier and so it's germany that 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.200
 emerged victorious from this confrontation 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.780
 between the big blocks of seconds the two 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.969
 leaders on the paper at least one 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.539
 will see later if the ghana where the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.219
 united states would compete with 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.140
 his two tormentors and maybe to do 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.059
 the surprise case so far it does not 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.180
 is nothing and its united states that gives the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.340
 kicking off this game of the first 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.340
 opportunity however it will be for ghana 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.809
 with kopa that will center for boateng 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.260
 whose framed head will be captured without 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.090
 problem by howard redeemed again 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.970
 the ghana who is attacking with the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.650
 bat michael essien on the left side I 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.119
 go back to face me 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.880
 center it will not give anything and that states 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.340
 united who leave against with johnson 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.009
 there that will be found on the side 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.520
 left 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:34.240
 johnson for dempsey john are from 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.470
 new dmc in the surface it can be 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.750
 dangerous for the united states 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.500
 theme is that he did not succeed you 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.380
 hit it in two stages and dauda the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.020
 guardian of this ghana team 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.580
 goes out very well now has not 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.619
 attacked in the second half at the 50th 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.090
 minute with this action taken by the 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.700
 united states the strike of johnson country 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.070
 who comes back in the feet of altidore 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.600
 who will not be able to worry 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.210
 goalkeeper 67th minute dime it's in the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.720
 area 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.700
 one of the small centers for john johns 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.200
 schiavi maybe the hands he got 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.190
 in any case what seems eric clam 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.610
 the Americans the referee lets play 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.200
 73rd minute michael essien the space with 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.660
 boateng boateng who finds it 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.030
 opens me to the keystroke but the player 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.340
 Ghanaian was obviously offside 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.920
 it was played out very little there 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.319
 had the skin put the danger on 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.430
 the US ebit new shares for 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.880
 the ghana with a hand whistled against 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:45.090
 the united states 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:50.160
 the coming change for ghana in 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.690
 this 82nd minute with the release of his 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.170
 death replaced by jordan ayew 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:01.380
 the Marseille player on loan to sochaux he 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.950
 will also hit that free kick but 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.320
 next to the goals the last opportunity 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.120
 will be visible in the United States at the 86th 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.700
 with that good sense the typing is too much 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.230
 crushed donovan that will not give anything 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.280
 eventually the ghana may arrive at 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.830
 to get behind which we know 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:23.220
 match with a good center to succeed 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.660
 no it will not pay any attention to the 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.330
 bad stimulus intercepted by jordan 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.330
 ayew shifts 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.760
 and if any of us 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.890
 essien 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.790
 will not be dangerous 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.530
 and this is where it ends 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:51.930
 match 0 to 0 between ghana and united states 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.390
 question that neutralized in this match at 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.400
 term of a match played on 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.890
 ranking now Germany is 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.380
 so always at the top of this group g 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.860
 with 3 points and Ghana and the states 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.730
 united share the second place with 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.000
 both a point the firm portugal 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.000
 walking
