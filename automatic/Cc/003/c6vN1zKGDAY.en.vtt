 a little bit cool in a lot of truth but 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.010
 in here I have qualifications that 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.390
 they are more or less good because the day of 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.099
 Today I 'm going to show you a breakfast because 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.499
 good thing they already asked for breakfast 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.480
 dinners meals of all dietetic because 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:31.089
 I also went tasty potatoes those 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.300
 three months and I have not been doing 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:37.480
 exercise I just started my routine and already 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.710
 I still have some meals that also 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.620
 they have told me why I am so 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.450
 absent from facebook on the good youtube 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.990
 as you know this week was my birthday 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.910
 and giving me in california and then I was 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.770
 very heavy the trip from Sunday 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.620
 every day I slept no more than three of 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.760
 two and four hours until I arrived 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.769
 here to Thursday afternoon 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.680
 it was working the night I came back and 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:06.210
 postponing as well as recovering my 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.060
 I dream my days as you would say with my 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.130
 normal routine my is a good the command 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.250
 right now but still the celebration is going to 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.049
 follow about 23 more days because you can see 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.460
 in california now I need to be the one 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.369
 wings 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.869
 the detail is who good for that and 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.810
 also for more or less are the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:30.200
 faces fans and half I'm going to have breakfast 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.200
 Señorito and today after seeing what is 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.570
 the only one would be that right now I'm going to 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:42.370
 recommend for now is the special 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:46.210
 Thick cake the original and do not have 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.450
 nothing that strawberries that flavorings of 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.720
 none or companions that the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.050
 almonds nothing there are ones that are 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:01.640
 prepared with honey and that's not nothing 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:05.020
 ok antón if it is the most obvious the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.020
 next I have a little left 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.080
 Party 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.770
 the serials sometimes we make a mistake 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.950
 I also made it to sometimes you have 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:23.040
 powers in something light and a meal 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:34.390
 It would be according to the healthiest but 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:36.700
 It turns out that this is not the best option for 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.100
 dine is good but only for 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.250
 have breakfast all that are cereals and 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.290
 derived from the seeds all that has 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.030
 to be before 12 o'clock because 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.510
 the body can not process it 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.800
 here we have almonte milk 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.430
 almonte but there is soy milk that is 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.069
 very good to me the truth I did not like in 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.090
 the slightest 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.249
 and aside from the shots sometimes come about 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.189
 air milestones of your body and not god 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:10.530
 keep coming to your only correction 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.840
 just colors because they can not stand those 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.900
 envelopes are very strong very penetrated 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.280
 they look like bombs there are other coconuts that 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.959
 It is also very rich in nutrients. 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.450
 It is very nutritious coconut as 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.909
 soy but in taste the truth to me I do not 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.160
 liked and hence decide that that of 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:35.080
 almonte but the original 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.240
 but I did not like it and he recommended the 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.590
 but this one is vanilla this 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.330
 has some flavor is having 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.150
 flavorings by the cane has cane 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.460
 sugar but sometimes it's the single take it's 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.000
 a little sweet date so I buy from 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.820
 the two 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.400
 the one that is alone the original without flavor and 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.730
 the vanilla and I stir half and 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.430
 half and this one is called simply shake 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:06.270
 before using and so you like it 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:09.300
 more I need it they put more vanilla 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.160
 that was original and they do not like it so 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.610
 sweet so sweet it puts more of the 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.610
 original 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:27.200
 well and before saying why is not only 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:32.140
 here does not include me the fruit is nothing else 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.140
 well the cereal ready a teaspoon 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.449
 it is very rich this would be I like it very much 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.569
 I really like this topic 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.059
 well I will continue uploading tutorials 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:51.210
 there are breakfasts of dinners 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:52.710
 between meals and then for example 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.779
 anything was done to them 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.919
 I recommend myself for breakfast that 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:05:00.680
 do twice a week maximum three 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.289
 I'm going to share some three breakfasts 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.069
 sometimes 4 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.539
 sometimes breakfasts 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:11.999
 the joke is that they do not eat every day 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:15.469
 the same one so that they do not get bored and I 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:15.469
 you appear the body does not get used 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.860
 it would be water 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.760
 but what I have done the law in the 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.470
 project was read a little bit towards 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.090
 and they recommend another little 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.550
 I recommend that because I like it to be 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.520
 with jing then do not tostadito that follow 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.210
 in contact and chewing then as 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.590
 I like it good after a breakfast 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.900
 Well, nothing else I agreed to do 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.420
 apple a piece watermelon the melon 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.640
 fresh papaya any fruit that 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.190
 you choose is a fruit because it has 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.980
 up to two oranges but with bagasse 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.980
 nothing in the cartoon makes bites 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.750
 segments and if it is a portion of fruits that are 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.730
 big pictures a clown come hold it 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.840
 equivalent to less than one dish because 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.900
 it's going to be nothing more 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.090
 it's going to be between meals 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.310
 after the meal that I already taught them 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.100
 out there I think that one but they are going to come 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.270
 more I'm going to start uploading more than 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.570
 nutrition 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.220
 suddenly they are looking for things like that 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.100
 dietetics will not find much 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.050
 moment just to upload ok and to make it 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.300
 easier do not put times and food 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.310
 dietetics 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.990
 Aubenas and healthy food and they already have 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.590
 there will be regular food I have very rich 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:39.270
 in flavor but that other things and will see 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:42.430
 the food that is the dietetic food that 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.270
 There's just a breakfast theater, it's a very 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.970
 easy 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.680
 ok and so I'll keep going up more good 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.889
 I leave because I have hunger if I do 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.889
 to do 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:02.229
 Y
