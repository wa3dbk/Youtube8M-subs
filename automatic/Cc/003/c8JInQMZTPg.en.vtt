00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.000
 you just said some fellow by the BKV 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.379
 by the wk advise players here to 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.759
 there are other reasons for this 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.200
 why those players don't have that choice yet 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.009
 should make it for you now 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.250
 to go abroad 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.259
 yes but you are going to talk too much about that 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.480
 they play what we individually about 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.090
 steps they have to make is clear 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.250
 of course that she yes that she that 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.699
 have to make steps but me 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.679
 think that is in the process of feyenoord 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.900
 and let's hope toward season 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.540
 I think that with Euro European football 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.989
 it is very important in and 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.519
 to your example is of course 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.470
 certainly that also lies in the national coach 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.269
 of course yes vlaar goes to austin 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.339
 fill to the steps and premium look 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.680
 but the others at Feyenoord 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.390
 play play in the center so yes it 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.559
 do not want to automatically say if you 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.750
 going to a larger club or you too 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.199
 is selected because yes mainly looks 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.180
 to design and see if you play 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.650
 these guys will almost always be with 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.780
 feyenoord play those qualities to him 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.220
 have them or them one step higher 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.380
 start playing weekly 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.310
 plus a new environment plus a new one 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.500
 language and everything but yes but now 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.490
 I talk too much about now 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.410
 and that is what I want from 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.180
 actually focus on what we are doing 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.860
 I agree with clasie too 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.870
 no you both also you first 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.460
 the competition that sounds logical but you 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.900
 you can also have it distracted as p pegs 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.690
 that that that you stop that you don't stop 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.640
 the environment is often is and then so 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.190
 long the environment is a you focus 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.800
 at feyenoord then we must 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.030
 that is possible but it is also boys 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.040
 have never experienced that before 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.250
 of course and therefore also an experience that 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.830
 they must go and get it that way 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.600
 we wait and see if we can do it as a team 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.340
 also sure every individual play that 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.930
 can continue to do what they have done 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.400
 that we also play differently 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.960
 Martin who for example looks like someone who 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.430
 closes very easily for his 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.100
 environment soup per player otherwise such 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.860
 process yes that is that also lies 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.890
 characters of players 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.810
 one has its more affected than 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.540
 the person other than the can understand what you are saying 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.520
 Get rid of that and well that 's one 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.800
 development that they must also go with 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.720
 make and 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.120
 those are of course coming 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.010
 We can test matches well 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.240
 one and the other deal with that 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.620
 can from personal experience 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.950
 it when it comes to advising the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.560
 boys eh yes but the time is different 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.560
 I had it this morning with the met met 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.510
 shampoo gasses over years 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.020
 i went i could go abroad then 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.090
 I was 25 and then I had that with PSV 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.040
 the championship the national title the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.800
 won the Europa Cup 1 cup 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.330
 88 came after that and I chose 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.220
 conscious to stay with psv for another year 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.040
 stay 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.170
 yes because after because I found that I have one more 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.910
 wanted to play at PSV for years and we still 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.590
 wanted to develop further before I started the 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.530
 City started making and so it is always a 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.840
 certain risk and then you cannot 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.960
 more compare what players in the day 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.150
 time no longer remain until their 25th 26th 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.980
 in the Netherlands that has changed but you 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.920
 you have to wonder if these players are dropping 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.690
 but I think that's it 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.520
 that is good for their work development 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.500
 they stay another year after a week 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.420
 work towards and from the club 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.820
 sold nearly 10,000 oils yesterday 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.010
 everyone talks about how or how you are doing 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.720
 he also play that city that is reasons 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.860
 really captivated by that race for it 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.959
 championship 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.000
 You already have this player and train whole 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.680
 you can experience a lot more often 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.430
 something with that experience in your way of 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.590
 coaching the way of working with this group 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.980
 well what we are doing act that 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.590
 we would like to hold on and yes yes 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.440
 think the simplest is you 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.750
 focus from match after match and 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.280
 and we put it so well every time 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.040
 possibly down 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.530
 yes and as long as possible and that is all the 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.260
 a nice fact to work from scratch 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.970
 and the baptism position and and still 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.860
 just indicate and den 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.530
 not aware but that is just the case 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.050
 that we still want and all 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.060
 who are enthusiastic and make people very happy 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.410
 want to make but the others have to come along 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.690
 and there is much more pressure on it 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.120
 the boiler that is not allowed to waste this 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.950
 we can still do this because the 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.600
 The objective has largely been achieved 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.370
 everything we get more is included 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.930
 You can also say that was also a discussion 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.460
 with an earlier training in you 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.300
 predecessor thereby giving boys base 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.970
 also an excuse 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.349
 let it think you can do that alone 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.849
 say if you have a better how i work 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:35.419
 internal 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:37.460
 and and think if there is a pressure on your 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.830
 these young boys that I am in 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.550
 no one else but you have seven 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.500
 competitions 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.120
 are you one who is one for yourself 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.830
 You know you're out of seven 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.470
 time must be no but what are the 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.300
 dangers en route is that 17 a building 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.979
 with two floors sorry rack no well 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.190
 yes there really exciting given it 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:58.240
 very very unpredictable so yes you 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.240
 you should not distract too much either 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.699
 to look at others or it 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:05.150
 program of the other 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:07.789
 we play the three more and we play 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.259
 the four at home well four at home is 12 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.270
 points 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:15.610
 yes calculate then you can get very far 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.610
 yes beautiful yes beautiful
