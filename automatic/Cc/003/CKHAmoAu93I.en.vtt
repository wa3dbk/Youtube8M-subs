00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
on the pistol shrimp with its lightning

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.069 
on the pistol shrimp with its lightning
speed<00:04:04.230> punches<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:05.430> actual<00:04:05.850> fist<00:04:06.390> itself<00:04:06.810> is

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
speed punches the actual fist itself is

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.110 
speed punches the actual fist itself is
fairly<00:04:07.769> detached<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.489> can<00:04:08.670> move<00:04:09.000> it

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
fairly detached so you can move it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.890 
fairly detached so you can move it
around

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
around

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.390 
around
doesn't<00:04:10.379> look<00:04:10.470> like<00:04:10.530> it'll<00:04:10.799> break<00:04:11.010> it's

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.460 
doesn't look like it'll break it's
pretty<00:04:11.610> strong<00:04:11.849> between<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.599> just<00:04:13.230> fun<00:04:13.439> to

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
pretty strong between but just fun to

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.440
