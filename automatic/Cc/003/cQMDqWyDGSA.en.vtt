00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
it to make it you know work a lot better

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.700 
it to make it you know work a lot better
the<00:00:22.289> first<00:00:22.500> thing<00:00:22.740> was<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:24.410> got<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> hayward

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the first thing was we got a hayward

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.470 
the first thing was we got a hayward
filter<00:00:27.199> it's<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:29.090> link<00:00:30.090> will<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
filter it's a link will be in the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.240 
filter it's a link will be in the
description<00:00:31.579> but<00:00:32.579> basically<00:00:33.829> the<00:00:34.829> filters

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
description but basically the filters

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.930 
description but basically the filters
here<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:37.350> got<00:00:37.530> its<00:00:37.739> own<00:00:37.860> built-in<00:00:38.640> pump

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
here and it's got its own built-in pump

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.190 
here and it's got its own built-in pump
with<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.649> the<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:44.250> know<00:00:44.399> filter

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
with it and so the you know filter

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.170 
with it and so the you know filter
replaced<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.500> cartridge<00:00:47.309> filter<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.969> was

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
replaced the cartridge filter that was

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.619 
replaced the cartridge filter that was
in<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.320> basically<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.610> used<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.180> exact

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
in it and basically I used the exact

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
in it and basically I used the exact
same<00:00:51.719> hoses<00:00:52.730> that<00:00:53.899> that<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> had<00:00:55.280> originally<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
same hoses that that I had originally I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.819 
same hoses that that I had originally I
don't<00:00:57.420> think<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.690> had<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.989> replace<00:00:58.230> any<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
don't think I had to replace any of the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.020 
don't think I had to replace any of the
houses<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.399> anything<00:01:00.140> I<00:01:01.699> got<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
houses or anything I got it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.080 
houses or anything I got it
kind<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.449> hung<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.870> with<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:05.460> bungee<00:01:05.790> cord

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
kind of hung up with a the bungee cord

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.380 
kind of hung up with a the bungee cord
but<00:01:07.369> but<00:01:08.369> basically<00:01:09.260> pretty<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.850> not<00:01:11.850> so

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
but but basically pretty good not so

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.289 
but but basically pretty good not so
extremely<00:01:13.260> level<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.189> wanted<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
extremely level like I wanted it it's a

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.130 
extremely level like I wanted it it's a
little<00:01:15.450> bit<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.960> little<00:01:16.409> bit<00:01:16.560> off<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:18.020> but<00:01:19.020> it

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
little bit a little bit off but but it

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.380 
little bit a little bit off but but it
still<00:01:19.350> does<00:01:19.530> okay<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.729> haywood<00:01:21.030> filter

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
still does okay the the haywood filter

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.130 
still does okay the the haywood filter
comes<00:01:21.689> with<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.409> different<00:01:23.040> type<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.220> skimmer

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
comes with a different type of skimmer

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
comes with a different type of skimmer
as<00:01:25.140> well<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> lot<00:01:26.100> bigger<00:01:26.369> skimmer<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:28.520> so

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
as well have a lot bigger skimmer and so

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
as well have a lot bigger skimmer and so

put 50 pounds of sand in it I had a

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.660 
put 50 pounds of sand in it I had a
couple<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.409> problems<00:01:49.650> with<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> pool<00:01:50.460> this

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
couple of problems with the pool this

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.930 
couple of problems with the pool this
year<00:01:51.380> one<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.650> problems<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.910> a

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
year one of the problems is we have a

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.820 
year one of the problems is we have a
leak<00:01:54.240> over<00:01:54.540> here<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.020> side<00:01:57.830> somewhere

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
leak over here on this side somewhere

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.320 
leak over here on this side somewhere
underneath<00:01:59.690> underneath<00:02:00.690> that<00:02:01.320> section

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
underneath underneath that section

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.960 
underneath underneath that section
somewhere<00:02:03.330> there's<00:02:03.900> a<00:02:04.020> leak<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.700> still<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.820> to

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
somewhere there's a leak I still have to

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.900 
somewhere there's a leak I still have to
figure<00:02:06.300> that<00:02:06.330> out<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.050> then<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:08.369> also<00:02:08.550> had<00:02:08.880> a

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
figure that out and then we also had a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:18.110 
figure that out and then we also had a
leak<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:12.060> side<00:02:12.390> over<00:02:12.630> here<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:18.090> I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
leak in this side over here but I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.430 
leak in this side over here but I
patched<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.780> yesterday<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.320> is

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
patched that yesterday so that is

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.130 
patched that yesterday so that is
patched<00:02:22.940> right<00:02:23.940> now<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.330> crystal<00:02:24.780> clear<00:02:24.810> of

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
patched right now it's crystal clear of

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.470 
patched right now it's crystal clear of
course<00:02:25.320> because<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.920> filled<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.340> up<00:02:26.489> you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
course because I just filled it up you

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.800 
course because I just filled it up you
know<00:02:27.660> but<00:02:28.250> got<00:02:29.250> those<00:02:29.430> little<00:02:30.300> floaties

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
know but got those little floaties

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.150 
know but got those little floaties
floating<00:02:31.680> around<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:34.050> then<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.739> other<00:02:34.890> one

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
floating around and then the other one

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.300 
floating around and then the other one
the<00:02:35.730> other<00:02:35.850> problem<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.300> had<00:02:36.510> was<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:37.280> one<00:02:38.280> of

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the other problem I had was on one of

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.690 
the other problem I had was on one of
the<00:02:38.459> hoses<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:40.050> also<00:02:40.230> had<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> pinhole<00:02:41.190> leak<00:02:41.489> in

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
the hoses it also had a pinhole leak in

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.100 
the hoses it also had a pinhole leak in
it<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.900> patched<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:44.160> morning<00:02:44.610> as<00:02:44.790> well

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
it that I patched this morning as well

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.640 
it that I patched this morning as well
to<00:02:46.110> try<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.410> get<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.600> fix<00:02:48.600> what<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.870> did<00:02:49.079> was<00:02:49.290> I

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
to try to get it to fix what I did was I

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.569 
to try to get it to fix what I did was I
put<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.400> concrete<00:02:50.640> on<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.440> patch<00:02:52.440> cement<00:02:53.370> on

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
put the concrete on the patch cement on

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.110 
put the concrete on the patch cement on
it<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.000> then<00:02:54.720> wrapped<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.230> with<00:02:55.910> wrapped<00:02:56.910> it

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
it and then wrapped it with wrapped it

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.319 
it and then wrapped it with wrapped it
with<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.480> waterproof<00:02:57.959> tape<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:59.060> so<00:03:00.060> anyway

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
with the waterproof tape so so anyway

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.479 
with the waterproof tape so so anyway
that<00:03:00.900> sports<00:03:01.290> gonna<00:03:01.530> happen

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
that sports gonna happen

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.130 
that sports gonna happen
the<00:03:02.790> next<00:03:03.120> step<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.500> cut<00:03:05.370> all<00:03:05.579> of<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:06.140> blue

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
the next step is to cut all of this blue

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.870 
the next step is to cut all of this blue
tarp<00:03:07.500> out<00:03:09.739> cut<00:03:10.739> all<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.040> pieces<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.549> I<00:03:11.610> don't

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
tarp out cut all the pieces that I don't

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.150 
tarp out cut all the pieces that I don't
need<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.470> probably<00:03:13.470> move<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.799> filter<00:03:14.130> a

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
need and probably move the filter a

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.759 
need and probably move the filter a
little<00:03:14.459> bit<00:03:14.579> closer<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.690> pool<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.470> can

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
little bit closer to the pool so I can

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.240 
little bit closer to the pool so I can
reach<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.100> from<00:03:17.130> inside<00:03:17.780> as<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:19.049> use<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:19.860> for

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
reach it from inside as I use it for

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.850 
reach it from inside as I use it for
vacuuming<00:03:20.790> or<00:03:21.060> whatever<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:22.290> sort<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.620> thing

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
vacuuming or whatever that sort of thing

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.400 
vacuuming or whatever that sort of thing
so<00:03:23.160> if<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.610> like<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.810> know<00:03:24.900> do<00:03:25.140> your<00:03:25.260> in-text

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
so if you like you know do your in-text

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.970 
so if you like you know do your in-text
pulls<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.850> size<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.230> good<00:03:28.650> for

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
pulls the this size this is good for

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.890 
pulls the this size this is good for
just<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.400> backyard<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:30.150> type<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.420> thing

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
just the backyard that type of thing

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.050 
just the backyard that type of thing
these<00:03:31.560> filters<00:03:31.950> would<00:03:32.340> work<00:03:32.640> really<00:03:32.910> really

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
these filters would work really really

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.150 
these filters would work really really
well<00:03:33.329> we've<00:03:33.750> had<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.140> does<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.620> think<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.950> is

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
well we've had it does I think this is

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.580 
well we've had it does I think this is
probably<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.209> second<00:03:36.570> year<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.959> I've<00:03:37.380> used

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
probably the second year that I've used

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.080 
probably the second year that I've used
it<00:03:37.769> maybe<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.130> third<00:03:38.370> year<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:38.820> I've<00:03:38.940> used

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
it maybe the third year that I've used

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.830 
it maybe the third year that I've used
it<00:03:39.329> we've<00:03:39.840> had<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.109> pool<00:03:40.290> for<00:03:40.560> four<00:03:40.829> years<00:03:41.130> and

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
it we've had the pool for four years and

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.950 
it we've had the pool for four years and
use<00:03:42.530> this<00:03:42.740> filter<00:03:43.130> for<00:03:43.430> at<00:03:44.240> least<00:03:44.420> two<00:03:44.750> years

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
use this filter for at least two years

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.840 
use this filter for at least two years
so<00:03:46.330> this<00:03:47.330> might<00:03:47.540> be<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.810> third<00:03:47.990> season<00:03:48.470> but

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
so this might be the third season but

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.870 
so this might be the third season but
anyway<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:50.270> just<00:03:50.890> thought<00:03:51.890> I'd<00:03:52.040> put<00:03:52.550> that<00:03:52.610> out

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
anyway so just thought I'd put that out

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.340 
anyway so just thought I'd put that out
there<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.270> let<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:53.720> know<00:03:53.930> what<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.170> project

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
there and let you know what the project

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.510 
there and let you know what the project
was<00:03:54.650> doing<00:03:54.980> thanks<00:03:55.700> have<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.150> good<00:03:56.330> thing
