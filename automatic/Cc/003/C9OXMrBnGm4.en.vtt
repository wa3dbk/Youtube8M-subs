what<00:01:17.990> makes<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.380> DHS<00:01:18.920> upgrades<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:19.610> powerful

what makes the DHS upgrades so powerful
and<00:01:20.390> basically<00:01:20.780> majid<00:01:21.259> ori<00:01:21.439> from<00:01:21.619> MEC<00:01:21.799> design

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
and basically majid ori from MEC design

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.160 
and basically majid ori from MEC design
is<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.759> fact<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.210> internal<00:01:23.659> heat<00:01:23.810> sinks

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
is the fact that the internal heat sinks

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.959 
is the fact that the internal heat sinks
which<00:01:24.619> cost<00:01:24.890> no<00:01:25.100> additional<00:01:25.490> tonnage<00:01:25.850> or

critical<00:01:26.450> slots<00:01:26.719> are<00:01:27.259> increased<00:01:27.619> by<00:01:27.770> 100%

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
when upgraded this means that any met

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.620
