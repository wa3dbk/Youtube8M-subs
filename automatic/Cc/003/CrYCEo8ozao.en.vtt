00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.720 

all<00:00:12.240> right<00:00:12.360> we're<00:00:12.480> looking<00:00:12.630> at<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.750> D<00:00:12.929> H<00:00:13.139> 55<00:00:13.830> TC

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
all right we're looking at the D H 55 TC

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.609 
all right we're looking at the D H 55 TC
motherboard<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.630> as<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.139> can<00:00:16.260> imagine<00:00:16.350> that

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
motherboard and as you can imagine that

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.920 
motherboard and as you can imagine that
goes<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> 855<00:00:17.490> Express<00:00:18.150> chipset<00:00:18.869> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
goes with the 855 Express chipset and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.540 
goes with the 855 Express chipset and
that<00:00:19.050> means<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.439> takes<00:00:19.590> all<00:00:19.740> your<00:00:20.130> socket

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
that means that it takes all your socket

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.390 
that means that it takes all your socket

processors<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.470> board<00:00:25.710> that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
processors and this is the board that

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.640 
processors and this is the board that
works<00:00:26.010> with<00:00:26.220> Intel's<00:00:27.230> graphics<00:00:28.230> technology

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
works with Intel's graphics technology

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.259 
works with Intel's graphics technology
that<00:00:28.769> basically<00:00:29.130> has<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> onboard<00:00:29.580> graphics

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
that basically has the onboard graphics

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.910 
that basically has the onboard graphics
on<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.050> processor<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.830> go<00:00:31.890> to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
on the processor so if you go to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.400 
on the processor so if you go to
processor<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> i3<00:00:33.570> or<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.809> i5<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.290> that

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
processor like the i3 or the i5 is that

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.200 
processor like the i3 or the i5 is that
come<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> onboard<00:00:34.980> graphics<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:36.090> can

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
come with the onboard graphics you can

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.580 
come with the onboard graphics you can
actually<00:00:36.360> output<00:00:36.899> without<00:00:37.020> having<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.380> video

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
actually output without having a video

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.700 
actually output without having a video
card<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.860> has<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.980> VGA<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.760> DVI<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.750> an<00:00:40.230> hdmi

it<00:00:57.210> will<00:00:57.390> recognize<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.710> very<00:00:58.949> very<00:00:59.100> nice<00:00:59.340> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it will recognize so very very nice you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.410 
it will recognize so very very nice you
have<00:00:59.879> 6<00:01:00.359> SATA<00:01:01.140> 2<00:01:01.620> ports<00:01:02.039> down<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:02.789> 3<00:01:03.030> gigabit

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
have 6 SATA 2 ports down here 3 gigabit

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.899 
have 6 SATA 2 ports down here 3 gigabit
per<00:01:03.510> second<00:01:03.870> SATA<00:01:04.080> ports<00:01:04.439> which<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.280> very<00:01:05.700> very

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
per second SATA ports which is very very

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.399 
per second SATA ports which is very very
nice<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.630> lot<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.020> harder<00:01:07.260> than

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
nice to have it's a lot of harder than

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.740 
nice to have it's a lot of harder than
using<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> do<00:01:07.710> raid<00:01:07.920> 0<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.030> raid<00:01:09.210> 1<00:01:09.479> you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
using to do raid 0 you can do raid 1 you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230 
using to do raid 0 you can do raid 1 you
can<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:09.960> 5<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.010> 1<00:01:11.189> plus<00:01:11.400> 0<00:01:11.670> or<00:01:11.790> 10

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
can do 5 and you can do 1 plus 0 or 10

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.750 
can do 5 and you can do 1 plus 0 or 10
so<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> lot<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.320> options<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:13.920> far<00:01:13.950> as<00:01:14.130> rate<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
so a lot of options as far as rate and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.670 
so a lot of options as far as rate and
redundancy<00:01:15.119> goes<00:01:15.360> now<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:15.930> far<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.170> graphics

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
redundancy goes now as far as graphics

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.990 
redundancy goes now as far as graphics
go<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.400> said<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.640> has<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.759> onboard

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
go like I said it has the onboard

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.340 
go like I said it has the onboard
graphics<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.960> want<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> add<00:01:19.320> a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
graphics but if you want to add a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.679 
graphics but if you want to add a
discrete<00:01:19.979> video<00:01:20.159> card<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:21.360> because<00:01:21.630> you

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
discrete video card you can because you

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.800 
discrete video card you can because you
do<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.960> PCI<00:01:22.320> Express<00:01:22.650> x16<00:01:23.220> 2.0<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.659> also

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
do have a PCI Express x16 2.0 you also

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.410 
do have a PCI Express x16 2.0 you also
have<00:01:24.930> 2<00:01:25.140> PCI<00:01:25.560> Express<00:01:25.860> x1<00:01:26.549> right<00:01:27.090> underneath

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
have 2 PCI Express x1 right underneath

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
have 2 PCI Express x1 right underneath
it<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:27.780> finally<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.320> PCI<00:01:28.920> slot<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.490> your

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it and then finally a PCI slot or your

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.880 
it and then finally a PCI slot or your
standard<00:01:29.970> PCI<00:01:30.299> slot<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:31.170> available<00:01:31.229> now<00:01:31.770> on

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
standard PCI slot is available now on

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.469 
standard PCI slot is available now on
the<00:01:31.920> back<00:01:32.100> panel<00:01:32.340> lots<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.150> good<00:01:33.270> stuff<00:01:33.420> going

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the back panel lots of good stuff going

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.929 
the back panel lots of good stuff going
on<00:01:33.720> multiple<00:01:34.710> ps2<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> work<00:01:35.820> on

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
on multiple ps2 so it's going to work on

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.840 
on multiple ps2 so it's going to work on
keyboard<00:01:36.329> or<00:01:36.509> Mouse<00:01:36.720> 2<00:01:37.409> USB<00:01:37.920> 2.0<00:01:38.430> port<00:01:38.670> there's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
actually six in total on the back VGA

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.539 
actually six in total on the back VGA
DVI<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.640> HDMI<00:01:42.119> now<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.200> ATM<00:01:43.710> I'll<00:01:43.770> transfer

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
DVI and HDMI now this ATM I'll transfer

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.060 
DVI and HDMI now this ATM I'll transfer
8<00:01:44.729> channels<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.329> audio<00:01:45.720> through<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> cable

8 channels of audio through that cable

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.130 
8 channels of audio through that cable
but<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.640> want<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:47.909> analog<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:49.020> do

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
but if you want to go analog you can do

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.200 
but if you want to go analog you can do
your<00:01:49.290> simple<00:01:49.619> 2<00:01:49.740> channel<00:01:50.040> over<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:50.970> more

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
your simple 2 channel over here for more

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.969 
your simple 2 channel over here for more
USB<00:01:51.509> 2.0<00:01:51.899> ports<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.290> then<00:01:52.350> finally<00:01:52.740> right<00:01:52.860> up

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
USB 2.0 ports and then finally right up

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.149 
USB 2.0 ports and then finally right up
here<00:01:53.100> 10<00:01:53.340> 100<00:01:53.700> 1000<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:54.990> Gigabit<00:01:55.530> Ethernet<00:01:55.710> is

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
here 10 100 1000 or Gigabit Ethernet is

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.889 
here 10 100 1000 or Gigabit Ethernet is
on<00:01:56.369> board<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.880> you're<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.479> use<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.719> as

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
on board so you're going to use this as

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.840 
on board so you're going to use this as
a<00:01:58.079> home<00:01:58.229> theater<00:01:58.590> PC<00:01:58.670> excellent<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.820> that

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
a home theater PC excellent for that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.929 
a home theater PC excellent for that
again<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.509> micro<00:02:00.869> ATX<00:02:00.930> board<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.670> is

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
again this is a micro ATX board so it is

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.120 
again this is a micro ATX board so it is
a<00:02:02.969> little<00:02:03.540> bit<00:02:03.630> smaller<00:02:03.899> than<00:02:04.439> what<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.950> used

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
a little bit smaller than what you used

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.620 
a little bit smaller than what you used
to<00:02:05.219> seeing<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.700> that's<00:02:05.759> really<00:02:06.240> really<00:02:06.420> good

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
to seeing and that's really really good

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.749 
to seeing and that's really really good
