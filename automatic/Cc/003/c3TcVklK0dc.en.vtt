00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:49.189 
with a tracer you'll see the switch to

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:52.149 
with a tracer you'll see the switch to
oil<00:05:49.399> pressure<00:05:49.759> and<00:05:49.999> you'll<00:05:50.959> also<00:05:51.259> see<00:05:51.949> the

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
oil pressure and you'll also see the

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.029 
oil pressure and you'll also see the
fuel<00:05:52.550> pump<00:05:52.939> compared<00:05:53.899> to<00:05:53.989> the<00:05:54.110> diesel<00:05:54.319> the<00:05:54.740> v8

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
fuel pump compared to the diesel the v8

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.339 
fuel pump compared to the diesel the v8
has<00:05:55.339> a<00:05:55.399> lot<00:05:55.699> more<00:05:55.729> activation<00:05:56.659> with<00:05:57.169> the

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
has a lot more activation with the

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:59.829 
has a lot more activation with the
ignition<00:05:57.679> switch<00:05:58.069> so<00:05:58.909> if<00:05:58.969> you<00:05:59.089> know<00:05:59.300> is<00:05:59.539> with

00:05:59.829 --> 00:05:59.839 
ignition switch so if you know is with

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:02.350 
ignition switch so if you know is with
the<00:06:00.019> oil<00:06:00.409> pressure<00:06:00.830> switch<00:06:01.249> it<00:06:01.610> needs<00:06:02.029> to<00:06:02.240> go

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
the oil pressure switch it needs to go

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.329 
the oil pressure switch it needs to go
to<00:06:02.419> earth<00:06:02.689> to<00:06:02.869> put<00:06:03.019> the<00:06:03.110> light<00:06:03.289> out<00:06:03.529> which<00:06:03.830> also

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:04.339 
to earth to put the light out which also

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:06.159 
to earth to put the light out which also
provides<00:06:04.849> an<00:06:05.089> earth<00:06:05.269> for<00:06:05.719> the<00:06:05.779> relay

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
provides an earth for the relay

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.919 
provides an earth for the relay
otherwise<00:06:06.589> the<00:06:06.800> fuel<00:06:07.039> pump<00:06:07.309> won't<00:06:07.580> work<00:06:07.929> this

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:08.929 
otherwise the fuel pump won't work this

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:11.409 
otherwise the fuel pump won't work this
is<00:06:09.110> looking<00:06:09.529> just<00:06:09.889> at<00:06:10.039> the<00:06:10.129> wine<00:06:10.309> diagram<00:06:10.879> so

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
is looking just at the wine diagram so

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.629 
is looking just at the wine diagram so
that's<00:06:11.659> quite<00:06:11.869> easy<00:06:11.929> if<00:06:12.499> you<00:06:12.709> understand<00:06:13.399> that

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
that's quite easy if you understand that

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.939 
that's quite easy if you understand that
then<00:06:13.909> it's<00:06:14.059> like<00:06:14.360> following<00:06:14.719> a<00:06:14.899> map<00:06:15.229> once<00:06:15.769> you

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
then it's like following a map once you

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.279 
then it's like following a map once you
understand<00:06:16.459> how<00:06:16.550> to<00:06:16.729> read<00:06:17.269> wiring<00:06:17.749> diagrams

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
understand how to read wiring diagrams

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.739 
understand how to read wiring diagrams
