00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:22.580 

ah<00:00:19.760> nothing<00:00:20.760> like<00:00:20.789> an<00:00:21.090> electric<00:00:21.630> fan<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.289> hot

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
ah nothing like an electric fan on a hot

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.919 
ah nothing like an electric fan on a hot
day<00:00:28.220> uh<00:00:29.220> II<00:00:29.640> D<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.119> don't<00:00:30.510> think<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.750> should<00:00:30.779> be

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
day uh II D I don't think we should be

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.810 
day uh II D I don't think we should be
using<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.289> much<00:00:31.470> electricity<00:00:31.830> what<00:00:32.669> do<00:00:32.759> you

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
using this much electricity what do you

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.209 
using this much electricity what do you
mean<00:00:33.000> well<00:00:33.960> if<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.469> keep<00:00:34.620> using<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.010> much

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
mean well if we keep using this much

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.500 
mean well if we keep using this much
electricity<00:00:35.579> then<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> power<00:00:36.090> plants<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
electricity then the power plants the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.940 
electricity then the power plants the
provider<00:00:36.809> will<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.260> work<00:00:37.380> overtime<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
provider will have to work overtime and

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.869 
provider will have to work overtime and
that<00:00:38.010> will<00:00:38.190> result<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> excretion<00:00:38.820> of

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
that will result the excretion of

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.490 
that will result the excretion of
excessive<00:00:39.450> amounts<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.809> greenhouse<00:00:40.110> gases

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
excessive amounts of greenhouse gases

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.810 
excessive amounts of greenhouse gases
that<00:00:40.590> will<00:00:40.680> travel<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> polar<00:00:41.370> ice<00:00:41.579> caps

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that will travel to the polar ice caps

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.220 
that will travel to the polar ice caps
and<00:00:41.910> boil<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.390> melt<00:00:42.540> them<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.809> cause<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> sea

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and boil and melt them and cause the sea

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.420 
and boil and melt them and cause the sea
levels<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> rise<00:00:43.620> which<00:00:43.950> will<00:00:43.980> ultimately

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
levels to rise which will ultimately

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.860 
levels to rise which will ultimately
result<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.879> extreme<00:00:45.180> weather<00:00:45.329> changes<00:00:45.450> no

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
result in extreme weather changes no

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.360 
result in extreme weather changes no
doubt<00:00:46.050> causing<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> earth<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.649> both<00:00:46.950> overheat

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
doubt causing the earth to both overheat

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.240 
doubt causing the earth to both overheat
and<00:00:47.489> flood<00:00:47.730> simultaneously<00:00:48.620> don't<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.739> silly

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
and flood simultaneously don't be silly

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.520 
and flood simultaneously don't be silly
like<00:00:50.610> our<00:00:50.820> electricity<00:00:51.300> usage<00:00:51.750> alone<00:00:52.140> could

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
like our electricity usage alone could

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.220 
like our electricity usage alone could
cause<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.070> yeah<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> guess<00:00:54.270> you're<00:00:54.390> right<00:00:54.449> hey

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
cause that yeah I guess you're right hey

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:14.719 
cause that yeah I guess you're right hey
can<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.829> those<00:00:56.899> No<00:01:13.729> somebody

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
can I have one of those No somebody

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.460 
can I have one of those No somebody
somewhere<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.600> sure<00:01:15.810> using<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.229> lot<00:01:16.380> of

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
somewhere is sure using a lot of

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.090 
somewhere is sure using a lot of
electricity<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.900> your<00:01:18.900> point<00:01:19.259> is

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
electricity and your point is

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:55.449 
electricity and your point is
Oh<00:01:20.130> Webb<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:22.820> just<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.420> narrate

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
you know what guys I've learned

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.809 
you know what guys I've learned
something<00:03:27.569> today<00:03:27.769> that's<00:03:28.769> right<00:03:29.040> we<00:03:29.340> do<00:03:29.610> need

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
something today that's right we do need

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.130 
something today that's right we do need
to<00:03:29.970> seriously<00:03:30.150> consider<00:03:30.329> cutting<00:03:30.780> back<00:03:31.019> on

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
to seriously consider cutting back on

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.809 
to seriously consider cutting back on
our<00:03:31.230> electricity<00:03:31.560> usage<00:03:31.950> even<00:03:32.489> if<00:03:32.549> it's<00:03:32.670> just

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
our electricity usage even if it's just

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.100 
our electricity usage even if it's just
something<00:03:32.970> small<00:03:33.090> like<00:03:33.329> turning<00:03:33.810> stuff<00:03:33.989> off

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
something small like turning stuff off

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.839 
something small like turning stuff off
completely<00:03:34.590> before<00:03:34.799> we<00:03:34.920> go<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.069> bed<00:03:35.250> because

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
completely before we go to bed because

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.549 
completely before we go to bed because
if<00:03:35.970> we<00:03:36.090> don't<00:03:36.269> we<00:03:36.659> are<00:03:36.689> all<00:03:36.989> going<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:38.040> die
