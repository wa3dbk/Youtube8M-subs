00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello everybody food energy aquino 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.839
 molecular cuisine and today we have a 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.929
 super special guest to prove 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.540
 Wow, and whenever I'm ready. 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.830
 please enter the already entered now looks 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.779
 Just know that you're forced to close the book and 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.590
 now it came here risk is expanding either 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.840
 so the next we'll have a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.220
 superlegal recipe she's a pasta 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.019
 very strange 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.060
 You will not see how it is that you do not. 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.800
 will know what the ingredients are and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.230
 go final approval 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.210
 It's okay, we 're going now. 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.500
 our kitchen to make the year from here 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.239
 We will not pilot the test again. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.690
 because he will find this super recipe 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.690
 crazy 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.430
 to make a recipe today we are going 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.900
 use different methods 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.700
 when we created molecular cuisine 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.470
 there in early 2012 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.420
 the idea was just to find ways 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.170
 alternatives to make the dishes of the day 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.970
 day is similar to the techniques of 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.530
 molecular gastronomy that uses 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.900
 scientific techniques to make the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.660
 things and now the opportunity has 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.760
 people do here in a molecular kitchen 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.520
 some recipes as the technical dates 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.840
 of molecular gastronomy and are 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.070
 simple thing you can do at home 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.200
 that's also how we're going to do it 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.300
 here you do not need a lot of equipment 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.950
 where many ingredients 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.110
 so today we are going to make a recipe 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.850
 that will be a recipe made but also 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.500
 will be a molecular recipe that she 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.050
 will use some techniques a little bit 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.210
 different and in the end we will give the 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.790
 our special guest experience 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.050
 here finding of our recipe the people 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.610
 will be able to deceive 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.619
 So to make this recipe we go 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.869
 need 85 grams of chocolate 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.580
 that is more or less half of 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.649
 a bar of those great Portuguese 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.530
 threw the first scent one 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.500
 little strawberry tray 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.120
 coconut liqueur to a spoon dh which is 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.409
 a jelly of seaweed that people 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.159
 you find in any product store 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.010
 Oriental half a cup of sugar 275 ml 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.750
 water and also a syringe and a 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.979
 silicone tube 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.619
 the syringe you find in any 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.820
 pharmacy and silicone tubing is easy 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.250
 to find in hardware stores 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.590
 construction shops that sell products to 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.660
 laboratory and chemical products or 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.299
 you are a serum in the hospital at the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.190
 health claims the effect of serum also serves 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.019
 Do not you think any of these can be a 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.940
 strawberry, even in case people stand 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.070
 in the syringe it will give the same effect 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.880
 it will be a bit shorter our 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.260
 channel 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.570
 the first thing that will make the 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.299
 to heat the water and dissolve all the 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.610
 when you are well of your life in the 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.230
 we can add chocolate 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.730
 when the chocolate is well 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.410
 incorporated into this mixture we will 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.540
 add the coconut liqueur 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.000
 Then just take it out of the fire, I hope to stay. 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.220
 A little bit we'll get some 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.459
 a lot more beautiful and we go 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.720
 fit the tubing 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.730
 let's inject that with great care and 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:09.849
 until white chocolate fills all 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:14.080
 It 's fine, no spill. It's good, we'll go. 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:17.200
 to be beautiful and will put a 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.260
 container with ice water and ice for more 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.950
 or less than three minutes to him 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.840
 entered the gallery a gelatin 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.849
 only that it has the property of 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.290
 remain after the durinhos 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.459
 ambient temperature is not that 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.370
 gelatine that we buy at the market 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.769
 in dollars and only gets hard in the 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.569
 when she gets out of the 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.299
 refrigerator she ends up holding back, huh? 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.000
 then inject with the second that the 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.590
 Noodles come out perfect, people do 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.260
 several times to give a 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.359
 pasta dish an engineer for 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.010
 make the sauce and will grind the strawberries 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.530
 can be a processor in the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.459
 blender in a mix I'm more 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.620
 easy is that 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.630
 then I 'll see him with sugar I hope 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.700
 have become more consistent neighbors 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.169
 nor with a face of sauce and then we go 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.970
 have to let it cool because you can not 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.739
 put and hot on top of the pasta are 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.480
 noodles will end up melting 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.120
 then we created we can assemble the dish 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.919
 I already have a house here, just put 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.889
 our three ferrero rocher bonbons 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:16.810
 as if they were meatballs then cover 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.260
 all as a layer of our way of 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.260
 strawberries 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.870
 so it's ready that our pasta 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.670
 made molecular 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.980
 now it 's just us taking to our 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.380
 special guest to prove that 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:38.490
 he will find this culinary delicacy 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.190
 beauty then it's here now ours 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.570
 pasta our guest to prove 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.550
 those with a little bit now with a 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.740
 load of exquisite pasta by 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.480
 microwave transported through space and 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.970
 by time happens happens happens 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.120
 so it is not totally intact right? 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.100
 is then you can prove that the tabloid 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.150
 you'll see here we when 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.070
 you the process here an aroma that was going 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.990
 grab a whole season dumpling can 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:13.280
 take a little pasta and a wave 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.280
 God bless her 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.880
 bizarre fashion picks up just because there's no way 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.330
 you feel the texture so the factor more 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:34.480
 does not discover that there is a 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:38.320
 they were like me and orkut I do not have 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:41.910
 orkut but it does not look a bit like 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.910
 I remember that the imported 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.090
 I have the slightest idea of ​​what this is 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:57.240
 good and pedro boucherie yes yes it's easy 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.680
 this is the strawberry syrup and so 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.750
 it took the pasta to have an idea of ​​what 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.420
 so be the spaghetti pasta people 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.670
 made with white chocolate is a technique 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.610
 which is of the molecular gastronomy is not then 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.380
 Those who have seen the real face 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.030
 then it is only some techniques of 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.770
 molecular gastronomy 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.330
 We're bringing down the channel. 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.100
 I think this is already a series with other 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.230
 recipes if crazy that ended 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.520
 joining the revenue from the technique 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.260
 molecular cim 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.450
 but the idea is to have others and only 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.700
 the molecular pixel show of our 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.510
 recipe made staff approved will 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.010
 to stare 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.570
 Dude I always found it very bizarre and 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.100
 especially since I did not know what 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.480
 it was in my mouth 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.150
 I think this is the worst thing that you 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.070
 Did you eat the food you did not know? 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.230
 I like what you will have if you do not know 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.580
 that is but you look you imagine 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:49.070
 another thing 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.070
 the business of a super Chávez doing 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.810
 orange but in fact the tiller is a 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.640
 in the head but thanks to follow in 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.250
 house to catch a beach near the 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:03.050
 People are really fun so I bought it. 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.050
 mouth I felt we spoke here is 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:09.420
 that as she was in white then only 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.580
 of not knowing what it was already started 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.610
 imagine other things 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:18.990
 already in the beginning was more than the last not 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:20.850
 It was so cool, so we 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.590
 thank you very much that the presence of the tav 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.120
 this availability the courage said 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.400
 also to prove the revenue without 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.740
 know what it was and asked if 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.540
 I had power with him here it's okay 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.970
 when it arrives in the next video then 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.830
 forget to sign up for the channel and then 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.300
 I liked it implanted, right? 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.130
 since I did not pay I liked one more joy 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.230
 to let you leave you there 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.360
 What can you do now while we go? 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.640
 redistribute the lights 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.080
 thank you for receiving me is 

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.160
 So we'll see in the next game. 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.160
 A big hug and see you there
