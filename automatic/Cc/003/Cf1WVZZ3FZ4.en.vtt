00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 friends of the return of jose here we are 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.859
 again I'll show you what I 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.900
 planted this year in the greenhouse and 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.929
 that many of you have sent me 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.670
 a lot of messages asking me to 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.440
 make a video when you plant in the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.140
 vegetable in the greenhouse 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.390
 I started planting almost two weeks ago 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.120
 but as I have been planting little by little 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.470
 because I have raised many times ugás 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.640
 so you hit me a little more to 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.840
 make the video 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:37.190
 Well, here I show you 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.440
 We are on April 18, 2015 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.770
 and I will show you what I have planted 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.530
 in the greenhouse 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.770
 Here you have some lettuces that I planted 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.770
 Yesterday 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.520
 I have raised three tables 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.390
 in order to have 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.809
 enough lettuces since I have many 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.850
 chickens and so take advantage and the leaves are 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.860
 I'll give them to the chickens to eat 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.000
 green because more than lack 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.460
 here you have 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.030
 the rest of what is raised yesterday 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.760
 planted between 55 and 60 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.910
 every 78 days 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.909
 here you have 3 cherry tomatoes 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.430
 also poses yesterday 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.250
 here you have them are very beautiful 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.370
 very pretty besides truth and here 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.890
 you have some rambo tomato plants that this one 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.950
 they have planted approximately three 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.950
 weeks 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.000
 here you have it 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.560
 these were the first lettuces that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.490
 the plant that shows 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.200
 they are much bigger in the rest 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.200
 and here the rest of the tomato plants 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.540
 and as you can see they already have a flower 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.540
 the truth is very cool 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.280
 Here you have 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.300
 everything that I have planted 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.640
 one thing I'm super happy I'm 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.200
 receiving a lot of visits in the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.560
 youtube channel and the truth is that 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.990
 I'm super happy and I already have 1400 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.260
 subscribers now I do not want to be 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.900
 be there we hope to be soon 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.170
 2000 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.110
 and if it can be before summer it would be 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.970
 One last 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.360
 since when I started with this project 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.620
 I did not believe that it was going to happen that I was going to 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.620
 have this success the truth 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.080
 and taught again 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.799
 for a general overview so that 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.799
 see how it looks 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.130
 today a good day ago not much 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.340
 cold not too hot 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.170
 it's very good 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.950
 this is a tomato plant that has come out there 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.950
 from last year 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.040
 and there it is 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.740
 here is the second remittance that planted 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.920
 of lettuces you have in another that are more 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.920
 big 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.110
 and this as I said before the first 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.740
 that the truth that is noticeable but they are three 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.740
 bigger times 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.210
 here I have also planted three pepín 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.210
 heras 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.310
 12 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.310
 and 3 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.610
 but they are some broths that go out there all 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.020
 life then why 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.950
 and here is another round 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.950
 of lettuce 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.250
 here you have them 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.250
 and as I said before the tomato plants 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.810
 how could I listen to the hens and 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:12.239
 they are giving me the egg today 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.239
 the truth that they behave well I have 48 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.170
 and you have 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.349
 another with its flower 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.490
 And this too 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.410
 I'm going to make a panoramic view 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.100
 so you can see how everything is planted 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.340
 here a month or you 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.289
 they will go back to 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.419
 How could I make another video 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.629
 so you can see the evolution of the 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.629
 vegetable 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.659
 and I hope it's already super super grain and 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.910
 augur of lettuce this surely 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:00.310
 they will not be 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.340
 Well, I do not expect you to like the 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.040
 video if you like the video give you a good 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.160
 like 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.730
 and please subscribe and subscribe 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.700
 to the channel or I would not appreciate very much and 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.320
 so the community will be much bigger and 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.580
 we will be encouraged to do many more 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.260
 things 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.260
 well here I leave you until then
