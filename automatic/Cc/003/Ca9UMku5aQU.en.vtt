00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.330 
network with a very good bandwidth
because<00:05:35.900> it<00:05:36.050> will<00:05:36.229> take<00:05:36.949> some<00:05:37.159> of<00:05:37.250> the

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
because it will take some of the

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.980 
because it will take some of the
bandwidth<00:05:37.669> up<00:05:37.909> also<00:05:38.150> I<00:05:38.330> was<00:05:38.539> kind<00:05:38.720> of<00:05:38.780> hoping

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
bandwidth up also I was kind of hoping

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.869 
bandwidth up also I was kind of hoping
they<00:05:39.259> would<00:05:39.379> have<00:05:39.530> some<00:05:39.740> HD<00:05:40.129> inputs<00:05:40.520> for<00:05:40.729> this

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:40.879 
they would have some HD inputs for this

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.430 
they would have some HD inputs for this
but<00:05:41.180> with<00:05:41.300> this<00:05:41.479> technology<00:05:42.169> and<00:05:42.259> it's

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
but with this technology and it's

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.930 
but with this technology and it's
wireless<00:05:42.620> streaming<00:05:43.069> I<00:05:43.310> just<00:05:43.550> don't<00:05:43.729> think

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
wireless streaming I just don't think

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.879
