slog<00:01:17.500> at<00:01:17.770> like<00:01:18.070> DeForest<00:01:18.760> and<00:01:18.970> a<00:01:19.150> lot<00:01:19.299> of

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
slog at like DeForest and a lot of

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.490 
slog at like DeForest and a lot of
people<00:01:19.600> think<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:19.930> can<00:01:20.049> level<00:01:20.320> him<00:01:20.440> up

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
people think that you can level him up

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.800 
people think that you can level him up
and<00:01:20.710> know<00:01:20.860> his<00:01:21.310> max<00:01:21.610> level<00:01:21.850> is<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.330> Duke<00:01:22.600> of

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.480 
and know his max level is the Duke of
Orcs<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.260> he<00:01:23.409> doesn't<00:01:23.710> go<00:01:23.770> any<00:01:24.040> further<00:01:24.130> from

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
Orcs and he doesn't go any further from

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.149 
Orcs and he doesn't go any further from
there<00:01:24.820> so<00:01:25.420> he<00:01:25.930> has<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.049> chance<00:01:26.320> king<00:01:26.890> of<00:01:26.979> orcs

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159

the same time the other unique ability
that<00:02:31.210> this<00:02:31.330> has<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.780> just<00:02:31.990> like<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.680> new<00:02:32.860> orc

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
that this has is just like the new orc

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.040 
that this has is just like the new orc
submachine<00:02:33.700> gun<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.120> has<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.570> chance<00:02:34.900> to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
increase its fire rate and reload speed

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.820 
increase its fire rate and reload speed
at<00:02:37.510> certain<00:02:37.810> periods<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.230> time<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.590> then<00:02:38.710> it

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
at certain periods of time and then it

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.710 
at certain periods of time and then it
will<00:02:38.860> go<00:02:39.070> back<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.280> normal<00:02:39.610> eventually<00:02:40.120> later

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
will go back to normal eventually later

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.690 
will go back to normal eventually later
so<00:02:41.110> that's<00:02:41.680> pretty<00:02:41.950> much<00:02:42.070> all<00:02:42.220> there<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.430> about

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
so that's pretty much all there is about

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.730 
so that's pretty much all there is about
the<00:02:42.790> ogre<00:02:42.910> it's<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.600> torque<00:02:44.230> spin<00:02:44.500> gun

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
the ogre it's just a torque spin gun

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.550 
the ogre it's just a torque spin gun
that<00:02:45.010> shoots<00:02:45.550> explosives<00:02:46.210> and<00:02:46.450> yeah<00:02:47.320> that's

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
that shoots explosives and yeah that's

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.330 
that shoots explosives and yeah that's
all<00:02:47.680> there<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.070> it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
all there is to it

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.700 
all there is to it
overall<00:02:48.850> this<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.330> decent<00:02:49.660> weapon<00:02:50.170> I<00:02:50.410> was

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.710 
overall this is a decent weapon I was
kind<00:02:51.070> of<00:02:51.160> expecting<00:02:51.730> more<00:02:51.910> of<00:02:52.150> course<00:02:52.390> being

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
kind of expecting more of course being

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.290 
kind of expecting more of course being

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
add-on concept for Borderlands 2 I was

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.680 
add-on concept for Borderlands 2 I was
kind<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.400> expecting<00:03:00.880> more<00:03:01.030> for<00:03:01.270> a<00:03:01.300> legendary

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
kind of expecting more for a legendary

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.780 
kind of expecting more for a legendary
but<00:03:02.020> it<00:03:02.470> can<00:03:02.710> still<00:03:02.890> be<00:03:02.950> good<00:03:03.220> with<00:03:03.460> many

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
but it can still be good with many

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.910 
but it can still be good with many
different<00:03:04.150> setups<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:04.930> if<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.590> want<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.830> go

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
different setups and if you want to go

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.800 
different setups and if you want to go
for<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.220> sure<00:03:06.460> I<00:03:06.490> wouldn't<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.270> wouldn't

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
for it sure I wouldn't I wouldn't

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.600 
for it sure I wouldn't I wouldn't
exactly<00:03:08.140> recommend<00:03:08.740> it<00:03:08.890> going<00:03:09.340> through<00:03:09.520> all

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
exactly recommend it going through all

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.310 
exactly recommend it going through all
the<00:03:09.730> trouble<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.120> do<00:03:10.270> it<00:03:10.390> but<00:03:10.570> actually<00:03:11.260> you

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
the trouble to do it but actually you

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.570 
the trouble to do it but actually you
know<00:03:11.440> what<00:03:11.590> since<00:03:11.800> there's<00:03:11.980> an<00:03:12.130> easier<00:03:12.400> way

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
know what since there's an easier way

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.760 
know what since there's an easier way
now<00:03:12.790> with<00:03:13.390> this<00:03:13.570> method<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.290> actually<00:03:14.650> not

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
now with this method it's actually not

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.260 
now with this method it's actually not
too<00:03:14.950> hard<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.220> get<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.400> ogre<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.790> originally

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
too hard to get the ogre I originally

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.880 
too hard to get the ogre I originally
thought<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.540> was<00:03:16.630> way<00:03:16.900> too<00:03:16.930> difficult<00:03:17.650> but

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
thought it was way too difficult but

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.350 
thought it was way too difficult but
it's<00:03:18.370> not<00:03:18.460> too<00:03:18.670> hard<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:18.940> if<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.090> want<00:03:19.240> to<00:03:19.300> go

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
it's not too hard so if you want to go

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.360 
it's not too hard so if you want to go
for<00:03:19.510> this<00:03:19.570> gun<00:03:19.780> it's<00:03:20.020> it's<00:03:20.380> decent<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:20.920> you

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
for this gun it's it's decent and you

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.620 
for this gun it's it's decent and you
can<00:03:21.520> go<00:03:21.640> ahead<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:21.850> try<00:03:22.090> if<00:03:22.240> you<00:03:22.330> want<00:03:22.360> to
