00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
output pickups as well ceramic magnets

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
output pickups as well ceramic magnets
tend<00:01:24.190> to<00:01:24.280> have<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.490> brighter<00:01:25.450> edge<00:01:26.020> your

tend to have a brighter edge your

tend to have a brighter edge your
crunchy<00:01:27.910> or<00:01:28.000> treble<00:01:28.420> response

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.590 

for<00:01:36.280> that<00:01:36.400> reason<00:01:36.430> they're<00:01:36.790> primarily<00:01:37.240> found

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
for that reason they're primarily found

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.630 
for that reason they're primarily found
in<00:01:37.780> high<00:01:37.930> output<00:01:38.380> pickups<00:01:38.770> because<00:01:39.280> high

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
in high output pickups because high

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.969 
in high output pickups because high
output<00:01:40.000> coils<00:01:40.570> tend<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.200> have<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.380> lower<00:01:41.619> treble

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
output coils tend to have a lower treble

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.100 
output coils tend to have a lower treble
resonance<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:42.729> so<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.240> ceramic<00:01:43.689> magnet

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
resonance and so the ceramic magnet

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.020 
resonance and so the ceramic magnet
helps<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.680> bring<00:01:44.830> some<00:01:44.979> of<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:45.100> articulation

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
helps to bring some of that articulation

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.070 
helps to bring some of that articulation
and<00:01:46.649> definition<00:01:47.649> back<00:01:47.860> into<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.399> sound<00:01:49.080> so

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
and definition back into the sound so

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.539 
and definition back into the sound so
hopefully<00:01:50.500> knowing<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.830> little<00:01:50.950> bit<00:01:51.100> about<00:01:51.220> the

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
hopefully knowing a little bit about the

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.880 
hopefully knowing a little bit about the
difference<00:01:51.880> between<00:01:51.909> Allen<00:01:52.420> go<00:01:52.509> to<00:01:52.570> alnico<00:01:53.500> 5
