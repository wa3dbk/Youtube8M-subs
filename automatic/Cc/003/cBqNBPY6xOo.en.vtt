 for a pharmaceutical company no one 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.810

 having worked for more than 20 years in the ambrella he 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.120
 knew that consciousness was not developing this 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.280

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.590
 the leitmotif of the following parts of the series and 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.720
 if not for unplanned intervention 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.210
 chris ri here who knows maybe 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.730
 red eyes with a vertical pupil 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.980
 would cease to be something outstanding for 7 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.530
 minutes of play 7 minutes that he played with us 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.810

 Arthas has changed lost in his 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.560
 So much so that the fight itself became 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.630
 supreme evil general shepard 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.730
 decided to rewrite for the sake of his offense 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.800
 Albert Hesker 's story 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.110
 cold-blooded and slippery and cruel 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.420
 bastard in raccoon city and beyond 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.650
 the theme of betrayal in video games to this 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.540
 the day remains key 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.730
 what can arouse more excitement 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.530
 interspersed with fear than suddenly and 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.320
 disappointment in one of his friends 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.480
 of course suddenly and frustrated 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.310
 Yourself when that one you thought 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.310
 traitor is right 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.800
 xenophobe 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.290
 ruthless avenger muse who knows a lot about 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.110
 in torture and immorality philosopher 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.870
 traitor from wounds with absolutely no pity for 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.450
 their victims women are innocent children only 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.330
 few deserve according to him 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.740
 mercy in the form of death of course 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.540
 vindictive and cunning he remembers everyone 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.060
 who ever crossed his path 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.400
 will be an individual or a whole race 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.590
 he will always find a reason for revenge and and 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.480
 soundness is the last thing 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.760
 Spectrum helped him masterfully 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.100
 manipulate information and while someone 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.140
 tried to rewrite the history of sarna quite 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.730
 the expert said the facts in his reports 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.160
 individual attention activity 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.180
 deserves the book prequel to the legendary 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.640
 space saga 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.710
 climbing exactly where sarn is shown 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.040
 so how trying to convey to you and you 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.500
 I 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.930
 he absolutely hates all even those who 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.850
 were once his brothers in arms 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.130
 a certain stage of his game he decided 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.840
 that rubbed oppressed in the mouth and only 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.270
 he can bring turians from his wounds 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.250
 Christina to the domination but behind the screen 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.290
 the inveterate scum and bastard quickly 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.900
 hiding dangerous not only in terms of 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.370
 views rival saren reluctantly but all 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.380
 does shepard come in contact 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.050
 in various ways trying to win 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.520
 you to his side he is a clear philosopher and 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.920
 his point of view is not devoid of meaning 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.170
 turian thinks that only u serve 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.000
 tenants and surviving the harvest can be saved 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.350
 at least some survivors 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.720
 other options in his opinion 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.820
 will entail the death of all living things 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.710
 his talent of persuasion and colossal 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.080
 influence helped gather an entire army 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.450
 geth and he almost managed to add to 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.370
 her hordes rahni and circles if it were not 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.710
 commander it was a clash of two 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.380
 leaders of two unshakable characters and 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.930
 in it sarn suffered defeat 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.360
 he managed to understand that the lord reaper 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.950
 Nazar will just his brains with 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.750
 the final battle on the citadel i what 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.420
 blurts arno to stop 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.650
 Are there any bullets in this head? 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.650
 saying sacred 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.110
 the main fear of his betrayal lurked in 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.630
 friend shepard and knew for sure that saren was 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:44.380
 rights and reapers sooner or later return 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:46.510
 wounds were right first place 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.730
 you just met the most 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.650
 vile and dishonest traitors in 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.510
 gaming worlds that we ever 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.270
 to meet however this is no reason 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.940
 relax tomorrow in the game worlds 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.490
 new no less insidious bastards will come and 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.500
 I hope you will be ready for this and not 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.660
 think back to them 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.030
 talked about terrible hard and you 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.100
 watched a game of phobias on games channel bast 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.310
 with sure to tell in the comments 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.020
 what betrayal was for you the most 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.130
 shocking perhaps you know about scary 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.650
 no less than me 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:21.180
 and you will see a new portion of the terrible 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.180
 a week later see you soon 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.860
