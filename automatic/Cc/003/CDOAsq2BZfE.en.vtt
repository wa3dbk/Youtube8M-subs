00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.690
 in the bibio there are two forms of scanning the interlaced scanner and the progressive the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.360
 device uses the scanning process to view images in the 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.570
 screen in this picture appear the two modes simultaneously we can appreciate 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.289
 better image in the progressive scan that is watched by thriller 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.220
 An interlaced video scan frame is created from two video fields 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.189
 the first field showed serious odd scanning and the second showed the 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.189
 children for the scanner 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.340
 the new headquarters 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.030
 nothing 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.530
 the nastic percent 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.399
 each field appears once every 50 seconds 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.020
 this produces 25 frames per second 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.540
 the interlaced scan format ranges from 480 lines of horizontal resolution to 1080 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.310
 lines 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.660
 the horizontal resolution lines are the number of lines that divides a 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.080
 weak image 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.100
 all of you take video paot are able to realize is that they have 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.620
 interlaced 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.440
 in the progressive scan hot video each line is scanned to 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.930
 create an image of me 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.360
 the advantage of progressive scanning that the image has more details 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.590
 contrast and sharper lines this was achieved because the image is in all the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.170
 Arabic screen every four times every 25 seconds and this produces 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.410
 50 frames per second 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.150
 The progressive scan format goes from 480 lines of resolution 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.620
 horizontal to 1080 horizontal resolution lines 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.820
 Progressive scanning is not possible through the output that video ovidio 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.920
 compound 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.130
 thus put the already made 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.530
 now the kind of doubts 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.530
 percent 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.420
 past 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.309
 frost
