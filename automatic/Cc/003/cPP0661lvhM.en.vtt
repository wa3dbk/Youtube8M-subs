whatever you want to put on it'll be but

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.789 
whatever you want to put on it'll be but
you<00:02:50.569> probably<00:02:50.780> anything<00:02:51.139> you<00:02:51.230> want<00:02:51.440> blossom

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
you probably anything you want blossom

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.470 
you probably anything you want blossom
to<00:02:51.920> exceed<00:02:52.190> 13<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.609> 6<00:02:52.819> and<00:02:53.000> heights<00:02:53.150> when<00:02:53.359> it's

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
to exceed 13 to 6 and heights when it's

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.300 
to exceed 13 to 6 and heights when it's
loaded<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.989> can<00:02:54.350> put<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:54.769> in<00:02:55.010> your<00:02:55.040> board

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
loaded you can put this in your board

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.400 
loaded you can put this in your board
anything<00:02:55.609> you<00:02:55.700> want<00:02:55.910> as<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.959> know<00:02:57.079> the<00:02:57.200> fifth

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
anything you want as you know the fifth

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.080 
anything you want as you know the fifth
will<00:02:57.590> take<00:02:57.859> up<00:02:57.980> most<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.519> construction

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
will take up most of that construction

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.000 
will take up most of that construction
so<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.209> can't<00:02:59.450> put<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.840> boat<00:03:00.470> in<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.680> back<00:03:00.829> of

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
so you can't put a boat in the back of

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.470 
so you can't put a boat in the back of
truck<00:03:01.220> so<00:03:01.400> that's<00:03:01.579> why<00:03:01.760> we<00:03:01.880> built<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.269> system

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
truck so that's why we built this system

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.440 
truck so that's why we built this system
to<00:03:02.690> go<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.959> front<00:03:03.079> of<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.260> truck
