and the cafeteria so yeah this that's it
um<00:00:55.039> what<00:00:56.039> i<00:00:56.070> suggest<00:00:56.520> using<00:00:56.730> instead<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
um what i suggest using instead of the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.360 
um what i suggest using instead of the
hand<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.230> actually<00:00:58.710> really

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
hand which is actually really

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.080 
hand which is actually really
complicated<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.270> use<00:01:00.469> it<00:01:01.469> makes<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.190> circles

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
complicated to use it makes the circles

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.090 
complicated to use it makes the circles
way<00:01:03.180> better<00:01:03.420> than<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.110> hand<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.650> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
way better than like the hand but you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.340 
way better than like the hand but you
know<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.580> makes<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.210> lot<00:01:06.600> easier<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
know this one makes it a lot easier and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.770 
know this one makes it a lot easier and
i<00:01:07.409> suggest<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.330> airplane

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
i suggest it so just get the airplane

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.859 
i suggest it so just get the airplane
and<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.130> go<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:14.540> this<00:01:15.540> works

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
and you just go like this and this works

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.109 
and you just go like this and this works
perfectly<00:01:16.590> let<00:01:17.310> me<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.549> turn<00:01:17.640> off<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> grid

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
perfectly let me just turn off the grid

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.130 
perfectly let me just turn off the grid
sit<00:01:18.960> oh<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.380> makes<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.920> much<00:01:20.040> better<00:01:21.140> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
sit oh that makes it so much better to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.749 
sit oh that makes it so much better to
make<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.290> more<00:01:22.439> round<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.159> make<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.400> like

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
make it more round you just make it like

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.210 
make it more round you just make it like
taller<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:27.869> i<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.200> tried<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.470> adjust<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.920> use

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
taller and i just tried to adjust it use

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.100 
taller and i just tried to adjust it use
the<00:01:29.340> arrow<00:01:29.520> keys<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.880> make<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.329> more<00:01:30.479> easier<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the arrow keys to make it more easier to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.440 
the arrow keys to make it more easier to
just<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.060> round

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
just as you see it's kind of like round

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
just as you see it's kind of like round
and<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:33.990> straight<00:01:34.530> that's<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.610> only

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and then straight that's like the only

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640 
and then straight that's like the only
thing<00:01:35.850> i<00:01:36.090> don't<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.390> love<00:01:37.079> too<00:01:37.320> much<00:01:37.470> about

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
thing i don't really love too much about

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.830 
thing i don't really love too much about
it<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.070> okay<00:01:38.479> especially<00:01:39.479> because<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it but it's okay especially because the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.420 
it but it's okay especially because the
jersey<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.560> supposed<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.220> straight

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
jersey is like supposed to be straight

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.010 
jersey is like supposed to be straight
right<00:01:41.579> there<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.570> actually<00:01:42.810> really<00:01:42.930> good

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
right there so it's actually really good

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.920 
right there so it's actually really good

good thing about the airplane is that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.619 
good thing about the airplane is that

when you make it bigger you don't have

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.660 
when you make it bigger you don't have

know what that was all about through a
lot<00:05:23.250> of<00:05:23.279> the<00:05:23.490> bitches<00:05:23.759> that's<00:05:24.330> okay<00:05:24.840> that's

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
lot of the bitches that's okay that's

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:31.219 
lot of the bitches that's okay that's
gay<00:05:25.800> a<00:05:26.069> tree<00:05:29.690> and<00:05:30.690> then<00:05:30.839> you<00:05:30.930> go<00:05:31.050> back<00:05:31.080> to

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
gay a tree and then you go back to

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.079 
gay a tree and then you go back to
simple<00:05:31.830> shapes<00:05:32.069> and<00:05:32.490> you<00:05:32.610> get<00:05:32.789> a<00:05:32.819> triangle<00:05:33.509> and

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:35.089 
simple shapes and you get a triangle and

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:38.990 
simple shapes and you get a triangle and
you<00:05:36.089> put<00:05:36.300> it<00:05:36.389> like<00:05:36.509> that<00:05:37.099> what<00:05:38.099> I<00:05:38.129> do<00:05:38.279> is<00:05:38.610> I<00:05:38.940> just

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
you put it like that what I do is I just

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.570 
you put it like that what I do is I just
stamp<00:05:39.389> it<00:05:39.569> a<00:05:39.629> bunch<00:05:39.810> like<00:05:39.990> that<00:05:40.229> so<00:05:40.580> the

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
stamp it a bunch like that so the

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.159 
stamp it a bunch like that so the
triangles<00:05:42.029> are<00:05:42.120> always<00:05:42.419> even<00:05:42.750> I<00:05:42.870> stand<00:05:43.139> for

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
triangles are always even I stand for

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:51.280 
triangles are always even I stand for
three<00:05:43.409> times

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.980 

whoops<00:05:52.290> a<00:05:52.620> new<00:05:53.610> shift<00:05:54.000> and<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:54.450> arrow<00:05:54.630> keys<00:05:54.750> to

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
whoops a new shift and the arrow keys to

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.890 
whoops a new shift and the arrow keys to
move<00:05:55.380> faster<00:05:56.040> and<00:05:57.000> use<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.390> regular<00:05:57.720> arrow

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
move faster and use the regular arrow

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.930 
move faster and use the regular arrow
keys<00:05:58.170> without<00:05:58.350> Shifta<00:05:58.950> you<00:05:59.340> know<00:05:59.460> like<00:05:59.730> he's

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
keys without Shifta you know like he's

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:07.960 
keys without Shifta you know like he's
like<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:01.580> more<00:06:02.580> carefully<00:06:03.170> um<00:06:05.630> like<00:06:06.830> there

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
like that more carefully um like there

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.860 
like that more carefully um like there
um<00:06:08.970> and<00:06:09.960> I'm<00:06:10.050> also<00:06:10.200> going<00:06:10.440> to<00:06:10.500> do<00:06:10.620> fade
