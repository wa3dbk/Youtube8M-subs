this<00:00:01.410> videos<00:00:01.770> response<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.429> jean-luc<00:00:02.970> who

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.190 
this videos response to jean-luc who

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.530 
this videos response to jean-luc who
suggested<00:00:05.190> rightly<00:00:05.520> so<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:06.029> if<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:06.359> went

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
suggested rightly so that if I went

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.330 
suggested rightly so that if I went
ahead<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:06.960> made<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.290> not<00:00:07.500> right<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:08.069> front

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
ahead and I made the not right in front

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.160 
ahead and I made the not right in front
of<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.639> camera<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.630> would<00:00:09.750> be<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.870> heck<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.050> a

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
of the camera it would be a heck of a

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.440 
of the camera it would be a heck of a
lot<00:00:10.290> easier<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.710> see<00:00:10.920> what<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.219> was<00:00:11.400> doing<00:00:11.460> this

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
lot easier to see what I was doing this

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.640 
lot easier to see what I was doing this
is<00:00:12.630> one<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.929> ones<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.290> had<00:00:13.469> made

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
is one of the ones that I had made

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.289 
is one of the ones that I had made
earlier<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.309> had<00:00:14.340> adjusted<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.089> make<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
earlier and I had adjusted to make the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.240 
earlier and I had adjusted to make the
loops<00:00:15.509> shorter<00:00:16.199> since<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.650> had<00:00:16.800> too<00:00:17.039> much

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
loops shorter since it had too much

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.790 
loops shorter since it had too much
length<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.600> what<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> did<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:19.470> fed<00:00:19.650> it

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
length so what I did is I just fed it

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.800 
length so what I did is I just fed it
through<00:00:19.830> fed<00:00:20.460> slack<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.029> reform<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> loop<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
through fed slack to reform the loop and

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.660 
through fed slack to reform the loop and
pulled<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.199> there<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.560> then<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.859> tighten<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
pulled it there and then you tighten it

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.320 
pulled it there and then you tighten it
up<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.029> loop<00:00:24.150> again<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:25.949> right<00:00:25.980> now<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.699> just

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
up on the loop again so right now I just

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.720 
up on the loop again so right now I just
got<00:00:27.449> an<00:00:27.539> extra<00:00:27.720> strand<00:00:28.080> paracord<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.550> see

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
got an extra strand paracord you can see

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.550 
got an extra strand paracord you can see
how<00:00:29.849> if<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.240> don't<00:00:30.420> melt<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.960> frays<00:00:31.230> but

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
how if you don't melt it it frays but

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.020 
how if you don't melt it it frays but
that's<00:00:31.800> really<00:00:32.099> not<00:00:32.219> something<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.790> need<00:00:32.969> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
that's really not something we need to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.139 
that's really not something we need to
worry<00:00:33.210> about<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.600> I'm<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:35.000> take<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
worry about just I'm going to take the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.000 
worry about just I'm going to take the
string<00:00:36.450> pretend<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.350> had<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> loop<00:00:37.739> here

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
string pretend that I had a loop here

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.270 
string pretend that I had a loop here
and<00:00:38.160> work<00:00:38.940> around<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.540> with<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.160> strand<00:00:41.160> of

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
and work around it with this strand of

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.930 
and work around it with this strand of
paracord<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.829> starting<00:00:43.940> putting

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
paracord that I have so starting putting

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.970 
paracord that I have so starting putting
the<00:00:45.120> paracord<00:00:46.129> beneath<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.680> feed<00:00:49.680> one

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the paracord beneath it like so feed one

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.029 
the paracord beneath it like so feed one
end<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> paracord<00:00:50.820> through<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> loop

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
end of the paracord through the loop

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.979 
end of the paracord through the loop
then<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.160> go<00:00:53.280> ahead<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:54.000> hold<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.809> at<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
then I go ahead and hold it here at the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.760 
then I go ahead and hold it here at the
bottom<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.469> loop<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.329> at<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> end<00:00:57.770> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
bottom of the loop and at the end to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.119 
bottom of the loop and at the end to
make<00:00:58.890> sure<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.489> still<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.969> this

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
make sure that you still have this

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.289 
make sure that you still have this
portion<00:01:02.989> take<00:01:03.989> your<00:01:04.140> other<00:01:04.320> half<00:01:05.180> feed<00:01:06.180> it

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
portion take your other half feed it

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.480 
portion take your other half feed it
through<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:07.080> side<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.159> actually

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
through that side and this is actually

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.000 
through that side and this is actually
gonna<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.729> right<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> loop<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.650> of

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
gonna be right here the loop of the of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.210 
gonna be right here the loop of the of
the<00:01:14.880> bow<00:01:15.060> that's<00:01:15.689> what<00:01:15.900> we're<00:01:16.020> making<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:17.100> then

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the bow that's what we're making so then

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.770 
the bow that's what we're making so then
come<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:17.970> around<00:01:18.799> around<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:21.150> loop<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
come here and around around the loop and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.590 
come here and around around the loop and
then<00:01:22.590> through<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.750> original<00:01:25.290> loop<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
then through the original loop like that

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.620 
then through the original loop like that
and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:27.720> hold<00:01:28.020> both<00:01:28.380> ends<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.070> one<00:01:29.250> hand<00:01:29.630> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and then hold both ends in one hand and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.950 
and then hold both ends in one hand and
sort<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.900> pull<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.259> taut<00:01:31.610> like<00:01:32.610> that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.780 

there<00:01:37.960> you<00:01:38.049> jump<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.530> pull<00:01:41.740> tighter<00:01:42.009> it's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
there you jump as you pull tighter it's

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.760 
there you jump as you pull tighter it's
just<00:01:43.090> gonna<00:01:43.299> grab<00:01:43.720> harder<00:01:44.140> so<00:01:44.350> it's<00:01:44.500> not<00:01:44.619> going

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
just gonna grab harder so it's not going

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.580 
just gonna grab harder so it's not going
to<00:01:44.860> slip<00:01:45.070> off<00:01:45.900> let<00:01:46.900> me<00:01:46.990> see<00:01:47.140> if<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.290> can<00:01:47.440> loosen

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
to slip off let me see if I can loosen

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.289 
to slip off let me see if I can loosen
it<00:01:47.799> up<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.070> give<00:01:48.220> you<00:01:48.310> another<00:01:48.490> good<00:01:48.729> idea<00:01:49.030> how

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
it up to give you another good idea how

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.620 
it up to give you another good idea how
it's<00:01:49.860> how<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:50.920> knot<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.310> structured<00:01:51.820> make<00:01:52.600> a

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
it's how the knot is structured make a

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.850 
it's how the knot is structured make a
nice<00:01:52.899> image<00:01:53.740> for<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:56.500> are<00:01:56.560> probably

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
nice image for you there are probably

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.149 
nice image for you there are probably
other<00:01:57.070> ways<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.670> go<00:01:58.119> ahead<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.479> do<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:59.159> there

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
other ways to go ahead and do it there

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.580 
other ways to go ahead and do it there
you<00:02:00.250> go

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.919 

that's<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.830> knot

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.790 

hmm<00:02:10.929> like<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:11.469> cool<00:02:12.310> thanks<00:02:12.579> for<00:02:12.700> watching
