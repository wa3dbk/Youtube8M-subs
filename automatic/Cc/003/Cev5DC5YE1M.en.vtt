I<00:01:02.090> think<00:01:02.510> Vivek<00:01:03.760> made<00:01:04.760> a<00:01:04.790> mistake<00:01:05.240> and<00:01:05.570> the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
I think Vivek made a mistake and the

I think Vivek made a mistake and the
windy<00:01:06.290> helped<00:01:06.740> Stevie<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.330> boss<00:01:08.510> who

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
windy helped Stevie and the boss who

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.650 
windy helped Stevie and the boss who
they<00:01:09.410> were<00:01:09.560> talking<00:01:09.860> about<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:11.090> decision<00:01:11.450> to

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
they were talking about the decision to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.040 
they were talking about the decision to
say<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.710> first<00:01:12.980> half<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:14.180> have<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.750> opposite

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
say the first half to have the opposite

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.240 
say the first half to have the opposite
wind<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:15.710> in<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.760> Sacred<00:01:17.060> Heart<00:01:17.300> for<00:01:18.170> us<00:01:18.320> then

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.179 

from<00:01:32.210> that<00:01:32.450> moment<00:01:32.479> on<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.469> belief<00:01:33.710> came<00:01:33.979> back

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
from that moment on the belief came back

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.039 
from that moment on the belief came back
that<00:01:34.429> we<00:01:34.579> could<00:01:34.759> we<00:01:35.240> can<00:01:35.390> get<00:01:35.570> something<00:01:35.780> wound

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
that we could we can get something wound

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:45.520 
that we could we can get something wound
again<00:01:42.280> now<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.310> be<00:01:43.700> honest<00:01:44.000> I<00:01:44.539> was<00:01:44.899> expecting

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
again now to be honest I was expecting
