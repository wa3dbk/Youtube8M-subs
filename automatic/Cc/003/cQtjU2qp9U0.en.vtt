just so popular here on YouTube and I

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.420 
just so popular here on YouTube and I
talked<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> company<00:01:13.770> about<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.250> they

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.280 
talked to the company about it and they
just<00:01:14.460> said<00:01:14.880> well<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.360> guess<00:01:15.720> your<00:01:15.930> teeth<00:01:16.140> were

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
just said well I guess your teeth were

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
just said well I guess your teeth were
just<00:01:16.530> too<00:01:16.740> white<00:01:16.950> enough<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.250> start<00:01:17.640> off<00:01:17.790> with

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
just too white enough to start off with

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.700 
just too white enough to start off with
and<00:01:18.270> that's<00:01:18.659> why<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.930> probably<00:01:19.200> didn't<00:01:19.560> see

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and that's why you probably didn't see

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.440 
and that's why you probably didn't see
the<00:01:19.830> results<00:01:19.950> their<00:01:20.670> products<00:01:21.150> are<00:01:21.270> also

really<00:01:21.840> expensive<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.740> don't

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
really expensive and I just don't

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.609 
really expensive and I just don't
understand<00:01:23.430> how<00:01:23.610> that's<00:01:23.880> their<00:01:24.450> excuse<00:01:25.170> again

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
man and your hands tend to be a little

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.610 
man and your hands tend to be a little
bit<00:04:30.130> warmer<00:04:30.640> try<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.240> do<00:04:31.419> it<00:04:31.540> no<00:04:31.750> more<00:04:31.930> than<00:04:32.080> 25

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
bit warmer try to do it no more than 25

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.200 
bit warmer try to do it no more than 25
seconds<00:04:33.040> because<00:04:33.160> it<00:04:33.460> will<00:04:33.640> start<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.000> get

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
seconds because it will start to get

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.780 
seconds because it will start to get
hard<00:04:34.510> so<00:04:35.470> I<00:04:35.500> have<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:35.770> little<00:04:36.040> timer<00:04:36.280> here<00:04:36.610> going

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
hard so I have a little timer here going

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.780 
hard so I have a little timer here going
on<00:04:37.000> my<00:04:37.180> clock<00:04:37.480> and<00:04:37.919> I<00:04:38.919> will<00:04:39.100> tell<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.550> when

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790
