00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.700
 good afternoon today our story about 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.789
 most common pests 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.809
 garden ornamental plants it is from lyakh 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.110
 for 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.230
 it is extremely dangerous and unpleasant 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.450
 insect in your garden because of your 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.550
 incredible biological features 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.470
 fast breeding for can give 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.760
 10-15 days in our climate 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.460
 despite the fact that it is small 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.940
 slender animal with or without wings 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.360
 wings 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.020
 she quite aggressively captures 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.440
 plant and infects all new and new 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.660
 plants 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.300
 as a rule for settle on young 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.649
 sprouts stalks buds that is to 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.140
 those places where korra and covers of plants 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.110
 thin enough one of the first 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.260
 signs of defeat the key is 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.630
 some deformation of the leaves and shoots 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.140
 accordingly when for begin to suck 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.040
 juice she excretes feces which 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 hits on 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.330
 underlying leaves and it turns out 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.100
 called for on tiers which 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.020
 causes the development of soot fungi 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.400
 which may turn very 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.830
 quickly destroy the plant 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.869
 but one of the biggest problems that 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.800
 tolerate 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:28.409
 is it of course viral and other 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.820
 diseases for example mycoplasmas they 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.740
 extremely hard 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.220
 they are practically not even removed 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.960
 are treated therefore in case of smoldering everything on 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.869
 first place always goes exactly 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.420
 otle treatment prevention need 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.789
 produce as soon as you see the beginning 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.420
 defeat this happens some 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.570
 by the waves so it can occur in 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.820
 flow literally every 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.710
 10-15 days so you should always 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.810
 approach your green pet chat 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.450
 on and inspect if any first 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.570
 signs of damage ie 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.539
 finding 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.909
 the insects themselves twisting the leaves 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.590
 allotment 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.269
 ipad or black soot joints introduced 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.790
 as well as the leafy plant for 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.640
 amazes their war grow coniferous plant 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.010
 no exception and just as amazed 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.470
 aphids as well as deciduous plants 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.340
 difference can only be placement 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.040
 of these harmful insects as a rule 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.330
 between the needles and nahayan to here or 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.330
 articulation of branches 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.440
 It is very remarkable that she sees 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.319
 amazes bullshit it's big enough 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.760
 types of glue for example pine autumn 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.280
 cheeriness is very big for 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.709
 measuring 5 8 millimeters at a very 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.379
 characteristic and just like on hardwood 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.720
 plants and when severe damage 3 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.730
 characteristic is specific 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.090
 curvature of shoots that improve 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.340
 diagnostics and again I accentuate 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.690
 attention constant constant inspection 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.659
 your green pets 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.049
 if you have a winged lady hide forms 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.420
 3 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.640
 you should immediately apply if the birds 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.379
 this is best systemic because for 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.959
 usually hit the plant then 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.510
 when intensive sap flow with me 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.579
 systemic insecticides such for example 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.579
 as konfidor and its analogues find but food 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.470
 is most appropriate also 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.140
 I can underline a very important detail 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.720
 the connection between 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.370
 insects such as ants and aphids 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.670
 even here on this little one 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.690
 plot we can see an ant which 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.579
 blowing so that we can with certainty 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.599
 say that the connection is my kind is she 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.569
 there is always 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:49.140
 and so for more decisive action 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.500
 to destroy what you need 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.580
 engage in destruction activities 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.660
 ants on the site than will be told 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.730
 in the next from time to time with spring 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.459
 almost to late autumn air 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.470
 little feet start flying 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.390
 sit on your face on your hands do you think 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.480
 what is it that can and but in fact 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.880
 In fact, this winged form of dividers 3 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.480
 who are starting a new settlement phase 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.660
 Russia 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.250
 if you are on your site on hand or on 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.260
 plants start to set such 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.810
 little flies is the first sign 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.060
 that a new stage has begun in the fight against 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.730
 heavy 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.380
 pests of various plants 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.380
 namely those need bison
