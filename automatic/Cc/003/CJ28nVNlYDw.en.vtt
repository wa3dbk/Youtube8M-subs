00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
always amazed at how well they are but

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.280 
always amazed at how well they are but
the<00:00:32.940> build<00:00:33.210> quality<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:34.550> this<00:00:35.719> this<00:00:36.719> figures

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the build quality of this this figures

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.500 
the build quality of this this figures
is<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:38.250> poor<00:00:39.320> first<00:00:40.320> off<00:00:40.649> when<00:00:41.309> i<00:00:41.760> received

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
is really poor first off when i received

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.069 
is really poor first off when i received
them<00:00:43.340> his<00:00:44.340> eyes<00:00:45.530> didn't<00:00:46.530> work<00:00:47.300> I<00:00:48.300> had<00:00:48.960> nothing

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
them his eyes didn't work I had nothing

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.479 
them his eyes didn't work I had nothing
to<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> batteries<00:00:50.039> there's<00:00:50.309> just

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to do with the batteries there's just

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.750 
to do with the batteries there's just
something<00:00:50.879> wrong<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> circuitry<00:00:52.610> but<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
something wrong in the circuitry but I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.569 
something wrong in the circuitry but I
you<00:00:54.180> know<00:00:54.210> I'll<00:00:54.660> deal<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.949> eyes<00:00:56.250> on

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
you know I'll deal with that the eyes on

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.560 
you know I'll deal with that the eyes on
that<00:00:57.140> often<00:00:59.570> the<00:01:00.570> other<00:01:00.809> thing<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:02.579> don't

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
that often the other thing I just don't

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.240 
that often the other thing I just don't
think<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:06.409> his<00:01:07.640> build<00:01:08.640> quality<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:10.250> really

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
think that his build quality is really

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.520 
think that his build quality is really
there<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:13.460> far<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.119> materials<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.500> they

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
there as far as the materials that they

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.170 
there as far as the materials that they
used<00:01:18.439> his<00:01:19.439> plastic<00:01:20.040> seems<00:01:20.909> kinda<00:01:21.810> cheap

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
used his plastic seems kinda cheap

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.600 
used his plastic seems kinda cheap
compared<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.450> say<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.650> last<00:01:25.950> Iron<00:01:26.790> Man<00:01:28.610> Battle

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
compared to say the last Iron Man Battle

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.730 
compared to say the last Iron Man Battle
Damage<00:01:30.829> tradition<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.900> just<00:01:33.900> how<00:01:34.140> well<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
Damage tradition and just how well the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.630 
Damage tradition and just how well the
Tony<00:01:35.009> Stark<00:01:37.100> edition<00:01:38.100> came<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:40.520> one<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
Tony Stark edition came out one of the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.850 
Tony Stark edition came out one of the
reasons<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.240> say<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:43.880> there<00:01:45.500> were<00:01:46.500> big

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
reasons I can say this there were big

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.740 
reasons I can say this there were big
advertising<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.939> how<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:49.229> had<00:01:50.750> flexibility

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
advertising on how it had flexibility

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.709 
advertising on how it had flexibility
well<00:01:53.060> from<00:01:54.060> minor<00:01:54.509> posing<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:56.670> snapped<00:01:57.420> off

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
well from minor posing it snapped off

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.490 
well from minor posing it snapped off
and<00:01:58.310> I<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.490> tell<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:01.610> it's<00:02:02.610> only<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:04.020> small

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
and I can tell you it's only this small

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.919 
and I can tell you it's only this small
piece<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:07.860> small<00:02:08.429> piece<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:08.970> there<00:02:09.179> that

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
piece and a small piece in there that

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.760 
piece and a small piece in there that
held<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.319> together<00:02:10.730> really<00:02:11.730> not<00:02:12.030> much<00:02:12.239> at<00:02:12.720> all

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
held it together really not much at all

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.090 
held it together really not much at all
cold<00:02:14.280> GI<00:02:14.580> Joes<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.510> rubber<00:02:15.810> bands<00:02:16.170> were

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
cold GI Joes of the rubber bands were

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.390 
cold GI Joes of the rubber bands were
better<00:02:17.940> put<00:02:18.240> together<00:02:18.740> then<00:02:19.740> this<00:02:19.950> hot<00:02:20.160> toy

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
better put together then this hot toy

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
better put together then this hot toy
was<00:02:20.730> which<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.870> huge<00:02:22.320> disappointment<00:02:23.420> but

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
was which is a huge disappointment but

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.490 
was which is a huge disappointment but
to<00:02:24.600> go<00:02:24.780> over<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.080> figure<00:02:25.470> um<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:27.360> course

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
to go over the figure um of course

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.260 
to go over the figure um of course
everybody<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.860> probably<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.430> biome<00:02:29.880> to

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
everybody is probably on a biome to

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.100 
everybody is probably on a biome to
complete<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.560> sets<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.390> all<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.570> armors

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
complete the the sets of all the armors

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.400 
complete the the sets of all the armors
which<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.740> why<00:02:34.950> really<00:02:35.910> well<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.750> really<00:02:37.170> wanted

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
which is why really well I really wanted

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.110 
which is why really well I really wanted
to<00:02:37.530> figure<00:02:37.680> out<00:02:37.890> those<00:02:38.070> new<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.460> lot<00:02:38.850> better

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.550 

some<00:02:42.120> other<00:02:42.300> disappointments<00:02:43.020> there's<00:02:43.260> just

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
some other disappointments there's just

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.130 
some other disappointments there's just
not<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:43.860> much<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.500> figure<00:02:47.390> they<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
not that much to the figure they the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.010 
not that much to the figure they the
stand<00:02:49.500> was<00:02:49.710> pretty<00:02:49.950> weak<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.550> had<00:02:51.210> a<00:02:51.240> regular

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
stand was pretty weak I had a regular

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.230 
stand was pretty weak I had a regular
black<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.700> know<00:02:53.910> hot<00:02:54.330> toy<00:02:54.540> stand<00:02:55.850> with<00:02:56.850> the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
black you know hot toy stand with the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.840 
black you know hot toy stand with the
mark<00:02:57.960> sticks<00:02:58.230> coming<00:02:58.560> out<00:02:58.710> we<00:02:59.160> saw<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.670> it

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
mark sticks coming out we saw that it

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.910 
mark sticks coming out we saw that it
had<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.210> stand<00:03:00.450> from<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> field<00:03:01.110> where<00:03:01.560> they

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
had to stand from the field where they

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.940 
had to stand from the field where they
had<00:03:02.520> their<00:03:02.700> battle<00:03:03.180> together<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.900> thought<00:03:04.710> the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
had their battle together I thought the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.680 
had their battle together I thought the
field<00:03:05.220> would<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.490> been<00:03:05.610> great<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.480> have<00:03:06.660> him

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
field would have been great to have him

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.330 
field would have been great to have him
back<00:03:06.990> to<00:03:07.200> back<00:03:08.060> but<00:03:09.060> probably<00:03:10.160> they'll<00:03:11.160> come

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
back to back but probably they'll come

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.330 
back to back but probably they'll come
out<00:03:11.490> with<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.700> diorama<00:03:12.800> like<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.950> different

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
out with a diorama like the different

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.910 
out with a diorama like the different
snake<00:03:14.610> eyes<00:03:14.850> or<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.180> throne<00:03:15.570> for<00:03:15.870> GI<00:03:16.050> Joe<00:03:16.350> so

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
snake eyes or the throne for GI Joe so

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.560 
snake eyes or the throne for GI Joe so
that<00:03:17.130> they<00:03:17.280> can<00:03:17.430> bang<00:03:17.640> us<00:03:17.820> for<00:03:18.030> more<00:03:18.209> money<00:03:18.390> on

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
that they can bang us for more money on

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.170 
that they can bang us for more money on
that<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.020> of<00:03:19.890> course<00:03:19.920> they'll<00:03:20.310> get<00:03:20.490> it<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.880> we

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
that and of course they'll get it and we

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.780 
that and of course they'll get it and we
probably<00:03:21.450> all<00:03:21.750> will<00:03:22.340> put<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.430> go<00:03:23.550> over<00:03:23.700> the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
probably all will put to go over the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.680 
probably all will put to go over the
features<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:25.050> were<00:03:25.860> pretty<00:03:26.100> cool<00:03:26.450> he's<00:03:27.450> got

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
features that were pretty cool he's got

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.590 
features that were pretty cool he's got
his<00:03:27.990> missile<00:03:28.980> launcher<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:30.470> sucks<00:03:31.470> down

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
his missile launcher that sucks down

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.440 
his missile launcher that sucks down
he's<00:03:33.600> got<00:03:33.870> his<00:03:33.990> Gatling<00:03:34.530> gun<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.880> slides

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
he's got his Gatling gun that slides

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.210 
he's got his Gatling gun that slides
thought<00:03:36.990> slides<00:03:37.440> side<00:03:39.170> rotate<00:03:40.170> scones<00:03:40.709> couple

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
thought slides side rotate scones couple

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.540 
thought slides side rotate scones couple
positions<00:03:42.950> might<00:03:43.950> as<00:03:44.010> well<00:03:44.130> take<00:03:44.310> them<00:03:44.490> apart

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
positions might as well take them apart

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:52.000 
positions might as well take them apart
here<00:03:45.440> if<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:47.040> pull<00:03:47.910> these<00:03:48.150> down<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:50.190> can<00:03:50.459> pop
