is<00:02:39.750> excellent<00:02:40.260> for<00:02:40.409> taking<00:02:40.709> out<00:02:40.829> groups<00:02:41.129> of

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
is excellent for taking out groups of

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.789 
is excellent for taking out groups of
guys<00:02:41.599> this<00:02:42.599> launcher<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.049> extremely<00:02:43.650> powerful

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
guys this launcher is extremely powerful

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.589 
guys this launcher is extremely powerful
especially<00:02:44.310> considering<00:02:44.909> its<00:02:45.060> damage<00:02:45.450> is

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
especially considering its damage is

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.500 
especially considering its damage is
times<00:02:45.930> by<00:02:46.169> 3<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.859> it<00:02:47.219> only<00:02:47.340> uses<00:02:47.579> up<00:02:47.879> one

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
times by 3 and it only uses up one

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.500 
times by 3 and it only uses up one
rocket<00:02:49.109> per<00:02:49.620> shot<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.430> technically<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:51.329> have

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
rocket per shot so technically you have

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.509 
rocket per shot so technically you have
three<00:02:51.959> times<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.530> rockets<00:02:52.980> if<00:02:53.129> you<00:02:53.280> think

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
three times the rockets if you think

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.909 
three times the rockets if you think
about<00:02:53.699> it<00:02:53.879> I<00:02:54.290> hope<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.409> enjoyed<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.769> video
