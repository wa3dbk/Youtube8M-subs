00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
they're not the source block they make

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.180 
they're not the source block they make
the<00:00:22.840> first<00:00:23.110> block<00:00:23.350> that<00:00:23.620> taught<00:00:23.830> you<00:00:24.040> don't

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
the first block that taught you don't

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.080 
the first block that taught you don't
make<00:00:24.310> obsidian<00:00:25.350> yeah<00:00:26.350> so<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:27.760> need<00:00:27.940> to<00:00:28.060> make

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
make obsidian yeah so you need to make

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.820 
make obsidian yeah so you need to make
sure<00:00:28.240> it's<00:00:28.630> not<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:28.870> source<00:00:29.200> block<00:00:29.440> touching

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
sure it's not the source block touching

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.880 
sure it's not the source block touching
each<00:00:29.920> other<00:00:30.160> each<00:00:30.610> other<00:00:31.289> right<00:00:33.480> no<00:00:34.710> with<00:00:35.710> this

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
each other each other right no with this

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.280 
each other each other right no with this
works<00:00:36.160> is<00:00:36.400> just<00:00:36.730> equal<00:00:37.060> distance<00:00:37.840> behind<00:00:38.079> a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
works is just equal distance behind a

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.710 
works is just equal distance behind a
piece<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.470> comfort<00:00:38.860> zone<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:40.120> every<00:00:40.480> time<00:00:40.690> a

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
piece of cobblestone is formed a clock

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.720 
piece of cobblestone is formed a clock
behind<00:00:43.930> here<00:00:44.470> I<00:00:45.130> usually<00:00:46.060> set<00:00:46.420> my<00:00:46.570> nose<00:00:47.730> 554

I'm not really good off redstone it just
slowed<00:00:54.399> it<00:00:54.430> down<00:00:54.579> and<00:00:54.730> just<00:00:54.940> move<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.329> block

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
slowed it down and just move the block

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.049 
slowed it down and just move the block
that<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.840> new<00:00:55.989> one<00:00:56.140> can<00:00:56.290> form<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:57.640> that's<00:00:57.940> just

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059

engines<00:01:14.009> that<00:01:15.009> they<00:01:15.670> cobblestone<00:01:16.359> like<00:01:16.509> this

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
engines that they cobblestone like this

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.349 
engines that they cobblestone like this
one's<00:01:16.840> doing<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.649> just<00:01:18.429> push<00:01:18.969> them<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.149> certain

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359 
one's doing and just push them a certain

one's doing and just push them a certain
amount<00:01:19.509> of<00:01:19.600> blog<00:01:21.659> stopped<00:01:22.659> by<00:01:23.020> obsidian<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
amount of blog stopped by obsidian the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.730 
amount of blog stopped by obsidian the
limits<00:01:30.639> of<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:32.079> soon<00:01:32.259> as<00:01:32.409> you<00:01:32.499> break

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
limits of it and as soon as you break

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.529 
limits of it and as soon as you break
one<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.340> engines<00:01:34.469> around<00:01:35.469> and<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:37.299> way<00:01:37.479> you

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
one the engines around and that way you

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.980 
one the engines around and that way you
can<00:01:37.840> just<00:01:37.869> like<00:01:38.560> block<00:01:39.479> fill<00:01:40.479> it<00:01:40.630> right<00:01:40.659> back

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
can just like block fill it right back

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.769 
can just like block fill it right back
yet<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.549> if<00:01:42.789> you<00:01:42.880> come<00:01:43.060> up<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.179> the<00:01:43.329> roof<00:01:43.509> here

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:43.779 
yet and if you come up to the roof here

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:50.290 
yet and if you come up to the roof here
that's<00:01:44.380> what<00:01:44.649> allowed<00:01:44.889> me<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.840> be<00:01:47.020> able<00:01:47.109> to

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:59.720 

it<00:01:51.300> might<00:01:51.660> be<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> little<00:01:51.960> bit<00:01:52.110> slow<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.610> is

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
it might be a little bit slow so this is

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:09.609 
it might be a little bit slow so this is
a<00:01:59.850> pretty<00:01:59.970> neat<00:02:00.270> structure<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:00.870> here

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.860 

city<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.770> places<00:02:11.220> over<00:02:11.820> here<00:02:12.030> they<00:02:12.180> don't<00:02:12.720> have

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
city in places over here they don't have

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.990 
city in places over here they don't have
to<00:02:12.990> be<00:02:13.020> opinion<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.680> made<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:13.980> thats<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:14.790> work

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
to be opinion I made it thats not work

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.750 
to be opinion I made it thats not work
you<00:02:15.210> made<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.420> up<00:02:15.720> sitting<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.350> it's<00:02:17.070> look

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
you made it up sitting so it's look

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.920 
you made it up sitting so it's look
better<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.950> does<00:02:20.190> break<00:02:20.510> then<00:02:21.510> I

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
better so that if it does break then I

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.000 
better so that if it does break then I
don't<00:02:22.110> have<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.380> replace<00:02:22.890> see<00:02:23.490> oh<00:02:24.860> it's<00:02:25.860> out<00:02:25.980> of

up of TNT for a loaf I know it will yeah
so<00:04:00.910> then<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.209> generators<00:04:01.780> will<00:04:01.959> get<00:04:02.079> damaged

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
so then the generators will get damaged

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:16.110 
so then the generators will get damaged
exactly<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:13.560> like<00:04:14.560> in<00:04:14.709> survival<00:04:15.280> mode<00:04:15.310> you

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
exactly so like in survival mode you

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.140 
exactly so like in survival mode you
should<00:04:16.329> put<00:04:16.510> Bowl<00:04:16.810> barriers<00:04:17.260> around<00:04:17.500> this<00:04:18.150> so

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
should put Bowl barriers around this so

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.440 
should put Bowl barriers around this so
creepers<00:04:19.539> can't<00:04:19.780> lick<00:04:19.959> blowed<00:04:20.169> up<00:04:21.180> if<00:04:22.180> you

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
creepers can't lick blowed up if you

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.000 
creepers can't lick blowed up if you
have<00:04:22.720> enough<00:04:22.990> obsidian<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.680> could<00:04:23.830> cover

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
have enough obsidian you could cover

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.430 
have enough obsidian you could cover
your<00:04:24.280> generator<00:04:28.020> well<00:04:29.020> this<00:04:29.139> is<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.289> pretty

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
your generator well this is a pretty

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.360 
your generator well this is a pretty
cool<00:04:29.740> house<00:04:29.919> I<00:04:30.630> didn't<00:04:31.630> think<00:04:31.660> as<00:04:31.960> possible

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
cool house I didn't think as possible

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.700 
cool house I didn't think as possible
oh<00:04:36.600> yeah<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:37.810> didn't<00:04:38.080> take<00:04:38.260> me<00:04:38.350> very<00:04:38.380> long<00:04:38.590> to

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
oh yeah it didn't take me very long to

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.800 
oh yeah it didn't take me very long to
build<00:04:38.919> either<00:04:39.150> power<00:04:40.150> went<00:04:40.419> out<00:04:40.479> and<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.690> have

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
build either power went out and I have

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.290 
build either power went out and I have
to<00:04:40.900> start<00:04:41.110> from<00:04:41.169> scratch
