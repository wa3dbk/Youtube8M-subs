00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.259 
with it so might be just one or two
videos<00:00:13.799> maybe<00:00:14.309> I'll<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:14.639> more<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.880> don't<00:00:15.059> know

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269

yet<00:00:15.770> I've<00:00:16.770> had<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.010> change<00:00:17.160> my<00:00:17.430> desktop

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
yet I've had to change my desktop

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.200 
yet I've had to change my desktop
resolution<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.279> low<00:00:20.520> because<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.029> game

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
resolution really low because this game

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.540 
resolution really low because this game
won't<00:00:21.420> go<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.869> full<00:00:22.650> screen<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.250> actually

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
won't go to full screen so I actually

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.839 
won't go to full screen so I actually
change<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.939> 800<00:00:24.390> by<00:00:24.480> 600<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:26.369> try<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> get<00:00:26.760> up

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
change it to 800 by 600 to try to get up

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.060 
change it to 800 by 600 to try to get up
more<00:00:27.599> full<00:00:27.840> screen<00:00:28.140> version<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.800> game

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
more full screen version of this game

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.240 
more full screen version of this game
but<00:00:29.689> that's<00:00:30.689> that's<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> best<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.830> can<00:00:31.890> do<00:00:32.099> with

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
but that's that's the best I can do with

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.060 
but that's that's the best I can do with
this<00:00:32.340> monitor<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:33.450> I've<00:00:33.600> really<00:00:33.989> pushed<00:00:34.920> it

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
down it's kind of distorted because it's

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.720 
down it's kind of distorted because it's
a<00:00:36.630> widescreen<00:00:37.020> monitor<00:00:37.620> table<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.550> I'm<00:00:38.610> just

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
of a noob ah not much choice

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.139 
of a noob ah not much choice
I<00:00:52.350> guess<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.949> picture<00:00:53.160> guy<00:00:53.879> looks<00:00:54.059> pretty

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
I guess just a picture guy looks pretty

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.119 
I guess just a picture guy looks pretty
cool

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
cool

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.860 
cool
Kri<00:00:56.760> character<00:00:58.309> okay<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.399> wsad<00:01:00.180> key<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.570> move

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
Kri character okay so wsad key is move

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.329 
Kri character okay so wsad key is move
and<00:01:01.789> your<00:01:02.789> mouse<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:04.140> attack<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:05.250> I

that before it's a good game too okay so

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.990 
that before it's a good game too okay so
let's<00:02:31.200> go<00:02:31.440> figure<00:02:32.160> out<00:02:32.220> where<00:02:32.340> these<00:02:32.459> goblins

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
let's go figure out where these goblins

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.860 
let's go figure out where these goblins
are<00:02:37.280> map<00:02:38.280> up<00:02:38.610> there<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.940> kind<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.299> useful<00:02:39.510> it's

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
are map up there is kind of useful it's

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.680 
are map up there is kind of useful it's
hard<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.110> tell<00:02:40.260> where<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.470> am<00:02:40.620> on<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:41.510> what's<00:02:42.510> up

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
I've tried and just like glitches yo

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.979 
I've tried and just like glitches yo
