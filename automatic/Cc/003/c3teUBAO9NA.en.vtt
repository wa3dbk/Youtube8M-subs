00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.710
 Yes 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.409
 But for the first time 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.109
 Basically, there are things for which enthusiasm is guaranteed 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:35.130
 There was something 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.130
 There were a lot of things before 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.810
 The battle is continuing at 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.920
 I was using it through the microphone 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.940
 If you do not have the equipment 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.830
 Lose 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.840
 So the clerk 32 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.370
 Do you argue a lot 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.370
 If said 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.570
 Of reform 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.720
 If you are home you want what you like 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.500
 The clerk who puts in will say 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.580
 At that moment 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.980
 No, actually I'm a newbie, but it's been a while 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.910
 This is the first time I get along with .3 when the right angle building gets better 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.990
 Well, in the calculation it is said that it was the customer's pattern 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.720
 The person who does not do that one 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.280
 I have been listening to the festival in 2002 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.510
 Or old fashioned 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.440
 There is no foreign ownership of that one 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.440
 In that case say honestly 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.290
 I think I'll try to get started, but this guitar pitcher 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.780
 Would you like to leave me for a moment 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.300
 It's so sweet and it's a circuit once 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.590
 Urgent accused of making a big charge while carrying out a park switch 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.840
 I hear a sound 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.820
 4 This Fukushima University and a little 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.180
 I can not stop it 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.440
 It seems to be most likely to be the first point 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 I hate high fate 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.960
 During the performance of 2. 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.049
 So the more and more information goes to these two next 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:57.900
 Shooting 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.420
 From the man who was most interested in hearing it is a great deered 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.360
 A little bit of a whistle to a pin and something 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.920
 Someone who can speak with 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.819
 Do you feel depressed 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.230
 I felt that I was a great photographer 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.230
 It is not good 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:27.139
 Everybody in the source of Bahrain 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.139
 62 people can be introduced in the rumor 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.669
 This is transparent software 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.669
 After leaving for 5 points all the time 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.129
 Because it is a rain man, not a feeling of overheating 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.370
 Still because I like this color 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.180
 But it was open
