00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.880
 Hello and welcome to memorable marriage 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.739
 In today's Lightroom Tutorial I want to answer a question 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.649
 Miro is asked again and again 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.579
 and it goes down 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:31.609
 the 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.420
 Structure my word Photos of my pictures on the disk 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.190
 how percent do I archive my photos like Zotti her photos on the 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.070
 Hard drive so that 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.070
 which later also finds a simple one 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.190
 I have to go here 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.560
 open my current folder 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.110
 and process is also very nice to see I have all the annual Rau 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.790
 and this year so Ruhr 2009 are the single or soap tomorrow with it 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.560
 Sorting is right 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.700
 I also have the percentage with the supervisor 01 January 02 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.720
 February 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.079
 then the sorting is correct 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.780
 Windows Explorer percent 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.780
 when I call the photos 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.500
 around 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.680
 It has always been like this in the past 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.630
 All the photos from all years in the had carried in my name means I had 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.400
 a folder 2007 2008 2009 trendy 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.710
 now as a folder 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.850
 and in the respective or dryer 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.000
 then the respective day folder that means theirs then the opera just like them 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.440
 come from the camera 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.650
 2009 01 01 this is rank first January and percent the bandage the city still 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.620
 for each 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.480
 a meaningful name that has been photographed here 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.540
 and percent so I can get the easiest and fastest fit again 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.880
 the problem 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.410
 at the time when all photos from all years stayed here 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.869
 set myself as me 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.319
 Percent in the region 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.149
 respectively 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:24.689
 It will say 23 to 25 thousand photos have come 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.879
 The team leaders warned about tears 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.069
 because Lightroom has become noticeably slower that means it is open from 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.679
 Lightroom took much longer and percent the whole work with 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.189
 Lightroom has slowed down 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.189
 That's why I have 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.819
 starting with the percentages also building structure too 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.269
 Changes here remain Rome 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.760
 and I went the following way I have each individual 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.469
 Catalogs created for the only years 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.799
 that means I have a catalog for the year 2007 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.719
 with own pictures from 2007 a catalog 2008 is drinking a catalog 2009 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.829
 and I open the catalog in Ono 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.749
 which I just need that is usually actually the last 2009 only 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:18.949
 if I have a picture of China's older now 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.849
 then it will be difficult with it 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.239
 a two mouse clicks latter part open 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.579
 the motto 2008 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.579
 the line closes short feels again and again 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.959
 my photos from the year 2008 are also available here 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.449
 how do I put it so now 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.489
 9 catalogs 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.609
 that is actually relatively easy 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:43.709
 brittle 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.069
 very much too that it is not the 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.019
 Catalog file the line catalog the part with this year's order 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.409
 operate Tacke 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.839
 so I only offered this complete 2009 location to Paule of a backups 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:00.970
 Example has to backup and have both the Lightroom catalog file 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.429
 as well as percent all photos separate percent in a compact Opel 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:08.819
 so 2010 I would insert now 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.819
 File new catalog 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:17.959
 I am looking for May in the RP disk with the photos Arrows 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.949
 Now put her on a new North Murder 2010 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:24.880
 confirm that 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.139
 open this folder 2010 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.780
 and would be here now 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.470
 create a Lightroom catalog of the part that is also called 2010 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.900
 that also means saving 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.040
 the catalog opens I have to confirm the plate 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.670
 and from now on a completely new lean 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.949
 Catalog 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.119
 and can now import my photos here 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.699
 for example this photo 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.699
 I want to copy him here 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:01.700
 I'm looking here now 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.559
 also copy to 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.559
 again this hard drive 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.529
 Capture Photos 2010 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.650
 and 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.629
 Let's import this now in the war too 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.629
 also the photo here now 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.729
 and can work like this now 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.729
 I'm going back to 2009 now 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.199
 and let's check here once 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.630
 Explorer Metz mean 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.630
 photos 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.800
 Here you can see these two folders 2009 and 2010 now 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.669
 and in these folders are respectively 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.050
 the victims with each month 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.270
 and additionally 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.490
 he has the log file 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.270
 the here now 92 employee Reus is in this case 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.729
 that means assurances I just need this complete folder 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.050
 Safe here in 2009 have all backed up what I do for Lightroom 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.039
 need all work steps 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.889
 all editing features in Lightroom 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.580
 if anything breaks me percent I can do that their time as there in the year 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.509
 put 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.509
 yes that was it failed the kita-line tutorial 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.310
 by this circumstance that individual catalogs created Ismail Lightroom 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.619
 I have become much faster again every year 

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:36.270
 rarely on 12 20 25 thousand photos 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.520
 I usually have ten to 15 thousand photos per year 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.039
 and percent that fits quite well with it's guiding theme actually still relative 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.770
 it barely makes a speed loss 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.990
 to record one 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.669
 until the next guidance tutorial happy again about comments 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.580
 if you have questions and suggestions about Lightroom Hardt simple short 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.300
 Leave a comment or never send me any more 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.789
 I then like to answer
