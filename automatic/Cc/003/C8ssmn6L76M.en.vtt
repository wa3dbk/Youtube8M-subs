00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
right so you see I don't really

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.319 
right so you see I don't really
understand<00:00:44.399> people<00:00:44.700> who<00:00:44.730> would<00:00:44.969> get<00:00:45.090> upset

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
understand people who would get upset

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.459 
understand people who would get upset
for<00:00:45.480> him<00:00:45.600> wanting<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.050> better<00:00:46.230> players

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
for him wanting to have better players

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.600 
for him wanting to have better players
with<00:00:46.649> them<00:00:46.800> maybe<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.100> could<00:00:47.250> handle<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
with them maybe you could handle it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.600 
with them maybe you could handle it
better<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.860> it's<00:00:49.860> kind<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> turned<00:00:50.340> into<00:00:50.399> this

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
better but it's kind of turned into this

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.369 
better but it's kind of turned into this
thing<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:51.000> season<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.870> ongoing

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
thing all season and it's this ongoing

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.660 
thing all season and it's this ongoing
theme<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.100> won't<00:00:53.190> go<00:00:53.399> away

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
theme now that won't go away

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.910 
theme now that won't go away
I<00:00:53.940> think<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> good<00:00:55.110> side<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.530> they're

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
I think the good side is that they're

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.889 
I think the good side is that they're
winning<00:00:56.070> they're<00:00:56.579> pressing<00:00:56.940> 12<00:00:57.539> games<00:00:57.690> about

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
winning they're pressing 12 games about

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.229 
winning they're pressing 12 games about
500<00:00:58.320> right<00:00:58.410> now<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.710> looks<00:00:58.739> really<00:00:59.219> good<00:00:59.399> I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
500 right now it looks really good I

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.639 
500 right now it looks really good I
don't<00:01:00.719> really<00:01:00.930> think<00:01:00.989> they're<00:01:01.289> gonna<00:01:01.379> make<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
don't really think they're gonna make a

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.990 
don't really think they're gonna make a
move<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.250> Dwight<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> don't<00:01:02.760> think<00:01:02.910> he's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
move with Dwight I don't think he's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.729 
move with Dwight I don't think he's
going<00:01:03.180> anywhere<00:01:03.329> I've<00:01:04.140> kind<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.439> thought<00:01:04.589> all

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
going anywhere I've kind of thought all

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.350

the best players you can and and the way

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the NBA's worked the past couple of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.010 
the NBA's worked the past couple of
years<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.850> playoffs<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.810> into

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
years in the playoffs is you get into

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.179 
years in the playoffs is you get into
the<00:01:16.110> playoffs<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.619> hot<00:01:16.799> that's<00:01:17.070> what

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the playoffs you get hot that's what

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.340 
the playoffs you get hot that's what
happened<00:01:17.400> Orlando<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.820> 2009<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.200> just

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
happened Orlando in 2009 you can just

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.109 
happened Orlando in 2009 you can just
win<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> final<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> think

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
win out to the final so I think

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.700 
win out to the final so I think
Orlando's<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.290> good<00:01:22.439> place

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
Orlando's in a good place

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
Orlando's in a good place
maybe<00:01:23.430> they<00:01:23.580> pick<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.909> someone<00:01:24.210> else<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
maybe they pick up someone else and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.719 
maybe they pick up someone else and
bench<00:01:24.869> help<00:01:25.110> some<00:01:25.290> depth<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.159> don't<00:01:26.549> think

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
bench help some depth but I don't think

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.070 
bench help some depth but I don't think
they're<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.850> far<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.479> think<00:01:27.659> they<00:01:27.930> keep

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
they're that far and I think they keep

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.749 
they're that far and I think they keep
Dwight<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:28.950> go<00:01:29.070> from<00:01:29.189> there<00:01:29.369> another

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
Dwight and just go from there another

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.100 
Dwight and just go from there another
team<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.030> seems<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.780> good<00:01:30.960> place

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
team that seems to be in a good place

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.660

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
maybe they make a move but you know this

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.830 
maybe they make a move but you know this
whole<00:03:17.280> trade<00:03:17.820> deadline<00:03:17.970> has<00:03:18.270> been<00:03:18.600> kind<00:03:18.810> of

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
whole trade deadline has been kind of

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.210 
whole trade deadline has been kind of
slow<00:03:18.990> right<00:03:19.290> right<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.710> there<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.860> reason<00:03:20.190> for

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
slow right right is there a reason for

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.100 
slow right right is there a reason for
that<00:03:20.490> I<00:03:20.760> mean<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.150> stands<00:03:21.390> out<00:03:21.570> -<00:03:21.690> yeah

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110

that I mean that that stands out - yeah
I<00:03:22.140> think<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.500> couple<00:03:22.710> of<00:03:22.830> reasons<00:03:22.950> from<00:03:23.190> one<00:03:23.400> no

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
I think a couple of reasons from one no

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.800 
I think a couple of reasons from one no
one<00:03:23.790> wants<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:23.970> give<00:03:24.120> up<00:03:24.180> draft<00:03:24.420> picks<00:03:24.630> because

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
one wants to give up draft picks because

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.420 
one wants to give up draft picks because
the<00:03:24.930> drafts<00:03:25.200> gonna<00:03:25.440> be<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.620> great<00:03:26.040> draft<00:03:26.280> of
