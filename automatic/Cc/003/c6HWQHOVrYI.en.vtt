is pretty thin and the characters are
very<00:02:12.760> one-dimensional<00:02:13.080> it's<00:02:14.080> not<00:02:14.410> really<00:02:14.800> the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
very one-dimensional it's not really the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.460 
very one-dimensional it's not really the
most<00:02:15.010> engaging<00:02:15.430> experience<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.810> positive

most engaging experience on the positive

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.380 
most engaging experience on the positive
side<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:17.920> great<00:02:18.099> presentation<00:02:18.760> Ubisoft

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
side is the great presentation Ubisoft

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.059

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.839 
voices so if you find the English voice
is<00:02:23.349> grating<00:02:23.590> like<00:02:23.709> we<00:02:24.040> did<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.310> can<00:02:24.459> switch<00:02:24.730> it

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
is grating like we did you can switch it

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.850 
is grating like we did you can switch it
over<00:02:24.940> at<00:02:25.150> any<00:02:25.330> time<00:02:25.599> and<00:02:25.840> listen<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.739> the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
over at any time and listen to the
