rest<00:01:00.770> away<00:01:00.980> once<00:01:01.280> I<00:01:01.489> did<00:01:01.700> I<00:01:01.730> found<00:01:02.030> that<00:01:02.329> this

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
rest away once I did I found that this

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.770 
rest away once I did I found that this
little<00:01:02.719> retaining<00:01:03.530> ring<00:01:03.980> that<00:01:04.939> was<00:01:05.149> over<00:01:05.479> this

little retaining ring that was over this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.750 
little retaining ring that was over this
you<00:01:06.320> can<00:01:06.440> see<00:01:06.620> where<00:01:06.770> they<00:01:06.950> kind<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.250> match<00:01:07.400> a

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
you can see where they kind of match a

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.240 
you can see where they kind of match a
little<00:01:08.479> circle<00:01:08.810> for<00:01:09.020> a<00:01:09.049> circle<00:01:09.380> thing<00:01:09.590> pulled

squeeze a rue with my side cuts I use

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.039 
squeeze a rue with my side cuts I use
the<00:01:16.310> side<00:01:16.549> cuts<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:17.060> trip<00:01:17.360> trim<00:01:17.840> this<00:01:17.990> little

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.560 
the side cuts to trip trim this little
piece<00:01:18.470> off<00:01:18.680> I<00:01:19.040> found<00:01:19.760> I<00:01:19.880> had<00:01:20.060> really<00:01:20.299> clean

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
piece off I found I had really clean

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.270 
piece off I found I had really clean
access<00:01:21.049> where<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:21.260> could<00:01:21.470> even<00:01:21.619> use<00:01:21.890> this<00:01:22.040> hose

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
access where I could even use this hose

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.280 
access where I could even use this hose
and<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:22.520> thought<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:22.850> know<00:01:22.970> what<00:01:23.180> rather<00:01:24.020> than

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
and I thought you know what rather than

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.430 
and I thought you know what rather than
paying<00:01:24.530> 150<00:01:25.490> bucks<00:01:25.930> might<00:01:26.930> as<00:01:27.049> well<00:01:27.200> do<00:01:27.409> a

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
paying 150 bucks might as well do a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.490 
paying 150 bucks might as well do a
little<00:01:27.530> bit<00:01:27.979> more<00:01:28.280> labor<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:30.049> way<00:01:30.229> I

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
little bit more labor and that way I

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.800 
little bit more labor and that way I
make<00:01:31.400> more<00:01:31.580> money<00:01:31.640> off<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.240> labor<00:01:32.570> I<00:01:32.689> don't

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
make more money off the labor I don't

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.380 
make more money off the labor I don't
make<00:01:32.960> much<00:01:33.170> off<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.380> parts<00:01:33.770> necessarily<00:01:34.549> but

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
make much off of parts necessarily but

to use for compress air fittings is a
thirty<00:01:52.040> one<00:01:52.310> sixty<00:01:52.850> fourths<00:01:53.439> that's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
thirty one sixty fourths that's

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.310 
thirty one sixty fourths that's
basically<00:01:55.460> just<00:01:55.729> about<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.180> big<00:01:56.390> this<00:01:57.020> drill

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
basically just about that big this drill

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.679 
basically just about that big this drill
is<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.590> half-inch<00:01:58.009> chuck<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:58.790> it's<00:01:59.030> getting

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
is a half-inch chuck so it's getting

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.039 
is a half-inch chuck so it's getting
Nayan<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.530> half-inch<00:02:01.130> but<00:02:01.729> not<00:02:01.939> quite<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.020> I

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
Nayan to half-inch but not quite so I

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.780 
Nayan to half-inch but not quite so I
drilled<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.470> out<00:02:03.829> I'll<00:02:04.070> put<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.340> fitting<00:02:04.670> in

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
drilled that out I'll put the fitting in

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.640 
drilled that out I'll put the fitting in
there<00:02:05.000> I'm<00:02:05.450> going<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.689> clean<00:02:05.900> out<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.229> rest<00:02:06.409> of

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
there I'm going to clean out the rest of

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.419 
there I'm going to clean out the rest of
this<00:02:06.799> after<00:02:07.250> crushing<00:02:07.729> it<00:02:07.909> with<00:02:08.689> a<00:02:09.099> demo<00:02:10.099> pic

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
this after crushing it with a demo pic

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.059 
this after crushing it with a demo pic
that's<00:02:10.670> been<00:02:10.910> adapted<00:02:11.500> for<00:02:12.500> such<00:02:12.770> things<00:02:12.800> and

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
that's been adapted for such things and

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.429 
that's been adapted for such things and
and<00:02:14.159> getting<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.879> hose<00:02:15.030> clamp<00:02:15.299> at<00:02:15.659> so<00:02:16.109> this<00:02:16.260> will

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
and getting a hose clamp at so this will

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.640 
and getting a hose clamp at so this will
screw<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.859> there<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.909> then<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.840> hose<00:02:19.260> will<00:02:19.499> go

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
screw in there and then the hose will go

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.119 
screw in there and then the hose will go
over<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.069> fitting<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:21.230> may<00:02:22.230> trim<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.650> back<00:02:22.680> just

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
over the fitting I may trim it back just

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.270 
over the fitting I may trim it back just
a<00:02:23.310> little<00:02:23.340> bit<00:02:23.670> but<00:02:24.499> anyway<00:02:25.499> that's<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.189> way

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
a little bit but anyway that's the way

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.339 
a little bit but anyway that's the way
that<00:02:26.430> will<00:02:26.609> work<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.359> it'll<00:02:27.719> be<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.109> new

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
that will work and it'll be like new

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.369 
that will work and it'll be like new
needs<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.159> hold<00:02:29.400> 16<00:02:29.969> psi<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.599> figure<00:02:31.230> these

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
needs to hold 16 psi I figure these

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.720 
needs to hold 16 psi I figure these
fittings<00:02:32.389> regularly<00:02:33.389> use<00:02:33.599> them<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.079> hold<00:02:34.730> 160

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
fittings regularly use them to hold 160

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.440 
fittings regularly use them to hold 160

he's<00:02:36.870> about<00:02:37.139> 130<00:02:37.650> but<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.950> can<00:02:38.159> go<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:38.430> pretty

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
he's about 130 but I can go up pretty

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.690 
he's about 130 but I can go up pretty
high<00:02:39.200> 160<00:02:40.200> easy<00:02:40.349> there<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:41.579> thought

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
high 160 easy there I just thought

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.399 
high 160 easy there I just thought
you're<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.030> with<00:02:42.299> you<00:02:42.450> add<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.750> on<00:02:42.870> take<00:02:43.139> it<00:02:43.169> on

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
you're not with you add it on take it on

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.250 
you're not with you add it on take it on
the<00:02:43.560> back<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.419> diagnostic<00:02:45.419> video<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.230> I

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
the back of that diagnostic video that I

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.099 
the back of that diagnostic video that I
did<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.969> got<00:02:47.969> this<00:02:48.120> repair<00:02:48.540> all<00:02:48.750> put<00:02:48.959> together

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
did I got this repair all put together

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.640 
did I got this repair all put together
all<00:02:49.620> ready<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:50.040> go<00:02:50.189> and<00:02:50.219> guess<00:02:50.760> what

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
all ready to go and guess what

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.509 
all ready to go and guess what
the<00:02:53.579> whole<00:02:53.790> thing<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.449> busted<00:02:55.280> fell<00:02:56.280> right

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
the whole thing just busted fell right

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.909 
the whole thing just busted fell right
apart<00:02:56.939> and<00:02:57.389> so<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:57.900> got<00:02:58.139> to<00:02:58.290> thinking<00:02:58.620> that's

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
apart and so I got to thinking that's

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.449 
apart and so I got to thinking that's
what<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.609> light<00:02:59.879> means<00:03:01.040> I'll<00:03:02.040> show<00:03:02.400> you

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
what that light means I'll show you

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.770 
what that light means I'll show you

to require a light that says dude your
car<00:03:55.550> is<00:03:55.760> screwed<00:03:58.990> all<00:03:59.990> that<00:04:00.350> okay<00:04:00.860> so<00:04:00.920> here's

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
car is screwed all that okay so here's

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.670 
car is screwed all that okay so here's
the<00:04:01.430> solution<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:02.209> came<00:04:02.480> up<00:04:02.690> with<00:04:02.720> a<00:04:02.930> lentil<00:04:03.440> O's

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
the solution I came up with a lentil O's

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.060 
the solution I came up with a lentil O's
I<00:04:04.070> got<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:04.760> piece<00:04:05.090> of<00:04:05.120> one<00:04:05.720> inch<00:04:05.750> by<00:04:06.410> six<00:04:06.800> inch

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
I got a piece of one inch by six inch

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.030 
I got a piece of one inch by six inch
galvanized<00:04:07.790> pipe<00:04:08.090> I<00:04:08.410> cut<00:04:09.410> out<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.620> section

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
galvanized pipe I cut out the section

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.770 
galvanized pipe I cut out the section
where<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:11.239> old<00:04:11.630> plastic<00:04:12.230> union<00:04:12.739> was<00:04:12.980> and

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
where the old plastic union was and

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.650 
where the old plastic union was and
basically<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:15.050> will<00:04:15.230> tie<00:04:15.470> in<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:16.669> lower

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
basically this will tie in the lower

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.970 
basically this will tie in the lower
rated<00:04:18.140> upper<00:04:18.470> radiator<00:04:18.620> hose<00:04:18.950> excuse<00:04:19.700> me

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
rated upper radiator hose excuse me

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.560 
rated upper radiator hose excuse me
instead<00:04:21.980> of<00:04:22.130> being<00:04:22.370> on<00:04:22.490> a<00:04:22.550> plastic<00:04:23.150> fitting

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
instead of being on a plastic fitting

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.840 
instead of being on a plastic fitting
it'll<00:04:24.260> go<00:04:24.350> on<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.620> this<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.100> then<00:04:25.340> I<00:04:25.370> cut<00:04:25.700> the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
it'll go on to this and then I cut the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.430 
it'll go on to this and then I cut the
other<00:04:25.880> side<00:04:26.060> of<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.450> plastic<00:04:26.810> fitting<00:04:27.080> off<00:04:27.230> so

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
other side of the plastic fitting off so

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.860 
other side of the plastic fitting off so
it's<00:04:27.560> just<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.800> radiator<00:04:28.190> hose<00:04:28.490> material<00:04:29.030> go<00:04:29.780> on

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
it's just a radiator hose material go on

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.840 
it's just a radiator hose material go on
that<00:04:30.050> in<00:04:30.260> you<00:04:30.919> can<00:04:31.010> see<00:04:31.160> what<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.340> did<00:04:31.460> is<00:04:31.760> I

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
that in you can see what I did is I

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.360 
that in you can see what I did is I
welded<00:04:32.120> around<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.840> threads<00:04:33.229> and<00:04:33.620> then<00:04:34.070> I<00:04:34.190> use

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
welded around the threads and then I use

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.250 
welded around the threads and then I use
a<00:04:34.400> grinder<00:04:35.000> to<00:04:35.030> just<00:04:35.330> round<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.750> out<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.080> rest

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
a grinder to just round it out the rest

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.760 
a grinder to just round it out the rest
of<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.530> way<00:04:36.710> but<00:04:37.520> if<00:04:37.850> you<00:04:38.210> you<00:04:39.110> probably<00:04:39.380> clamp

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
of the way but if you you probably clamp

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.500 
of the way but if you you probably clamp
on<00:04:39.979> to<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.220> threads<00:04:40.520> but<00:04:40.850> I<00:04:41.090> get<00:04:41.270> nervous

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
on to the threads but I get nervous

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.360 
on to the threads but I get nervous
about<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:42.169> about<00:04:42.410> antifreeze<00:04:42.950> seeping

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
about that about antifreeze seeping

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.070 
about that about antifreeze seeping
around<00:04:43.669> down<00:04:43.970> in<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.240> low<00:04:44.419> valleys<00:04:44.660> of<00:04:44.990> the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
around down in the low valleys of the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.380 
around down in the low valleys of the
threads<00:04:45.380> then<00:04:46.310> another<00:04:46.520> thing<00:04:46.760> I<00:04:46.850> did<00:04:47.060> I<00:04:47.090> put

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
threads then another thing I did I put

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.690 
threads then another thing I did I put
it<00:04:47.510> in<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.810> drill<00:04:48.050> press<00:04:48.229> I<00:04:48.650> drilled<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.669> hole

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
it in the drill press I drilled a hole

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.330 
it in the drill press I drilled a hole
down<00:04:50.180> through<00:04:50.479> that<00:04:50.660> thing<00:04:51.020> it<00:04:51.680> took<00:04:51.890> me<00:04:52.100> about

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
down through that thing it took me about

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.490 
down through that thing it took me about
seven<00:04:52.729> or<00:04:53.000> eight<00:04:53.060> approaches<00:04:53.720> oiling<00:04:54.200> the<00:04:54.320> bit

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
seven or eight approaches oiling the bit

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.760 
seven or eight approaches oiling the bit
in<00:04:54.710> between<00:04:55.540> but<00:04:56.540> drilled<00:04:57.110> out<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.290> big<00:04:57.530> enough

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
in between but drilled out a big enough

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.469 
in between but drilled out a big enough
hole<00:04:58.010> that<00:04:58.970> I<00:04:59.000> could<00:04:59.479> put<00:04:59.690> that<00:05:00.370> hose

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
hole that I could put that hose

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.180 
hole that I could put that hose
compression<00:05:02.479> fitting<00:05:02.930> down<00:05:03.590> in<00:05:03.830> there<00:05:04.070> and

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
compression fitting down in there and

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.920 
compression fitting down in there and
then<00:05:04.280> I<00:05:04.370> just<00:05:04.580> weld<00:05:04.820> it<00:05:05.030> around<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.450> base<00:05:05.600> and

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
then I just weld it around the base and

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.080 
then I just weld it around the base and
you<00:05:06.410> see<00:05:06.590> it's<00:05:06.710> black<00:05:07.100> instead<00:05:07.729> of<00:05:07.880> silver

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
you see it's black instead of silver

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.140 
you see it's black instead of silver
like<00:05:08.390> you'd<00:05:08.570> expect<00:05:08.690> I<00:05:09.169> used<00:05:09.669> black<00:05:10.669> ceramic

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
like you'd expect I used black ceramic

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.930 
like you'd expect I used black ceramic

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
steel instead of that plastic that

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.429 
steel instead of that plastic that
dissolves<00:06:35.060> with<00:06:35.180> antifreeze<00:06:35.539> so<00:06:36.199> that's

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:36.439 
dissolves with antifreeze so that's

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.800 
dissolves with antifreeze so that's
enough<00:06:36.770> it's<00:06:37.550> definitely<00:06:38.060> an<00:06:38.150> improvement<00:06:38.419> in
