00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
first and foremost black site is a

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.190 
first and foremost black site is a
fast-paced<00:00:13.940> first-person<00:00:14.630> shooter<00:00:14.930> so<00:00:15.110> the

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
fast-paced first-person shooter so the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.510 
fast-paced first-person shooter so the
weapons<00:00:15.530> are<00:00:15.650> totally<00:00:16.039> key<00:00:16.219> to<00:00:16.430> the

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
weapons are totally key to the

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.640 
weapons are totally key to the
experience<00:00:16.970> on<00:00:17.810> top<00:00:18.020> of<00:00:18.050> that<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:18.410> squad

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
experience on top of that the squad

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.710 
experience on top of that the squad
functions<00:00:19.130> as<00:00:19.279> another<00:00:19.550> weapon<00:00:19.760> I<00:00:20.120> think

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
functions as another weapon I think

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.260 
functions as another weapon I think
really<00:00:20.870> the<00:00:21.590> weapons<00:00:21.890> in<00:00:22.010> black<00:00:22.220> site<00:00:22.520> have

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
really the weapons in black site have

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.270 
really the weapons in black site have
enough<00:00:23.480> attention<00:00:23.720> to<00:00:23.930> detail<00:00:24.410> it's<00:00:24.890> little

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.280 
enough attention to detail it's little

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.620

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.250 
you can cook off grenades I love our
sniper<00:00:44.120> rifle<00:00:44.510> when<00:00:44.600> people<00:00:44.809> have<00:00:44.899> time<00:00:45.079> to

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
sniper rifle when people have time to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.560 
sniper rifle when people have time to
tweak<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.739> edges<00:00:46.250> of<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.430> sniper<00:00:46.910> scope<00:00:47.329> so

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
tweak the edges of the sniper scope so

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.780 
tweak the edges of the sniper scope so
that<00:00:47.720> it<00:00:47.809> warps<00:00:48.230> like<00:00:48.559> glass<00:00:48.890> or<00:00:49.190> make<00:00:49.640> the

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
that it warps like glass or make the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.370 
that it warps like glass or make the
crosshair<00:00:50.239> in<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:50.420> center<00:00:50.660> a<00:00:50.690> little<00:00:51.020> finer

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
crosshair in the center a little finer

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.170 
crosshair in the center a little finer
just<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.010> feels<00:00:52.280> like<00:00:52.579> looking<00:00:52.969> through<00:00:53.000> a

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
just so it feels like looking through a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.569 
just so it feels like looking through a
real<00:00:53.420> scope<00:00:53.899> one<00:00:54.890> of<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.040> things<00:00:55.219> we<00:00:55.340> wanted

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
real scope one of the things we wanted

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.610 
real scope one of the things we wanted
to<00:00:55.670> do<00:00:55.850> for<00:00:55.879> black<00:00:56.239> site<00:00:56.540> is<00:00:56.780> include<00:00:57.410> some

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
to do for black site is include some

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.470 
to do for black site is include some
authentic<00:00:58.070> Special<00:00:58.520> Forces<00:00:58.790> weapons<00:00:59.030> but

like what if certain scientific

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.469 
like what if certain scientific
conglomerate<00:01:03.620> organizations<00:01:04.430> had<00:01:04.670> access<00:01:05.239> to
