you<00:02:13.490> can<00:02:13.670> loosen<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.420> pivot<00:02:14.720> if<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.989> want<00:02:15.200> to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
you can loosen the pivot if you want to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.900 
you can loosen the pivot if you want to
take<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.410> apart<00:02:15.770> just<00:02:16.550> some<00:02:16.700> standard<00:02:18.910> x.x

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910

take it apart just some standard x.x
keys<00:02:20.330> or<00:02:20.750> torps<00:02:21.220> torques<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.280> bit<00:02:22.430> yeah<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:22.940> think

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
keys or torps torques a bit yeah I think

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.570 
keys or torps torques a bit yeah I think
it's<00:02:23.330> pretty<00:02:23.480> much<00:02:23.739> would<00:02:24.739> be<00:02:24.770> Torx<00:02:25.190> bit<00:02:25.280> for

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
it's pretty much would be Torx bit for

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.580 
it's pretty much would be Torx bit for
that<00:02:25.700> but<00:02:26.330> this<00:02:26.510> is<00:02:26.720> when<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.170> do<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.319> knife

really really sharp edges especially

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.400 
really really sharp edges especially
around<00:04:09.980> here<00:04:10.430> around<00:04:10.609> the<00:04:10.790> lock<00:04:10.970> all<00:04:11.750> those

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
around here around the lock all those

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.319 
around here around the lock all those
corners<00:04:12.920> here<00:04:13.190> I'm<00:04:13.340> going<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.579> use<00:04:13.700> my<00:04:13.730> dremel

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
corners here I'm going to use my dremel

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.779 
corners here I'm going to use my dremel
I'm<00:04:14.480> gonna<00:04:14.720> modify<00:04:15.019> this<00:04:15.200> all<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.370> little

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
I'm gonna modify this all that little

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.820 
I'm gonna modify this all that little
corner<00:04:17.090> this<00:04:17.359> is<00:04:17.570> so<00:04:17.870> sharp<00:04:18.200> that<00:04:18.320> you<00:04:18.560> could

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
corner this is so sharp that you could

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.589 
corner this is so sharp that you could
probably<00:04:19.250> cut<00:04:19.489> yourself<00:04:19.909> depending<00:04:20.479> if

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
probably cut yourself depending if

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.450 
probably cut yourself depending if
you're<00:04:20.870> doing<00:04:21.229> a<00:04:21.380> hard<00:04:21.680> use<00:04:21.859> of<00:04:22.039> the<00:04:22.159> knife

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
you're doing a hard use of the knife

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.760 
you're doing a hard use of the knife
and<00:04:22.910> I'm<00:04:23.270> gonna<00:04:23.539> probably<00:04:23.840> gonna<00:04:24.259> do<00:04:24.470> it<00:04:24.590> all

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
and I'm gonna probably gonna do it all

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.439 
and I'm gonna probably gonna do it all
around<00:04:25.069> here<00:04:25.460> it's<00:04:25.610> not<00:04:25.789> so<00:04:26.000> bad<00:04:26.180> you<00:04:26.330> know

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
around here it's not so bad you know

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.559 
around here it's not so bad you know
it's<00:04:26.600> not<00:04:26.720> that<00:04:26.960> sharp<00:04:27.259> on<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.069> inside<00:04:28.520> not<00:04:29.330> so

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 
it's not that sharp on the inside not so

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.050 
it's not that sharp on the inside not so
bad<00:04:29.600> either<00:04:29.960> but<00:04:30.139> you<00:04:30.590> know<00:04:31.009> just<00:04:31.310> for<00:04:31.940> the

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
bad either but you know just for the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.879 
bad either but you know just for the
sake<00:04:32.300> of<00:04:32.330> making<00:04:32.630> it<00:04:32.930> just<00:04:33.080> a<00:04:33.590> little<00:04:33.620> bit

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
sake of making it just a little bit

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.680 
sake of making it just a little bit
smoother<00:04:34.280> I'm<00:04:34.430> going<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.669> pass<00:04:34.819> a<00:04:34.849> dremel<00:04:35.449> and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
smoother I'm going to pass a dremel and

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.740 
smoother I'm going to pass a dremel and
just<00:04:36.560> gonna<00:04:36.680> make<00:04:37.039> the<00:04:37.340> entire<00:04:38.030> edge<00:04:38.300> yet

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
just gonna make the entire edge yet

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.730 
just gonna make the entire edge yet
entire<00:04:39.470> face<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.639> these<00:04:40.960> little<00:04:41.960> edges<00:04:42.560> that

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
entire face of these little edges that

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.140 
entire face of these little edges that
are<00:04:42.800> sharp<00:04:43.430> I'm<00:04:43.699> going<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:43.940> make<00:04:44.060> them

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
are sharp I'm going to make them

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.020 
are sharp I'm going to make them
smoother<00:04:44.750> but<00:04:45.560> anyway<00:04:46.130> for<00:04:46.340> twelve<00:04:46.610> dollars

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
smoother but anyway for twelve dollars

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.730 
smoother but anyway for twelve dollars
you<00:04:47.449> know<00:04:47.539> you<00:04:47.599> can't<00:04:47.960> go<00:04:48.139> wrong<00:04:48.169> with<00:04:48.620> this

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
you know you can't go wrong with this

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.059 
you know you can't go wrong with this
this<00:04:49.009> is<00:04:49.190> a<00:04:49.220> great<00:04:49.669> knife<00:04:50.000> for<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.300> money<00:04:50.509> and

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069 
this is a great knife for the money and

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.189 
this is a great knife for the money and
you<00:04:52.069> know<00:04:52.610> you're<00:04:53.360> getting<00:04:53.569> something<00:04:53.960> that

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
you know you're getting something that

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.830 
you know you're getting something that
resembles<00:04:55.070> it's<00:04:55.460> not<00:04:55.669> exactly<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.389> same<00:04:56.630> as<00:04:56.810> a

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
resembles it's not exactly the same as a

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.339 
resembles it's not exactly the same as a
ZT<00:04:57.380> but<00:04:58.160> it<00:04:58.310> resembles<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.030> shape<00:04:59.060> and<00:04:59.630> since

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
ZT but it resembles the shape and since

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.370 
ZT but it resembles the shape and since
I<00:05:00.560> like<00:05:00.620> that<00:05:01.070> shape<00:05:01.400> you<00:05:02.210> know<00:05:02.360> I<00:05:02.690> want<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.199> see

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
I like that shape you know I want to see

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.800 
I like that shape you know I want to see
first<00:05:03.710> if<00:05:03.919> I<00:05:04.039> would<00:05:04.220> like<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.580> shape<00:05:05.300> of<00:05:05.509> the<00:05:05.539> Z

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
first if I would like the shape of the Z

tease and the flipper and a guard that

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.409 
tease and the flipper and a guard that
it<00:05:08.810> creates<00:05:09.229> and<00:05:09.530> in<00:05:10.340> hand<00:05:10.639> it<00:05:10.820> feels<00:05:10.849> really

it creates and in hand it feels really

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.930 
it creates and in hand it feels really
really<00:05:11.750> good<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:12.680> only<00:05:12.889> thing<00:05:13.070> I've<00:05:13.250> would

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
really good the only thing I've would

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.170 
really good the only thing I've would
want<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.509> see<00:05:14.810> is<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.380> water<00:05:15.919> type<00:05:16.460> of<00:05:16.729> deep

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
want to see is the water type of deep

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.969 
want to see is the water type of deep
carry<00:05:17.449> pocket<00:05:17.870> clip<00:05:18.050> right<00:05:18.530> here<00:05:18.590> you<00:05:18.830> could

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
carry pocket clip right here you could

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.710 
carry pocket clip right here you could
always<00:05:19.159> modify<00:05:19.550> that<00:05:19.909> and<00:05:20.210> flip<00:05:20.389> it<00:05:20.509> around

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
always modify that and flip it around

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.140 
always modify that and flip it around
and<00:05:21.199> just<00:05:21.860> modify<00:05:22.340> it<00:05:22.400> but<00:05:22.699> I<00:05:22.729> think<00:05:22.849> the<00:05:23.120> idea

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
and just modify it but I think the idea

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.310 
and just modify it but I think the idea
pocket<00:05:23.659> clip<00:05:23.990> are<00:05:24.289> acts<00:05:24.590> as<00:05:24.979> a<00:05:25.009> as<00:05:25.570> a<00:05:26.570> stop<00:05:27.050> for

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
pocket clip are acts as a as a stop for

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.490 
pocket clip are acts as a as a stop for
the<00:05:27.470> for<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.280> backlog<00:05:28.820> but<00:05:29.060> I'm<00:05:29.210> not<00:05:29.389> sure<00:05:29.500> if

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
the for the backlog but I'm not sure if

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.790 
the for the backlog but I'm not sure if
it's<00:05:30.940> even<00:05:31.940> touching<00:05:32.539> now<00:05:32.810> it's<00:05:33.199> not<00:05:33.380> touching

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
it's even touching now it's not touching

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.850 
it's even touching now it's not touching
so<00:05:34.009> it<00:05:34.729> doesn't<00:05:35.150> care<00:05:35.360> too<00:05:35.539> much<00:05:35.590> so<00:05:36.590> you<00:05:36.650> could

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
so it doesn't care too much so you could

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.620 
so it doesn't care too much so you could
always<00:05:37.009> modify<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:37.580> pocket<00:05:37.940> clip<00:05:38.150> to<00:05:38.330> make<00:05:38.479> it

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
always modify the pocket clip to make it

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.870 
always modify the pocket clip to make it
more<00:05:38.810> deep<00:05:39.080> care<00:05:39.409> if<00:05:39.620> you<00:05:39.800> want<00:05:40.070> just<00:05:40.280> loop<00:05:40.580> dad

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
more deep care if you want just loop dad

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.180 
more deep care if you want just loop dad
bend<00:05:41.330> that<00:05:41.539> and<00:05:41.870> try<00:05:42.530> to<00:05:42.590> make<00:05:42.740> it<00:05:42.800> more<00:05:43.039> d

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
bend that and try to make it more d

bend that and try to make it more d
carried<00:05:43.639> pocket<00:05:44.000> clip<00:05:44.180> itself<00:05:44.889> so<00:05:45.889> bad<00:05:46.190> but

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
carried pocket clip itself so bad but

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.670 
carried pocket clip itself so bad but
you<00:05:47.180> know<00:05:47.300> they<00:05:47.449> could<00:05:47.599> be<00:05:47.780> improved<00:05:48.080> a<00:05:48.440> little

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
you know they could be improved a little

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.950 
you know they could be improved a little
bit<00:05:48.919> and<00:05:49.099> there's<00:05:49.820> no<00:05:49.909> forward<00:05:50.419> positioning

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
bit and there's no forward positioning

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.589 
bit and there's no forward positioning
on<00:05:51.080> that<00:05:51.110> one<00:05:51.530> so<00:05:51.830> that<00:05:52.699> would<00:05:52.820> be<00:05:52.909> enough<00:05:53.090> that

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
on that one so that would be enough that

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:54.879 
on that one so that would be enough that
would<00:05:53.690> have<00:05:53.780> been<00:05:53.810> fun<00:05:54.139> to<00:05:54.169> to<00:05:54.469> see<00:05:54.650> for

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
would have been fun to to see for

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.249 
would have been fun to to see for
