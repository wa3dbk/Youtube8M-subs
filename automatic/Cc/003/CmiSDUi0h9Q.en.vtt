00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
got to mature very quickly and if we do

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.660 
got to mature very quickly and if we do
those<00:00:54.420> things<00:00:54.749> and<00:00:55.019> we<00:00:55.679> come<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.249> come<00:00:56.429> along

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670

day<00:00:56.940> by<00:00:57.120> day<00:00:57.149> by<00:00:57.539> day<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:57.960> then<00:00:58.230> we're<00:00:58.379> going

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
day by day by day then then we're going

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.549 
day by day by day then then we're going
to<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.620> fun<00:00:58.819> I<00:00:59.819> think<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.629> gotta<00:01:00.809> start<00:01:01.319> picking

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to be fun I think we gotta start picking

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.939 
to be fun I think we gotta start picking
up<00:01:02.629> start<00:01:03.629> working<00:01:03.870> hard<00:01:04.110> we've<00:01:04.650> worked<00:01:04.680> hard

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
up start working hard we've worked hard

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.280 
up start working hard we've worked hard
all<00:01:05.309> summer<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:06.330> if<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.140> keep

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
all summer and I think if we keep

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.719 
all summer and I think if we keep
working<00:01:07.440> hard<00:01:07.800> we<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.040> probably<00:01:08.370> get<00:01:08.460> back<00:01:08.640> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
working hard we can probably get back to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.630 
working hard we can probably get back to
the<00:01:08.850> state<00:01:09.060> championship<00:01:11.660> this<00:01:12.660> year<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:13.110> have

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
the state championship this year we have

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.570 
the state championship this year we have
the<00:01:14.640> Brett<00:01:15.060> at<00:01:15.330> linebacker<00:01:16.070> maybe<00:01:17.070> nose<00:01:17.310> guard

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the Brett at linebacker maybe nose guard

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.510 
the Brett at linebacker maybe nose guard
but<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:17.970> Abby's<00:01:18.930> going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.230> be<00:01:19.440> our<00:01:19.590> running

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
but and Abby's going to be our running

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.130 
but and Abby's going to be our running
back<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.000> think<00:01:21.210> every<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:22.050> we're

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
back but I think every this we're

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
back but I think every this we're
going<00:01:22.260> to<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.410> as<00:01:22.560> good<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.800> last<00:01:23.100> year<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
going to be as good as last year and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.520 
going to be as good as last year and
even<00:01:24.090> better<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.570> everybody<00:01:24.990> works<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.410> hard

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
even better if everybody works as hard

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.110 
even better if everybody works as hard
as<00:01:25.680> they<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:26.780> our<00:01:27.780> offense<00:01:28.140> uh<00:01:29.000> we're<00:01:30.000> going

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
as they can our offense uh we're going

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.030 
as they can our offense uh we're going
to<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.660> lot<00:01:31.050> better<00:01:31.200> than<00:01:31.470> last<00:01:31.500> year<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
to be a lot better than last year I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.150 
to be a lot better than last year I
believe<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.730> think<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.480> we're<00:01:34.260> we're<00:01:34.830> working
