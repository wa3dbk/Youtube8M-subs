00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
okay so this is the review of the

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.329 
okay so this is the review of the
syncope<00:00:02.790> cm1<00:00:03.330> it's<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.840> MIDI<00:00:04.110> controller<00:00:04.339> PC

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
syncope cm1 it's a MIDI controller PC

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.220 
syncope cm1 it's a MIDI controller PC
and<00:00:05.940> it<00:00:06.029> comes<00:00:06.270> with<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.480> decorative<00:00:06.720> software

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
and it comes with a decorative software

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.749 
and it comes with a decorative software
there<00:00:10.230> are<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> few<00:00:10.590> drawbacks<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:11.490> I

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
there are a few drawbacks to this I

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.330 
there are a few drawbacks to this I
really<00:00:12.389> thought<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.840> through

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
really thought this through

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.250 
really thought this through
main<00:00:14.340> drop<00:00:14.580> back<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.030> would<00:00:15.330> say<00:00:15.360> these<00:00:16.020> aren't

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
main drop back I would say these aren't

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.920 
main drop back I would say these aren't
the<00:00:16.440> lovely<00:00:16.830> fats<00:00:17.460> biomass<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.539> they're<00:00:18.750> so

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
the lovely fats biomass but they're so

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.620 
the lovely fats biomass but they're so
close<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.410> each<00:00:19.470> other<00:00:19.740> you'll<00:00:20.340> often<00:00:20.640> hits

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
close to each other you'll often hits

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.929 
close to each other you'll often hits
one<00:00:21.960> another<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.500> turn<00:00:22.740> two<00:00:23.400> instead<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.910> one

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
one another and turn two instead of one

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.599 
one another and turn two instead of one
it's<00:00:26.939> compacting<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.990> maybe<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.949> would<00:00:29.250> have

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
it's compacting so maybe I would have

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.749 
it's compacting so maybe I would have
chosen<00:00:29.880> another<00:00:30.060> type<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> knot<00:00:31.019> there<00:00:31.759> other

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
chosen another type of knot there other

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.720 
chosen another type of knot there other
than<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.450> don't<00:00:34.230> think<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:34.770> some

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
than that I don't think there are some

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.880 
than that I don't think there are some
funny<00:00:36.210> there<00:00:36.540> are<00:00:36.630> major<00:00:36.840> drawbacks<00:00:37.530> down

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
funny there are major drawbacks down

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.819 
funny there are major drawbacks down
there<00:00:38.879> are<00:00:38.940> some<00:00:39.090> mistakes<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.500> only

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
there are some mistakes but the only

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.520 
there are some mistakes but the only
thing<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.520> drivers<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.360> support<00:00:43.200> from

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
thing is the drivers and support from

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.400 
thing is the drivers and support from
from<00:00:44.219> software<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.149> updated<00:00:45.660> MIDI

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
from software can all be updated MIDI

for<00:00:57.629> free<00:00:57.690> I<00:01:01.010> think<00:01:02.010> you'd<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.730> very<00:01:03.000> creative

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
for free I think you'd be very creative

for free I think you'd be very creative
for<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.989> both<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:05.250> new<00:01:05.869> digital<00:01:06.869> way<00:01:07.290> with

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
for this both the new digital way with

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.830 
for this both the new digital way with
which<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.430> sync<00:01:08.760> them<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.299> use<00:01:09.630> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
which you can sync them or you can use a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.000 
which you can sync them or you can use a
pitch<00:01:10.140> control<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:10.619> both<00:01:10.860> work<00:01:11.100> fine<00:01:11.610> and

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
pitch control they both work fine and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.320 
pitch control they both work fine and
never<00:01:14.010> got<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.369> effects<00:01:14.640> they<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.060> sample

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
never got the effects they can sample

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.469 
never got the effects they can sample
they<00:01:15.689> got<00:01:16.460> extensive<00:01:17.460> loop<00:01:17.670> options<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.360> will

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
they got extensive loop options and will

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.450 
they got extensive loop options and will
leap<00:01:18.689> showed<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.680> I'm<00:01:19.950> sure<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> most

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
leap showed you that I'm sure the most

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.179 
leap showed you that I'm sure the most
features<00:01:20.880> there<00:01:21.570> are<00:01:21.689> more<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.650> try

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
features there are more but you can try

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.920 
features there are more but you can try
to<00:01:23.220> match<00:01:23.400> yourself<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.909> beccarose<00:01:24.240> better<00:01:24.600> or

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
to match yourself in beccarose better or

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.539 
to match yourself in beccarose better or
you<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.229> take<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> look<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> manual<00:01:26.130> how

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you can take a look at the manual how

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.219 
you can take a look at the manual how
things<00:01:26.909> work<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.420> stuff<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:30.869> are<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
things work and stuff so there are a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.999 
things work and stuff so there are a
little<00:01:32.159> things<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> say<00:01:32.880> about<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.770> it<00:01:34.770> works

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
little things to say about this it works

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:35.510 
little things to say about this it works
really<00:01:35.220> well

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
really well

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.200 
really well
I<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.240> mixer<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:38.060> there<00:01:39.060> are

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
I can I can mixer with this there are

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.690 
I can I can mixer with this there are
several<00:01:39.600> Ino<00:01:40.320> learning<00:01:40.740> curve<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> think

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
several Ino learning curve so I think

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.149 
several Ino learning curve so I think
that's<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.090> good<00:01:42.240> thing

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
that's a good thing

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.039 
that's a good thing
so<00:01:44.159> about<00:01:44.490> they<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.850> either<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.299> suffer<00:01:45.780> my

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
so about they can either like suffer my

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.580 
so about they can either like suffer my
absolute<00:01:46.979> favorites<00:01:47.399> still<00:01:47.729> Virtual<00:01:48.149> DJ<00:01:48.590> but

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
absolute favorites still Virtual DJ but

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.690 
absolute favorites still Virtual DJ but
I<00:01:49.979> think<00:01:50.490> there's<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.790> very<00:01:51.000> nice<00:01:51.210> alternative

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
I think there's a very nice alternative

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.100 
I think there's a very nice alternative
it's<00:01:53.700> got<00:01:53.909> most<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.329> features<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.840> want

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it's got most of features I want

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.670 
it's got most of features I want
especially<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.340> new<00:01:56.490> version<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.409> keep

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
especially the new version and it's keep

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.340 
especially the new version and it's keep
getting<00:01:58.979> updated<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.930> definitely<00:02:01.049> see

years<00:02:16.769> but<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.250> looked<00:02:17.909> it<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.360> Google<00:02:18.629> and

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
years but I looked it up on Google and

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.559 
years but I looked it up on Google and
you<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.290> find<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.650> for<00:02:19.769> 300<00:02:20.370> euros<00:02:20.549> so<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
you can find it for 300 euros so the

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.929 
you can find it for 300 euros so the
thing<00:02:21.810> that's<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.560> lower<00:02:22.980> middle<00:02:23.549> segment

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
thing that's in the lower middle segment

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.740 
thing that's in the lower middle segment
so<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:25.010> think<00:02:26.010> for<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:26.549> quality<00:02:26.790> yes<00:02:27.359> it<00:02:27.599> might

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
so I think for this quality yes it might

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.610 
so I think for this quality yes it might
be<00:02:27.930> compact<00:02:28.439> or<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:29.280> might<00:02:29.459> be<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:30.319> rather<00:02:31.319> odd

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
be compact or it might be a rather odd

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.220 
be compact or it might be a rather odd
shape<00:02:32.069> you're<00:02:32.609> the<00:02:32.790> MIDI<00:02:32.970> controls<00:02:33.420> are<00:02:33.780> more

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
shape you're the MIDI controls are more

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.789 
shape you're the MIDI controls are more
of<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.799> shape<00:02:35.129> here<00:02:36.530> but<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:39.680> don't<00:02:40.680> think

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
of this shape here but I don't think

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.979 
of this shape here but I don't think
little<00:02:41.280> digits<00:02:41.640> who<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> rack<00:02:42.480> full<00:02:42.780> like

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
little digits who have a rack full like

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.479 
little digits who have a rack full like
that<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.739> easily<00:02:44.040> implement<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:46.489> and

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
that you can easily implement this and

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.660 
that you can easily implement this and
all<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> options<00:02:48.120> were<00:02:48.269> great<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.370> it's<00:02:50.370> been

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
all the options were great so it's been

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.849 
all the options were great so it's been
fun<00:02:50.879> reviewing<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:51.780> needed<00:02:52.379> some<00:02:52.560> extra

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
fun reviewing this and needed some extra

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.179 
fun reviewing this and needed some extra
time<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:53.519> I'm<00:02:54.409> busy<00:02:55.409> of<00:02:55.650> course<00:02:55.920> the

time that I'm busy of course the

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.929 
time that I'm busy of course the
University<00:02:56.730> City<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.769> think<00:02:59.519> that's<00:02:59.730> where

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
University City and I think that's where
