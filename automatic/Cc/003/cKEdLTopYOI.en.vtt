and then once that's done we're ready
for<00:05:30.260> the<00:05:30.410> dehydrator<00:05:31.270> now<00:05:32.270> as<00:05:32.449> I<00:05:32.510> mentioned

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
for the dehydrator now as I mentioned

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.600 
for the dehydrator now as I mentioned
before<00:05:32.810> we're<00:05:33.229> gonna<00:05:33.320> be<00:05:33.500> using<00:05:33.650> our<00:05:33.919> Wes<00:05:34.400> the

this you can see it's pretty small and

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.350 
this you can see it's pretty small and
compact<00:05:42.470> so<00:05:42.889> compared<00:05:43.639> to<00:05:43.729> using<00:05:43.880> a<00:05:44.090> smoker

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
compact so compared to using a smoker

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.240 
compact so compared to using a smoker
you<00:05:45.169> know<00:05:45.199> it's<00:05:45.530> just<00:05:45.650> it's<00:05:45.919> a<00:05:45.979> lot<00:05:46.099> more

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
you know it's just it's a lot more

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.920 
you know it's just it's a lot more
portable<00:05:46.669> a<00:05:46.699> lot<00:05:46.820> more<00:05:46.970> convenient<00:05:47.360> you<00:05:47.750> know

the<00:05:48.110> other<00:05:48.229> big<00:05:48.410> difference<00:05:48.560> between<00:05:48.889> using<00:05:49.639> a

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
the other big difference between using a

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.300 
the other big difference between using a
dehydrator<00:05:49.910> and<00:05:50.570> a<00:05:50.630> smoker<00:05:51.139> is<00:05:51.320> when<00:05:52.190> you're

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
dehydrator and a smoker is when you're

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.740 
dehydrator and a smoker is when you're
using<00:05:52.460> a<00:05:52.639> dehydrator<00:05:52.789> you're<00:05:53.389> gonna<00:05:53.479> be<00:05:53.660> able

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
using a dehydrator you're gonna be able

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.270 
using a dehydrator you're gonna be able
to<00:05:53.870> remove<00:05:54.080> a<00:05:54.229> lot<00:05:54.380> more<00:05:54.560> than<00:05:54.710> moisture<00:05:55.099> from

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
to remove a lot more than moisture from

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.920 
to remove a lot more than moisture from
the<00:05:55.400> meat<00:05:55.550> then<00:05:55.880> you<00:05:56.030> would<00:05:56.240> when<00:05:56.810> you're

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
the meat then you would when you're

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.379 
the meat then you would when you're
using<00:05:57.139> a<00:05:57.289> smoker<00:05:57.560> and<00:05:57.919> so<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:58.880> jerky<00:05:59.180> is<00:05:59.240> gonna

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
using a smoker and so the jerky is gonna

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:00.969 
using a smoker and so the jerky is gonna
last<00:05:59.630> a<00:05:59.750> lot<00:05:59.840> longer<00:05:59.900> you<00:06:00.199> will<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:00.470> store<00:06:00.710> for

last a lot longer you will the store for

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:01.400 
last a lot longer you will the store for
you

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
you

you
the<00:06:01.710> time<00:06:01.920> as<00:06:02.130> opposed<00:06:02.400> to<00:06:02.520> you<00:06:02.910> know<00:06:02.970> weeks<00:06:03.210> at

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
the time as opposed to you know weeks at

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.150 
the time as opposed to you know weeks at
a<00:06:03.450> time<00:06:03.480> when<00:06:04.080> are<00:06:04.140> you<00:06:04.230> using<00:06:04.380> a<00:06:04.560> smoker<00:06:04.800> so

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
a time when are you using a smoker so

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.950 
a time when are you using a smoker so
you<00:06:06.120> know<00:06:06.210> the<00:06:06.330> other<00:06:06.360> great<00:06:06.660> thing<00:06:06.870> about

you know the other great thing about

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.350 
you know the other great thing about
this<00:06:07.230> dehydrator<00:06:07.560> is<00:06:08.130> it<00:06:08.790> was<00:06:09.030> that<00:06:09.240> we

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
this dehydrator is it was that we

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.450 
this dehydrator is it was that we
designed<00:06:09.720> it<00:06:09.840> specifically<00:06:10.350> for<00:06:10.470> jerky<00:06:11.040> so

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
designed it specifically for jerky so

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.750 
designed it specifically for jerky so
it's<00:06:11.490> extremely<00:06:12.500> simple<00:06:13.500> and<00:06:13.950> foolproof<00:06:14.220> to

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
it's extremely simple and foolproof to

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.100 
it's extremely simple and foolproof to
use<00:06:14.970> you<00:06:15.540> basically<00:06:16.500> there's<00:06:17.130> one<00:06:17.520> button<00:06:17.910> and

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
use you basically there's one button and

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.110 
use you basically there's one button and
that's<00:06:19.110> to<00:06:19.260> turn<00:06:19.440> it<00:06:19.560> on<00:06:19.680> and<00:06:19.980> you<00:06:20.700> basically

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
that's to turn it on and you basically

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.960 
that's to turn it on and you basically
turn<00:06:22.050> it<00:06:22.200> on<00:06:22.320> and<00:06:22.650> you<00:06:23.130> can<00:06:23.280> forget<00:06:23.550> about<00:06:23.610> it

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
turn it on and you can forget about it

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.810 
turn it on and you can forget about it
so<00:06:24.590> we're<00:06:25.590> gonna<00:06:25.680> do<00:06:25.890> is<00:06:26.190> it<00:06:26.430> comes<00:06:26.610> like<00:06:26.730> I

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
so we're gonna do is it comes like I

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.160 
so we're gonna do is it comes like I
said<00:06:27.000> it<00:06:27.090> comes<00:06:27.270> with<00:06:27.360> four<00:06:27.600> trays<00:06:27.900> and

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
said it comes with four trays and

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.570 
said it comes with four trays and
they're<00:06:28.800> stackable<00:06:29.340> so<00:06:30.150> we're<00:06:30.690> gonna<00:06:30.780> take

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
they're stackable so we're gonna take

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.830 
they're stackable so we're gonna take
take<00:06:32.580> them<00:06:32.730> all<00:06:32.850> off<00:06:33.060> with<00:06:33.240> the<00:06:33.330> bottom<00:06:33.630> one

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840

and<00:06:34.110> we're<00:06:34.950> gonna<00:06:35.040> lay<00:06:35.280> this<00:06:35.670> out<00:06:35.970> spread<00:06:36.810> this

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
and we're gonna lay this out spread this

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.650 
and we're gonna lay this out spread this
out<00:06:37.080> on<00:06:37.260> the<00:06:37.350> bottom<00:06:37.530> tray<00:06:37.950> first<00:06:38.420> and<00:06:39.420> then

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
out on the bottom tray first and then

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.300 
out on the bottom tray first and then
once<00:06:39.900> that's<00:06:40.140> filled<00:06:40.470> up<00:06:40.850> we'll<00:06:41.850> take<00:06:43.310> the

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
once that's filled up we'll take the

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.340 
once that's filled up we'll take the
next<00:06:44.460> tray<00:06:47.420> fill<00:06:48.420> it<00:06:48.570> up<00:06:48.660> and<00:06:48.930> as<00:06:49.050> you<00:06:49.140> can<00:06:49.290> see

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
next tray fill it up and as you can see

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.920 
next tray fill it up and as you can see
we're<00:06:50.340> only<00:06:50.550> going<00:06:50.940> to<00:06:51.060> be<00:06:51.300> able<00:06:51.390> to<00:06:51.540> fill<00:06:51.780> up

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
we're only going to be able to fill up

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.970 
we're only going to be able to fill up
two<00:06:52.140> trays<00:06:52.440> of<00:06:52.620> the<00:06:52.770> hydrator<00:06:53.250> so<00:06:54.830> the<00:06:55.830> other

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
two trays of the hydrator so the other

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.580 
two trays of the hydrator so the other
great<00:06:56.190> thing<00:06:56.400> about<00:06:56.430> this<00:06:56.820> is<00:06:57.420> if<00:06:57.750> you're<00:06:58.410> not

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
great thing about this is if you're not

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.680 
great thing about this is if you're not
using<00:06:58.800> all<00:06:59.010> the<00:06:59.070> trays<00:06:59.430> you<00:07:00.300> don't<00:07:00.450> need<00:07:00.570> to

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
using all the trays you don't need to

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.270 
using all the trays you don't need to
use<00:07:00.810> them<00:07:00.930> all<00:07:01.080> you<00:07:01.410> just<00:07:01.740> put<00:07:01.860> the<00:07:01.950> lid<00:07:02.130> on<00:07:02.250> the

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
use them all you just put the lid on the

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.540 
use them all you just put the lid on the
first<00:07:02.610> two<00:07:03.770> and<00:07:04.770> when<00:07:04.980> you're<00:07:05.130> doing<00:07:05.400> a

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
first two and when you're doing a

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.180 
first two and when you're doing a
smaller<00:07:05.850> batch<00:07:06.120> like<00:07:06.480> this<00:07:06.720> it<00:07:06.990> has<00:07:07.530> you<00:07:08.160> know

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
smaller batch like this it has you know

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.580 
smaller batch like this it has you know
there's<00:07:08.430> less<00:07:08.610> space<00:07:08.970> for<00:07:09.300> you<00:07:10.080> know<00:07:10.170> to<00:07:10.410> heat

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
there's less space for you know to heat
