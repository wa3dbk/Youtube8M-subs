this<00:00:05.819> clip<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.120> about<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.420> cardiovascular

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
this clip is about the cardiovascular

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.900 
this clip is about the cardiovascular
and<00:00:07.379> respiratory<00:00:07.470> system<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.490> how<00:00:08.760> it

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
and respiratory system and how it

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.919 
and respiratory system and how it
responds<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.540> exercise<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.679> training<00:00:14.929> when

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
responds to exercise and training when

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.810 
responds to exercise and training when
we<00:00:16.049> start<00:00:16.350> running<00:00:16.650> around<00:00:16.770> our<00:00:17.279> heart<00:00:17.640> rate

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
we start running around our heart rate

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.179 
we start running around our heart rate
increases<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.350> because<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.920> fact

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
increases this is because of the fact

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.980 
increases this is because of the fact
that<00:00:20.340> our<00:00:20.550> muscles<00:00:20.820> plays<00:00:21.390> an<00:00:21.539> increased

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
that our muscles plays an increased

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.900 
that our muscles plays an increased

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.950 
demand for oxygen in order to create
energy<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.560> done<00:00:25.740> by<00:00:25.920> chemoreceptors

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
energy this is done by chemoreceptors

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.150 
energy this is done by chemoreceptors
detecting<00:00:27.960> an<00:00:28.140> increase<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.769> carbon<00:00:29.130> dioxide

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
detecting an increase in carbon dioxide
