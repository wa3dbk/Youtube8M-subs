00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.570
 because it 's a dessert and the truth is that 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.970
 when I saw it in interest that is from there 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.919
 where I grabbed the idea I loved it makes 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.630
 months that I saw it and was with the 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.460
 temptation to do it and record it for 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.070
 you but I had not had the time 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.450

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.040

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.870

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.610
 in practice if they put it into practice 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.860

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.970

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.990

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.780
 so much that they are here with me 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.820
 true thank you very much so good 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.090
 I hope to see you in a next video 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.950
 I send many kisses many blessings 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.390
 bye 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.720
 first of all let's see who 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.540
 we need the ingredients are a 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.250
 small box to make brownies 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.250
 ingredients that is indicated 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.780
 we are also going to occupy strawberries 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.969
 bananas chocolate chip abstract 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.969
 vanilla 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.689
 cream cheese 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:00.780
 to sugar glass and finally a mold 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.740
 round can be like this for cake 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.500
 or it can be like this one that is for pizza 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.770
 I'm going to use the one that is for cake 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.500
 because it is deeper 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.470
 but if you like it and if you find a mold 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.170
 for pizza that is deep then 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.570
 forward, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.100
 follow the instructions of our 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.100
 mix box 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.390
 I only use half of the mixture and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.190
 half of the ingredients by the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.770
 size of my mold container 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.330
 what I did now was 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:46.620
 add oil and flour to my mold to 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.620
 that the mixture does not stick 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.750
 As you can see, it does not fill up 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.110
 the mold but do not worry it's super 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.600
 all right 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.720
 because the mold is for a cake the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.000
 cake is obviously more with chito 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.860
 but our brown and pizza is 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.920
 thin and while our brownie is 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.920
 we already have here prepared 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.980
 our fruit chocolate sparks the 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.430
 ingredients that we want to put to this 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.190
 super rich pizza we already have here our 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.140
 cream cheese at room temperature super 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.320
 important we are going to add from our 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.470
 sugar glass a spoonful and of our 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:42.400
 abstract only a trickle 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.140
 whether that my mold brownie 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.140
 let's let it cool 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.560
 very well comes the richest of this 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:58.950
 recipe let's put our mix 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.950
 in our brownie pizza 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.100
 how rich do you see then what are we going to do 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.570
 is that with our hands or if you 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.790
 you want the truth with me 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:17.870
 I prefer with my hands we will decorate 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.870
 our pizza 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.890
 What do you think about me? 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.890
 delighted now let's try it 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.479
 good 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.979
 to see here the judges are going to tell me if 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.979
 I was rich how is 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:06.600
 bad and what wave do you want to try 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.600

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.780
