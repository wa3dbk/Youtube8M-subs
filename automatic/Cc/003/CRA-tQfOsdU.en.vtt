00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.940
 how many boys welcome to block 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.560
 center in this opportunity we love you 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.390
 again an exclusivity on the part of 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.480
 The friends of Jesus is about the plate 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.250
 mother of 85 vanguard part of the series 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.470
 the ultimate force also known as 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.939
 chat and well this board is designed 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.289
 for fourth quarter teachers 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.559
 generation and as its name says 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.210
 has a chipset of 85 at a glance 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.670
 you may notice that it is a motherboard of 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.290
 micro to tx format but with the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.670
 characteristics and security that we 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.080
 provides the tap series 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.660
 then we will be making a 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.460
 maxi and a quick view of this plate l 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.899
 plate of this pretty small plate what 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.790
 fair and necessary for a micro plate 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.559
 x bat style moore regrets being 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.840
 caught with a military or armored touch 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.600
 As I mentioned, this plate comes with a 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.940
 chipset of 85 and is part of the series the 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.010
 ultimate force also known as tab 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.840
 in the bottom of the front 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.970
 we found some features like 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.090
 compatibility with windows 8 port hdmi 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.700
 and support of crossfire support ultra hd 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.780
 4k and logically the intel logos of 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.220
 fourth generation 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.500
 finally the main feature 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.450
 of the series and to the five years in entity 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.890
 at the top we find a 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.460
 box in different languages ​​that says 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.650
 usb 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.420
 0-real data rate said superior 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.340
 and component is high levels 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.229
 yields reported to the right side 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.790
 and left we have only the logos 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.080
 of the series and model in the part 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.340
 lower is where we find a number 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.079
 serial and part number 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.159
 in the back we have more 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.719
 specifications of this plate 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.250
 including two previews of the 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.340
 same some of the characteristics 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.329
 mentioned perhaps harboe radar horne that 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.859
 is responsible for monitoring the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.390
 temperatures will be adjusted speed of 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.679
 those fans can also be 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.270
 customize to our liking the 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.950
 bells that assures us the component 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.350
 it will be high performance military and 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.060
 duration server write realities have 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.770
 the entire staff plate pass these tests 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.689
 under different heat conditions and 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.640
 humidity that results in plates totally 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.979
 reliable and safe for intensive use in 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.959
 different parts of the world digits 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.579
 vietnam the well-known technology of 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.259
 echoes that is responsible for providing the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.819
 precise amount of energy with its 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.769
 superior performance stability and 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.150
 energy efficiency on this side 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.709
 We have the specification box 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.140
 we have tried continuation and 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:21.090
 Low features like usb 3.0 bus 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.799
 bios of fit and edwards and the sweet frame 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.019
 these are the specifications listed 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.850
 in the packaging for more detail I will leave the 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.310
 link in the description 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.020
 now let's move to the maximum 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.060
 as I mentioned the box is the size 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.060
 just for a micro- ate plate x 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.110
 under the tray that protects the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.940
 plate we will find the rest of 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.310
 accessories and extras of the plate as 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.349
 this sticker with the tab logo 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.300
 and then we have the already classic terms 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.770
 of guarantee and mining among them 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.020
 burst and chop of confidence or 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.930
 security of the tap plates that says that 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.489
 Each part of the plate has been tested 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.470
 and finally the user manual with the 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.340
 disk of drivers and utilities as a 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.290
 issues sticker inside 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.360
 then we have the back play with a 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.280
 matte black finish typical of many 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.280
 plates and their and in particular the series 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.710
 and finally within a tab of the 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.960
 tray that protects the plate we have two 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.960
 sata cables and the two connectors 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.090
 as we already see, only the necessary 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.920
 to put the tables in operation 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.269
 in the packaging of silver and it is a norm 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.150
 always comes inside a bag 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.860
 antistatic at first glance I can say 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.480
 that silver is pretty solid is 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.280
 quite heavy for its size which 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.660
 It is also an indicator of the quality of 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.660
 construction and materials used 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.620
 As is typical of the series, the design and 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.319
 Plate colors have a theme 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.970
 military like an armored or a bunker 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.860
 the activity farm quickly jumps 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.989
 at sight the fact that it is a plate 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.640
 small and a chipset of 85 does not 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.290
 means that that has been neglected to 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.880
 the same as the version tx 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.980
 has a good number of connectors for 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.180
 fans with 5 of these I think your visit 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.000
 to connect the whole system and 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.380
 keep it properly refrigerated in 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.989
 regarding connectivity of the part of the 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.890
 wax we have a ps2 port two ports 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:19.700
 usb 2.0 connection hdmi displayport dvi and 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:23.180
 vga four ports usb 3.0 a port lan 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.340
 and 7.1 audio ports also 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.930
 we have the name and edwards that are 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.830
 some chips that protect the components 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.830
 of electrostatic discharges 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.240
 in the bottom part we have the 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.330
 audio connections and on this the 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.880
 spf connection a connector for fans a 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.280
 connector for security tpm a port 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.870
 with three USB 2.0 ports 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.449
 each of these the connectivity for 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.550
 two usb ports or another fan connector 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.830
 the pins for the front control of the 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.160
 case rts jumpers to reset the 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.110
 closer memories and jumpers for the case 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.060
 On the right side we have six ports 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.710
 sata four of them are jumps three and 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.930
 two tied between them too 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.810
 we have a power indicator led 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:09.060
 usb 3.0 connector and with power environment 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.980
 24 pins and two connectors for fans 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.180
 at the top we only have 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.340
 the connector for the cooler of 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.750
 processor a proprietary connection and 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.930
 we can notice the power connectors 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.070
 to 8-pin tx around the socket 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.770
 we find in some composers 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.450
 sounds and phases few enough 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.740
 to wish a light watch and 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.120
 second they wonder why they talk about 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.850
 see clock being this a plate with 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.500
 85 chipset good in the past 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.810
 videos of them has managed to unlock 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.840
 the ability to overclock low chipset 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.520
 of 85 andh 77 however that this 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.800
 continuity depends on intel since only 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.419
 the 187 were designed and designed to 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.340
 said characteristic unlike 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.919
 other plates my key tx s supports up 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.690
 32 gb of ram of 4 slots and with dual 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.850
 channel as you already noticed the heatsinks 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.200
 also the military theme this last 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.669
 It has a series of pretty details 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.560
 small emulating a sheet of steel 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.330
 Slip-resistant finally the slots 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.880
 expansion this plate has three 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:03.690
 pci express slots and 1 psi in order 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.120
 we have a slot pci x 16 other x 1 a 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.860
 pci slot and at the end a pci express slot 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.840
 from format x 16 running to x4 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.520
 in conclusion this plate is perfect 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.889
 both for gamers and enthusiasts 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.810
 with a somewhat low budget if still 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.550
 we do not know the price we can deduct 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.650
 that will not be as high as it has a 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.389
 85 chipset in terms of the 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.729
 connectivity in general surpasses by much 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.500
 the micro x conventional beats with six 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.479
 sata ports 4 slot for memory 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.759
 amount of usb is amount of 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.259
 connections for fans among others 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.969
 great point in favor is the quality of 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:37.219
 constitution and certified parties 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:39.379
 this board is really solid to simple 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:42.110
 view and assures us years of years of use 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:46.219
 intense new features as is 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.659
 to save Robert Cort and USB 3.0 Push him 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:49.759
 they give a good added value to this plate 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:51.379
 The only thing I have seen is a button 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.210
 dedicated to clean ships and it would be the 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:55.279
 only observation for this plate so 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.500
 others is perfect and an excellent option 

00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:00.500
 to migrate or put together a new PC based 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.349
 in hardware like that those 25 vanguard are 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.159
 They carry our world editors choice 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:05.750
 soon we will be looking forward to this 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:07.340
 plate more thoroughly and showing them their 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.110
 Software behavior and utilities 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.789
 good we can only thank issues 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.050
