00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
just to check them out I'm going to be

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.060 
just to check them out I'm going to be
opening<00:00:24.150> both<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.570> them<00:00:24.920> apparently<00:00:25.920> there's

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
opening both of them apparently there's

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.950 
opening both of them apparently there's
not<00:00:26.250> going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> be<00:00:26.490> any<00:00:26.670> overprinting<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.810> this

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
not going to be any overprinting of this

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.110 
not going to be any overprinting of this
issue<00:00:28.140> or<00:00:28.529> rather<00:00:31.250> where<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.969> yeah

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
issue or rather where was it yeah

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.750 
issue or rather where was it yeah
overprinting<00:00:33.930> guys<00:00:34.230> like<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> 90s<00:00:35.610> it

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
overprinting guys like in the 90s it

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.700 
overprinting guys like in the 90s it
would<00:00:35.850> always<00:00:36.090> over<00:00:36.420> print<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.320> print

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
would always over print that just print

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.889 
would always over print that just print
the<00:00:37.829> same<00:00:38.010> issue<00:00:38.190> over<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.879> over<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.300> over<00:00:39.450> so

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the same issue over and over and over so

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.420 
the same issue over and over and over so
they<00:00:39.989> became<00:00:40.290> very<00:00:40.559> practically<00:00:41.160> worthless

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
they became very practically worthless

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.700 
they became very practically worthless
so<00:00:42.239> apparently<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.989> retain

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
so apparently this is going to retain

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.209 
so apparently this is going to retain
some<00:00:44.010> value<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:45.840> variance<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:46.920> not

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
some value and the variance I don't not

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.010 
some value and the variance I don't not
entirely<00:00:47.489> sure<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:47.789> they're<00:00:48.090> included<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
entirely sure if they're included in the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.970 
entirely sure if they're included in the
poly<00:00:49.260> bags<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.829> well<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.960> know<00:00:51.960> there<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.320> I've

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
poly bags as well I know there was I've

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.590 
poly bags as well I know there was I've
seen<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.730> spoiler<00:00:54.360> variant<00:00:55.579> that<00:00:56.600> didn't

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
seen one spoiler variant that didn't

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.540 
seen one spoiler variant that didn't
seem<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> poly<00:00:59.100> I'm<00:00:59.370> not

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
seem to be in in the poly I'm not

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.229 
seem to be in in the poly I'm not
entirely<00:00:59.820> sure<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:01.070> seems<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.309> great

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
entirely sure but seems like a great

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.620 
entirely sure but seems like a great
issue<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:04.710> own<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:08.100> keep<00:01:08.340> all<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.420> so

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
I'm gonna open both of these and maybe

research on and I'll grab some more
later<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:17.340> how<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> variants<00:01:18.840> are

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
later and see how the variants are

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.780 
later and see how the variants are
distributed<00:01:20.430> exactly<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:22.549> should<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.640> gotten

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
distributed exactly I should have gotten

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.719 
distributed exactly I should have gotten
some<00:01:23.970> scissors<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.509> guess<00:01:24.830> well<00:01:25.830> anyway<00:01:26.100> i'm

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
some scissors I guess well anyway i'm

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.170 
some scissors I guess well anyway i'm
just<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.030> rip<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> open<00:01:28.549> not<00:01:29.549> much<00:01:29.850> for

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
just going to rip it open not much for

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.539 
just going to rip it open not much for
the<00:01:30.270> poly<00:01:30.540> bag<00:01:31.170> anyway<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:32.280> means<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the poly bag anyway but that means a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:45.970 
the poly bag anyway but that means a
cool<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.150> cool<00:01:33.240> poly<00:01:33.659> agus

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.440 

all<00:01:46.980> right<00:01:47.250> look<00:01:47.640> at<00:01:47.760> that<00:01:47.910> that's<00:01:48.120> an<00:01:48.300> awesome

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
all right look at that that's an awesome

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.970 
all right look at that that's an awesome
cover<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.800> right<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.680> thought<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.920> was

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
cover all right so I I thought this was

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.820 
cover all right so I I thought this was
the<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.150> spoiler<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.900> I<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> guess<00:01:55.620> somebody

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
the the spoiler one I I guess somebody

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.440 
the the spoiler one I I guess somebody
was<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.250> including<00:01:56.760> it<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.030> calling<00:01:57.210> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
was just including it and calling a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.220 
was just including it and calling a
spoiler<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.140> not<00:01:58.830> entirely<00:01:59.100> sure<00:01:59.250> what<00:02:00.230> what

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
spoiler so not entirely sure what what

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.860 
spoiler so not entirely sure what what
this<00:02:01.410> would<00:02:01.560> become<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.280> might<00:02:02.580> be<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.300> okay

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
this would become this might be the okay

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.680 
this would become this might be the okay
so<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.170> one<00:02:04.320> looks<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.620> badly<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.690> think

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
so this one looks like a badly I think

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.450 
so this one looks like a badly I think
there's<00:02:06.900> two<00:02:07.200> variants<00:02:07.710> or<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:10.280> think<00:02:11.280> there's

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
there's two variants or I think there's

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.760 
there's two variants or I think there's
a<00:02:11.520> bendy<00:02:12.300> send<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.810> Bagley<00:02:13.260> variant<00:02:13.680> or

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
a bendy send a Bagley variant or

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.230 
a bendy send a Bagley variant or
something<00:02:14.070> like<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.460> have<00:02:14.580> no<00:02:14.760> idea<00:02:14.880> but

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
something like that I have no idea but

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.590 
something like that I have no idea but
anyway<00:02:15.600> this<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.560> an<00:02:16.680> awesome<00:02:16.800> cover<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:18.330> looks

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
anyway this is an awesome cover it looks
