today<00:00:13.790> we<00:00:13.970> are<00:00:14.030> using<00:00:14.150> a<00:00:14.690> method<00:00:15.110> called<00:00:15.530> the

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
today we are using a method called the

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.430 
today we are using a method called the
drop<00:00:16.160> shot<00:00:16.400> rig<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:16.940> you<00:00:17.020> can<00:00:18.020> use<00:00:18.140> it<00:00:18.260> with

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
drop shot rig and you can use it with

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.700 
drop shot rig and you can use it with
live<00:00:19.099> or<00:00:19.400> artificial<00:00:20.000> bait<00:00:20.270> so<00:00:21.140> I<00:00:21.529> just

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
live or artificial bait so I just

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.170 
live or artificial bait so I just
wandering<00:00:22.040> Paul<00:00:22.189> if<00:00:22.310> you<00:00:22.400> can<00:00:22.550> maybe<00:00:22.790> show<00:00:23.060> our

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
monofilament like Amanda does it's it's

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.860 
monofilament like Amanda does it's it's
key<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.190> run<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.700> small<00:02:43.299> two<00:02:43.480> waist<00:02:43.660> swivel

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.030 
green is kind of color yeah and then
they<00:04:35.960> get<00:04:36.080> these<00:04:36.140> really<00:04:36.320> nice<00:04:36.470> markings<00:04:36.890> so<00:04:36.980> a

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
they get these really nice markings so a

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.860 
they get these really nice markings so a
lot<00:04:37.190> of<00:04:37.220> it's<00:04:37.370> for<00:04:37.490> camouflage<00:04:37.910> because<00:04:38.630> we're

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
lot of it's for camouflage because we're

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.360 
lot of it's for camouflage because we're
in<00:04:38.930> fairly<00:04:39.290> shallow<00:04:39.470> water<00:04:39.830> here<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.190> water

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
in fairly shallow water here the water

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.740 
in fairly shallow water here the water
is<00:04:40.490> clear<00:04:40.760> I<00:04:40.970> think<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.210> lot<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.390> it's<00:04:41.570> just

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
is clear I think a lot of it's just

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.590 
is clear I think a lot of it's just
survival<00:04:42.040> instincts<00:04:43.040> just<00:04:43.970> handle<00:04:44.240> but<00:04:44.390> yeah

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
survival instincts just handle but yeah

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.000 
survival instincts just handle but yeah
accidental<00:04:44.990> flies<00:04:45.140> for<00:04:45.380> example<00:04:45.770> if<00:04:45.860> they're

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
accidental flies for example if they're

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.790 
accidental flies for example if they're
on<00:04:46.130> a<00:04:46.400> dark<00:04:46.880> bottom<00:04:47.270> or<00:04:47.390> rock<00:04:48.229> a<00:04:48.470> lot<00:04:48.560> of<00:04:48.620> times

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800
