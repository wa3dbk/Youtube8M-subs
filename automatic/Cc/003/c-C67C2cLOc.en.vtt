00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.000
 dear friends of hers, she is 2012 to us 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.830
 sony stand in front of a wall 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.890
 really the case to say about TV from 84 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.720
 4k inches the new bravia that was 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.300
 presented right here was already 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.130
 clearly a much anticipated product but 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.260
 finally we can see it up close and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.359
 above all to know a lot more thanks 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.620
 also to the help of franc calabretto of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.910
 sony italy that helps us then frankly 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.829
 let's talk about the basic features 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.920
 of this of this product and then 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.379
 let's go into depth on some aspects 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.210
 their haifa 2012 sony with kde l 84 hicks 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.989
 9500 this is the abbreviation in full of 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.899
 this little television wall 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.600
 she also enters the 4k world 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.969
 home then it is a TV 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.829
 let's say consumer is not a product 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.930
 professional a product intended for 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.570
 domestic end users 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.880
 absolutely yes although the appearance 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.400
 particularly robust and professional 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.000
 I would say precisely for the type of 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.939
 chassis is very linear very clean 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.240
 as a design it makes it look like a product 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.890
 pro is absolutely home well 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.380
 so let's say 4k then in the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.540
 four times the resolution of 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.440
 a full hd tv 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.690
 however the contents obviously the problem 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.390
 content or lack or absence 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.820
 current content at home level is 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.700
 definitely one of the concerns 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.460
 primary but poor consumers but sony 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.440
 he tried to solve from the beginning 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.240
 we see this kind of problem 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.930
 in the demo rooms we are going to see 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.270
 now 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.890
 ok now let's move on, that's it 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.840
 then move to this new one 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.520
 position another specimen for 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.370
 bring a slightly smaller TV 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.259
 tell us then slightly smaller 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.210
 actually this is until now the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.000
 Biggest television that Sony had a 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.680
 full hd format 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.020
 the example we want to show here and that 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.130
 it is essential to clarify what it is 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.709
 been the effort of technological sony e 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.590
 the use of a full hd source 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.700
 reproduced by both televisions 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.620
 naturally on a large TV 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.530
 screen with great thumbwash the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.260
 full hd becomes almost too little in 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.670
 termination terms 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.800
 the 84 inches the 4k through a new one 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.790
 processor that is the 4 kx reality pro 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.010
 he apologizes without it for a while 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.070
 same that mounted on the 4k projector 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.100
 of sony is the same mounted on the new 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.959
 sony 4k projector adds a 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.390
 integrated that takes care of the over 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.530
 sampling then takes the full signal 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:59.420
 hd and turns it into a 4k signal with 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.340
 a result that is definitely live 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.170
 convincing comforting decidedly 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.330
 remarkable looking even so happened 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.510
 so you also say full content 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.180
 normal hd can benefit from a 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.709
 4k panel of this type and thanks 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.570
 even the electronics behind it 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.430
 let's say any content in 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.049
 particularly if the content is good 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.970
 so all the blu ray that have been 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.549
 purchased so far can 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.950
 immediately benefit from this 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.920
 over sampling giving a result 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.260
 the very good image is yes 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.120
 it is about 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.890
 3d tv and a naturally 3d or tv 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.909
 cannot not be a product of 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:45.230
 this 3d generation but in this 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:48.709
 product is no longer active but is passive or 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.900
 better the glasses system 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.140
 utilized profits from a passive system e 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.319
 not active then polarized lenses e 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.099
 then reverse aline polarization 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.340
 alternate which however allows you to 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.900
 also get a vision of oneself 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.900
 full hd image 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.379
 therefore therefore I am always in 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.290
 this case 1080 lines for each or two 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:18.079
 2k images so absolutely or one 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.220
 3d quality that is definitely higher than 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.120
 the one that a system can offer 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:28.940
 passive normal by the way it incorporates and 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:31.910
 we see it in this other demo room one 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.710
 technology that is characteristic of 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.490
 playstation 3 that technology 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.010
 simulview therefore takes advantage of evolution 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.250
 of 3d to give the possibility to do 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.830
 something otherwise impossible, that is 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.990
 gives two users the chance to see 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.750
 simultaneously on the same screen 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.760
 two different images this 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.320
 simply using the 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.400
 polarization we just have 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.430
 mentioned that it comes normally 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.169
 exploited for 3d with two glasses that 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.320
 they are therefore different one polarized 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.630
 right only 1 polarized only left 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.630
 both lenses and can change 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.240
 certainly and with time we succeed in 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.340
 see each one's own car then 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.130
 guide everyone their own race on 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.560
 same screen as with this size 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.599
 you can usually imagine what benefit 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.930
 can give even in this case in full 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:26.740
 hd then the final quality for each 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.319
 player will be full hd thing 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.470
 and obviously not obtainable with the 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:35.110
 polarized technology except with a 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.950
 panel 4k I would like to move the last one 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.440
 location where we still talk about ps3 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.930
 I see that here is a playstation up is 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.050
 has been linked to another copy of 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.060
 this 84 inch 10 frank this is one 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.250
 playstation that right now is 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.500
 using a downloadable software already 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.920
 from now in reality we are a plane 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.800
 moresi study that allows you to manage 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.230
 download images and videos and even 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.250
 to make video image editing 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.230
 the peculiarity is that with a subsequent one 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.330
 update that will arrive shortly 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.970
 this software will be possible 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.440
 transform the playstation that still 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.370
 once amazes us for his 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.800
 elasticity will transform it into the first 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.800
 4k player does not divide or 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.440
 initially but at least of the photos that 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.510
 boredom today we are already able to 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.910
 achieve with even resolution 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.160
 over 4 k with our reflex cameras o 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.770
 even even with our compacts 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.060
 remember that 4k is more or less equivalent to 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.650
 8 megapixels 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.360
 so let's start being one 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.590
 resolution that comparable to that 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.570
 of the best cameras 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.910
 surely we begin to see 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.350
 really even on TV the detail of the 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.700
 photo that you didn't see before then 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.560
 this thanks to the process a play not 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.570
 need a new machine 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.660
 absolutely not says transform later 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:59.050
 the output that instead of going out in full hd 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.990
 simple comes out in 4k and then lets you 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.540
 use in this case photos and 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.660
 therefore exploit adequately and 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:10.450
 corrected our new 84 screen 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.330
 inches or as in the case of the 4 kx i 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.920
 reality show to upgrade those that are 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.700
 the video images we already have at 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.470
 layout 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:22.480
 then we are enraptured by so much 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:25.330
 magnificence and yet we have to get to 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.000
 a sore point painful for all the 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.040
 price of this fantastic item not 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.400
 I speak of the ps then obviously in the bravi 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:38.260
 and 84 inches 4k the price communicated for 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:40.390
 2012 is 25 thousand euros 25,000 euros 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.820
 a very important price comes that 

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.980
 maybe we hope will be susceptible in 

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.740
 future of some reduction though 

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.180
 surely we say equal to the 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.750
 quality of the product we have seen 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.560
 today 

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.560
 thank you so much
