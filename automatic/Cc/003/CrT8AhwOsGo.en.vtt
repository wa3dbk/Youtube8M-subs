00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.519
 Welcome to the car practice 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.750
 test de 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.179
 I do not have a golf gti 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.460
 confused with the golf gti stands 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.280
 namely electronic electrics 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.260
 electronics 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.060
 somehow synonymous with normal elsewhere 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.140
 if you are slow 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.430
 continue with 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.710
 battery 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.660
 be careful if it is slow now 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.310
 set off 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.060
 one does not say because 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.390
 motor electric 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.390
 yeah 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.420
 Now he is with the mother 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.960
 that sits 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.960
 not bad, right 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.520
 that's weird at first because of the 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.900
 one thinks relatively quietly 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.150
 why he does not drive now but the 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.140
 FÃ¶rderschulen you have as quiet as one 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.140
 very small the machine 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.690
 man i say quicker than 25 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.430
 kilometer runs then the normal 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.820
 Another thing that makes the combustion engine 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.820
 everything alone 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.640
 who, so to speak, is an independent dare 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.190
 forget everything 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.990
 The car does not matter how fast you get 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.960
 remote 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.320
 the master 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.680
 I like that 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.130
 travel mother 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.720
 if you charge the car then you have to 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.870
 the cable in the back of the trunk 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.240
 connect at the front 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.540
 vw sign on the front of the bonnet 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.520
 you can meet up 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.140
 On the other hand, I do not have that right away 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.740
 I had to search for a while 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.930
 in the manual the house 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.790
 that does not explain itself but you get 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.040
 also 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.530
 that explains that if that's wonderful 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.610
 you can read 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.450
 in the row 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.310
 take out there 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.310
 without simply plugging that 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.659
 if you charge the car then you can 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.580
 that is in the normal socket 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.040
 So he puts his strong current home 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.690
 in the garage also good but you need 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.770
 you can not do any commercial 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.079
 outlet in the garage 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.330
 plug in next to it that the cable is 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.310
 you used for it 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.740
 the normal outlet are also 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.300
 second cable strong current so if you 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.210
 in high demand 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.900
 the kba use 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.069
 because another 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.019
 That's why you should actually 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.230
 which I like very much with the cars 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.730
 again their designed is seen 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.560
 his car from the inside out 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.170
 therefore 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.760
 important in 20 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.439
 I think the design of this 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.460
 Change here for you everywhere 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:37.500
 send so nice heard 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.370
 What I noticed is what I give you 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.980
 in the evening 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.750
 have driven 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.550
 which is when you're in there their 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.990
 spaceships at the many judges 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.400
 and the winner is 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.400
 star trek I can also really great 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.120
 Sutter is on the street 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.980
 of 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.010
 the relatively flat so a little hard 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.240
 from the partner but I think that makes 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.830
 good if you drive faster 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.920
 is not possible 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.959
 really fast 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.990
 he drives fast but not so 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.060
 that man now 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.569
 press down the accelerator pedal that there 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.499
 not what is coming 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.499
 he needs a bit 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.340
 that makes 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.660
 now a display stands there then book 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.590
 because you can look at it as well 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.080
 I would pass on a dear 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.970
 but he is fun he is driving is 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.610
 I am very happy with the highway 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.510
 I'm driving on the highway 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.330
 I am 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.720
 fallen in the city with them 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.280
 has actually everywhere equally well 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.290
 proven so I think the fan is about it 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.090
 there 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.150
 I liked it a lot 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.880
 two things 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.860
 not even minutiae 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.380
 great vienna abc always pave 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.940
 the attached sizzles actors so 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.120
 if you really want it to be true and 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.340
 The women like to do it 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.660
 three make us heart 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.739
 others which I really liked 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.420
 I'll try that too 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.420
 demonstrate when navigating out 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.140
 which is really great for me 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.110
 shows again 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.150
 he now shows only the card because you empty 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.780
 comes with the hand and the performance 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.590
 from approx 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.630
 growth 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.580
 the big fun i just pull i 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.200
 I thought I can not believe it 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.820
 in things the added 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.650
 So the electronic super 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.630
 The navi's works is great 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.370
 insanely easy too much 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.520
 if you enter the addresses you can 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.480
 do that via touchscreen and it works 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.670
 so I think I have never been so 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.420
 fast address entered with this 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.139
 golf gti 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:49.629
 He also finds everything that is right 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.629
 hired a lady , dear Herr 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.720
 which is a bit difficult to trade 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.910
 this pattern of a seat 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.430
 but that is a matter of taste there 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.280
 I would have this 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.460
 before the 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.199
 make less 70s 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.780
 show are clearly one sees 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.180
 everything you see 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.470
 only at the beginning of the fuel gauge she has 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.660
 but still and 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.550
 because such a left one is not called 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.990
 I know what she means but her 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.860
 Right then I thought that there 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.110
 completely one 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.270
 and I have made 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:24.639
 at vw almost always the plant is good 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.259
 also in gti I have again 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.960
 smartphone connected by the 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.870
 deals 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.190
 and whenever I got in the car 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.450
 was that connected 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.230
 you could musician and that works 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.249
 impeccable her 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.229
 then connect 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:40.680
 everything self-explanatory totally easy 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.940
 made 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.080
 and the facility is good 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.939
 What I had, what I had 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.590
 have a bit of where they were there 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:49.539
 they do not do the other thing that well 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.060
 but here the plant is good 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:54.460
 nice pass 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.630
 the program from the bte is of course not 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.580
 but as sufficient and 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.350
 he lies very deep and you have to be able to 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.889
 wonderfully loaded 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.200
 the all purchased at all 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.360
 not a sofa now 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.169
 but 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.820
 bicycle 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:15.280
 are tapped under 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.449
 my conclusion the golf gti is a great one 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.099
 automobile 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.469
 if you mark gold and i like today 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:24.689
 still most I always claim 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:27.159
 now time wolfes one of the best cars 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.110
 because I'm running the price performance 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:31.300
 always great if he is still good 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.710
 Is provided 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:38.110
 and the golf gti is here if you are now 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.110
 not what in the sporty drive wants 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.860
 Highly recommended you can also with electricity 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.040
 drive with laughter already I have everything 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.040
 made 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.290
 Yes 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.270
 is suitable for women's men too 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.790
 for new drivers is really fit 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:56.470
 It's great to think that 's a car with you 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.470
 each kind were immediately
