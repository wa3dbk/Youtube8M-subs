 Hello everyone, how about playing gta5 with 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.000
 first-person view both at the time 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.199
 you are driving or when you are 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.170
 have you been walking 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.769
 many people have done it right with the molds 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.589
 in the epoch of gta 4 and such that only one 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:53.339
 support site print info 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:57.210
 rockstar has been removed 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:00.000
 but I'll show you here it's this 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.170
 It was added in promises sometimes and 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.390
 this feature in ps version 4 xbox wii and 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.180
 of course not pc 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.140
 was also informed a few more 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.510
 news 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.500
 while you see the print I comment 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.960
 for you 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.360
 these new features has been adding new 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.159
 random events for single mode 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:31.350
 player new ways for the session 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.950
 online new strix and also the inclusion 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.280
 of new animals in the game that also 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.479
 can make their debut in online mode 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.700
 in the game 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.850
 It is interesting to see that the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.039
 rockstar is improving by adding 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.159
 new features in the game 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:53.549
 this causes those who have already played 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:56.819
 until you have a new experience 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.859
 less some things in the game right? 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:03.299
 exercising the city will find some 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:06.270
 thing that the PS3 version and Xbox 360 does not 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.110
 had remembered again the game will be 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.580
 launched on November 19th in the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.680
 playstation 4 and xbox the year and only in 27 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.190
 from January to PC 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.209
 hopefully with this pc version come 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.330
 right as the best think the released version 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.670
 of the game is more complete after all 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.030
 and it will appear last 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.700
 Yes, thankfully, this already has 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.190
 happened with some games but even 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.440
 so there is still phase of the pc 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.100
 a better platform where the price 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.340
 of games are much lower, right? 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.490
 obviously superior quality you have 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.160
 the equivalent touch equipment 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.870
 a big personal hug until the next 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.870
 video wants to watch
