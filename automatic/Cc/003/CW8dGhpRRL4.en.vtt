okay out there YouTube land here's the

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.789 
okay out there YouTube land here's the
video<00:00:03.620> that<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.650> challenged<00:00:05.400> debunkers<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.799> try

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
video that I challenged debunkers to try

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.310 
video that I challenged debunkers to try
to<00:00:07.859> debunk<00:00:08.660> what<00:00:09.660> you're<00:00:09.840> seeing<00:00:10.050> right<00:00:10.139> there

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
to debunk what you're seeing right there

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.959 
to debunk what you're seeing right there
is<00:00:11.509> two<00:00:12.509> chemtrail<00:00:13.049> planes<00:00:13.790> chasing<00:00:14.790> after

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
is two chemtrail planes chasing after

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.859 
is two chemtrail planes chasing after
another<00:00:15.660> plane<00:00:17.060> here's<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.119> couple<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.600> French

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
another plane here's a couple of French

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.450 
another plane here's a couple of French
planes<00:00:20.119> these<00:00:21.119> planes<00:00:21.449> will<00:00:21.689> show<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:21.990> how

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
planes these planes will show you how

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.450 
planes these planes will show you how
aerosols<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.910> turned<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.449> off<00:00:25.460> very

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
aerosols can be turned on and off very

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.179 
aerosols can be turned on and off very
obvious<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:28.230> plane<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.590> turned<00:00:29.010> on

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
obvious here the plane just turned on

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.600 
obvious here the plane just turned on
the<00:00:29.220> area<00:00:29.580> saw<00:00:29.789> spray<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:32.130> other<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:32.399> had<00:00:32.579> it

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
the area saw spray the other one had it

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.030 
the area saw spray the other one had it
on<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.210> other<00:00:33.300> two<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:34.230> nothing<00:00:34.410> coming<00:00:34.829> out

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
on the other two have nothing coming out

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.500 
on the other two have nothing coming out
at<00:00:35.250> all<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:37.219> this<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.340> obviously<00:00:38.550> an<00:00:39.059> aerosol

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
at all and this is obviously an aerosol

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.200 
at all and this is obviously an aerosol
okay<00:00:39.989> there<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.379> plane<00:00:40.649> turned<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.100> off<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
okay there that plane turned it off that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.869 
okay there that plane turned it off that
plane<00:00:42.510> turned<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.079> all<00:00:43.379> four<00:00:44.309> planes<00:00:44.520> are

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
plane turned it on all four planes are

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.100 
plane turned it on all four planes are
flying<00:00:44.910> all<00:00:45.469> four<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.710> an<00:00:47.070> exhaust<00:00:47.489> yet<00:00:48.110> only

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
flying all four have an exhaust yet only

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.770 
flying all four have an exhaust yet only
two<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.739> them<00:00:50.070> alternately<00:00:50.940> turn<00:00:51.300> off<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> on

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
two of them alternately turn off and on

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.779 
two of them alternately turn off and on
now<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:53.210> sky<00:00:54.210> riders<00:00:55.280> okay<00:00:56.280> Skye<00:00:56.579> Ryder's

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
now here is sky riders okay Skye Ryder's

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.750 
now here is sky riders okay Skye Ryder's
spray<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.960> sky<00:00:58.289> they<00:00:59.010> would<00:00:59.190> spray<00:00:59.489> words

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
spray in the sky they would spray words

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.500 
spray in the sky they would spray words
things<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:01.910> but<00:01:02.910> look<00:01:03.090> there's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
things like that but look there's

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.039 
things like that but look there's
chemtrails<00:01:04.939> some<00:01:05.939> people<00:01:06.210> think<00:01:06.360> skywriters

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
chemtrails some people think skywriters

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.950 
chemtrails some people think skywriters
can<00:01:07.380> work<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:07.890> other<00:01:08.280> planes<00:01:08.610> can't<00:01:08.960> it's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
can work but other planes can't it's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.750 
can work but other planes can't it's
just<00:01:10.200> contrast<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:10.890> no<00:01:11.189> all<00:01:11.400> right<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:11.580> here

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
just contrast but no all right now here

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.480 
just contrast but no all right now here
here<00:01:12.000> you've<00:01:12.119> got<00:01:12.150> two<00:01:12.510> planes<00:01:12.810> sprang

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
here you've got two planes sprang

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.550 
here you've got two planes sprang
chasing<00:01:14.490> another<00:01:14.640> plane<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.869> other<00:01:15.990> plane<00:01:16.290> is

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
chasing another plane the other plane is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.170 
chasing another plane the other plane is
in<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> middle<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.580> right<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:18.000> bit

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
in the middle to the right a little bit

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.840 
in the middle to the right a little bit
you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.200> small<00:01:19.710> dot<00:01:19.979> same

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
you can see it there it's small dot same

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.420 
you can see it there it's small dot same
speed<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.200> altitude<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.860> probably<00:01:23.250> exactly

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
speed the altitude is probably exactly

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.730 
speed the altitude is probably exactly
the<00:01:23.939> same<00:01:24.180> or<00:01:24.360> possibly<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> altitude<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the same or possibly the altitude of the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.219 
the same or possibly the altitude of the
plane<00:01:26.640> that's<00:01:26.939> not<00:01:27.180> spraying<00:01:27.630> anything<00:01:28.080> is

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
plane that's not spraying anything is

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.670 
plane that's not spraying anything is
higher<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.180> lot<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.450> people

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
higher now you know a lot of people

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.140 
higher now you know a lot of people
pilots<00:01:31.680> everybody<00:01:32.159> else<00:01:32.369> will<00:01:32.579> come<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.880> board

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
pilots everybody else will come on board

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.630 
pilots everybody else will come on board
now<00:01:33.270> say<00:01:33.689> well<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.920> contrail<00:01:35.369> it's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
now say well it's just a contrail it's

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.480 
now say well it's just a contrail it's
just<00:01:35.880> normal<00:01:36.119> exhaust<00:01:36.630> well<00:01:37.280> there<00:01:38.280> you've

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
just normal exhaust well there you've

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.700 
just normal exhaust well there you've
got<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> plane<00:01:39.090> stop<00:01:39.630> spring<00:01:40.110> right<00:01:40.470> there

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
got the plane stop spring right there

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.330 
got the plane stop spring right there
and<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.520> other<00:01:41.549> plane<00:01:41.880> continues<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.720> fly<00:01:43.340> ok

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and the other plane continues to fly ok

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.609 
and the other plane continues to fly ok
mr.<00:01:44.880> pilots<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.659> debunkers<00:01:46.110> where's<00:01:46.409> that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
mr. pilots and debunkers where's that

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.289 
mr. pilots and debunkers where's that
other<00:01:46.649> plane<00:01:47.040> did<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.700> turn<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.180> engine

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
other plane did it just turn the engine

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.200 
other plane did it just turn the engine
off<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.899> don't<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.430> stopped<00:01:50.759> spring

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
off I don't think so it stopped spring

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.319 
off I don't think so it stopped spring
now<00:01:51.780> here's<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> here's<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> video<00:01:52.770> again

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
now here's the here's the video again

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.300 
now here's the here's the video again
it's<00:01:54.329> chasing<00:01:54.720> another<00:01:55.259> plane<00:01:55.649> two<00:01:55.979> planes

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it's chasing another plane two planes

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.459 
it's chasing another plane two planes
are<00:01:56.490> spraying<00:01:56.790> another<00:01:57.689> plane<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
are spraying another plane is in the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.520 
are spraying another plane is in the
middle<00:01:58.710> no<00:01:59.610> exhaust<00:02:00.030> no<00:02:00.479> spraying<00:02:00.990> nothing

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
middle no exhaust no spraying nothing

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.520 
middle no exhaust no spraying nothing
how<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.790> explain<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.689> pilots<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
how can you explain that you pilots and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.530 
how can you explain that you pilots and
debunkers<00:02:04.979> out<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.399> how<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.210> plane

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
debunkers out there how can that plane

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.600 
debunkers out there how can that plane
in<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> middle<00:02:06.990> fly<00:02:07.380> without<00:02:07.770> an<00:02:07.920> exhaust<00:02:08.310> but

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
in the middle fly without an exhaust but

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.389 
in the middle fly without an exhaust but
the<00:02:08.700> other<00:02:08.819> two<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.209> an<00:02:09.330> exhaust

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
the other two have an exhaust

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.670 
the other two have an exhaust
I<00:02:10.780> really<00:02:11.780> know<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.019> then<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.409> see<00:02:12.560> how

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
I really know and then you can see how

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.410 
I really know and then you can see how
it<00:02:12.799> started<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.459> they<00:02:13.579> started<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.150> spray

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
it started so they started to spray

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.479 
it started so they started to spray
right<00:02:14.629> there<00:02:14.930> does<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.829> mean<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.099> the

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
right there does that mean that the

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.399 
right there does that mean that the
temperature<00:02:16.909> suddenly<00:02:17.299> changed<00:02:17.959> there<00:02:18.230> and

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
temperature suddenly changed there and

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.589 
temperature suddenly changed there and
wait<00:02:19.159> okay<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.760> temperature<00:02:20.150> changer<00:02:20.480> oh

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
wait okay the temperature changer oh

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.569 
wait okay the temperature changer oh
wait<00:02:20.870> but<00:02:21.439> the<00:02:21.560> other<00:02:21.590> planes<00:02:21.950> right<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.400> same

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
wait but the other planes right the same

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.630 
wait but the other planes right the same
altitude<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.180> it's<00:02:23.299> still<00:02:23.510> spraying<00:02:23.870> ah<00:02:24.799> no

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
altitude and it's still spraying ah no

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.839 
altitude and it's still spraying ah no
temperature<00:02:26.090> change<00:02:27.040> happened<00:02:28.040> there<00:02:28.220> that

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
temperature change happened there that

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.390 
temperature change happened there that
other<00:02:29.090> plane<00:02:29.420> stop<00:02:29.780> spraying<00:02:30.230> again<00:02:31.040> here<00:02:31.280> it

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
other plane stop spraying again here it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.099 
other plane stop spraying again here it
is<00:02:31.549> three<00:02:32.510> planes<00:02:32.810> tour<00:02:33.379> spraying<00:02:33.829> once<00:02:34.159> not

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
is three planes tour spraying once not

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:39.670 
is three planes tour spraying once not
there<00:02:36.109> they<00:02:36.319> go<00:02:37.510> obvious<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:39.079> can<00:02:39.260> see<00:02:39.530> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
there they go obvious you can see the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.220 
there they go obvious you can see the
plane<00:02:39.920> right<00:02:40.250> there<00:02:40.750> nothing's<00:02:41.750> coming<00:02:42.019> out

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
plane right there nothing's coming out

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.710 
plane right there nothing's coming out
of<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.799> exhaust<00:02:43.069> is<00:02:43.310> perfectly<00:02:43.760> clear<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
of it the exhaust is perfectly clear the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.330 
of it the exhaust is perfectly clear the
other<00:02:44.750> two<00:02:45.049> are<00:02:45.079> spraying<00:02:45.500> it's<00:02:46.129> not<00:02:46.310> a

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
other two are spraying it's not a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.970 
other two are spraying it's not a
contrail<00:02:46.849> people<00:02:47.269> now<00:02:48.049> you<00:02:48.109> go<00:02:48.290> down<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.769> can

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
contrail people now you go down you can

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.490 
contrail people now you go down you can
see<00:02:49.220> where<00:02:49.400> they<00:02:49.549> start<00:02:50.030> at<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.329> spray<00:02:50.690> both

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
see where they start at the spray both

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.410 
see where they start at the spray both
those<00:02:51.739> planes<00:02:52.010> start<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.549> spray<00:02:52.819> right<00:02:53.150> there

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
those planes start the spray right there

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.020 
those planes start the spray right there
oh<00:02:53.680> wait<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.950> then<00:02:55.099> you<00:02:55.220> look<00:02:55.400> up<00:02:55.579> that<00:02:55.609> one

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
oh wait and then you look up that one

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.039 
oh wait and then you look up that one
stop<00:02:56.389> spraying<00:02:57.099> or<00:02:58.269> or<00:02:59.269> do<00:02:59.569> they<00:02:59.659> just<00:02:59.689> turn

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
stop spraying or or do they just turn

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.300 
stop spraying or or do they just turn
its<00:03:00.200> engine<00:03:00.530> off<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.829> like<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.069> see<00:03:01.220> your

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
its engine off I like to see your

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.830 
its engine off I like to see your
comments<00:03:01.790> down<00:03:01.909> there<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.239> pilots<00:03:02.689> and

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
comments down there you pilots and

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.710 
comments down there you pilots and
debunkers<00:03:03.620> what<00:03:04.250> happened<00:03:04.639> with<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.790> okay

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
debunkers what happened with that okay

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.199 
debunkers what happened with that okay
so<00:03:05.780> obviously<00:03:06.439> there's<00:03:07.129> two<00:03:07.370> chemtrail<00:03:07.909> plans

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
so obviously there's two chemtrail plans

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.510 
so obviously there's two chemtrail plans
there
