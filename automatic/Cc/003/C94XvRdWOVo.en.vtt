there<00:05:58.150> too<00:05:58.420> so<00:05:59.340> no<00:06:00.340> I<00:06:00.400> think<00:06:00.700> they're<00:06:01.030> very

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
there too so no I think they're very

flattering

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.460 

the<00:06:10.610> zipper<00:06:10.880> is<00:06:10.910> actually<00:06:11.360> inside<00:06:11.780> the<00:06:12.050> pocket

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
the zipper is actually inside the pocket

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.620 
the zipper is actually inside the pocket
as<00:06:12.650> you<00:06:12.860> can<00:06:13.070> see<00:06:13.310> so<00:06:13.550> it's<00:06:13.730> very<00:06:13.970> important

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
as you can see so it's very important

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.760 
as you can see so it's very important
that<00:06:14.690> you<00:06:14.900> remember<00:06:15.169> that<00:06:15.470> they<00:06:15.740> are

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
that you remember that they are

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.800 
that you remember that they are
difficult<00:06:16.460> to<00:06:16.610> get<00:06:16.790> on<00:06:17.030> over<00:06:17.449> the<00:06:17.600> hips

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
difficult to get on over the hips

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.620 
difficult to get on over the hips
sometimes<00:06:18.729> because<00:06:19.729> the<00:06:19.940> waist<00:06:20.120> is<00:06:20.389> cut

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
sometimes because the waist is cut

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.480 
sometimes because the waist is cut
smaller<00:06:21.020> and<00:06:21.320> because<00:06:21.830> there<00:06:21.979> is<00:06:22.070> no<00:06:22.220> stretch

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
smaller and because there is no stretch

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.050 
smaller and because there is no stretch
in<00:06:22.729> them

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
in them

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.370 
in them
so<00:06:23.270> these<00:06:23.419> are<00:06:23.600> a<00:06:23.630> little<00:06:23.720> more<00:06:23.840> difficult<00:06:24.050> to

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
so these are a little more difficult to

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.640 
so these are a little more difficult to
get<00:06:24.590> on<00:06:24.770> than<00:06:25.040> my<00:06:25.190> hungary<00:06:25.820> dolls<00:06:26.090> are<00:06:26.650> so

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
get on than my hungary dolls are so

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.800 
get on than my hungary dolls are so
sometimes<00:06:28.280> I<00:06:28.460> have<00:06:28.490> to<00:06:28.820> really<00:06:29.360> struggle<00:06:29.600> to

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
sometimes I have to really struggle to

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.240 
sometimes I have to really struggle to
getting<00:06:30.110> them<00:06:30.229> but<00:06:30.320> once<00:06:30.530> you<00:06:30.680> get<00:06:30.800> on<00:06:30.979> and<00:06:31.160> get

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
getting them but once you get on and get

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.830 
getting them but once you get on and get
them<00:06:31.370> on<00:06:31.460> they<00:06:31.610> fit<00:06:31.760> perfectly<00:06:32.210> once<00:06:32.570> you<00:06:32.720> get

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
them on they fit perfectly once you get

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.850
