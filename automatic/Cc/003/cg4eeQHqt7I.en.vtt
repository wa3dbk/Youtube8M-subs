for<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> most<00:00:53.070> part<00:00:53.489> different<00:00:54.059> varieties

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
for the most part different varieties

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.209 
for the most part different varieties
will<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.899> slightly<00:00:55.110> different<00:00:55.410> shapes<00:00:56.010> but

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
will have slightly different shapes but

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.360 
will have slightly different shapes but
they'll<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.780> entire<00:00:58.620> leaf<00:00:59.010> shape

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
they'll all have this entire leaf shape

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.520 
they'll all have this entire leaf shape
whereas<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.750> ragweed

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
whereas the ragweed

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.100 
whereas the ragweed
is<00:01:03.039> very<00:01:03.280> raggedy<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:04.030> leaves<00:01:04.269> are<00:01:04.479> deeply

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
is very raggedy the leaves are deeply

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.700 
is very raggedy the leaves are deeply
cut<00:01:05.530> deeply<00:01:06.070> lobed<00:01:06.369> in<00:01:06.909> this<00:01:07.720> way<00:01:07.990> other

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
cut deeply lobed in this way other

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.560 
cut deeply lobed in this way other
varieties<00:01:09.310> of<00:01:09.460> ragweed<00:01:09.670> as<00:01:10.000> well<00:01:10.210> but<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.510> is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
varieties of ragweed as well but this is

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.109 
varieties of ragweed as well but this is
the<00:01:10.780> predominant<00:01:11.549> structure<00:01:12.549> for<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.880> leaves

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
the predominant structure for the leaves

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.060 
the predominant structure for the leaves
and<00:01:13.479> of<00:01:13.570> course<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:14.200> flowers<00:01:14.650> are<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:14.890> big

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
and of course the flowers are the big

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.149 
and of course the flowers are the big
giveaway<00:01:15.990> goldenrod<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.200> red<00:01:17.530> we<00:01:17.799> both

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
giveaway goldenrod and red we both

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.880 
giveaway goldenrod and red we both
produce<00:01:18.520> large<00:01:19.090> quantities<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.930> pollen<00:01:20.500> the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
produce large quantities of pollen the

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.480 
produce large quantities of pollen the
big<00:01:21.159> difference<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:21.850> this<00:01:22.290> goldenrod

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
big difference is this goldenrod

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.370 
big difference is this goldenrod
produces<00:01:24.490> pollen<00:01:24.790> that<00:01:25.180> is<00:01:25.299> heavy<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:25.780> sticky

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
produces pollen that is heavy and sticky

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.680 
produces pollen that is heavy and sticky
because<00:01:27.340> goldenrod<00:01:27.909> is<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.119> plant<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.540> is

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
because goldenrod is a plant that is

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.680 
because goldenrod is a plant that is

ragweed on the other hand is what we

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.389 
ragweed on the other hand is what we

to blow around and thus they get inhaled

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.260 
to blow around and thus they get inhaled
by<00:01:43.630> people<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.710> some<00:01:45.369> people<00:01:45.700> have<00:01:45.880> allergic

by people and some people have allergic

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.930 
by people and some people have allergic
reaction<00:01:47.009> because<00:01:48.009> they<00:01:48.159> bloom<00:01:48.429> at<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.640> same

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
reaction because they bloom at the same

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.680 
reaction because they bloom at the same
time

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690
