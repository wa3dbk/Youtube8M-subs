00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.149 
already just like firing at this thing
but<00:01:36.360> yet<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:37.049> been<00:01:37.259> addressed<00:01:37.650> there<00:01:38.009> was<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
but yet it's been addressed there was a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.310 
but yet it's been addressed there was a
reason<00:01:38.520> for<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.810> reason<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
reason for this and the reason it is a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.870 
reason for this and the reason it is a
small<00:01:40.590> gap<00:01:40.799> appears<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> gap<00:01:41.850> is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
small gap appears that the gap is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.960 
small gap appears that the gap is
necessary<00:01:42.920> Manufacturing<00:01:43.920> feature<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.549> some

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
necessary Manufacturing feature and some

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.899 
necessary Manufacturing feature and some
minor<00:01:45.210> rocking<00:01:45.780> or<00:01:45.899> vibration<00:01:46.860> or<00:01:47.009> parts<00:01:47.670> may

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
minor rocking or vibration or parts may

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.870 
minor rocking or vibration or parts may
occur<00:01:48.270> over<00:01:48.960> time<00:01:48.990> friction<00:01:49.950> between<00:01:50.189> parts

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
occur over time friction between parts

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.300 
occur over time friction between parts
may<00:01:51.060> cause<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.659> gap<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.899> expand<00:01:52.680> slightly

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
may cause the gap to expand slightly

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.310 
may cause the gap to expand slightly
okay<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:55.610> it's<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:57.000> necessary<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.899> you

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
okay so it's it's necessary it's you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.780 
okay so it's it's necessary it's you
know<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> small<00:01:58.920> yacht<00:01:59.100> appears<00:01:59.369> around<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
know as a small yacht appears around the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.090 
know as a small yacht appears around the
outside<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> vice<00:02:00.450> KD<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.890> gap<00:02:02.070> is

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
outside of the vice KD and this gap is

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.510 
outside of the vice KD and this gap is
necessary<00:02:02.640> man<00:02:03.030> van

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
necessary man van

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.050 
necessary man van
yeah<00:02:03.789> it's<00:02:04.030> it's<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:06.009> nothing<00:02:06.399> big<00:02:06.549> it

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
know and you know the vibrations and

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.949 
know and you know the vibrations and
everything<00:02:12.610> like<00:02:12.700> they<00:02:12.819> address<00:02:13.150> i<00:02:13.180> mean<00:02:13.450> it's

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
everything like they address i mean it's

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.500 
everything like they address i mean it's
it's<00:02:14.709> nothing<00:02:15.099> to<00:02:15.250> gripe<00:02:15.700> about<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:16.180> really

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
this really shouldn't even be a

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.740 
this really shouldn't even be a
controversy<00:02:18.069> thing<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.459> mean<00:02:18.879> Ben<00:02:19.060> gate<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.510> one

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
controversy thing I mean Ben gate is one

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.199 
controversy thing I mean Ben gate is one
thing<00:02:19.989> this<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.349> just<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.650> gap<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.190> it's<00:02:21.970> kind<00:02:22.150> of

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
just it's a small little gap it's it's

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.430 
just it's a small little gap it's it's
it's<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.730> buffer<00:02:33.940> that's<00:02:34.480> what<00:02:34.690> i<00:02:34.720> say<00:02:34.930> it's<00:02:35.200> a

might<00:03:02.739> not<00:03:03.010> be<00:03:03.069> as<00:03:03.730> gimmicky<00:03:04.120> as<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.660> might

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
might not be as gimmicky as you might

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.020 
might not be as gimmicky as you might
think<00:03:04.840> because<00:03:05.200> Samsung<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.459> known<00:03:06.730> for<00:03:06.970> their

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030
