00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
and the 49ers just in case anything goes

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.060

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
think they need depth at that outside

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.040 
why he's a tough rugged scrappy player
maybe<00:05:30.730> not<00:05:31.000> as<00:05:31.120> talented<00:05:31.390> to<00:05:31.720> some<00:05:31.900> of<00:05:31.990> the

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
maybe not as talented to some of the

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.050 
maybe not as talented to some of the
better<00:05:32.260> centers<00:05:32.710> in<00:05:32.830> this<00:05:32.980> draft<00:05:33.310> but<00:05:33.790> I<00:05:33.850> think

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
better centers in this draft but I think

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.760 
better centers in this draft but I think
a<00:05:34.120> guy<00:05:34.270> that<00:05:34.300> could<00:05:34.570> be<00:05:34.660> coached<00:05:34.930> up<00:05:35.230> he'll<00:05:35.740> be

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
a guy that could be coached up he'll be

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.890 
a guy that could be coached up he'll be
coachable<00:05:36.310> and<00:05:36.730> those<00:05:37.240> are<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.450> kind<00:05:37.660> of<00:05:37.720> guys

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
I think is a good fit for them if they

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.740 
I think is a good fit for them if they
do<00:06:00.010> have<00:06:00.310> some<00:06:00.520> turnover<00:06:01.000> with<00:06:01.120> Mike<00:06:01.300> Adams

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
coming back from injury I think he can

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.580 
coming back from injury I think he can
be<00:06:06.340> a<00:06:06.370> guy<00:06:06.640> that<00:06:07.420> they<00:06:07.540> could<00:06:07.720> look<00:06:07.900> to<00:06:07.930> to

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
be a guy that they could look to to

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.560

the year after having a good start to

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
the year after having a good start to
the<00:06:37.780> season<00:06:38.050> a<00:06:38.380> guy<00:06:39.130> was

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
the season a guy was

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.590 
the season a guy was
to<00:06:39.830> pass<00:06:40.100> rusher<00:06:40.610> I<00:06:40.759> think<00:06:41.240> he's<00:06:41.330> going<00:06:41.479> to<00:06:41.539> be

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
to pass rusher I think he's going to be

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.659 
to pass rusher I think he's going to be
under<00:06:41.870> the<00:06:42.020> radar<00:06:42.229> here<00:06:42.830> because<00:06:43.400> of<00:06:43.550> his

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
under the radar here because of his

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.520 
under the radar here because of his
injuries<00:06:44.180> and<00:06:44.449> I<00:06:44.840> think<00:06:45.139> he<00:06:45.199> could<00:06:45.350> have<00:06:45.440> been

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
injuries and I think he could have been

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.860 
injuries and I think he could have been
