hi<00:00:01.260> again<00:00:01.290> we<00:00:01.740> are<00:00:01.860> now<00:00:02.010> finally<00:00:02.399> ready<00:00:02.790> for

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hi again we are now finally ready for

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.480 
hi again we are now finally ready for
takeoff<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:03.990> I'd<00:00:04.680> like<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:05.009> show<00:00:05.190> you<00:00:05.250> how

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
takeoff and I'd like to show you how

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.460 
takeoff and I'd like to show you how
this<00:00:05.670> can<00:00:05.879> be<00:00:05.940> done<00:00:06.180> without<00:00:06.420> any<00:00:06.750> joystick

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
this can be done without any joystick

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.330 
this can be done without any joystick
attached<00:00:07.950> just<00:00:08.610> by<00:00:08.849> FS<00:00:09.450> pilot<00:00:10.040> first<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.190> all

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
attached just by FS pilot first of all

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.450 
attached just by FS pilot first of all
we<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.570> modify<00:00:13.170> now<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.710> entries<00:00:14.280> here

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
we have to modify now the entries here

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.349 
we have to modify now the entries here
for<00:00:14.790> Speed<00:00:15.330> heading<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.550> altitude<00:00:17.550> and

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
for Speed heading and altitude and

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.310 
for Speed heading and altitude and
vertical<00:00:18.840> speed<00:00:19.080> for<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:21.439> speed<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:22.859> select

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
vertical speed for the speed we select

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.500 
vertical speed for the speed we select
220

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.110 

and<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.710> heading<00:00:32.040> will<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.430> current<00:00:32.910> heading

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
and the heading will be current heading

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.760 
and the heading will be current heading
81<00:00:33.840> degrees<00:00:34.320> vertical<00:00:35.310> speed<00:00:35.790> will<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.870> 1,500

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
81 degrees vertical speed will be 1,500

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.840 
81 degrees vertical speed will be 1,500
feet<00:00:37.920> per<00:00:38.130> minute<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.960> altitude<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.200> think<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
feet per minute and altitude I think is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.420 
feet per minute and altitude I think is
okay<00:00:41.850> about<00:00:42.090> 10,000<00:00:42.750> feet

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.100 

so<00:00:46.150> that's<00:00:46.390> not<00:00:46.570> all<00:00:46.780> set<00:00:47.050> correctly<00:00:49.110> next

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
so that's not all set correctly next

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.880 
so that's not all set correctly next
thing<00:00:50.290> is<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.500> switch<00:00:51.280> on<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.490> autopilot<00:00:52.030> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
thing is to switch on the autopilot and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.420 
thing is to switch on the autopilot and
to<00:00:54.120> select<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.520> rudder<00:00:58.980> symbol<00:00:59.980> which

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
to select here the rudder symbol which

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.619 
to select here the rudder symbol which
means<00:01:00.730> we<00:01:01.239> have<00:01:01.330> a<00:01:01.390> fixed-wing<00:01:01.900> aircraft<00:01:03.600> ok<00:01:04.600> I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
means we have a fixed-wing aircraft ok I

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.480 
means we have a fixed-wing aircraft ok I
think<00:01:04.839> we<00:01:05.020> can<00:01:05.229> now<00:01:05.379> start<00:01:05.710> first<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.190> all<00:01:06.369> we

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
think we can now start first of all we

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:19.480 
think we can now start first of all we
set<00:01:07.410> flaps<00:01:08.410> to<00:01:09.040> position<00:01:09.850> one<00:01:09.880> by<00:01:10.390> pressing<00:01:10.780> f7

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.180 

hmm

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
hmm

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.920 
hmm
f7<00:01:22.120> okay<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:23.830> you<00:01:23.980> look<00:01:24.220> now<00:01:24.430> here<00:01:25.150> is<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.540> see

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
f7 okay if you look now here is I see

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.300 
f7 okay if you look now here is I see
that<00:01:26.140> we<00:01:26.290> have<00:01:26.320> flaps<00:01:27.070> one<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.540> now<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.920> press

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
that we have flaps one and now we press

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.990 
that we have flaps one and now we press
speed<00:01:31.020> heading<00:01:32.020> out<00:01:32.680> and<00:01:33.190> level<00:01:34.000> or<00:01:34.360> together

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
speed heading out and level or together

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.300 
speed heading out and level or together
so<00:01:37.000> this<00:01:37.660> means<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.560> aircraft<00:01:39.070> will

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
so this means the aircraft will

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:52.670 
so this means the aircraft will
accelerate

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:02.840 

and<00:01:53.190> take<00:01:53.550> off

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.640 

the<00:02:03.390> only<00:02:03.570> thing<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.900> have<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> do<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.439> to

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
the only thing you have to do is to

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.600 
the only thing you have to do is to
retract<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.430> gear<00:02:05.700> by<00:02:06.689> pressing<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.350> G<00:02:07.610> on

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
retract the gear by pressing the G on

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.250 
retract the gear by pressing the G on
the<00:02:08.670> keyboard

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:23.940 

and<00:02:12.860> enjoy<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.430> nice<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.620> nice<00:02:15.799> vision

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.130 

you'll<00:02:24.580> see<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.849> it<00:02:25.030> takes<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.690> little<00:02:25.810> time

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
you'll see that it takes a little time

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.380 
you'll see that it takes a little time
until<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:27.750> autopilot<00:02:28.750> will<00:02:29.050> adjust<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
until the autopilot will adjust to the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.160 
until the autopilot will adjust to the
vertical<00:02:31.390> speed<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.050> we<00:02:32.260> have<00:02:32.580> given<00:02:34.170> that's

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
vertical speed that we have given that's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.650 
vertical speed that we have given that's
also<00:02:35.410> because<00:02:36.150> there's<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.269> little<00:02:37.390> bit<00:02:37.599> of

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
also because there's a little bit of

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.640 
also because there's a little bit of
over<00:02:38.319> speed<00:02:39.599> we<00:02:40.599> reach<00:02:40.810> right<00:02:41.050> now<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.290> flaps

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
over speed we reach right now the flaps

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.150 
over speed we reach right now the flaps
by<00:02:41.890> pressing<00:02:42.370> f5

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.000 

and<00:02:48.400> here<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.270> can<00:02:49.450> see<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.920> have<00:02:51.060> now<00:02:53.010> 220

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
and here you can see we have now 220

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.100 
and here you can see we have now 220
knots<00:02:54.330> 20<00:02:55.330> 25<00:02:55.900> 24<00:02:56.890> going<00:02:57.430> down<00:02:57.640> 220<00:02:58.270> 220<00:02:58.870> 0<00:02:59.290> and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
knots 20 25 24 going down 220 220 0 and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.180 
knots 20 25 24 going down 220 220 0 and
already<00:03:03.720> adjusting<00:03:04.720> our<00:03:04.960> two<00:03:05.260> vertical<00:03:05.950> speed

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
already adjusting our two vertical speed

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.020 
already adjusting our two vertical speed
of<00:03:06.780> 1,500<00:03:07.780> feet<00:03:08.490> if<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.610> want<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.910> increase

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
of 1,500 feet if you want to increase

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.220 
of 1,500 feet if you want to increase
this<00:03:10.480> just<00:03:10.930> press<00:03:11.320> up<00:03:11.970> for<00:03:12.970> example<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:14.130> 2,500

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
this just press up for example to 2,500

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.330 
this just press up for example to 2,500
to<00:03:17.230> have<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> steeper<00:03:18.130> client

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
to have a steeper client

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.690 
to have a steeper client
ok<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.120> pause<00:03:21.420> know<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.930> recording<00:03:22.560> until<00:03:22.980> we

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
ok I pause know the recording until we

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.700 
ok I pause know the recording until we
have<00:03:24.200> reached<00:03:25.200> our<00:03:26.540> 10,000<00:03:27.540> feet

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:35.700 

so<00:03:30.460> we<00:03:31.150> are<00:03:31.270> now<00:03:31.420> climbing<00:03:32.970> at<00:03:33.970> about<00:03:34.710> 8,000

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
so we are now climbing at about 8,000

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.870 
so we are now climbing at about 8,000
feet<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.870> in<00:03:37.870> some<00:03:38.170> moments<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:39.250> think<00:03:39.640> we<00:03:39.790> will

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
feet and in some moments I think we will

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.620 
feet and in some moments I think we will
reach<00:03:40.090> 10,000<00:03:41.020> feet<00:03:42.480> but<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.510> can<00:03:43.750> show<00:03:43.960> you<00:03:45.630> how

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
reach 10,000 feet but I can show you how

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.370 
reach 10,000 feet but I can show you how
we<00:03:46.690> modify<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:48.160> aircraft<00:03:48.670> heading<00:03:49.170> if<00:03:50.170> you

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
we modify the aircraft heading if you

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.820 
we modify the aircraft heading if you
click<00:03:50.680> right<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.600> modify<00:03:52.600> here<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.140> target
