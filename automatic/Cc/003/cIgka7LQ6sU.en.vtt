 means this good that is designed 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.750

 mercenaries who are randomly in 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.560
 what is your game in online mode 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.780
 to achieve what is the glory in the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.850

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.480
 the robberies and good hopefully it gets well 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.000
 ok we'll wait to see what 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.650
 they say at the end of 2014 they are also going to 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.200

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.910

 and a new dlc for the story mode that 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.480
 is going to impact this is going to be fine 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.019
 well chingón hopefully they put a part of what 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.670
 that was gta 4 to see how it is put and not 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.079
 well, something that I found very curious 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.519
 it was a recent update that 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.079
 solves a problem related to 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.660
 handling of motorcycles and bicycles 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.160
 when they were in the air at the end 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.590
 it turned out that many of the members of the 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.900
 acrobatics community of gta 5 se 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.150
 They were disappointed to discover that 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.130
 this arrangement made certain tricks and 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.900
 popular stunts were virtually 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.239
 impossible with what rockstar games 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.419
 decided to restore the original physics 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.209
 of motorcycles and bikes in the air 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:23.699
 in the next update of the game 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.990
 rockstar games announced that you're good 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:27.200
 that would be open 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.430
 certain clichés that were not 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.290
 intended in the game if the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.210
 players enjoy them and not 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.520
 caused no negative impact on what 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.950
 which was the gameplay or if it does not cause 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.840
 no unfair situation would leave them 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.860
 I liked that very much because of the account 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.660
 what they are doing is that 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.250
 they are not going to be bothering you so much 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.250
 will be like ken without - by all 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.440
 time they will leave certain clichés and if 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.120
 they see that people like good handles 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.680
 so that they continue having fun continue 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.680
 doing things but good the most 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.080
 important thing about this DLCI is that good 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.650
 comes what is the powerful bull rifle or 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.540
 the new costume items not this one 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.100
 also the motorcycle dincap trot and three 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.590
 among them, well 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.720
 the pegasys superclass environment and good 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.160
 a variety of things not also 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.810
