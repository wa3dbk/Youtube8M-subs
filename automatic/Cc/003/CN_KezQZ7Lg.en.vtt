00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.280 

so<00:00:05.220> here<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.609> am<00:00:05.819> in<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.420> London<00:00:06.839> vision<00:00:07.109> clinic

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
so here I am in the London vision clinic

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.490 
so here I am in the London vision clinic
and<00:00:07.680> finally<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.820> moment<00:00:09.000> has<00:00:09.360> come<00:00:10.050> where<00:00:10.469> I

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
and finally the moment has come where I

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.770 
and finally the moment has come where I
am<00:00:10.620> going<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.219> take<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.670> plunge<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.269> have<00:00:12.509> my

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
am going to take the plunge and have my

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.169 
am going to take the plunge and have my
eyes<00:00:12.960> lasered<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.799> worn<00:00:14.130> glasses<00:00:14.309> for<00:00:14.790> years

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
eyes lasered have worn glasses for years

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.109 
eyes lasered have worn glasses for years
and<00:00:15.450> been<00:00:16.230> really<00:00:16.770> bad<00:00:17.070> at<00:00:17.430> wearing<00:00:17.940> them

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
and been really bad at wearing them

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.269 
and been really bad at wearing them
purely<00:00:18.840> because<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.140> vanity<00:00:19.470> I've<00:00:19.920> decided

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
purely because of vanity I've decided

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.040 
purely because of vanity I've decided
the<00:00:20.609> time<00:00:20.730> has<00:00:20.939> come<00:00:20.970> for<00:00:21.449> me<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.810> able<00:00:21.960> to

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the time has come for me to be able to

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.259 
the time has come for me to be able to
see<00:00:22.199> properly<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.980> very<00:00:23.400> soon<00:00:23.640> I'll<00:00:23.910> be<00:00:23.970> able

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
see properly so very soon I'll be able

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.109 
see properly so very soon I'll be able
to<00:00:24.390> see<00:00:24.600> far<00:00:25.019> into<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.560> distance<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:26.160> went

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
to see far into the distance I went

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.660 
to see far into the distance I went
through<00:00:27.269> more<00:00:27.599> rigorous<00:00:27.900> checks<00:00:28.550> for<00:00:29.550> this

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
through more rigorous checks for this

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.299 
through more rigorous checks for this
operation<00:00:30.240> than<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.170> did<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
operation than I think I did for the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.130 
operation than I think I did for the
birth<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.669> my<00:00:32.730> child<00:00:33.030> which<00:00:33.540> from<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:33.719> point<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
birth of my child which from my point of

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.410 
birth of my child which from my point of
view<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.530> course<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.980> incredibly<00:00:35.700> reassuring

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
view of course is incredibly reassuring

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.869 
view of course is incredibly reassuring
because<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.870> means<00:00:37.110> every<00:00:37.829> single<00:00:38.190> aspect<00:00:38.370> of

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
because it means every single aspect of

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.940 
because it means every single aspect of
my<00:00:39.300> vision<00:00:39.660> has<00:00:39.809> been<00:00:39.989> checked<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.500> assessed

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
my vision has been checked and assessed

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.580 
my vision has been checked and assessed
and<00:00:41.340> I'm<00:00:42.030> deemed<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.450> be<00:00:42.540> suitable<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.320> that's

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
and I'm deemed to be suitable so that's

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.319 
and I'm deemed to be suitable so that's
really<00:00:43.860> reassuring<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.760> at<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> moment

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
really reassuring and at the moment

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.850 
really reassuring and at the moment
actually<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.629> feel<00:00:45.930> really<00:00:46.170> relaxed<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
actually I feel really relaxed and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.619 
actually I feel really relaxed and
because<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.489> think<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.000> probably<00:00:48.329> gonna

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
because I think this is probably gonna

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.080 
because I think this is probably gonna
change<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:49.140> life<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:50.129> procedure<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.730> pixie

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
change my life the procedure that pixie

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.060 
change my life the procedure that pixie
had<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.840> called<00:00:52.170> LASIK<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.010> been

after the tissue has been evaporated to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
after the tissue has been evaporated to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
create the new shape the flap is

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.780 
create the new shape the flap is
replaced<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.830> course<00:01:19.860> seals<00:01:20.400> down

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
replaced and that of course seals down

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.490 
replaced and that of course seals down
and<00:01:21.119> everything's<00:01:21.420> sealed<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and everything's sealed up in it and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.320 
and everything's sealed up in it and
people<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:22.979> basically<00:01:23.220> back<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.909> normal<00:01:24.240> at

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
people are basically back to normal at

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.240 
people are basically back to normal at
that<00:01:24.509> point<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.170> what<00:01:25.409> she's<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> sense

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that point so what she's going to sense

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.690 
that point so what she's going to sense
is<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:27.330> now<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> world<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.409> HD<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:29.460> long

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
is that now the world is in HD as long

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.429 
is that now the world is in HD as long
as<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:29.909> someone<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.210> turned<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.900> focusing

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
as if someone just turned the focusing

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.770 
as if someone just turned the focusing
knob<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.890> made<00:01:32.490> everything<00:01:32.790> crystal<00:01:33.540> clear

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
knob and made everything crystal clear

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
knob and made everything crystal clear
she'll<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.170> seeing<00:01:34.500> things<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.520> she<00:01:35.790> never

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
she'll be seeing things that she never

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.660 
she'll be seeing things that she never
paid<00:01:36.600> attention<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.140> before<00:01:37.320> Wow

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
paid attention to before Wow

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
paid attention to before Wow
I<00:01:39.409> mean<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.890> what's<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.750> see<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.960> 20

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
I mean I can see what's up see that 20

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.980 
I mean I can see what's up see that 20
minutes<00:01:43.890> ago<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.310> was<00:01:44.579> sat<00:01:44.790> here<00:01:45.090> awaiting<00:01:45.570> my

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
minutes ago I was sat here awaiting my

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.100 
minutes ago I was sat here awaiting my
laser<00:01:46.439> eye<00:01:46.590> surgery<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:48.420> I've<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.780> had<00:01:48.990> this

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
laser eye surgery and I've just had this

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.039 
laser eye surgery and I've just had this
it<00:01:49.560> wasn't<00:01:49.770> painful<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.850> wasn't<00:01:51.240> scary<00:01:51.570> I

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
it wasn't painful it wasn't scary I
