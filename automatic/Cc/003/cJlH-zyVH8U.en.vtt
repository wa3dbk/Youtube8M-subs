what<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.130> do<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.640> come<00:01:50.850> along<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.149> sit

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
what they do is they come along and sit

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
what they do is they come along and sit
on<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> surface<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.350> they<00:01:52.560> break<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.159> bonds

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
on the surface and they break the bonds

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.370

between<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.000> dead<00:01:54.149> skin<00:01:54.450> cells<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.020> that

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
between the dead skin cells so that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.380 
between the dead skin cells so that
those<00:01:55.710> dead<00:01:56.070> skin<00:01:56.250> cells<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.880> then<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.240> be

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
those dead skin cells can then just be

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.800 
those dead skin cells can then just be
wiped<00:01:57.659> away<00:01:57.899> gently<00:01:58.460> there<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.549> fantastic

product<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.019> my<00:02:32.139> salon<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.739> because<00:02:33.189> we<00:02:33.370> had<00:02:34.239> so

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
product in my salon is because we had so

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.780 
product in my salon is because we had so
many<00:02:34.659> applications<00:02:35.200> it's<00:02:36.010> really<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.489> must

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
many applications it's really a must

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.610 
many applications it's really a must
have<00:02:37.030> product<00:02:37.299> for<00:02:37.599> nearly<00:02:37.780> every<00:02:38.109> skin<00:02:38.379> type

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.360 
have product for nearly every skin type
and<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:40.000> will<00:02:40.540> dissolve<00:02:41.500> John<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.219> dead

surface<00:02:42.819> also<00:02:43.109> retexturize<00:02:44.109> as<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.439> skin<00:02:44.709> and

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
surface also retexturize as the skin and

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.319 
surface also retexturize as the skin and
what<00:02:45.099> that<00:02:45.250> means<00:02:45.489> is<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:45.730> if<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.090> imagine

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
what that means is that if you imagine

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.210 
what that means is that if you imagine
the<00:02:46.599> skin<00:02:46.870> surface<00:02:47.139> coming<00:02:47.590> along<00:02:47.859> and<00:02:48.040> having

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
the skin surface coming along and having

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.699 
the skin surface coming along and having
so<00:02:48.879> we've<00:02:49.030> got<00:02:49.180> open<00:02:49.480> pores<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.079> so<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.470> skin

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
so we've got open pores and so the skin

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.580 
so we've got open pores and so the skin
surface<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.340> quite<00:02:51.669> uneven<00:02:52.510> now<00:02:53.139> if<00:02:53.230> we<00:02:53.439> can

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
surface is quite uneven now if we can

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.050 
surface is quite uneven now if we can
come<00:02:53.769> along<00:02:54.040> with<00:02:54.069> something<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:54.669> dissolve

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
come along with something and dissolve

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.170 
come along with something and dissolve
away<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.480> surface<00:02:55.720> they<00:02:56.230> met<00:02:56.439> pore<00:02:56.799> edge<00:02:57.639> is

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
away the surface they met pore edge is

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.990 
away the surface they met pore edge is
quite<00:02:58.540> softened<00:02:59.469> and<00:02:59.769> refined<00:03:00.219> and<00:03:00.549> then<00:03:00.700> meet

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
quite softened and refined and then meet

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.629 
quite softened and refined and then meet
and<00:03:01.209> very<00:03:01.659> very<00:03:01.930> quickly<00:03:02.260> we<00:03:02.980> reduce<00:03:03.400> the

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
and very very quickly we reduce the

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.819 
and very very quickly we reduce the
appearance<00:03:03.939> of<00:03:04.299> those<00:03:04.510> ports<00:03:05.109> or<00:03:05.349> thus<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.799> the

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
size of those pores because we're

have a lot of oil just fear then this is
definitely<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.919> must<00:03:30.220> because<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.760> will<00:03:30.879> get

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
definitely a must because it will get

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.300 
definitely a must because it will get
your<00:03:31.180> bacteria<00:03:31.599> levels<00:03:31.930> under<00:03:32.349> control<00:03:32.379> but

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
your bacteria levels under control but

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.039 
your bacteria levels under control but
it<00:03:33.400> will<00:03:33.459> also<00:03:33.639> hydrate<00:03:34.359> your<00:03:34.449> skin<00:03:34.510> because

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
it will also hydrate your skin because

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.379 
it will also hydrate your skin because
lactic<00:03:35.409> acid<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:35.889> a<00:03:35.919> fantastic<00:03:36.609> hydrator

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
lactic acid is a fantastic hydrator

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.149 
lactic acid is a fantastic hydrator
it's<00:03:37.780> found<00:03:37.959> naturally<00:03:38.470> within<00:03:38.709> your<00:03:38.889> skin

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
it's found naturally within your skin

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.020 
it's found naturally within your skin
and<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.400> binds<00:03:39.639> water<00:03:39.939> to<00:03:40.150> itself<00:03:40.659> so<00:03:41.729> it's<00:03:42.729> a

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
and it binds water to itself so it's a

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.679 
and it binds water to itself so it's a
great<00:03:43.449> way<00:03:43.659> to<00:03:43.689> get<00:03:44.049> though<00:03:44.229> deep<00:03:44.680> layers

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
great way to get though deep layers

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.390 
great way to get though deep layers
better<00:03:46.689> hydrated<00:03:46.989> so<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.680> water<00:03:47.859> content

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
better hydrated so the water content

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.429 
better hydrated so the water content
gets<00:03:48.819> lifted<00:03:49.299> in<00:03:49.419> the<00:03:49.509> deeper<00:03:49.840> layers<00:03:49.870> and

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
gets lifted in the deeper layers and

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.559 
gets lifted in the deeper layers and
then<00:03:51.129> the<00:03:51.250> skin<00:03:51.519> goes<00:03:51.699> oh<00:03:51.909> wow<00:03:52.120> we've<00:03:52.389> got

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
then the skin goes oh wow we've got

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.689 
then the skin goes oh wow we've got
enough<00:03:52.780> moisture<00:03:52.959> down<00:03:53.409> here<00:03:53.739> perhaps<00:03:54.099> we<00:03:54.489> can

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
enough moisture down here perhaps we can

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.629 
enough moisture down here perhaps we can
safely<00:03:54.939> stop<00:03:55.449> over<00:03:55.840> producing<00:03:56.349> oil<00:03:56.530> now<00:03:56.829> it's

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
safely stop over producing oil now it's

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.759 
safely stop over producing oil now it's
a<00:03:57.790> good<00:03:57.939> tyrosinase<00:03:58.569> inhibitor<00:03:59.229> that's<00:03:59.530> one

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
a good tyrosinase inhibitor that's one

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.379 
a good tyrosinase inhibitor that's one
of<00:03:59.889> the<00:04:00.009> enzymes<00:04:00.189> that<00:04:00.579> goes<00:04:00.879> into<00:04:01.239> making

is light reflective it's not necessarily

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.480 
is light reflective it's not necessarily
thin<00:05:12.360> but<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.080> layers<00:05:13.320> are<00:05:13.590> nice<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:14.010> family
