you were to use something like the Mac

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.799 
you were to use something like the Mac
239<00:00:55.949> brush<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.789> would<00:00:56.969> pack<00:00:57.270> more<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.660> the

eyeshadow<00:00:58.230> onto<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.100> lid<00:00:59.280> you'd<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.609> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
eyeshadow onto the lid you'd get a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.369 
eyeshadow onto the lid you'd get a
little<00:00:59.730> bit<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.059> darker<00:01:00.390> look<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.260> can
