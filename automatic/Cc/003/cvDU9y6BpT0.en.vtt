00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
your subdivisions 25 there we go all

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.660 
your subdivisions 25 there we go all
right<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.380> let's<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.340> create<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> new

colors back to the default and what I'm
designing<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.189> usually<00:02:05.610> will<00:02:06.420> design<00:02:06.780> my

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
designing I usually will design my

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
designing I usually will design my
banner<00:02:07.680> or<00:02:08.039> your<00:02:08.700> header<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.229 
banner or your header of the
site<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:10.660> 900<00:02:11.379> pixels<00:02:11.830> wide<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.400> find<00:02:13.150> that

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
site to 900 pixels wide I find that

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.930 
site to 900 pixels wide I find that
being<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:14.290> perfect<00:02:14.769> width<00:02:15.040> for<00:02:15.370> most

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
being the perfect width for most

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.470 
being the perfect width for most
browsers<00:02:16.090> nowadays<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.670> once<00:02:18.849> we've<00:02:19.030> selected

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
browsers nowadays so once we've selected

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.180 
browsers nowadays so once we've selected
something<00:02:19.959> that's<00:02:20.110> about<00:02:20.260> 900<00:02:20.739> pixels<00:02:21.069> wide

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
something that's about 900 pixels wide

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.490 
something that's about 900 pixels wide
and<00:02:21.250> about<00:02:21.819> 150<00:02:22.660> pixels<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:24.730> know<00:02:24.879> tall<00:02:25.690> let's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
and about 150 pixels you know tall let's

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.589 
and about 150 pixels you know tall let's
go<00:02:26.560> ahead<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.799> fill<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:26.980> in<00:02:27.129> hit<00:02:28.120> option

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
go ahead and fill that in hit option

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.170 
go ahead and fill that in hit option
delete<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:31.319> yeah<00:02:32.319> so<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.980> then<00:02:33.370> obviously<00:02:33.489> on

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
delete and yeah so and then obviously on

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.610 
delete and yeah so and then obviously on
your<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.810> website<00:02:35.260> you're<00:02:35.379> designing

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
your on the website you're designing

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.289 
your on the website you're designing
you're<00:02:35.830> going<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.010> be<00:02:36.099> creating<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.819> main<00:02:37.060> real

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
you're going to be creating a main real

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.410 
you're going to be creating a main real
estate<00:02:37.629> for<00:02:37.840> whatever<00:02:38.290> you're<00:02:38.410> selling<00:02:38.860> or

dis<00:02:40.420> flowing<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.140> there's<00:02:41.590> my<00:02:41.739> main<00:02:42.010> article

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
dis flowing so there's my main article

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.339 
dis flowing so there's my main article
I'd<00:02:42.730> be<00:02:42.849> designing<00:02:43.180> go<00:02:43.959> ahead<00:02:44.079> and<00:02:44.170> fill<00:02:44.319> that

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
I'd be designing go ahead and fill that

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.180 
I'd be designing go ahead and fill that
in<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.890> then<00:02:44.980> let's<00:02:45.849> say<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.739> website

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
in and then let's say the the website

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.339 
in and then let's say the the website
needs<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.610> sign<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.420> or<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:50.220> newsletter<00:02:51.220> signup

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
needs a sign in or a newsletter signup

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.500 
needs a sign in or a newsletter signup
there's<00:02:53.349> that<00:02:53.849> let's<00:02:54.849> go<00:02:55.000> ahead<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.269> create

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
there's that let's go ahead and create

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.100 
there's that let's go ahead and create
some<00:02:55.720> sub<00:02:55.989> articles<00:02:57.209> for<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.360> website<00:02:58.840> and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
some sub articles for this website and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.619 
some sub articles for this website and
see<00:03:02.129> about<00:03:03.129> here<00:03:03.700> we'll<00:03:03.910> cut<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.180> off<00:03:06.629> and

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
see about here we'll cut it off and

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.970 
see about here we'll cut it off and
about<00:03:08.290> here<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.959> then<00:03:11.319> let's<00:03:11.709> go<00:03:11.769> ahead<00:03:11.860> and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
about here and then let's go ahead and

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.090 
about here and then let's go ahead and
add<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.670> flutter<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.120> finish<00:03:13.389> it<00:03:13.510> off<00:03:17.100> and

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
add the flutter to finish it off and

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.580 
add the flutter to finish it off and
then<00:03:18.299> just<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.569> make<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.959> little<00:03:20.139> more<00:03:20.230> sexy

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
then just to make it a little more sexy

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.199 
then just to make it a little more sexy
let's<00:03:20.980> go<00:03:21.130> ahead<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.400> go<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.549> your<00:03:21.670> layer<00:03:21.940> mode

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
let's go ahead and go to your layer mode

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.870 
let's go ahead and go to your layer mode
turn<00:03:23.049> our<00:03:23.200> multiply<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:24.069> I<00:03:24.370> like<00:03:24.519> to<00:03:24.639> have<00:03:24.760> it

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
turn our multiply and I like to have it

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.710 
turn our multiply and I like to have it
about<00:03:25.120> thirty<00:03:25.480> percent<00:03:26.880> then<00:03:27.880> wants<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.299> back

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720

a little more organized now and this is
something<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:32.739> you'd<00:03:32.920> be<00:03:33.040> able<00:03:33.099> to<00:03:33.220> design

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
something that you'd be able to design

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.020 
something that you'd be able to design
in<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:34.709> yeah<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:36.190> hopefully<00:03:36.519> this<00:03:36.670> helps<00:03:36.940> you
