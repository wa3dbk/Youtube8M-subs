jerrycans
the<00:01:14.250> reason<00:01:14.429> why<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.550> want<00:01:14.729> jerrycans<00:01:15.179> is

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.180 
the reason why I want jerrycans is
because<00:01:15.539> if<00:01:15.660> you<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.410> see<00:01:16.860> how<00:01:17.009> that

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
because if you can see here see how that

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.100 
because if you can see here see how that
is<00:01:17.429> expanded<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.720> gets<00:01:18.840> hot<00:01:19.080> in

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
is expanded it's because it gets hot in

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.680 
is expanded it's because it gets hot in
Florida<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.039> since<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.700> gets<00:01:20.820> hot<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.030> Florida

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
Florida and since it gets hot in Florida

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.010 
Florida and since it gets hot in Florida
it<00:01:22.020> tends<00:01:22.410> to<00:01:22.910> you<00:01:23.910> know<00:01:24.030> expand<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> little<00:01:24.899> bit

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
it tends to you know expand a little bit

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.990 
it tends to you know expand a little bit
now<00:01:25.229> don't<00:01:25.410> get<00:01:25.470> me<00:01:25.590> wrong<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:26.280> easy<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.700> it's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
now don't get me wrong it's easy to it's

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.719 
now don't get me wrong it's easy to it's
an<00:01:27.060> easy<00:01:27.270> fix<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:37.160> smell<00:01:38.160> for<00:01:38.489> a<00:01:38.520> little

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
an easy fix you just smell for a little

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.800 
an easy fix you just smell for a little
while<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.179> not<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.390> big<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.569> a<00:01:39.660> deal

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
while but it's not that big of a deal

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.830 
while but it's not that big of a deal
and<00:01:40.050> then<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.410> no<00:01:40.890> longer<00:01:40.920> as<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:42.239> tough<00:01:42.630> but

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and then it's no longer as as tough but

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080 
and then it's no longer as as tough but
quite<00:01:43.560> honestly<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:44.130> definitely<00:01:44.849> want<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> get

quite honestly I definitely want to get
a<00:01:45.149> jerrican<00:01:45.660> I<00:01:45.690> think<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> jury<00:01:46.080> can<00:01:46.289> be<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.470> lot

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
a jerrican I think a jury can be a lot

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.419 
a jerrican I think a jury can be a lot
better<00:01:47.000> another<00:01:48.000> thing<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.179> keep<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:49.250> some<00:01:50.250> type

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
better another thing I keep is some type

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.820 
better another thing I keep is some type
of<00:01:50.459> ground<00:01:50.849> cloth<00:01:51.119> now<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:51.569> one<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.989> left

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
of ground cloth now this one is left

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.859 
of ground cloth now this one is left
over<00:01:52.979> from<00:01:53.099> winter<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:54.509> thing<00:01:54.660> about<00:01:54.750> getting

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
over from winter I'm thing about getting

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.389 
over from winter I'm thing about getting
a<00:01:55.080> tarp<00:01:55.319> and<00:01:55.440> putting<00:01:55.679> it<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.069> large

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
a tarp and putting it in here a large

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.449 
a tarp and putting it in here a large
tarp<00:01:56.929> probably<00:01:57.929> a<00:01:57.959> canvas<00:01:58.349> tarp<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.220> reason

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
tarp probably a canvas tarp the reason

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:00.620 
tarp probably a canvas tarp the reason
being<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.700> because<00:01:59.849> not<00:02:00.119> only<00:02:00.179> could<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.479> be

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
being is because not only could it be

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.540 
being is because not only could it be
ground<00:02:00.840> cover<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.440> could<00:02:01.619> also<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.890> shelter

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
ground cover it could also be shelter

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.660 
ground cover it could also be shelter
and<00:02:02.670> that's<00:02:02.789> very<00:02:03.000> important<00:02:03.950> this<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.280> just

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
and that's very important this is just

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.400 
and that's very important this is just
basically<00:02:06.239> sometimes<00:02:06.539> my<00:02:07.020> daughter<00:02:07.200> gets

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
basically sometimes my daughter gets

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.139 
basically sometimes my daughter gets
cold<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.830> winter<00:02:08.039> or<00:02:08.160> something<00:02:08.459> while

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
cold in the winter or something while

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.309 
cold in the winter or something while

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
putting snacks and small water bottles

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.959 
putting snacks and small water bottles
in<00:05:19.599> here<00:05:19.780> as<00:05:19.870> well<00:05:20.069> instead<00:05:21.069> of<00:05:21.250> just<00:05:21.370> a<00:05:21.610> gallon

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:21.969 
in here as well instead of just a gallon

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.230 
in here as well instead of just a gallon
reason<00:05:22.479> being<00:05:22.599> is<00:05:22.810> because<00:05:23.909> sometimes<00:05:24.909> you

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
reason being is because sometimes you

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.209 
reason being is because sometimes you
just<00:05:25.449> you<00:05:25.870> don't<00:05:26.379> want<00:05:26.620> to<00:05:26.680> drink<00:05:26.830> an<00:05:26.949> entire

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
just you don't want to drink an entire

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:31.050 
just you don't want to drink an entire
gallon<00:05:29.069> but<00:05:30.069> the<00:05:30.159> more<00:05:30.340> water<00:05:30.520> you<00:05:30.639> have<00:05:30.909> the

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
gallon but the more water you have the

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.029 
gallon but the more water you have the
better<00:05:31.210> it<00:05:31.300> is<00:05:31.419> and<00:05:31.719> I<00:05:31.960> can't<00:05:32.229> fit<00:05:32.560> a<00:05:32.590> second

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
better it is and I can't fit a second

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.649 
better it is and I can't fit a second
gallon<00:05:33.310> in<00:05:33.400> there<00:05:33.550> I<00:05:33.580> could<00:05:33.729> only<00:05:33.849> fit<00:05:34.120> one<00:05:34.150> so

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
gallon in there I could only fit one so

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:37.379 
gallon in there I could only fit one so
I<00:05:34.870> figure<00:05:35.319> I'll<00:05:35.770> put<00:05:36.069> some<00:05:36.669> small<00:05:36.940> bottles<00:05:37.270> in

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389
