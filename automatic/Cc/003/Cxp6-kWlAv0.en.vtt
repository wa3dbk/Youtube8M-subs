00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.800
 of people who wanted to ask me that and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.170

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.110
 by the way lately you're getting 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.510
 remember there were veins in the neck 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.920
 the bone for the shield so full of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.390
 world that forms the dungeon and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.540
 start all so at the end of the dungeon there 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.650
 gives more cool dacquoise and of which there are 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.790

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.530
 full of people you want but the headdress and 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.630
 in hd therefore necessarily the prices they 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.010
 drop so that's so we're going to hdd 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.210
 tailor do not worry it's not 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.800
 at all the goal it's not fears and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.720
 not the drops is not the dungeon trustee 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.050
 do not worry then hat 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.610
 we will see the price of the caps and 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.840

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:21.110
 in comic the crossa then I put the runes 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.820
 I helped in because it's a 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.930
 little that the loot is the runes so I 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.869
 do not know if you guessed 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.030
 so hat and I can tell you that it 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.290
 reports something crazy people I 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.580
 promise it's huge 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.110
 I was really happy elsewhere 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.540
 he was booed when there were sales 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.880
 so wait for a city â€‹â€‹yeah it works 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.320
 even for hoods so does not 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.210
 just too much at the headdress 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.970
 we will try already with the headdress so 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.890
 we will take a try to see the price the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.630
 below for the jay the best I have 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.900
 you want to have the game back 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.670
 take that 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.060
 49 49 me so that's the one it's good 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.360
 better 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.540
 and then I take that here it is perfect 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.060
 so I took 40 so saying 90000 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.590
 more so to vote on 139 cases badly for 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.820
 the moment I wasted to take 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.310
 three teachers blow so then to 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.380
 the attacked forges tribute 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.610
 hop I promise you it's she knew 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.989
 what I wanted to propose to the thousand 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.540
 subscribers but well then we go 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.980
 break all that etc so that's it I think 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.650
 that you have already understood a man who 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.769
 have left the video 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:32.620
 so here is broken so a cap taken 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:36.349
 and another time I want to break it or s 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.480
 that's the broken breeze the other one and that's it 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:43.690
 I broke everything so we'll take the 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:48.799
 three boom boom pushed so that's it 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:53.660
 climbed 16 not empty of ideas remains so to 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:56.260
 see immediately in the workshop and we will 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:02.480
 see right away what we won so 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:04.090
 that yes so that's 33 setting so I jump 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.310
 on the super calculator list 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:13.580
 mohamed no shit what's that rabbit 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:20.230
 calculator so that's 5 ghazi so 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:24.620
 it's thirty 3033 1908 x 5 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.480
 it's about 169000 kama bone so that's 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.370
 stand up and on one side then we will see 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:36.400
 pavie so that's it we have 10 so 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:40.519
 it's about more 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.310
 so give us that +16 plus there is 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.850
 believed a pavie so that's 3000 times 6 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.569
 over 3000 more so we will do more 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:54.599
 3000 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:57.269
 plus 3000 plus 3000 plus 3000 plus 3000 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.129
 plus 3000 +3 I think it's still 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.439
 an issue of another but good then 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:04.049
 so that rfe so have a little bit 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:09.450
 how much is it worth a ray and fire so that you 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:17.430
 3000k wafir me more than 3500 kama more 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:23.759
 was waiting and father fire so that makes 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:29.520
 3000 so that's 6200 plus 6200 that's it 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:31.110
 is we still defiance ripert is this 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.680
 that it's neutrals its neutral whip 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.820
 so we have five knots that's about 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.370
 8000 plus mimile equals 2139 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.849
 millecam to for how much purchase I said 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.539
 for forty thousand 40 me so what 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:50.910
 already made 90 miles and 90000 more kf 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.289
 40000 so what is 130 miles and there 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.159
 it's 230 me so it's a huge 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.620
 benefit this is my tip is mine 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:00.720
 on the other hand profit benefited these 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.979
 last time so so because there is 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.020
 full of people who made the dungeon with 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.550
 the with the veins flows as cool to 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.840
 self is its color so what had to 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.370
 full of people who already made me I 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.810
 have not come across a lot of delighted for 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.570

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.699
 will have to leave the maximum of lake and 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.840
 do not expect I 'm waiting 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.820
 especially not that I do tricks 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.199
 every day already I think it's 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.940
 the last because I did not think 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.500
