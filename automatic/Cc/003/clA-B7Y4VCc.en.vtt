00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
reviewing the center control s2 this

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.480 
reviewing the center control s2 this
will<00:01:14.539> be<00:01:14.660> a<00:01:14.690> very<00:01:15.020> in-depth<00:01:15.560> review<00:01:15.979> so<00:01:16.250> just

will be a very in-depth review so just

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.070 
will be a very in-depth review so just
keep<00:01:16.970> your<00:01:17.000> eyes<00:01:17.149> out<00:01:17.479> for<00:01:17.509> that<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:17.959> would

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
keep your eyes out for that that would

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.770 
keep your eyes out for that that would
be<00:01:18.200> within<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.500> next<00:01:18.740> couple<00:01:19.100> weeks<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.780> this

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
be within the next couple weeks and this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.889 
be within the next couple weeks and this
is<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.280> actual<00:01:22.280> deck<00:01:22.640> saver<00:01:22.940> that<00:01:23.509> fits

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
is the actual deck saver that fits

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.359 
is the actual deck saver that fits
directly<00:01:24.470> over<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.880> s2<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.830> this<00:01:28.220> is

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
directly over the s2 so this is

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.839 
directly over the s2 so this is
basically<00:01:28.940> a<00:01:29.240> hard<00:01:29.920> covering<00:01:30.920> it's<00:01:31.250> made<00:01:31.580> from

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:31.849 
basically a hard covering it's made from

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:34.389 
basically a hard covering it's made from
polycarbonate<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:33.440> it's<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:33.950> same<00:01:34.130> stuff

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
polycarbonate and it's the same stuff

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.490 
polycarbonate and it's the same stuff
that<00:01:34.429> they<00:01:34.640> have<00:01:34.789> in<00:01:34.940> bulletproof<00:01:35.300> glass<00:01:35.660> it's

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
that they have in bulletproof glass it's

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.260 
that they have in bulletproof glass it's
not<00:01:36.679> as<00:01:36.830> heavy<00:01:37.009> as<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.250> bulletproof<00:01:37.970> glass

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
not as heavy as a bulletproof glass

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.940 
not as heavy as a bulletproof glass
obviously<00:01:38.959> because<00:01:39.140> hopefully<00:01:39.319> nobody's

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
obviously because hopefully nobody's

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.889 
obviously because hopefully nobody's
going<00:01:40.069> to<00:01:40.160> shoot<00:01:40.369> at<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.610> but<00:01:41.119> it<00:01:41.330> will<00:01:41.599> protect
