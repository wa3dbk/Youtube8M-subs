of the same you push control in push it

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.770 
of the same you push control in push it
three<00:05:38.950> times<00:05:39.220> now<00:05:39.640> we<00:05:39.700> got<00:05:39.850> four<00:05:40.090> windows<00:05:40.390> open

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
three times now we got four windows open

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.390 
three times now we got four windows open
you<00:05:41.140> might<00:05:41.320> actually<00:05:41.500> be<00:05:41.710> able<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:41.979> type<00:05:42.190> more

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
you might actually be able to type more

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.920 
you might actually be able to type more
than<00:05:42.550> that<00:05:42.669> I<00:05:42.700> don't<00:05:42.850> know<00:05:43.000> I<00:05:43.060> haven't<00:05:43.360> tried

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
than that I don't know I haven't tried

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.580 
than that I don't know I haven't tried
but<00:05:44.919> anyway<00:05:45.990> what<00:05:46.990> you're<00:05:47.140> going<00:05:47.289> to<00:05:47.380> want<00:05:47.530> to

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
but anyway what you're going to want to

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.640 
but anyway what you're going to want to
do<00:05:47.800> is<00:05:48.100> you're<00:05:48.550> going<00:05:48.640> to<00:05:48.700> push<00:05:48.910> ctrl<00:05:49.600> alt<00:05:50.050> and

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
do is you're going to push ctrl alt and

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.040 
do is you're going to push ctrl alt and
then<00:05:51.430> this<00:05:52.090> only<00:05:52.300> works<00:05:52.570> if<00:05:52.750> you<00:05:52.870> have<00:05:52.900> a

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
then this only works if you have a

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.990 
then this only works if you have a
number<00:05:53.560> pad<00:05:53.770> on<00:05:53.979> your<00:05:54.010> keyboard<00:05:54.340> by<00:05:54.700> the<00:05:54.760> way

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
number pad on your keyboard by the way

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.700 
number pad on your keyboard by the way
so<00:05:55.990> ctrl<00:05:56.650> alt<00:05:57.039> number<00:05:57.789> pad<00:05:58.030> seven<00:05:58.780> puts<00:05:59.560> the

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
so ctrl alt number pad seven puts the

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.320 
so ctrl alt number pad seven puts the
window<00:06:00.010> in<00:06:00.190> that<00:06:00.220> corner<00:06:00.820> you<00:06:00.940> come<00:06:01.120> down<00:06:01.270> here

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
window in that corner you come down here

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.230 
window in that corner you come down here
select<00:06:01.600> this<00:06:01.930> one<00:06:02.100> ctrl<00:06:03.100> alt<00:06:03.340> number<00:06:03.669> pad<00:06:03.850> one

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
select this one ctrl alt number pad one

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.659 
select this one ctrl alt number pad one
puts<00:06:04.690> that<00:06:04.840> one<00:06:04.900> over<00:06:05.200> there<00:06:05.410> select<00:06:06.340> this<00:06:06.610> one

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
puts that one over there select this one

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.310 
puts that one over there select this one
ctrl<00:06:07.570> alt<00:06:07.870> number<00:06:08.710> pad<00:06:08.919> nine<00:06:09.460> and<00:06:10.450> ctrl<00:06:11.050> alt

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
ctrl alt number pad nine and ctrl alt

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.760 
ctrl alt number pad nine and ctrl alt
number<00:06:11.770> pad<00:06:12.039> 3<00:06:12.780> so<00:06:13.780> if<00:06:13.930> you<00:06:14.020> can<00:06:14.169> imagine<00:06:14.440> your

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
number pad 3 so if you can imagine your

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.120 
number pad 3 so if you can imagine your
number<00:06:15.190> pad<00:06:15.490> those<00:06:15.940> numbers<00:06:16.860> seven<00:06:17.860> nine<00:06:18.100> one

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
number pad those numbers seven nine one

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.250 
number pad those numbers seven nine one
and<00:06:18.520> three<00:06:18.910> your<00:06:19.180> four<00:06:19.479> corners<00:06:19.930> on<00:06:20.080> your

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
and three your four corners on your

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.440 
and three your four corners on your
screen<00:06:20.590> just<00:06:20.919> think<00:06:21.190> of<00:06:21.280> it<00:06:21.400> that<00:06:21.520> way<00:06:21.760> this

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
screen just think of it that way this

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.969 
screen just think of it that way this
would<00:06:22.630> be<00:06:22.690> easy<00:06:22.870> to<00:06:23.110> remember<00:06:23.410> and<00:06:23.680> if<00:06:23.800> you

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
would be easy to remember and if you

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.010 
would be easy to remember and if you
drag<00:06:24.250> the<00:06:24.400> windows<00:06:24.669> away<00:06:25.470> they<00:06:26.470> will<00:06:26.910> resize

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
drag the windows away they will resize

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.050 
drag the windows away they will resize
themselves<00:06:29.020> back<00:06:29.289> the<00:06:29.530> way<00:06:29.650> they<00:06:29.860> were<00:06:30.030> now<00:06:31.030> I

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
themselves back the way they were now I

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.790 
themselves back the way they were now I
don't<00:06:31.210> know<00:06:31.450> if<00:06:31.539> you<00:06:31.630> can<00:06:31.780> do<00:06:31.960> more<00:06:32.169> than<00:06:32.440> four

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
don't know if you can do more than four

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.620 
don't know if you can do more than four
because<00:06:33.250> I<00:06:33.280> know<00:06:33.400> you<00:06:33.550> can<00:06:33.700> change<00:06:33.729> the<00:06:34.060> sizes

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
because I know you can change the sizes

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.180 
because I know you can change the sizes
let's<00:06:34.900> try<00:06:35.140> that<00:06:35.349> let's<00:06:35.560> just<00:06:35.890> see<00:06:36.039> what

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
let's try that let's just see what

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.110 
let's try that let's just see what
happens<00:06:36.669> ctrl<00:06:37.450> alt<00:06:37.659> button<00:06:37.780> seven

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
happens ctrl alt button seven

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.330 
happens ctrl alt button seven
seven<00:06:39.449> again<00:06:39.540> see<00:06:40.110> the<00:06:40.680> size<00:06:40.919> of<00:06:41.040> the<00:06:41.100> window

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
seven again see the size of the window

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.659 
seven again see the size of the window
changes<00:06:42.560> so<00:06:43.560> what<00:06:43.740> happens<00:06:44.040> if<00:06:44.130> we<00:06:44.250> do<00:06:44.370> to

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
changes so what happens if we do to

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.390 
changes so what happens if we do to
control<00:06:45.360> all<00:06:45.750> seven<00:06:46.320> again<00:06:46.620> nope<00:06:46.949> it<00:06:47.220> just

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
control all seven again nope it just

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.000 
control all seven again nope it just
puts<00:06:47.580> it<00:06:47.669> over<00:06:47.790> the<00:06:47.880> top<00:06:48.710> anyway<00:06:49.710> I<00:06:49.800> was<00:06:49.979> hoping

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
puts it over the top anyway I was hoping

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.850 
puts it over the top anyway I was hoping
we<00:06:50.310> could<00:06:50.340> grid<00:06:50.669> more<00:06:50.970> than<00:06:51.150> four<00:06:51.389> but<00:06:51.860> doesn't

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
we could grid more than four but doesn't

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.890 
we could grid more than four but doesn't
look<00:06:52.949> like<00:06:53.220> that's<00:06:53.729> going<00:06:54.120> to<00:06:54.300> be<00:06:54.389> possible

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 
look like that's going to be possible

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.530 
look like that's going to be possible
but<00:06:55.710> anyway<00:06:56.430> there<00:06:56.760> you<00:06:56.940> have<00:06:57.150> it<00:06:59.210> for<00:07:00.210> number

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540 
but anyway there you have it for number

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.379 
but anyway there you have it for number
eight<00:07:00.919> it'll<00:07:01.919> maximize<00:07:02.370> it<00:07:02.610> ctrl<00:07:02.940> alt<00:07:03.120> number

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:03.389 
eight it'll maximize it ctrl alt number

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.710 
eight it'll maximize it ctrl alt number
eight<00:07:03.590> let's<00:07:04.590> take<00:07:04.710> it<00:07:04.800> to<00:07:04.919> the<00:07:05.040> top<00:07:05.630> so<00:07:06.630> you

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 
eight let's take it to the top so you

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.750 
eight let's take it to the top so you
can<00:07:06.750> tile<00:07:07.050> top<00:07:07.350> and<00:07:07.560> bottom<00:07:07.919> and<00:07:08.100> then<00:07:08.250> ctrl

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760 
can tile top and bottom and then ctrl

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.020 
can tile top and bottom and then ctrl
