00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.839 
is number 60 that's why I didn't really
pay<00:03:44.579> attention<00:03:44.609> to<00:03:45.319> I'm<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.500> US<00:03:46.650> ones<00:03:47.040> at

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
pay attention to I'm the US ones at

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:48.890 
pay attention to I'm the US ones at
least<00:03:48.030> tell<00:03:48.180> them<00:03:48.239> have<00:03:48.419> a<00:03:48.449> hole<00:03:48.720> going

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
least tell them have a hole going

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.780 
least tell them have a hole going
through<00:03:49.139> it<00:03:49.199> like<00:03:49.229> that<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.069> I<00:03:50.430> don't<00:03:50.579> know<00:03:50.729> if

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
through it like that so I don't know if

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.089 
through it like that so I don't know if
that's<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.359> like<00:03:51.599> put<00:03:52.590> some<00:03:52.799> strain

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
that's so you like put some strain

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.379 
that's so you like put some strain
through<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:53.909> use<00:03:54.150> them<00:03:54.269> as

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
through it and like use them as

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.699 
through it and like use them as
ornaments<00:03:54.689> or<00:03:54.870> something<00:03:55.079> like<00:03:55.139> that<00:03:55.199> or<00:03:55.500> what

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
ornaments or something like that or what

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.250 
ornaments or something like that or what
but<00:03:56.189> it<00:03:56.849> seems<00:03:57.090> like<00:03:57.209> only<00:03:57.299> one<00:03:57.419> per<00:03:57.780> pack<00:03:58.019> is

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
but it seems like only one per pack is

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.379 
but it seems like only one per pack is
like<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.739> at<00:03:58.859> most<00:03:59.129> looks<00:03:59.909> like<00:04:00.030> our<00:04:00.120> first

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
like that at most looks like our first

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.199 
like that at most looks like our first
pack<00:04:00.659> didn't<00:04:00.959> if<00:04:01.019> any<00:04:01.199> like<00:04:01.409> that<00:04:01.680> but<00:04:02.669> I<00:04:02.939> had

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
pack didn't if any like that but I had

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.520 
pack didn't if any like that but I had
noticed<00:04:03.510> in<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.629> UK<00:04:03.870> ones<00:04:04.079> they<00:04:04.260> have<00:04:04.409> that

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
noticed in the UK ones they have that

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.059 
noticed in the UK ones they have that
off<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.919> look<00:04:05.040> at<00:04:05.639> more<00:04:05.879> closely<00:04:05.939> later<00:04:06.389> but<00:04:06.720> I

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
off to look at more closely later but I

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.469 
off to look at more closely later but I
saw<00:04:08.069> some<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.340> packs<00:04:08.519> like<00:04:08.699> kisi<00:04:09.120> -<00:04:09.299> I<00:04:09.329> know

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
saw some of the packs like kisi - I know

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:10.999 
saw some of the packs like kisi - I know
it<00:04:09.599> has<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.750> hole<00:04:10.290> on<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.409> top<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.650> head<00:04:10.859> like

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:11.009

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.159 
it has a hole on the top a head like
that<00:04:11.069> so<00:04:12.000> I'm<00:04:12.060> not<00:04:12.150> sure<00:04:12.209> if<00:04:12.389> that's<00:04:12.479> only<00:04:12.930> like

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
that so I'm not sure if that's only like

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.599

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.429 
straight on you can't see the hole any
but<00:05:26.300> something<00:05:26.509> like<00:05:26.569> kissy<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.110> whole<00:05:27.259> kind

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:27.439 
but something like kissy the whole kind

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:28.990 
but something like kissy the whole kind
of<00:05:27.529> like<00:05:27.590> in<00:05:27.889> dense<00:05:28.159> topple<00:05:28.520> ahead<00:05:28.699> so<00:05:28.879> it's

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
of like in dense topple ahead so it's

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.149 
of like in dense topple ahead so it's
more<00:05:29.270> obvious<00:05:29.569> so<00:05:30.020> I<00:05:30.589> don't<00:05:30.770> think<00:05:30.949> they're

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
more obvious so I don't think they're

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:32.920 
more obvious so I don't think they're
like<00:05:31.400> that<00:05:31.610> in<00:05:31.699> the<00:05:31.849> UK<00:05:32.029> version<00:05:32.389> so<00:05:32.810> I<00:05:32.839> think

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
like that in the UK version so I think

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.499 
like that in the UK version so I think
what<00:05:33.110> I<00:05:33.169> noticed<00:05:33.440> that<00:05:33.589> but<00:05:33.800> anyways<00:05:34.639> Pookie
