00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:07.860 
she just got loose really

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.470 
she just got loose really
it's<00:00:08.430> really<00:00:08.670> hard<00:00:08.850> to<00:00:08.940> tell<00:00:09.120> from<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.420> angle

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
it's really hard to tell from that angle

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.840 
it's really hard to tell from that angle
and<00:00:09.870> it's<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.380> place<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.550> tend<00:00:11.790> to

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:11.850 
and it's the place that you you tend to

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.420 
and it's the place that you you tend to
fight<00:00:12.059> loose<00:00:12.420> into<00:00:12.780> these<00:00:12.960> corners<00:00:13.260> and<00:00:13.620> the

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 
fight loose into these corners and the

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.709 
fight loose into these corners and the
reason<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.760> you<00:00:14.970> fight<00:00:15.180> that<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.480> because

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
reason that you fight that is because

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.600 
reason that you fight that is because
you<00:00:15.870> try<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> get<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.710> car<00:00:16.860> freed<00:00:17.189> up<00:00:17.340> from<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
center of the corner out and so it can

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.750 
center of the corner out and so it can
get<00:00:19.800> away<00:00:19.920> from<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.369> will<00:00:20.490> be<00:00:20.580> especially
