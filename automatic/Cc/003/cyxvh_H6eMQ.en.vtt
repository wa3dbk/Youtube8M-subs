00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
weight and I was very skeptical I had

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.750 
weight and I was very skeptical I had
tried<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:38.930> many<00:00:39.170> different<00:00:40.010> kinds<00:00:40.460> of<00:00:40.579> weight

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
tried so many different kinds of weight

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.400 
tried so many different kinds of weight
loss<00:00:40.940> supplements<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:41.840> they<00:00:41.929> just<00:00:42.140> wouldn't

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
loss supplements and they just wouldn't

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.360 
loss supplements and they just wouldn't
work<00:00:42.649> or<00:00:43.039> they<00:00:43.730> make<00:00:43.879> me<00:00:44.030> too<00:00:44.149> jittery<00:00:44.359> or<00:00:45.370> it

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
work or they make me too jittery or it

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
work or they make me too jittery or it
was<00:00:46.489> just<00:00:46.519> a<00:00:46.699> waste<00:00:46.850> of<00:00:47.000> money

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
was just a waste of money

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.770 
was just a waste of money
all<00:00:47.570> like<00:00:47.989> all<00:00:48.170> around<00:00:49.480> so<00:00:50.480> I<00:00:50.510> was<00:00:50.600> really

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
all like all around so I was really

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.750 
all like all around so I was really
skeptical<00:00:51.079> with<00:00:51.559> trying<00:00:51.890> this<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:52.399> I<00:00:52.429> did

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
skeptical with trying this but I did

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.869 
skeptical with trying this but I did
hear<00:00:53.059> about<00:00:53.089> it<00:00:53.539> from<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:53.780> dr.<00:00:54.079> Oz<00:00:54.170> Show<00:00:54.879> and

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
hear about it from the dr. Oz Show and

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.119 
hear about it from the dr. Oz Show and
so<00:00:56.870> I<00:00:56.899> was<00:00:56.989> just<00:00:57.019> like<00:00:57.230> what<00:00:57.379> what<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.039> heck

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129

had<00:01:01.760> no<00:01:01.909> time<00:01:02.089> to<00:01:02.210> even<00:01:02.300> document<00:01:02.809> it<00:01:02.870> because

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140
