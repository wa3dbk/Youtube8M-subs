00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello friends of daniel I bring you this one 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.200
 chad this tweet consists of having two 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.420
 applications open at the same time and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.300
 use them for example was going to open the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.219
 YouTube application 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.110
 but even if I charge, I'm going to go to my 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.110
 channel and the videos section 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.900
 you can to join them and then 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.779
 are going to go on safari or any other 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.579
 application that they want to go after with 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.890
 pressing the double is on the button 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.860
 slog stick it like the king enable and 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.080
 they have to do that function 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.400
 they lower it and be going to be able to live here in 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.640
 the application which to me I do not 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.329
 it works at that moment I do not know why 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.000
 because I have these you active and 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.350
 ready now it will work but now it's going 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.170
 to open the adjustments app because 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.850
 will be what I had previously so 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.129
 we are going to go to any application 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.339
 what to have above and then the application 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.769
 they want to have down dorleta free and 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.140
 the two will already be working 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.350
 applications for example as of the two 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.080
 at the same time not only one at a time but 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.090
 if the street can not move the other and 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.400
 you can look for what you want for 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.120
 example 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.120
 doni 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.350
 in google look for this or anything 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.730
 and here I have my videos 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.570
 and you can do what you want 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.740
 want to look for any one application 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.439
 I am this, do not be 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.229
 and you can use any application 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.439
 who want also can we use it 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.630
 so if you have iphone 6 plus 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.230
 example and use settings that I know you see 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.890
 in horizontal 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.320
 I leave and we are via messages and I give 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.150
 is double and as you can see you can 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.670
 our split screen can use 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.290
 here one and here the other any 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.450
 replication and for example here you 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.700
 they see that there is a line, you can not 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.539
 reduce the application of adjustments or 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.640
 can enlarge 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.409
 and you select the half that 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.540
 they want in my case I work half and 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:18.670
 half that is dragging this strip 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.189
 then here well here I leave half and 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.290
 you must cancel it and well you can use 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.950
 two applications at a time if they did 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.010
 that application has been closed 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.190
 and good because here the twist 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.290
 until now 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.300
 and now I'm going to close the whole application 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.490
 they see that this tweet has many 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.960
 many mistakes 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.960
 and then with errors look 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.020
 how is this use 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.350
 and well now we will have to go to 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.350
 cydia 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.130
 we hope they charge me not because 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:02.480
 he does it fast we go to the section of 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.480
 edit sources add and add and guide 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.070
 today 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.930
 messi also not 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.460
 or if 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:26.410
 it knitted as well as to the ground 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:29.410
 he did not choose elegy with h at the end he chose 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.410
 ans 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:38.500
 dan drew 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.500
 dotcom on the networks see me if it 's okay 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.590
 have not tried not here alone with the d 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.310
 and I also think it's wrong to see him 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.830
 or 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.900
 Rodrigo 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.400
 point back them is already correct this 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.400
 conventional source 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.270
 but if it looks good 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.400
 and good 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.400
 It also improves description is not 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.670
 they add source and they go here and they go 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.080
 to all the packages and they will be subtracted 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.850

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.430

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.470
 event will have six diaries and it will 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.110

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.729
 settings 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.379
 that can 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.509
