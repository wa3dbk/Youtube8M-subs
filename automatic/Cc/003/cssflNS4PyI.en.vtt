you don't have to watch it but this is
just<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.490> little<00:01:25.070> thing<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> show<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.700> as

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
just a little thing just to show and as

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
you can see and pretty much the only

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.310 
you can see and pretty much the only
problem<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.360> stuff<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> outside<00:01:30.840> is

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
problem is the stuff on the outside is

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350 
problem is the stuff on the outside is
really<00:01:31.350> vulnerable<00:01:32.100> towards<00:01:32.729> arches<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
really vulnerable towards arches and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.039 
really vulnerable towards arches and
barbarians<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:34.890> even<00:01:35.220> though<00:01:35.369> my

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
barbarians just because even though my

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.560

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
attacking units just to help my defense

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.510 
attacking units just to help my defense
just<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.380> slow<00:02:16.620> them<00:02:16.770> down<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.190> give<00:02:17.370> my

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
just to slow them down and give my

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.010 
just to slow them down and give my
defense<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.030> little<00:02:18.120> bit<00:02:18.300> more<00:02:18.390> time<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.630> attack

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
defense a little bit more time to attack

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.920 
defense a little bit more time to attack
them<00:02:19.200> yeah<00:02:19.830> as<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.310> can<00:02:20.460> see<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> pretty

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
them yeah as you can see it is a pretty

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.720 
them yeah as you can see it is a pretty
good<00:02:22.110> base<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.650> don't<00:02:23.310> know<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:23.490> kind<00:02:23.550> of

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
good base I don't know it's kind of

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.450 
good base I don't know it's kind of
silly<00:02:23.880> for<00:02:24.090> me<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.210> show<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.960> loss<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:26.100> am<00:02:26.280> I

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
silly for me to show you a loss but am I

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.460 
silly for me to show you a loss but am I
just<00:02:26.550> started<00:02:26.850> show<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.780> did<00:02:27.990> sort<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.320> do

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
just started show this it did sort of do

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.120 
just started show this it did sort of do
a<00:02:28.500> bit<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.680> an<00:02:28.800> overkill<00:02:29.070> for<00:02:29.250> one<00:02:29.580> star<00:02:31.130> but

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
a bit of an overkill for one star but

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.670 
a bit of an overkill for one star but
yeah<00:02:32.280> again<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:33.000> Town<00:02:33.210> Hall<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:34.290> its<00:02:34.500> own

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680

yeah again the Town Hall is in its own
little<00:02:34.830> section<00:02:35.160> just<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:35.730> barbarians<00:02:36.270> if

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
little section just so barbarians if

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.700 
little section just so barbarians if
they<00:02:36.480> go<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.630> attack<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.140> after<00:02:37.380> break<00:02:37.560> for

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
they go to attack it after break for

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.830 
they go to attack it after break for
another<00:02:37.770> wall<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.700> gives<00:02:38.880> maybe<00:02:39.180> some

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
another wall and that gives maybe some

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.300 
another wall and that gives maybe some
my<00:02:39.960> defenses<00:02:40.410> enough<00:02:40.620> time<00:02:40.800> just<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.100> shoot

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
my defenses enough time just to shoot

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.830 
my defenses enough time just to shoot
and<00:02:41.460> try<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.700> kill<00:02:41.880> them<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.510> yeah<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:42.780> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
and try and kill them so yeah it's a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.840 
and try and kill them so yeah it's a
pretty<00:02:42.930> good<00:02:43.170> base<00:02:43.320> design<00:02:43.740> try<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.700> out

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850
