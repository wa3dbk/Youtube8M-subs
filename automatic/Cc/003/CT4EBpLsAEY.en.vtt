that would be comfortable and
friendly<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.310> use<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.030> what<00:02:15.990> came<00:02:16.200> out<00:02:16.320> of

friendly to use and what came out of

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.800 
friendly to use and what came out of
that<00:02:16.500> was<00:02:17.070> this<00:02:17.610> operating<00:02:18.060> system<00:02:18.180> called

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
that was this operating system called

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.980 
that was this operating system called
UNIX<00:02:19.380> which<00:02:19.800> was<00:02:20.010> very<00:02:20.340> small<00:02:20.610> but<00:02:20.850> very<00:02:21.570> clean

UNIX which was very small but very clean
and<00:02:22.380> very<00:02:22.620> elegant<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.880> like<00:02:24.030> saying<00:02:24.360> oh

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600

chop<00:02:29.280> down<00:02:29.430> some<00:02:29.490> trees<00:02:29.670> build<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.420> desk<00:02:30.600> at<00:02:30.780> it

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
chop down some trees build a desk at it
