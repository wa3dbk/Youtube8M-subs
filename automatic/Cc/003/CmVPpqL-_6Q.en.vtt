and and the veins in that area it's just

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.120 
and and the veins in that area it's just
you<00:02:43.050> know<00:02:43.080> it's<00:02:43.290> it's<00:02:43.470> not<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> good<00:02:43.920> thing<00:02:44.100> that

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
kind of like a water balloon that kind

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.330 
kind of like a water balloon that kind
of<00:02:48.360> pops<00:02:48.720> through<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.380> it's<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.980> usually

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
of pops through and it's it's usually

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.470 
of pops through and it's it's usually
when<00:02:50.459> there's<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:50.790> some<00:02:50.970> kind<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.239> heavy

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
when there's like some kind of heavy

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.660 
when there's like some kind of heavy
lifting<00:02:51.750> or<00:02:52.440> if<00:02:52.650> you're<00:02:52.830> straining<00:02:53.370> on<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
lifting or if you're straining on the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.220 
lifting or if you're straining on the
bat<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.209> toilet<00:02:54.390> sometimes<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:55.020> could<00:02:55.140> even

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
bat on the toilet sometimes I could even

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.940 
bat on the toilet sometimes I could even
happen<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.959> want<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.260> really<00:02:58.440> strengthen

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
happen so you want to really strengthen

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.260 
happen so you want to really strengthen
those<00:02:59.160> core<00:02:59.400> muscles<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.880> they're<00:03:00.000> able<00:03:00.120> to

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
those core muscles so they're able to

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.010 
those core muscles so they're able to
deal<00:03:00.780> with<00:03:01.470> extra<00:03:01.980> intra-abdominal<00:03:02.400> pressure

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
deal with extra intra-abdominal pressure

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.110 
deal with extra intra-abdominal pressure
which<00:03:04.020> may<00:03:04.410> be<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.010> cause<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.700> honey<00:03:05.940> in

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
which may be the cause of the honey in

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.300 
which may be the cause of the honey in
the<00:03:06.209> first<00:03:06.480> place<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:07.050> planks<00:03:07.620> side<00:03:07.920> planks

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the first place so planks side planks

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.210 
the first place so planks side planks

diet<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.209> begin<00:03:39.450> with<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:39.840> because<00:03:40.140> he's<00:03:40.290> you

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
diet to begin with and because he's you

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.770 
diet to begin with and because he's you
know<00:03:40.650> you're<00:03:40.830> gonna<00:03:40.950> be<00:03:41.070> less<00:03:41.280> active<00:03:41.730> okay<00:03:42.060> so

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.810 
know you're gonna be less active okay so
naturally<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.739> just<00:03:43.890> want<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.100> drop<00:03:44.610> your

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
naturally you just want to drop your

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.420 
naturally you just want to drop your
calorie<00:03:45.239> consumption<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.750> little<00:03:45.959> bit<00:03:46.079> because

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
calorie consumption a little bit because

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.940 
calorie consumption a little bit because
unless<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.640> want<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.850> gain<00:03:48.030> weight<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.950> need

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
unless you want to gain weight you need

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.860 
unless you want to gain weight you need
to<00:03:50.100> consume<00:03:50.459> fewer<00:03:50.790> calories<00:03:50.880> than<00:03:51.329> you<00:03:51.720> are

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
to consume fewer calories than you are

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.280 
to consume fewer calories than you are
burning<00:03:52.970> or<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.480> know<00:03:54.570> keep<00:03:54.780> them<00:03:54.900> roughly

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
burning or you know keep them roughly

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.289 
burning or you know keep them roughly
the<00:03:55.440> same<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:56.280> if<00:03:56.459> you're<00:03:56.640> normally<00:03:57.060> very

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
the same so if you're normally very

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.630 
the same so if you're normally very
active<00:03:57.660> six<00:03:57.870> days<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.079> week<00:03:58.340> seems<00:03:59.340> like<00:03:59.489> he's

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
active six days a week seems like he's

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.380 
active six days a week seems like he's
training<00:04:00.000> properly<00:04:01.519> and<00:04:02.519> you're<00:04:03.000> used<00:04:03.269> to

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
calories a day well you can see how

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.460 
calories a day well you can see how
that's<00:04:11.670> going<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.820> start<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.090> add<00:04:12.180> up<00:04:12.209> right<00:04:12.540> so

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
that's going to start to add up right so

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.810 
that's going to start to add up right so
you<00:04:13.530> may<00:04:13.620> want<00:04:13.829> to<00:04:13.860> drop<00:04:14.010> your<00:04:14.220> calories<00:04:14.610> by

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
you know the recommendations about

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.310 
you know the recommendations about
fifteen<00:04:17.400> percent<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:18.510> take<00:04:19.049> whatever

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
fifteen percent so take whatever

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.960 
fifteen percent so take whatever
calories<00:04:19.680> are<00:04:19.799> having<00:04:20.010> now<00:04:20.160> or<00:04:20.340> just<00:04:20.430> without

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
calories are having now or just without

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.490 
calories are having now or just without
even<00:04:21.209> counting<00:04:21.419> calories<00:04:21.840> just<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.410> know

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
even counting calories just you know

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.070 
even counting calories just you know
just<00:04:23.120> modify<00:04:24.120> your<00:04:24.300> portion<00:04:24.660> sizes<00:04:24.690> vary

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
just modify your portion sizes vary

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.490 
just modify your portion sizes vary
slightly<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.890> at

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
slightly and at

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.810 
slightly and at
equal<00:04:26.680> for<00:04:26.800> six<00:04:26.980> weeks<00:04:27.130> that'll<00:04:27.370> make<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.520> huge

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
equal for six weeks that'll make a huge

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.190 
equal for six weeks that'll make a huge
difference<00:04:28.060> so<00:04:28.300> you<00:04:28.360> don't<00:04:28.720> add<00:04:28.990> on

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
difference so you don't add on

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.290 
difference so you don't add on
additional<00:04:29.530> weights<00:04:30.070> but<00:04:31.030> again<00:04:31.120> the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
additional weights but again the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.000 
additional weights but again the
important<00:04:31.900> thing<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.140> with<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.590> hernia

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
important thing is that with the hernia

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.100 
important thing is that with the hernia
you<00:04:33.190> don't<00:04:33.460> want<00:04:33.700> to<00:04:33.850> jump<00:04:34.360> back<00:04:34.570> into<00:04:34.810> things

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
you don't want to jump back into things

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.940 
you don't want to jump back into things
literally<00:04:36.480> because<00:04:37.530> that's<00:04:38.530> going<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.860> make

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
literally because that's going to make

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.950 
literally because that's going to make
things<00:04:39.010> worse<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:39.640> follow<00:04:40.180> your<00:04:40.450> physio<00:04:40.780> or
