middle what this does is it allows you
to<00:01:25.220> hit<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.640> d-pad<00:01:26.030> easier<00:01:26.510> and<00:01:27.340> quicker<00:01:28.340> so

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
to hit the d-pad easier and quicker so

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.940

if you have a care package or something

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.030 
if you have a care package or something
like<00:01:31.400> that<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.820> can<00:01:32.000> really<00:01:32.560> hit<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.680> d-pad

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
like that you can really hit the d-pad

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.040 
like that you can really hit the d-pad
quickly<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:34.670> get<00:01:34.790> that<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.630> care<00:01:35.840> package

quickly and get that that care package

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.610 
quickly and get that that care package
as<00:01:36.380> fast<00:01:36.620> as<00:01:36.800> you<00:01:36.920> possibly<00:01:37.310> can<00:01:38.620> another

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
thing that you can do with these is you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.010 
thing that you can do with these is you
can<00:01:42.430> buy<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.460> couple<00:01:43.790> sets<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.480> swap<00:01:44.810> the

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
can buy a couple sets and swap the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.370 
can buy a couple sets and swap the
colors<00:01:45.380> out<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.400> you<00:01:46.460> could<00:01:46.910> buy<00:01:47.120> two<00:01:47.810> sets<00:01:48.110> of

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
colors out so you could buy two sets of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.800 
colors out so you could buy two sets of
red<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:49.040> blue<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:51.350> could<00:01:51.530> have<00:01:51.800> a<00:01:52.810> red

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810
