00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 it's still a bomb and now it's back 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.790
 sound the ticking Christian takes months 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.550
 wanting to renew but now it turns out that 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.870
 is more outside than inside or as a title 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.639
 the daily ace in its edition today 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.650
 Christian is closer to goodbye than 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.599
 of renewal and that's why even 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.609
 discards his departure from Madrid at the end of 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.260
 season the news reveals manu sainz 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.730
 ace journalist and personal friend of 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.320
 Christian since the Portuguese reaches 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.910
 Spain according to the news 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.800
 Christian is tired of feeling the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.779
 bad of Spanish football and there is not 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.550
 feels supported by the club the last 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.230
 friction comes last Monday when the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.390
 madrid takes out a statement protecting 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.579
 pepe and not Christian addition Christian 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.750
 does not declare its renovation the madrid is going 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.760
 to offer an improvement because its 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.890
 performance is beyond doubt but 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.719
 that evidence is as firm as another with 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.730
 the christian united renewed five times 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.100
 in six years with madrid he has three 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.570
 years and no improvement and above he finds out 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.489
 that Messi is about to renew with 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.800
 the barca for life at the rate of 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.510
 15 kilos per year is closer to the day 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.230
 in which Christian leaves Madrid and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.699
 if so 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.600
 will disembark in Paris to return to be 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.520
 the most expensive signing in history 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 betray his past and he will be left 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.059
 seduced by the petrodollars of the city or 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.949
 return to the arms of a turibus or a 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.949
 united sugarcane and even that misses 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:19.250
 in September Christian two months and 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.170
 half after it remains unrenewed upward 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.970
 still hurt he still does not feel 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.940
 backed by the club and that's why now 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.940
 it's more outside than inside man I think 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.580
 which is the best in the world like madrid 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.260
 he has to have the best of the world 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.729
 they always have to walk for a 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.040
 little bit but we will be close to 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.540
 renew the affection that also the pasta 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.580
 who pays him and every time he goes out to the field 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.530
 everyone is with him because I do not 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.509
 I would miss that at the last moment 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.540
 will march high on everything that is 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.190
 receiving then I think closer to 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.470
 renew if this has been done to 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.470
 ronaldo do it to messi 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.159
 but nothing less has to mark more 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.159
 goals and not cry so much 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.880
 good and now what we set out to do is 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.299
 reasons why the ronaldo Christian 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.299
 can be
