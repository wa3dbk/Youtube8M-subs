00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
that I've never tried before so this is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.350 
that I've never tried before so this is
how<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.160> started<00:00:47.610> thinking<00:00:47.879> about<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
how we started thinking about the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.450 
how we started thinking about the
concept<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:48.989> food<00:00:49.200> see<00:00:49.440> fitzy<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> new

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
concept for food see fitzy is a new

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.400 
concept for food see fitzy is a new
social<00:00:50.760> network<00:00:51.300> where<00:00:51.539> basically<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.199> keep

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
social network where basically you keep

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.529 
social network where basically you keep
track<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.370> eat<00:00:53.399> during<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> day<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
track of what you eat during the day it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.479

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
works real simple you just type in a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.549 
works real simple you just type in a
product<00:00:56.879> find<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.480> database<00:00:57.750> click<00:00:58.320> Add

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
product find it in a database click Add

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.500 
product find it in a database click Add
and<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.219> added<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.579> your<00:01:00.170> food<00:01:01.170> tracker<00:01:02.510> now

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you eat plenty of carrots because

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.670 
you eat plenty of carrots because
obviously<00:01:39.570> carrots<00:01:40.200> are<00:01:40.290> good<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.500> your

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
obviously carrots are good for your

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.370 
obviously carrots are good for your
eyesight<00:01:40.970> but<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.450> all<00:01:42.720> about<00:01:42.750> health

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
eyesight but it's not all about health

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.960 
eyesight but it's not all about health
and<00:01:43.710> dieting<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.579> sort<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.909> thing

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
and dieting in that sort of thing

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.300 
and dieting in that sort of thing
because<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> best<00:01:45.899> diet<00:01:46.200> quite<00:01:46.560> possibly<00:01:47.009> is

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
because the best diet quite possibly is

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.179 
because the best diet quite possibly is
to<00:01:47.549> eat<00:01:47.759> very<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.450> eat<00:01:48.630> well<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.470> also<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:50.040> to
