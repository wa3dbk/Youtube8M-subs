00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 the live and dark 92 there are very good at 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.389
 all for removes we are here in 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.250
 minecraft and guys today I bring a 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.480
 reston tutorial to do costs 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.990
 secrets 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.609
 secrets do not tell anyone and good 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.230
 guys the mechanism starts simple 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.000
 you are going to see now and what it does is rotate 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.830
 chests from top to bottom with which is a 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.689
 very very epic mechanism is valid for 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.220
 do it in a survival then they are what 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.039
 explained briefly worth here is with the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.420
 medium mechanism done and well this would be 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.270
 a diamond chest for example me 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.309
 put the button goes and comes the one above 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.530
 and so on it's worth we can place 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.879
 even five chests that there is no 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.030
 problem to see these are wagons 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.309
 chests is obviously worth it and well you see 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.079
 rotating you you you you with that do not know 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.789
 I would see why I'm going to put a slab here 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.200
 now you will see and well the mechanism is very 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.730
 simple here you have it I'm going to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.280
 explain briefly, what can you do? 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.559
 in any world any version in 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.570
 any server where you want is worth and 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.340
 well you see me here 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.470
 here I think enough for the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.320
 great, well, let me explain, let's go 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.520
 breaking 33 blocks in the ground is worth and 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.270
 we are going to place a piston as is 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.740
 and then later what we will do 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.850
 it will be here to place any block 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.610
 I'm going to do it in this case 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.990
 diamond and he and quartz 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.000
 then we put a block here 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.539
 anybody and we start placing three 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.909
 stars three rails better said with 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.009
 that is to say with propeller 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.439
 it's good after doing this 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.240
 we put here a block here another 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.490
 block is valid to be imported and not 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.750
 Well now see and we will put here 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.709
 one two three and we plug it in here it's going to go 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.170
 two rails 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:46.729
 better then here to finish we're going 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.159
 to place a block on top and two rails 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.989
 more here for it to bounce on the 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.270
 wall and raise the chest and lower it towards 

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:56.750
 down ballet is to say this goes up the chest 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.429
 bounces me down low as is and here 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.530
 we obviously put a droplet of 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.229
 a torch of rest to give 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.610
 working and we already have it we are going to 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.710
 cover a little bit all this because it is 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.190
 very ugly, I'm going to use 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.600
 the tinted glass you are going to see although it gives 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.300
 place a block but good now now 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.980
 I'll explain it then here does not make us 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.230
 missing and the piston we are going to cover over here 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.650
 so here's going to go what would be the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.400
 button then we place 123 voucher 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.400
 even 4 if you want here we break that 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.069
 is to obviously see the chests and here 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.870
 we put a slab and we have it 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.470
 now we put here the button where is 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.250
 and we are going to cover a little bit more for 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.959
 that does not look beautiful is precious 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.090
 then we are going to cover a little bit 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.680
 here a little bit here as you see the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.540
 mechanism is very simple be this what 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.250
 can a child make a child can 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:55.100
 do it then we were a little bit 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:58.610
 well so and so we have it now 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.959
 all we do is place the ride 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.540
 It's worth in the wagon with the confe 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.380
 so we put it here but looking 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.240
 towards there and to the agenda we can place 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.420
 those that we want must place 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.420
 two 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.190
 and 4 I think that with 4 enough they are worth and 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.330
 well let's see what really works 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.080
 fuck i know placing it the other way around 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.790
 the chests fuck good we give the button 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.739
 broken and send us the next voucher here 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.930
 we can save for example diamonds and 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.300
 once the blogs have passed four times 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.970
 the wagons we will find again 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.160
 our ccoo chest with diamonds 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.370
 let's see if it's true 2 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.319
 3 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.180
 and here would come the chest that we have put 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.010
 before with diamond we will see that they are 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.659
 here 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.280
 and good guys I hope that I have 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.840
