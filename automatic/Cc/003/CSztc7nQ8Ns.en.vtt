 hello everyone we find ourselves 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.000
 today for a new video 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.800
 I hope you all go very very 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.269
 well the devils listen point by all 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.429
 impeccable and today we at table 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.320
 forty fifth episode of my series 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.590
 and in the program three matches including the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.280
 here and we will fall against an opponent 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.590
 with training 5 2 2 1 and this match 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.480
 is going to be really it's a match that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.280
 will have marked me so why ben I'm going 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.390
 leave you a little suspense a 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.940
 really difficult match 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.260
 a money team in front is true 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.899
 five defenders it's still very 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.840
 compact and often has the purpose on 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.879
 this numerous defense it is true that 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.960
 I made a team in five 5 2 2 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.850
 1 besides loud before I you the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.770
 present this is a skil team that is 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.260
 really surprising it's true that the 5 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.270
 2 2 1 it's a device but that 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.189
 I never use that you surely you 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.689
 never use I wanted to try 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.860
 and it's not even ready this game that I 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.229
 wanted to try it is simply 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.799
 because I wanted to test it at 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.720
 this formation with 2 had 2 1 had 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.580
 some had I had a bep it's 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.140
 rather interesting and the links are 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.189
 are as interesting as you 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.490
 can see him dominate mans 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.860
 a lot and then look at the stupor on 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.290
 will cash a goal at the half hour of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.880
 game after a clear dominance 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.040
 so it does not matter we're still going 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.659
 try to react we will get some 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.479
 occasions do not worry you're going 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.850
 see it's quite a surprising enough this 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.960
 match here his goaltender will all go out his 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.490
 guardian I know more how he 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.579
 is called pants I know more how 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.470
 Romanian guardian pantilimon who plays at 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.750
 a sum that plays sunderland 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.829
 so after this game to buy it and I 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.270
 do not know if you've seen the table of 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.909
 stadiums it's just shameful 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.560
 so this game there I tell you a little 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.570
 more about what happened 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.430
 I literally farted a lead 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.869
 guardian was going out all his guardian was 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.270
 magical 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.099
 the match was completely faked so 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.080
 me the personal script I do not believe and there 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.400
 down after that you can believe it a 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.400
 really match 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.980
 shameful I do not hide you I farted my 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.909
 ashtray so much that I'm raging is 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.260
 impossible to mark impossible to 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.650
 mark though I was doing everything for 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.129
 I really limit playing to win 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.110
 the game 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.610
 a look there again his guardian who 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.849
 fate one by one parry come from null 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.040
 share 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.900
 so is the game rigged script 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.420
 and all you want for me I 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.650
 think so to the extent that after I 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.170
 will you invent all the salads 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.209
 possible but for me clearly it is 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.900
 watched this action we are we are alone 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.489
 in front of the goal 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.859
 still a pole guys again a 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.650
 pole and watch her second 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:49.079
 opportunity his second opportunity and penalty 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.370
 for him penalty while clearly he 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.109
 there is no fault for me there's no picture 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.540
 I 'm standing up I'm touching the ball and 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.159
 of stroke 2 0 for him in the 86th minute of 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.480
 game so there I was mad with rage 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.849
 by the way that's it that's it 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.439
 felt in the following matches because 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.049
 that it is true that I was still on this 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.970
 pretty upset match of the shot as well 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.470
 finish this match and looked at you I 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.750
 have left the table of stats that's 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.099
 shameful it's really shameful I have 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.599
 went crazy frankly that would have 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.939
 been funny filming me because I think 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.470
 that not really I am very brave 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.540
 but there for once I really farted 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.799
 a lead it's really annoyed and suddenly 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.769
 I started the other two matches 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.180
 afterwards with a little bit of rage so 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.169
 suddenly it this is perhaps felt the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.730
 gameplay level 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:29.120
 I'm sorry guys it's not 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.040
 necessarily the best phases 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.080
 that I could have offered you but 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.150
 tomorrow I'm going to rock you an episode 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.560
 really not bad matches 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.519
 also from tomorrow I played them in the 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.500
 stride actually I made six matches 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.090
 so that's three games 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.840
 episode and the one tomorrow will be a 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.659
 little bit better 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.280
 so suddenly the script is a big one 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:50.329
 debate is there any if we did not 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.010
 not personally I have always been 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.569
 more for the fact that there are some 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.860
 do not have after I think that a when 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.959
 even a little bit because it's true 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.489
 that often I noticed him 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.180
 scripps or especially when you fall condÃ© 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.230
 but do not have a lot of 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.120
 collective you see that you are players 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.950
 are worse after that it's not too much 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.230
 problematic but it's problematic 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.329
 insofar as I'm sure he's 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.650
 voluntary this script to force the 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.150
 types that actually plays to break the 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.909
 equipment to buy back the coup 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.959
 enrich these guys there after what I 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.820
 say it may be parrying to people 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.859
 it's nothing but sometimes I ask myself 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.989
 really the question if it's not wanted 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.789
 ap refuted that's for sure as they have 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.300
 always said bound it's a game all 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.370
 public 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.770
 and necessarily whoever says any public says 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.180
 necessarily everyone needs to 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.260
 take pleasure so suddenly it's 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.360
 maybe that's why there is 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.760
 script at that moment there I invite you 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.010
 guys to play in normal season for 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.570
 character scripts paper felt there 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.870
 on this crazy match I could nothing 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.060
 make 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.950
 my players missed everything after I have a 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.120
 team pretty true this team this is 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.229
 the one I offered you what he 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.080
 bubble to relay one by the way I you 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.940
 invite to check the video it's 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.160
 a really competitive team for 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.780
 only 15,000 credit after competitive 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.530
 she still has her limits but she 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.000
 is interesting 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.099
 frankly she interesting and good 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.419
 there is good player there are vargas and 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.710
 of the boussoufa are some players 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.160
 interesting and bags to a small 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.840
 surprise on the left who is really nice 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.360
 so suddenly the script I will stop 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.560
 to talk about it but sometimes I ask myself 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.330
 really questions because that's 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.860
 hot it's going to happen very often from 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.169
 losing games is very little bit to 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.360
 the image of the first and a red dominates and 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.250
 where the guy has no occaz so there I you 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.020
 have also left the table of occases 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.699
 of the second game frankly this year 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.820
 I will not say that I am ultra hot 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:28.789
 in defense but I'm really good 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.410
 defend and it's really often that 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.820
 my opponents have very few occases 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.710
 and for once I was even more 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.300
 disgusted the previous game brief it's 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.580
 no problem we will start the third 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.919
 match the guys this third match that is going 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.350
 a little bit better and we're going 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.150
 falling against a team in 3 4 3 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.040
 a Turkish team a pretty enough team 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.900
 original aside it's true the 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.870
 guardian who is not at the device 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.670
 or rather to the collective to know mignolet 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.650
 and the pledges wanted to enjoy it too 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.050
 I have a lot of things to tell you I 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.310
 you confess to tell you about what I 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.110
 spoke to you in the last pack 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.390
 opening namely the community channel 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.340
 unfortunately I have a bad 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.140
 new as well for you for me 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.450
 this chain I 'll never be able to 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.190
 reopen why so certainly it's true 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.420
 that she is always available a so if 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.430
 you go on it you can always 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.200
 watch the videos but in fact I 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.430
 can no longer use it as admin 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.520
 in other words, I can do more 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.770
 blog on it at the time I'm leguay 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.580
 with just my youtube nickname 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.070
 and a password 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.440
 and since a ca to change a I do not know 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.210
 if you know about it surely 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.680
 Maintenance merged with Google and 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.810
 blow for you login on youtube must 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.000
 you log in with the google mail address 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.900
 and suddenly I actually remember 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.540
 more than the email address
