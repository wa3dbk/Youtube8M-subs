00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
created and the answer is maybe but not

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.950 
created and the answer is maybe but not
the<00:01:07.280> way<00:01:07.430> we've<00:01:07.670> been<00:01:07.700> doing<00:01:07.940> it<00:01:08.360> if<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:08.780> want

to know what's wrong look down at the
table<00:01:10.760> it's<00:01:11.240> staring<00:01:11.750> back<00:01:11.960> again<00:01:12.350> think<00:01:13.280> of

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
table it's staring back again think of

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.070 
table it's staring back again think of
it<00:01:13.430> as<00:01:13.490> clients<00:01:14.000> malnutrition<00:01:14.750> because

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
that's what's going on but if we think

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.520
