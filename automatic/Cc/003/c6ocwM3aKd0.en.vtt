 of what is sound doctrine if it is that 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.210
 let's go on that interesting and nice topic 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.220
 per hundred the truth is that this Saturday san telmo that they participate night due to 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.719
 the fighting lorenzo until August a pleasure to have you 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.009
 the interesting topic is not the healthy doctrine when we talk about healthy 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:07.910
 doctrine 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.750

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.550
 really you 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.030
 in the full room 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.580
 when in MedellÃ­n in two moments 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.680
 percent since the woman was a Samaritan woman 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.370
 what is with the teacher meets the sr 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.409
 and the mr will transmit to him a teaching 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.000
 but he meets a person who has concepts already 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.610
 has pointed to them according to their concept of what a religion is 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.969
 what is happening today as we tell each other we meet people 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.579
 Aunt have concepts and they 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.190
 of what a religion is 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.230
 the emphasis definitely hand is the fact that Jesus 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.550
 he is the teacher 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.130
 and we have the grace of God in the sense that we have the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.480
 writings 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.810
 where Jesus left his words and teachings 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.240
 in chapter four that we are seeing here of the gospel according to san 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.150
 Juan 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.510
 there is recorded the meeting of Jesus with the Samaritan woman 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.309
 and we can appreciate her words after the clergy reveals part of 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:15.179
 his life 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.379
 Jesus has to go taking it to a tempo in the middle of a process of 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.479
 revelation 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:23.489
 to the fact of knowing that she was meeting at that moment 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.399
 with the saving savior with the revealing messiah 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.259
 and here we can see 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:34.009
 when the Samaritan woman tells him that she seems to be a prophet 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:39.860
 She also shows them for the part of what she thought she says 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.370
 verse 27 in the first verse 20 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.609
 our parents worshiped in this mountain not 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.849
 and you say that jerusalem is the place where you should worship 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:53.159
 jesus tells him woman that he now comes when neither on this mountain nor 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.089
 Jerusalem 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.599
 adore and sal father you speak what you do not know 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.090
 we worship what we know because salvation comes from the Jews more 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.090
 the hour is coming and now is when the true worshipers 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.339
 they will worship the father in spirit and in truth 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:12.159
 because also the father such worshipers seek to be worshiped 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.769
 God is spirit and creators in spirit and in truth it is necessary that 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:17.409
 adore 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.370
 the woman told him I know that the messiah called the Christ will come when he 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.099
 come tell us 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.039
 everything 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.810
 Jesus told him I'm the one talking to you 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.230
 then we see that the man appears to him this woman and rebels him as 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.280
 the messiah the christ who would declare all things 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.299
 and begins by declaring that God is spirit 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.229
 and that it is necessary that this god be worshiped 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:45.430
 in spirit 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.709
 and really 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.709
 together we can 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.999
 learn oo and bring this to practical life when we meet 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.999
 many people who already have a concept 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:04.939
 of what is apparently their religion a religion as vanguard 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.960
 he meets many people, I imagine 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.270
 what do they say my father has in the region I have my religion already has 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.120
 a concept how can 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.250
 church 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.970
 to reach the really healthy to take them to see the gravity is true doctrine 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.539
 in this time and even in the days when the Lord was here on earth 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.210
 found religious people and even within the people of israel one of them was 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.330
 nicodemo 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.039
 nicodemo had great knowledge background was master 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.490
 in the middle of the village and the religious man erum 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.120
 and the meeting with Jesus leads him to the rest of the world he wants 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.069
 recognize 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.659
 that it was necessary to be born again 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.120
 and there is the emphasis we can have religion but not new birth 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.020
 and the emphasis in the gospel is this we have to be born again to 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.120
 to see the kingdom of god Jesus Christ marked him as a teacher 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.180
 and part of the healthy teaching 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.590
 to indoctrinate 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.379
 is that there is no salvation for anyone if he is not born first 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:09.039
 born again of the water and the spirit for through the web the spirit 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.089
 to become a worshiper in spirit and in truth 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.230
 because such worshipers 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.839
 says the teacher 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:17.960
 God seeks me to adore him 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.840
 that day the advice a test in obvious that person 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.450
 who is watching us who is tuning 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.130
 pique and abidal I have my concept of religion 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.460
 percent what I think is that my parents taught me 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.250
 is that the religion that I believe 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.460
 wake as I interpret the bible 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.460
 what advice can we give him tonight 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.680
 God has left a spirit to be desired 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.419
 your holy spirit 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.960
 God tells him through Jesus Christ that he will guide us to the whole truth 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.080
 that the holy spirit is not going to reveal the necessary things 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.059
 so 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:58.429
 to the new birth the next step is to seek the presence of the holy spirit 

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:00.509
 just as the writing says 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.669
 that those who were on Pentecost were all filled with the Holy Spirit 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.020
 so we also have to look for our pentecost after 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.669
 to have received Christ for the new birth 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.150
 receive the holy spirit and through the covenant of the holy spirit the law 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.669
 the word of god is going to be an open book 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.410
 it's going to be a revealing book 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.279
 and we will be able to have a pure alliance 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.270
 of the spirit of the teacher 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.319
 who is a guide 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.680
 of all for the 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.789
 c / antonio 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.669
 that is danger we run when we harden the heart when messi 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:35.270
 he missed 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.000
 and I say no for that reason I think that's the way it is and and I'm fine what but we run to 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.169
 honduras the heart definitely brother the scriptures point 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.490
 that if it hardens is your heart says or if we harden our hearts 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.900
 let's go to 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.629
 unfortunately losing 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:59.160
 but the alliance of the sr is asia what is way or is on safe path 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.499
 and towards what is for us full salvation 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:07.019
 the healthy doctrine displaces teaching lassad teaching that will take us to the 

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:11.649
 full knowledge so that through full knowledge we can please 

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:12.639
 God in everything 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.360
 and that we can have that full salvation 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.219
 so 

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:18.020
 stay with 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.080
 traditions eads religious thoughts and in a 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.559
 think that this is going to be enough 

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:26.740
 from now 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.240
 those of us who are studying the word of God 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.990
 those of us who have had a personal encounter with Jesus Christ 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.960
 we are used by God himself to 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.789
 be as guides 

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.559
 so to what is the lamp the word and dryness 

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:42.389
 the lamp the torch that shines in the middle of a dark place is the same 

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:43.449
 word of God 

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:46.309
 if it is not according to the word of God 

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:47.650
 it is not from god 

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.080
 so if I have a mentality to say it 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.090
 I'm going to use the term closed 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:59.139
 third I do not want to open up to another thought no no I do not want to die something 

00:07:59.139 --> 00:07:59.669
 It is a horror
