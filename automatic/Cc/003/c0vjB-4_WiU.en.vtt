00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.509
 rattle calendar is here in the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.610
 screen is at the top left there and 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.440
 quasi the successor of kalenders plus 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.150
 only universal application for iphone 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.099
 ipad syncs with the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.960
 normal ios calendar respectively 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.210
 with the personal google calendar 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.500
 if you should use it and we 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.359
 just thought a glance purely 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.730
 we had the beta version now nine 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.619
 about one month into the day you can 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.090
 finally the official issue from the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.310
 Download the app store and which ones 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.810
 calendar theme opened 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.460
 We have some dates in Austria 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.149
 free since everyone has birthday and such 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.430
 on and on 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.809
 that's the list view here 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.399
 is displayed , you can see that too 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.129
 already we have the friday the 20th 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.530
 september including sunday the 22nd 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.059
 these are almost the registered dates 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.280
 that are coming soon 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.460
 and you can look at the settings topic 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.500
 choose which view or in 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.949
 which view the calendar rises 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.940
 should 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.199
 we have such a small one up here 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.449
 button there we can choose if 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.010
 we have a daily-weekly-monthly-view 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.840
 or have the tasks view 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.000
 because we want to come right at and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.739
 can sit in the set with 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.680
 which view the calendar will start 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.450
 should when we open the application 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.670
 application itself is currently 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.110
 not completely Germanized so one 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.880
 few things you can see here already 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.310
 data are displayed in German 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.570
 but above here in the list view to 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.460
 for example, there is still missing the German 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.740
 localization which will be submitted we 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.630
 spoken meet then work the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.040
 Above all, not only work on it 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.810
 the localization of the ad is German too 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.439
 make but also the input new 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.880
 Events 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.369
 If we look at each other here we have 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.990
 Here is an input field which is very smart 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.340
 I personally like it very much 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.380
 that's why the calendar is here too 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.210
 now since the beta phase on the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.979
 first page on it you can here 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.030
 can begin typing the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.320
 again about this over this typical 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.030
 semantics make logic that easy 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:59.000
 says I'll meet with me 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:01.049
 Michael we take on 12.9 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.509
 that will be such a bad example 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.950
 at least 22 09 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.810
 and then you can see it while I do that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.190
 A tip he replaces the date below 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.899
 stop if I continue here then and 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.369
 say we meet my ways around 11 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.680
 Clock 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.879
 already starts to insert that 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.610
 but he does not come with everyone yet 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.080
 sentences right so if I am 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.140
 just take german sentence and say 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.150
 Hairdressing appointment tomorrow 2 pm then he has 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.700
 still problems with that down right 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.489
 to insert is understood right now 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.510
 still on the us expressionist and there 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.430
 wait as I said on the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.049
 update otherwise but so is me 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.420

 impacts not first 100 auctions 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.500
 I can then put that 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.480
 for my sake wants to remember then 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.829
 other people are with us 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.569
 should take place exactly and so on and 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.670
 so on, but it will all step 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.640

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.709

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.340
 This sly keyboard is shown below 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.209
 which I can switch between the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.500
 time and date and then again 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.599
 Dedicated to that on my account 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.599
 the appointment here at 22 o'clock in the evening 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.549
 begins at 22.30 or so here there's 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.560
 extra buttons and I have to then 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.239
 not with these scroll wheels like us 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.859
 to get to know them from the ios calendar 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.299
 Top I can put that I

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.480
 possibility to respond 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.859
 which day is under so far 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.459
 I set I can even 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.379
 click 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.000

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.870
 there is the possibility still a place 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.329
 I could add here 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.859
 that is the repeat of the appointment 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.419
 The man happened once a week 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.579
 and bottom right then I have the 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.560
 possibility to add a note 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.549

 I have that in the settings 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.760
 I automatically set one 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.049
 I'll be alerted quarter of an hour before 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.280
 break things off here and we 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.299
 take a look at the settings 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.989
 We are up here in the 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.400
 menu bar tucked and there can 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.870
 We now choose this standard 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.030
 things as we want even our 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.400
 google calendar connect or just the 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.459

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.620
 should he us or according to which time zone 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.690

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.190
 Below are the view and elliot 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.510
 options this very interesting 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.320
 because those are there for us 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.910
 display 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.830
 we look purely times 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.270
 with which view the calendar to 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.240
 example now starts the question 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.120
 after the first day of the week from the state 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.950
 I've used the last one now 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.450
 I personally like the set 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.710
 list in itself quite like how can you 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.150

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.200
 hour I find it quite well for law 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.030
 clear if you always with hours 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.540

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.620
 little room for driving and the 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.150
 change to the next place 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.910
 otherwise there are still all options 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.510
 there is the standard 15 minutes earlier 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.740

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.350

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.810
 to take care of the alarm but he will 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.610
 automatically with the newly entered 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.440
 otherwise dates one too early 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.140
 there are the task options below 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.460
 there you can choose if the 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.010
 task management which is integrated 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.570
 in the calendar with the ios memorial 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.130
 application should be adjusted 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.300
 if you activate this below then 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.520
 he asks if he cares about the memories 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.990

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.160
 the different views of the 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.110

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.390
 Here you can just his finger 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.490
 stop and then so im 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.140
 quarter of an hour went somewhere 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.550
 click and say everything clearly to that 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.290
 I would like to make a new appointment 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.660
 We do not create that one now 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.220
 have a week view standard week 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.690
 finally , it should be known 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.400
 they are also appropriate 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.140
 colored depending on which 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.710
 colors selected in iphone calendar 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.570
 were 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.669
 we only have months to ourselves here too 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.080
 since Immerse your dates and 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.740

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.780

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.600
 again one 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.840
 small introduction to how can I a 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.000
 skip 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.820
 Then you see what todo tasks 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.350
 I am starting in my box drama otherwise 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.850

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.940
 look there you even have one 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:48.180
 a bit more space can be so long 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.280
 scrolling on the calendar gets as I said 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.190
 in all new screens still 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.500
 a little explanation and the 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.000
 usually knows or knows bavarian will 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.120
 know that we have a great preference for 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.620
 rattle, that we have more or less 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.570
 all applications from the 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.580
 software forge really comes 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.710
 they can be recommended constantly 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.780
 updated 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.400
 the pds expert is by far the best 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.500
 pdf management tool what you personally 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.970
 know and also the calendar here who 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.400
 did not use any of the plus that became 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.110
 he last offers free I think 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.690
 easy in preparation for this 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:25.550
 update calendar 5 we can 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:28.650
 Also calendar 5 really recommend 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.270
 The application will be there new application 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.550
 that could be distributed in the app store 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.200
 Just take Apple's decisions 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.540
 together no upgrades to offer 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.919
 but either a new application 

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.660
 to spend or even in app 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.610
 To put purchases and rebell says here 

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.530
 very clearly in the break, he does not 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.120
 We will issue this as a new application 

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.430
 the old one works for free after 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.960
 still can thus be used alternatively 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:53.610
 and by and large it was 

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.900
 the first time here with I think we are 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.720
 through the feature 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.910
 come look at this is how 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.380
 said our talented applications 

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.180
 we now have here on the homescreen 

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.610
 which we use daily 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.770
 all because of this simple variant 

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.750
 We like to add new dates 

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.310
 very good shows everything what they show 

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:14.010
 should have this google integration with 

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:16.700
 Trainer and gets two thumbs up 

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.700
 Thank you for watching
