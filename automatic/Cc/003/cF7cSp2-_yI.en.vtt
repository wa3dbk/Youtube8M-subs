of the arm here I'm going to put all my

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.270 
of the arm here I'm going to put all my
weight<00:02:06.729> on<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.210> arm<00:02:07.360> as<00:02:07.690> I<00:02:07.930> get<00:02:08.140> up<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:09.130> can

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
weight on the arm as I get up and I can

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.250 
weight on the arm as I get up and I can
run<00:02:09.429> away<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:16.209> one<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.660> concepts<00:02:17.110> in

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
run away so one of the concepts in

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.559 
run away so one of the concepts in
modern<00:02:17.530> Arni's<00:02:17.800> is<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.790> we<00:02:19.090> think<00:02:19.270> it's<00:02:19.390> all

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
modern Arni's is that we think it's all

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.479 
modern Arni's is that we think it's all
the<00:02:19.750> same<00:02:19.959> whether<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.560> would<00:02:20.680> stick<00:02:21.100> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
the same whether you would stick the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.420 
the same whether you would stick the
knife<00:02:21.730> empty<00:02:22.450> hand<00:02:22.750> other<00:02:23.020> weapons<00:02:23.470> all<00:02:24.130> the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
knife empty hand other weapons all the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.979 
knife empty hand other weapons all the
same<00:02:24.640> set<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:24.940> techniques<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.600> we<00:02:25.690> take<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
same set of techniques so we take the

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.560 
same set of techniques so we take the
same<00:02:26.230> drill<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.070> will<00:02:27.340> apply<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.640> multiple

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
same drill and will apply it multiple

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.330 
same drill and will apply it multiple
situations<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:29.500> means<00:02:29.709> you<00:02:29.800> can<00:02:29.890> spend<00:02:30.250> less

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
situations this means you can spend less

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.360 
situations this means you can spend less
time<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.970> dojo<00:02:31.590> more<00:02:32.590> time<00:02:32.800> doing<00:02:33.160> things

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
time in the dojo more time doing things

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.820 
time in the dojo more time doing things
that<00:02:33.519> you<00:02:33.730> love<00:02:34.080> maybe<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.410> in<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.650> dojo

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
that you love maybe that is in the dojo

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.830 
that you love maybe that is in the dojo
