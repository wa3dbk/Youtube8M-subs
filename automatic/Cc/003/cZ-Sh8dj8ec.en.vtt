and<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:33.299> other<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.600> exit<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.409> just

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
and the other one is exit so it's just

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.950 
and the other one is exit so it's just
very<00:01:34.740> simple<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.640> click<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.270> the

very simple just click that and the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.350 
very simple just click that and the
software<00:01:37.290> closes<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.549> good<00:01:38.759> thing<00:01:38.939> about<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
software closes the good thing about it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.620 
software closes the good thing about it
is<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:40.799> we've<00:01:41.430> created<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
is that we we've created it so that the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.410 
is that we we've created it so that the
last<00:01:42.899> set<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.649> information<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.759> had<00:01:45.030> in

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
last set of information that you had in

last set of information that you had in
the<00:01:45.780> software<00:01:46.140> will<00:01:47.130> sit<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.630> exit<00:01:49.079> out

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the software will sit so if we exit out

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.130 
the software will sit so if we exit out
of<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.970> all<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.299> information<00:01:51.479> will<00:01:52.110> be

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
of that all of this information will be

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.280 
of that all of this information will be
retained<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.790> will<00:01:53.909> only<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.210> changed<00:01:55.079> if

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
retained and it will only be changed if

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.219 
retained and it will only be changed if
we<00:01:55.619> change<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.420> now<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.990> information

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
we change it now that that information

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.200 
we change it now that that information
there<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.280> don't<00:01:59.549> need<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.820> get<00:02:00.000> rid<00:02:00.180> of
