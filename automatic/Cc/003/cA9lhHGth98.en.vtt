00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
synthesis is I don't know how you say

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.649 
synthesis is I don't know how you say
that<00:01:28.770> word<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> think<00:01:29.040> since<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.700> syntheses

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that word I think since that syntheses

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.030 
that word I think since that syntheses
would<00:01:30.960> probably<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> correct<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
would probably be the correct one and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.380 
would probably be the correct one and
that<00:01:32.310> sounds<00:01:32.549> stupid<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.939> video<00:01:33.150> I'm<00:01:33.240> probably

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that sounds stupid in video I'm probably

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.240 
that sounds stupid in video I'm probably
going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.659> cut<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.840> out<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.590> yeah<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:35.070> these

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
going to cut it out but yeah in these

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.530 
going to cut it out but yeah in these
