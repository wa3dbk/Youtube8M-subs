don't<00:00:22.230> worry<00:00:22.289> about<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.529> few<00:00:22.680> normally<00:00:22.920> fly

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
don't worry about a few normally fly

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.250 
don't worry about a few normally fly
airliners<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:24.119> don't<00:00:24.300> want<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.900> an<00:00:25.050> intern

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
airliners you don't want to do an intern

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.929 
airliners you don't want to do an intern
airliner<00:00:25.590> trust<00:00:25.980> me<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.130> didn't<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.640> 11

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
airliner trust me I didn't have the 11

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.250 
airliner trust me I didn't have the 11
that<00:00:27.090> was<00:00:27.210> pretty<00:00:27.390> cool<00:00:27.539> though<00:00:27.689> anyways<00:00:28.050> back

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
that was pretty cool though anyways back

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.960 
that was pretty cool though anyways back
to<00:00:28.320> what<00:00:28.439> we're<00:00:28.619> doing<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:29.550> first<00:00:29.789> one<00:00:29.910> here

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
to what we're doing this first one here

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.470 
to what we're doing this first one here
of<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> pellets<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.840> slow<00:00:31.140> his<00:00:32.070> good<00:00:32.480> landing

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
of the pellets to slow his good landing

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.479 
of the pellets to slow his good landing
approach<00:00:33.660> altitude<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.890> again<00:00:35.070> he's<00:00:35.280> too

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
approach altitude but again he's too

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.250 
approach altitude but again he's too
slow<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.790> he's<00:00:36.210> flying<00:00:36.450> away<00:00:36.570> too<00:00:36.719> much<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
slow and he's flying away too much and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.170 
slow and he's flying away too much and
so<00:00:37.920> that's<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> make<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.730> problem<00:00:39.030> where

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
so that's going to make a problem where

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.350 
so that's going to make a problem where
from<00:00:39.570> going<00:00:39.780> from<00:00:40.020> correct<00:00:40.790> landing<00:00:41.790> altitude

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
from going from correct landing altitude

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.979 
from going from correct landing altitude
to<00:00:43.050> too<00:00:43.320> low<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.250> too<00:00:44.430> low<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:45.210> really<00:00:45.570> too<00:00:45.750> low

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
to too low the too low to really too low

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.810 
to too low the too low to really too low
and<00:00:46.260> then<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.680> hear<00:00:46.950> where<00:00:47.160> he<00:00:47.309> touches<00:00:47.670> down

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
and then to hear where he touches down

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.250 
and then to hear where he touches down
right<00:00:48.120> before<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.539> beginning<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.930> runway

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
right before the beginning in the runway

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.290 
right before the beginning in the runway
though<00:00:49.980> here<00:00:50.219> he<00:00:50.430> should<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:50.700> coming<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.120> I

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
though here he should be coming in I

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.299 
though here he should be coming in I
don't<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.629> baby<00:00:51.930> will<00:00:52.260> say<00:00:52.500> 10<00:00:52.800> maybe<00:00:53.070> even

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
don't know baby will say 10 maybe even

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.220 
don't know baby will say 10 maybe even
20<00:00:53.579> knots<00:00:53.850> faster<00:00:54.090> yeah<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:54.930> about<00:00:55.020> right

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
20 knots faster yeah it's about right

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.040 
20 knots faster yeah it's about right
maybe<00:00:55.469> 170<00:00:56.100> 180<00:00:56.489> knots<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.690> he<00:00:57.840> touched

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
maybe 170 180 knots and I he touched

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.869 
maybe 170 180 knots and I he touched
down<00:00:58.199> way<00:00:58.710> farther<00:00:58.949> out<00:00:59.129> than<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.399> now<00:00:59.520> here

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
down way farther out than that now here

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.599 
down way farther out than that now here
747<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.020> too<00:01:01.170> high<00:01:01.379> now<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.039> guys<00:01:02.250> know<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
747 is too high now you guys know I

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.130 
747 is too high now you guys know I
don't<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:03.090> doing<00:01:03.300> go<00:01:03.510> around<00:01:03.750> unless<00:01:03.930> it's

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
don't like doing go around unless it's

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.240 
don't like doing go around unless it's
really<00:01:04.470> needed<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.630> year<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.380> pretty

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
really needed and so this year is pretty

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.350 
really needed and so this year is pretty
much<00:01:08.400> perfect<00:01:09.049> because<00:01:10.049> he's<00:01:10.950> too<00:01:11.159> high<00:01:11.360> he

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
much perfect because he's too high he

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.179 
much perfect because he's too high he
puts<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.810> spoilers<00:01:13.200> loses<00:01:13.770> speed<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
puts in spoilers loses speed and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.190 
puts in spoilers loses speed and
altitude<00:01:14.340> correctly<00:01:15.330> he<00:01:15.750> takes<00:01:15.990> him<00:01:16.140> out

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
altitude correctly he takes him out

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.800 
altitude correctly he takes him out
early<00:01:16.530> enough<00:01:16.650> touches<00:01:17.460> down<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.570> about

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
early enough touches down just about

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.260 
early enough touches down just about
perfectly<00:01:19.409> now<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.400> he<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:20.850> at<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> correct

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
perfectly now if he was at the correct

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.670 
perfectly now if he was at the correct
altitude<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:22.080> would<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.439> been<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.590> perfect

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
altitude that would have been a perfect

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.469 
altitude that would have been a perfect
landing<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.490> he<00:01:23.580> started<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:23.939> too<00:01:24.119> high<00:01:24.270> but

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
landing but he started out too high but

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.480 
landing but he started out too high but
he<00:01:24.570> made<00:01:24.750> correct<00:01:25.049> rhesus<00:01:25.320> pooler's<00:01:25.650> which<00:01:26.310> if

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
he made correct rhesus pooler's which if

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.609 
he made correct rhesus pooler's which if
you<00:01:26.580> use<00:01:26.729> correct<00:01:27.000> spoilers<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:28.320> I'll<00:01:28.590> just

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you use correct spoilers then I'll just

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.469 
you use correct spoilers then I'll just
like<00:01:29.159> kiss<00:01:29.369> your<00:01:29.549> feet<00:01:29.700> right<00:01:29.939> there<00:01:30.000> i<00:01:30.270> mean

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it's not many people do it so really

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.840 
it's not many people do it so really
work<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.549> too<00:01:35.700> fast

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
work on it this one here going too fast

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.270 
work on it this one here going too fast
too<00:01:36.210> low<00:01:36.420> uses<00:01:37.229> spoilers<00:01:37.409> causing<00:01:38.100> him<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
too low uses spoilers causing him to

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
a go around like me then do a correct

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.550 
a go around like me then do a correct
approach<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:35.690> know<00:02:35.780> here<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.140> pilots<00:02:36.380> coming

it'll<00:02:40.790> make<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.940> correct<00:02:41.240> decision<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.750> go

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
it'll make a correct decision and go

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.140 
it'll make a correct decision and go
around<00:02:42.110> right<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.440> there<00:02:42.760> now<00:02:43.760> here<00:02:44.030> is

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
around right in there now here is

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.360 
around right in there now here is
another<00:02:44.180> correct<00:02:44.720> approach<00:02:45.130> good<00:02:46.130> landing

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
another correct approach good landing

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.220 
another correct approach good landing
speed<00:02:46.760> you'll<00:02:47.300> notice<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.660> flaps<00:02:47.870> are<00:02:48.050> down

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230

from there I was about six miles out
when<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.810> started<00:02:54.020> this<00:02:54.140> lining<00:02:54.410> approach

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
when I started this lining approach

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.400 
when I started this lining approach
coming<00:02:55.820> down<00:02:55.970> flare<00:02:56.690> right<00:02:56.930> there<00:02:57.110> towards

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
for the two larger solids rectangles you

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.350 
for the two larger solids rectangles you
want<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.489> try<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.610> land<00:03:04.820> before<00:03:05.000> that

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360
