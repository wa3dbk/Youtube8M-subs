00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.779 

so<00:01:22.829> we<00:01:23.039> need<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:25.039> so<00:01:26.039> what<00:01:26.189> we're<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> do

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
so we need to so what we're going to do

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:38.980 
so we need to so what we're going to do
is<00:01:26.969> stand<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.509> platform

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.960 

kill<00:01:39.990> yes<00:01:40.439> there<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:40.920> go<00:01:42.979> whereas<00:01:43.979> now<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> giant

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
kill yes there we go whereas now a giant

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.240 
kill yes there we go whereas now a giant
automaton<00:01:45.509> will<00:01:45.720> come<00:01:45.930> or<00:01:46.140> two<00:01:46.380> even<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:47.039> them

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
automaton will come or two even of them

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.620 
automaton will come or two even of them
will<00:01:47.430> come

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
will come

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:07.310 
will come
so<00:01:49.930> just<00:01:50.170> toss<00:01:50.380> manage<00:01:50.860> those<00:01:51.490> multiple<00:01:52.060> days

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.130 

okay<00:02:08.320> so<00:02:08.380> that<00:02:08.890> we're<00:02:09.130> ghosts

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
okay so that we're ghosts

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.250 
okay so that we're ghosts
now<00:02:11.590> that'll<00:02:11.920> be<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.070> scorpion<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:13.630> just<00:02:14.020> stay

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
now that'll be a scorpion so just stay

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.020 
now that'll be a scorpion so just stay
on<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.830> elevator<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:18.010> really<00:02:18.430> nasty<00:02:18.610> but<00:02:18.910> it

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
on this elevator is really nasty but it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.890 
on this elevator is really nasty but it
will<00:02:19.180> help<00:02:19.360> you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
will help you

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.600 
will help you
so<00:02:20.350> it's<00:02:20.560> count<00:02:20.770> protects<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.220> when<00:02:21.400> you're

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
so it's count protects you when you're

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.140 
so it's count protects you when you're
on<00:02:21.880> this<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.890> can<00:02:24.010> kill<00:02:24.250> them<00:02:24.400> with<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.970> couple

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
on this you can kill them with a couple

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:38.670 
on this you can kill them with a couple
options<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:26.530> their<00:02:26.710> base

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.270 

but<00:02:39.010> now<00:02:39.250> we<00:02:39.310> need<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.849> be<00:02:40.030> on<00:02:40.239> this<00:02:40.450> elevator

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
but now we need to be on this elevator

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.430 
but now we need to be on this elevator
or<00:02:42.280> almost

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.830 

Yesi

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
Yesi

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.990 
Yesi
we<00:02:49.840> should<00:02:50.290> open<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.680> chest<00:02:50.950> before<00:02:51.520> that<00:02:51.760> time

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
we should open a chest before that time

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.750 
we should open a chest before that time
because<00:02:52.900> otherwise<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.560> don't<00:02:53.770> have<00:02:53.890> time<00:02:54.130> to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
because otherwise you don't have time to

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.140 
because otherwise you don't have time to
open<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:57.100> is<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.310> two<00:02:57.520> inch<00:02:57.700> drop<00:02:57.970> to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
open it this is a two inch drop to

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.000 
open it this is a two inch drop to
survive<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:02.080> now<00:03:02.260> we're<00:03:02.410> at<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.500> turtle

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
survive so now we're at the turtle

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:12.429 
survive so now we're at the turtle
docking<00:03:03.370> bay<00:03:04.440> we<00:03:05.440> can<00:03:05.650> right

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.649 

so<00:03:13.439> shall<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.709> do<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.090> now<00:03:15.090> we<00:03:15.299> have<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.540> do

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
so shall we do that now we have to do

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.640 
so shall we do that now we have to do
that<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.959> course<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.079> will<00:03:19.230> be<00:03:19.379> one<00:03:19.530> of

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
that of course so this will be one of

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.130 
that of course so this will be one of
the<00:03:19.739> trickiest<00:03:20.129> parts<00:03:20.700> as<00:03:21.480> well<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.930> this

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
the trickiest parts as well of this

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.820 
the trickiest parts as well of this
level

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.800 

we're<00:03:26.340> going<00:03:26.520> to<00:03:26.610> write<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.850> turtle<00:03:27.300> up<00:03:27.540> there

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
we're going to write a turtle up there

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.650 
we're going to write a turtle up there
will<00:03:27.960> be<00:03:28.250> some<00:03:29.250> tricky<00:03:29.730> business<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:32.660> it

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
will be some tricky business and it

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.330 
will be some tricky business and it
always<00:03:34.020> looks<00:03:34.170> like<00:03:34.560> you're<00:03:34.710> going<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:34.980> fall

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
