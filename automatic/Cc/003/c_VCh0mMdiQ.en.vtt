00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
to show you so here are the treads and

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.390 
to show you so here are the treads and
as<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.380> can<00:03:09.440> see<00:03:09.590> there<00:03:09.799> there's<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.250> bit<00:03:10.370> of

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
as you can see there there's a bit of

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.920 
as you can see there there's a bit of
weathering<00:03:10.850> on<00:03:10.940> them<00:03:11.150> which<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.540> just<00:03:11.720> used<00:03:11.840> to

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
weathering on them which I just used to

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.960 
weathering on them which I just used to
an<00:03:12.019> airbrush<00:03:12.350> do<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.530> quick<00:03:12.880> weathering<00:03:13.880> on

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
an airbrush do a quick weathering on

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.460 
an airbrush do a quick weathering on
them<00:03:14.090> as<00:03:14.209> well<00:03:14.359> as<00:03:14.450> on<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.660> bottom<00:03:15.079> here

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
them as well as on the bottom here

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.479 
them as well as on the bottom here
because<00:03:15.680> that's<00:03:15.739> where<00:03:15.889> the<00:03:15.980> mud<00:03:16.160> would<00:03:16.310> be

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
because that's where the mud would be

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:23.979 
because that's where the mud would be
thrown<00:03:17.209> on<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:19.489> right<00:03:20.470> there<00:03:22.810> awesome<00:03:23.810> stuff

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
thrown on the right there awesome stuff

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.559 
thrown on the right there awesome stuff
and<00:03:26.560> brighten<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.620> up<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:28.040> little<00:03:28.340> bit<00:03:28.540> there<00:03:29.540> we

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
and brighten it up a little bit there we

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.229 
and brighten it up a little bit there we
go

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:40.339

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
weathering effect on it as well here's

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.070 
weathering effect on it as well here's
the<00:04:20.199> back<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:21.060> pretty<00:04:22.060> standard<00:04:22.479> just<00:04:22.930> the

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
the back and pretty standard just the

gold symbol and the weathering on the
tracks<00:04:26.650> once<00:04:26.919> again<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:30.070> here's<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.669> other

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
tracks once again and here's the other

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.689 
tracks once again and here's the other
side<00:04:31.440> of<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.590> Rhino<00:04:32.800> so<00:04:33.400> again<00:04:33.580> that's

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
side of the Rhino so again that's

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.580 
side of the Rhino so again that's
ultimately<00:04:34.030> these<00:04:34.630> are<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.960> custom<00:04:35.350> doors

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
ultimately these are the custom doors

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.189 
ultimately these are the custom doors
from<00:04:36.220> 4-fold<00:04:36.849> they're<00:04:37.510> not<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.810> standard

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
from 4-fold they're not the standard

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.080 
from 4-fold they're not the standard
