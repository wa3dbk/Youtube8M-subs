00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
have slow running water like this maybe

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.580 
have slow running water like this maybe
you<00:02:37.340> guys<00:02:37.430> already<00:02:37.700> know<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.090> but<00:02:38.590> instead

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
you guys already know this but instead

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.470 
you guys already know this but instead
of<00:02:39.709> just<00:02:39.860> dumping<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.970> know<00:02:41.090> kind<00:02:41.420> of

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
of just dumping it in you know kind of

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.670 
of just dumping it in you know kind of
like<00:02:41.540> this<00:02:42.640> which<00:02:43.640> works<00:02:43.940> obviously<00:02:46.330> yeah

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
like this which works obviously yeah

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.340 
like this which works obviously yeah
kind<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.769> stand<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.280> up<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.580> little<00:02:49.700> more<00:02:50.350> almost

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
kind of stand it up a little more almost

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.860 
kind of stand it up a little more almost
straight<00:02:51.650> up<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.980> down<00:02:52.040> like<00:02:52.569> this<00:02:53.569> it<00:02:53.840> makes

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
straight up and down like this it makes

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.600 
straight up and down like this it makes
it<00:02:54.140> turbulence<00:02:54.680> behind<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.280> can<00:02:55.400> see

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
it turbulence behind that you can see

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.280 
it turbulence behind that you can see
that<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.650> kind<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:58.510> gets<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.660> other<00:02:59.930> dirt

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
that and it kind of gets the other dirt

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.650 
that and it kind of gets the other dirt
go<00:03:01.220> back<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.609> forth<00:03:01.820> you<00:03:02.090> know<00:03:02.500> kind<00:03:03.500> of<00:03:03.590> get

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
go back and forth you know kind of get

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.699 
go back and forth you know kind of get
behind<00:03:05.660> there<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:05.989> dirt<00:03:06.200> out<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.440> first

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
behind there that dirt out of the first

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.729 
behind there that dirt out of the first
ripple<00:03:07.870> it's<00:03:08.870> kind<00:03:09.019> of<00:03:09.109> getting<00:03:09.260> backed<00:03:09.530> up

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
ripple it's kind of getting backed up

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.819 
ripple it's kind of getting backed up
right<00:03:10.010> now<00:03:10.160> we're<00:03:10.609> getting<00:03:10.700> ready<00:03:10.850> to<00:03:10.970> go<00:03:11.120> home

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
right now we're getting ready to go home

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.890 
right now we're getting ready to go home
so<00:03:13.090> that's<00:03:14.090> kind<00:03:14.299> of<00:03:14.329> straight<00:03:14.570> up<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:14.870> down

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
so that's kind of straight up and down

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.300 
so that's kind of straight up and down
works<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.850> just<00:03:16.850> said<00:03:17.090> behind<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.780> makes<00:03:17.870> a

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
works I just said behind it it makes a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.090 
works I just said behind it it makes a
nice<00:03:19.310> little<00:03:19.549> ripple<00:03:20.000> or<00:03:20.739> turbulence<00:03:21.739> anyways

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
nice little ripple or turbulence anyways

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:32.080 
nice little ripple or turbulence anyways
and<00:03:22.280> it<00:03:22.400> works<00:03:22.730> pretty<00:03:22.850> good<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:26.829> again<00:03:31.090> other

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
and it works pretty good so again other

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.880 
and it works pretty good so again other
prospectors<00:03:33.049> down<00:03:33.290> there<00:03:33.530> we've<00:03:33.799> been

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
prospectors down there we've been

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.259 
prospectors down there we've been
working<00:03:34.100> on<00:03:34.280> this<00:03:34.459> whole<00:03:35.709> another<00:03:36.709> whole<00:03:37.269> lots
