I'm<00:01:37.890> actually<00:01:38.370> in<00:01:38.820> EV<00:01:39.150> mode<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.230> soon<00:01:40.410> as

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
I'm actually in EV mode and as soon as

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.220 
I'm actually in EV mode and as soon as
we<00:01:40.680> saw<00:01:40.860> changed

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
we saw changed

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.460 
we saw changed
I<00:01:44.000> think<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.150> a<00:01:45.240> little<00:01:45.330> bit<00:01:45.450> brighter<00:01:45.630> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
I think it's a little bit brighter and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.860 
I think it's a little bit brighter and
then<00:01:46.650> if<00:01:46.800> we<00:01:46.920> turn<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.250> up<00:01:47.340> again<00:01:47.510> I'm<00:01:48.510> going<00:01:48.780> to

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
then if we turn it up again I'm going to

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.960 
then if we turn it up again I'm going to
focus<00:01:49.020> modes<00:01:49.410> of<00:01:49.620> demons<00:01:50.370> down<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.760> gives<00:01:50.910> you

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
focus modes of demons down and gives you

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.910 
focus modes of demons down and gives you
the<00:01:51.060> best<00:01:51.180> battery<00:01:51.450> life<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:52.050> eco<00:01:52.740> mode

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the best battery life but eco mode

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.230 
the best battery life but eco mode
actually<00:01:53.250> gives<00:01:53.400> you<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.580> best<00:01:53.700> battery<00:01:53.970> life
