00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.530
The lighthouse generator is an amazing scientific
model. For making this your require Neodymium

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:12.530
magnets, 35-gauge insulated copper wire, old
CD, and a lot of other material. Take 35-gauge

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.550
insulated copper wire and wind 1000 turns
on an old film can. Remove the coil and place

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.460
a pen inside the coil. Make a hole in the
pen and remove the two ends of the wire through

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.040
the pen. Scrape the two ends of insulation
and attach an LED to the ends of the coil.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.829
Now you can see that the pen is inside the
coil and the two ends go through the pen and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.829
are attached to the LED. Fix the LED to the
end of the pen. This is the complete coil

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.950
and the rotating pen. If you spin two strong
magnets near the coil, EMF will be generated

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.950
and the LED would light up. Now take an old
CD and cut three parts. You require two rectangular

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.930
strips and a square portion with the hole
in the middle. Fix with glue the lid of a

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.710
film can to the square. Take a press button
and fix the part with the trough in the middle

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.710
of a wooden base. Stand four wooden pillars
as shown. Apply glue on the top of these pillars

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.979
and fix the square CD piece on them. It is
through the hole in the middle that the pen

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.280
will come out. These are 4 strong Neodymium
magnets. Stick 2 magnets back-to-back on a

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.159
piece of rectangular plastic CD. Make two
such strips with two-two magnets each and

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:01.939
glue them on to the pillars as shown. This
is the final foundation of the Lighthouse

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.700
generator. Now slip in the pen that the tip
of the pen sits in the press button. Ensure

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.700
that the pen spins smoothly. This is the view
of the Lighthouse generator from all sides.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.310
On spinning the pen the coil will spin inside
the magnets and the LED will light up! You

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.870
can see this much better in the dark. If you
spin the pen the coil spins between the magnets

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.650
and an EMF is generated and the LED lights
up. This is a variation. Instead of a wooden

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.650
base you can have a piece of rubber and you
can have 4 pencils. Once you spin the pen

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.040
the coil rotates inside the magnets and the
LED lights up just like a Light House.
