00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.030
 Hello there, this is the first video of 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:15.210
 let's say a whole series of videos about 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:17.850
 games on dns smartphone with 40 50 m why 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.470
 from the series because so many 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:27.980
 wishes that is there and asphalt 8 is and 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:31.859
 people ask for real racing there 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.050
 modern combat that is, well, a lot of games 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.140
 so I decided to cut them somehow 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.809
 so that the video is not received with 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.559
 pocket video to not get 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.010
 huge 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.579
 if I'm going to do everything in one review 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.059
 videos 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.309
 that is, it will be us in about an hour 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.510
 I guess you don't need it. 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.579
 strongly inside will 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.579
 and the second aspect is that much regret 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.180
 when I began it means I started to put everything 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.420
 games that is my flash drive for 16 gigabytes 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.320
 just could not stand that is past 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.439
 there are two games vidiq it just did not go 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.140
 already on it that is, the cache and become so 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.100
 healthy that is 2 to 3 gigabytes then 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.290
 Well, where is the plan for today? 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.990
 the most pleasant the most long-awaited 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:33.990
 and the largest number of questions about 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:38.610
 these games gta gta will be with us now 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.600
 try to focus gta wai city 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.189
 nikita san andreas means let's get started 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.189
 with you 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:28.840
 in the settings it means let's see at once what 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.840
 we have maximum settings 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.709
 I performed with your mix 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:33.580
 then watch the game pony game at first 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.239
 sorry hangs somehow some ghouls 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.120
 kenny 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:43.590
 well, literally the very beginning that is 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.590
 let's look at the sign 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:09.519
 let's try the car ride but 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.519
 here are the roles and see 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.810
 that is, you see that everything is at max. 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:36.180
 goes without glitches and the village that is, no 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:36.180
 there are no cheese problems 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.740
 san andreas 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:00.680
 go to the construction site put the display 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.680
 special effects set maximum 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:17.030
 set the drawing distance completely 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:17.030
 turn shadows do back 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.630
 well let's get started 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:09.809
 Here is such a garbage shorter than a miracle 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:09.809
 it happened and the game does not go to max. 

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:18.580
 let's try to make settings there 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:21.209
 by default and see how we have 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.209
 will be by default 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:32.639
 do by default 

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:32.639
 so back for me these 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:41.180
 everything goes fine that is to play quite 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.180
 that is possible 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.450
 the area around his neck 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:18.390
 that is, the treasure is all ok play 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.380
 possible on the settings of the full but 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:24.740
 honestly i was hoping for a miracle a lot 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:30.150
 There are no miracles in the world 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:40.700
