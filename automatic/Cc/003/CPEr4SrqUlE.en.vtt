reduce costs and I hope they're not

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.899 
reduce costs and I hope they're not
cutting<00:01:55.680> too<00:01:55.920> many<00:01:56.130> cuz<00:01:56.370> we<00:01:56.490> don't<00:01:56.670> want<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
cutting too many cuz we don't want to

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.040 
cutting too many cuz we don't want to
deal<00:01:57.060> with<00:01:57.090> another<00:01:57.390> red<00:01:57.690> ring<00:01:57.870> of<00:01:57.990> death

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
deal with another red ring of death

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.260 
deal with another red ring of death
Microsoft<00:01:58.979> still<00:01:59.250> has<00:01:59.400> to<00:01:59.550> recoup<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.030> money

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
Microsoft still has to recoup the money

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.030 
Microsoft still has to recoup the money
for<00:02:00.570> research<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.140> development<00:02:01.229> even<00:02:01.860> if

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
for research and development even if

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.290 
for research and development even if
they're<00:02:02.159> using<00:02:02.430> off-the-shelf<00:02:02.580> parts

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
they're using off-the-shelf parts

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.360 
they're using off-the-shelf parts
especially<00:02:04.080> if<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.170> system<00:02:04.650> is<00:02:04.740> very<00:02:04.950> small

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
especially if that system is very small

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.100 
especially if that system is very small
that's<00:02:05.580> gonna<00:02:05.700> take<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.000> lot<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.420> manpower<00:02:06.720> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that's gonna take a lot of manpower to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.899 
that's gonna take a lot of manpower to
make<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> motherboard<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.220> will<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.640> able<00:02:08.789> to

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909 
make a motherboard that will be able to

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.910 
make a motherboard that will be able to
fit<00:02:09.209> all<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.659> technology<00:02:10.050> inside<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.830> it

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
fit all that technology inside of it

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.649 
fit all that technology inside of it
like<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.129> said<00:02:11.280> Microsoft<00:02:11.730> no<00:02:12.269> one's<00:02:12.450> going<00:02:12.629> to

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
like I said Microsoft no one's going to

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.509 
like I said Microsoft no one's going to
tolerate<00:02:13.110> another<00:02:13.379> red<00:02:13.709> ring<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.010> death<00:02:14.069> and

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
tolerate another red ring of death and

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.550 
tolerate another red ring of death and
if<00:02:14.849> they<00:02:15.150> mean<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.810> next<00:02:15.959> generation

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
if they mean that the next generation

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.440 
if they mean that the next generation
Xbox<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.310> going<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.610> be<00:02:17.700> cheaper<00:02:18.209> than<00:02:18.239> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
Xbox is going to be cheaper than the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.270 
Xbox is going to be cheaper than the
current<00:02:18.840> generation<00:02:19.349> consoles<00:02:19.769> at<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> price

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
current generation consoles at the price

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.220 
current generation consoles at the price
they<00:02:20.489> are<00:02:20.519> now<00:02:20.909> how<00:02:21.330> much<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.810> leap<00:02:22.049> in

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
they are now how much of a leap in

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.720 
they are now how much of a leap in
technology<00:02:22.409> really<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.280> there<00:02:23.459> going<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.610> be

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
technology really is there going to be

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.430 
technology really is there going to be
inside<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.690> going<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:24.959> just<00:02:25.290> as

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
inside of it is it going to be just as

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.420 
inside of it is it going to be just as
powerful<00:02:25.950> as<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.280> Wii<00:02:26.459> U<00:02:26.700> or<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.150> it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
powerful as the Wii U or is it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.640 
powerful as the Wii U or is it
be<00:02:27.579> actually<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> next-generation<00:02:28.780> system

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
be actually a next-generation system

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.440 
be actually a next-generation system
because<00:02:29.920> like<00:02:30.129> I<00:02:30.280> said<00:02:30.519> in<00:02:30.640> previous<00:02:30.849> videos

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
because like I said in previous videos

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.270 
because like I said in previous videos
if<00:02:31.689> there's<00:02:31.870> not<00:02:32.049> a<00:02:32.079> huge<00:02:32.500> leap<00:02:32.590> in<00:02:33.099> technology

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
if there's not a huge leap in technology

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.309 
if there's not a huge leap in technology
a<00:02:33.790> lot<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.239> people<00:02:34.569> are<00:02:34.719> going<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.959> be<00:02:35.049> turned

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
a lot of people are going to be turned

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.759 
a lot of people are going to be turned
off

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
off

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.530 
off
Nintendo's<00:02:36.250> next-generation<00:02:36.700> console<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
Nintendo's next-generation console the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.300 
Nintendo's next-generation console the
Wii<00:02:37.569> U<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.049> a<00:02:38.079> different<00:02:38.500> story<00:02:38.769> because<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
Wii U is a different story because the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.699 
Wii U is a different story because the
original<00:02:39.579> we<00:02:39.969> had<00:02:40.209> GameCube<00:02:40.780> graphics<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:41.590> if

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
original we had GameCube graphics but if

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.369 
original we had GameCube graphics but if
the<00:02:41.799> Xbox<00:02:42.129> 720<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:43.269> not<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.510> huge<00:02:43.870> lead<00:02:44.139> people

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
the Xbox 720 is not a huge lead people

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.559 
the Xbox 720 is not a huge lead people
will<00:02:44.650> just<00:02:44.829> want<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.040> stay<00:02:45.189> with<00:02:45.219> the<00:02:45.489> Xbox<00:02:45.909> 360

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
will just want to stay with the Xbox 360

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.179 
will just want to stay with the Xbox 360
so<00:02:46.750> what's<00:02:46.959> your<00:02:47.170> take<00:02:47.379> on<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:47.709> do<00:02:47.889> you<00:02:47.980> think

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
so what's your take on this do you think

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:49.709 
so what's your take on this do you think
Microsoft<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.879> make<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> next-generation

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:49.719 
Microsoft can make a next-generation

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.959 
Microsoft can make a next-generation
console<00:02:50.560> that's<00:02:50.709> actually<00:02:51.280> cheaper<00:02:51.700> than<00:02:51.849> the

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:51.969 
console that's actually cheaper than the

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.690 
console that's actually cheaper than the
Xbox<00:02:52.359> 360<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.260> if<00:02:53.439> what<00:02:53.709> ms<00:02:53.980> nerd<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.430> saying

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
Xbox 360 and if what ms nerd is saying

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.940 
Xbox 360 and if what ms nerd is saying
is<00:02:54.909> true<00:02:55.239> is<00:02:55.510> this<00:02:55.689> next-generation<00:02:56.049> console

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
is true is this next-generation console

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.679 
is true is this next-generation console
going<00:02:57.099> to<00:02:57.159> be<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.280> huge<00:02:57.609> leap<00:02:57.879> from<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.209> Xbox
