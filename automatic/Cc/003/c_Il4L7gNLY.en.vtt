00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
add each image image number so mine's

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.110 
add each image image number so mine's
like<00:00:31.050> i<00:00:31.140> said<00:00:31.410> all<00:00:31.830> my<00:00:32.130> images<00:00:32.309> are<00:00:32.579> part<00:00:33.059> of

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
like i said all my images are part of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.049 
like i said all my images are part of
group<00:00:33.300> 0<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.350> i<00:00:34.440> said<00:00:34.469> each<00:00:35.250> image<00:00:35.640> has

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
group 0 but like i said each image has

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.690 
group 0 but like i said each image has
their<00:00:36.300> own<00:00:36.329> number<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.469> my<00:00:37.620> first<00:00:37.829> image<00:00:38.489> right

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
their own number so my first image right

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.850 
their own number so my first image right
here<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:39.239> group<00:00:39.989> 0<00:00:40.280> image0<00:00:41.690> but<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:43.110> second

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
here is group 0 image0 but my second

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.940 
here is group 0 image0 but my second
image<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.309> group<00:00:44.820> 0<00:00:44.850> image<00:00:45.660> 1<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.680> forth

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
image is group 0 image 1 and so forth

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.970 
image is group 0 image 1 and so forth
and<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.280> okay<00:00:48.210> now<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:49.410> won't<00:00:49.530> move<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and so on okay now we won't move on to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.920 
and so on okay now we won't move on to
the<00:00:50.070> next<00:00:50.100> step<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.579> very<00:00:50.789> easy<00:00:50.940> remember<00:00:51.780> like

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the next step is very easy remember like

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.930 
the next step is very easy remember like
I<00:00:52.020> said<00:00:52.260> remember<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> death<00:00:53.280> file<00:00:53.520> from

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
I said remember the death file from

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.939 
I said remember the death file from
stage<00:00:54.210> zero<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.870> yet<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.260> tweak<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.770> in

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
stage zero and yet to tweak it up in

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.889 
stage zero and yet to tweak it up in
order<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> make<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:56.550> stage<00:00:56.760> well<00:00:57.420> remembered

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
order to make your stage well remembered

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.080 
order to make your stage well remembered
we<00:00:58.500> want<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.739> do<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.920> again<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.520> stage<00:00:59.789> zero

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
we want to do that again get stage zero

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.599 
we want to do that again get stage zero
after<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.719> make<00:01:00.840> your<00:01:00.870> stage<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.550> going<00:01:02.550> to

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
after you make your stage and going to

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.000 
after you make your stage and going to
open<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> death<00:01:03.300> file<00:01:03.510> once<00:01:03.899> again<00:01:04.229> we'll

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
open up the death file once again we'll

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.710 
open up the death file once again we'll
revisit<00:01:05.280> everything<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.330> time<00:01:06.540> we

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
revisit everything but this time we

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.450 
revisit everything but this time we
don't<00:01:06.869> really<00:01:06.990> need<00:01:07.200> much<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.130> basically

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
don't really need much so basically

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.130 
don't really need much so basically
we're<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.299> time<00:01:09.540> when<00:01:10.080> you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
we're going to do is this time when you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.410 
we're going to do is this time when you
open<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.380> your<00:01:10.470> death<00:01:10.740> file<00:01:11.210> remember<00:01:12.210> when<00:01:12.390> I

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
open up your death file remember when I

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.670 
open up your death file remember when I
said<00:01:12.479> scroll<00:01:13.020> all<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.229> way<00:01:13.290> down<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
said scroll all the way down to the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.520 
said scroll all the way down to the
bottom<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:15.049> when<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> see<00:01:17.180> window<00:01:18.530> equals

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
bottom and when you see window equals

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.240 
bottom and when you see window equals
equals<00:01:20.100> 0<00:01:20.400> 0<00:01:20.700> 319<00:01:21.390> 239<00:01:22.110> remember<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.220> I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
equals 0 0 319 239 remember that and I

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.590 
equals 0 0 319 239 remember that and I
suppose<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.490> erase<00:01:23.790> everything<00:01:24.210> at<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
suppose you erase everything at the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.980 
suppose you erase everything at the
bottom<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.979> time<00:01:26.420> whether<00:01:27.420> everyone's

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
bottom but this time whether everyone's

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.660 
bottom but this time whether everyone's
are<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> add<00:01:28.590> everything<00:01:28.979> back<00:01:29.430> in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
are going to add everything back in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.910 
are going to add everything back in
order<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.210> guarantee<00:01:30.390> animations<00:01:31.049> working<00:01:31.470> so

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
order to guarantee animations working so

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.319 
order to guarantee animations working so
you<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> retype<00:01:32.549> everything<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.150> which

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
you have to retype everything in which

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.499 
you have to retype everything in which
is<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:33.659> simple<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.240> basically<00:01:36.240> we'll<00:01:36.390> be

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
is very simple so basically we'll be

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.270 
is very simple so basically we'll be
doing<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.110> here<00:01:37.439> I'm<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> move

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
doing this right here I'm going to move

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.109 
doing this right here I'm going to move
down<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.229> type<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.470> bracket<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.670> type<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
down and type in bracket you type in the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.510 
down and type in bracket you type in the
bracket<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.600> put<00:01:42.869> background<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:43.890> because

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
bracket and put background one because

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.539 
bracket and put background one because
this<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.790> background<00:01:45.270> image<00:01:45.479> 1<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.680> right

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
this is a background image 1 and right

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.550 
this is a background image 1 and right
here<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.060> too<00:01:48.420> tight<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.049> order<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.439> your

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
here is too tight and order for your

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.889 
here is too tight and order for your
animation<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.159> work<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.670> has<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> type<00:01:51.689> has

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
animation to work it has the type has

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.219 
animation to work it has the type has
two<00:01:52.049> equals<00:01:52.350> animation<00:01:53.070> right<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
two equals animation right here and

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.630 
two equals animation right here and
don't<00:01:55.229> worry<00:01:55.350> about<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.920> action<00:01:56.369> number

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
don't worry about this is action number

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.270 
don't worry about this is action number
extra<00:01:57.360> number<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.049> UM<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.770> numbered<00:01:59.159> at

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
extra number is the UM it's numbered at

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.859 
extra number is the UM it's numbered at
the<00:01:59.399> end<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> actions<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.479> fighter

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
the end of the actions and fighter

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.510 
the end of the actions and fighter
factor<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.469> being<00:02:01.770> used<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.250> order<00:02:02.369> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
factor is being used to in order to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.660 
factor is being used to in order to
activate<00:02:03.119> down<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.140> animation<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.950> don't

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
activate down the animation and don't

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
activate down the animation and don't
worry<00:02:05.820> about<00:02:06.000> layers<00:02:06.270> layers<00:02:06.960> not<00:02:07.290> really

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
worry about layers layers not really

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.760 
worry about layers layers not really
important<00:02:07.979> for<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.280> story

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
important for the story

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.050 
important for the story
so<00:02:09.840> now<00:02:10.840> after<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.500> make<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.220> semicolon<00:02:12.760> right

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
so now after that make a semicolon right

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.650 
so now after that make a semicolon right
here<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.690> make<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.470> space<00:02:14.740> line<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.910> them<00:02:16.150> we're

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
here and make a space line to them we're

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.240 
here and make a space line to them we're
going<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.900> do<00:02:16.990> is<00:02:17.170> we're<00:02:17.860> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.070> make<00:02:18.190> this

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
going to do is we're going to make this

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.940 
going to do is we're going to make this
put<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.730> bracket<00:02:18.940> again<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.540> type<00:02:20.020> them<00:02:20.230> begin

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
put a bracket again and type them begin

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.330 
put a bracket again and type them begin
action<00:02:21.550> one<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.380> then<00:02:23.380> close<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.070> with<00:02:24.310> a

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
action one and then close it with a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.550 
action one and then close it with a
bracket<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.450> basically<00:02:25.870> right<00:02:26.320> here<00:02:28.560> you're

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
bracket so basically right here you're

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.360 
bracket so basically right here you're
going<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.770> have<00:02:29.890> underneath<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:31.230> five<00:02:32.370> zeros

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
going to have underneath it five zeros

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.590 
going to have underneath it five zeros
and<00:02:34.290> basically<00:02:35.340> put<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.460> files<00:02:36.670> with<00:02:37.570> the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
and basically put the files with the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.680 
and basically put the files with the
five<00:02:37.840> zeros<00:02:38.260> mean<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.610> used<00:02:39.820> these<00:02:40.330> zeros

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
five zeros mean this is used these zeros

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.380 
five zeros mean this is used these zeros
are<00:02:40.840> used<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.260> activate<00:02:41.740> down<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.880> arm<00:02:43.090> the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
are used to activate down the arm the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.360 
are used to activate down the arm the
animation<00:02:43.990> so<00:02:44.800> make<00:02:44.980> sure<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.220> close

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
animation so make sure you close

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.140 
animation so make sure you close
everything<00:02:45.910> with<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.210> bracket<00:02:46.600> so<00:02:48.150> we're

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
everything with the bracket so we're

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.370 
everything with the bracket so we're
going<00:02:49.210> to<00:02:49.360> move<00:02:49.450> down<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:51.310> first<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:53.110> first

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
going to move down the first the first

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.290 
going to move down the first the first
two<00:02:53.560> zeroes<00:02:54.010> right<00:02:54.690> here<00:02:55.690> our<00:02:55.870> group<00:02:56.830> and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
two zeroes right here our group and

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.330 
two zeroes right here our group and
image<00:02:58.300> which<00:02:58.720> is<00:02:58.750> found<00:02:59.170> inside<00:02:59.500> fighter

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
image which is found inside fighter

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.900 
image which is found inside fighter
factory<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:01.660> let's<00:03:02.260> go<00:03:02.410> over<00:03:02.440> here<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:06.220> group

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
factory so let's go over here the group

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.770 
factory so let's go over here the group
and<00:03:07.200> image<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:09.940> first<00:03:10.120> one<00:03:10.330> starting<00:03:10.690> off

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
and image so the first one starting off

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.100 
and image so the first one starting off
is<00:03:10.960> going<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.200> be<00:03:11.260> 0<00:03:11.590> 0<00:03:12.160> 0<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:13.570> it's<00:03:13.690> open<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.080> the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
is going to be 0 0 0 so it's open to the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.110 
is going to be 0 0 0 so it's open to the
plant<00:03:14.709> benefit<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.250> file<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:17.700> then<00:03:18.700> we're

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
plant benefit that file so then we're

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.970 
plant benefit that file so then we're
going<00:03:19.240> to<00:03:19.330> put<00:03:19.900> everything<00:03:20.200> else<00:03:20.470> back<00:03:20.740> in

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
going to put everything else back in

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.370 
going to put everything else back in
don't<00:03:21.700> worry<00:03:21.880> about<00:03:21.959> don't<00:03:22.959> worry<00:03:23.080> about

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
don't worry about don't worry about

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.410 
don't worry about don't worry about
these<00:03:23.560> right<00:03:23.830> here<00:03:23.860> these<00:03:24.280> extra<00:03:25.030> lines<00:03:25.209> back

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
these right here these extra lines back

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.480 
these right here these extra lines back
here<00:03:25.600> I<00:03:25.630> get<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.050> in<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.230> minute<00:03:26.380> so<00:03:27.160> the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
here I get to that in a minute so the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.780 
here I get to that in a minute so the
next<00:03:27.700> one<00:03:27.900> since<00:03:28.900> I<00:03:29.020> got<00:03:29.250> since<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.340> got<00:03:30.520> nine

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
next one since I got since I got nine

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.660 
next one since I got since I got nine
pictures<00:03:31.600> mom's<00:03:32.590> going<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:32.980> be<00:03:33.040> nine<00:03:33.280> friends

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
pictures mom's going to be nine friends

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.510 
pictures mom's going to be nine friends
so<00:03:34.270> I<00:03:34.300> put<00:03:34.660> nine<00:03:34.870> rows<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.380> zeroes<00:03:35.709> so

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
so I put nine rows of zeroes so

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.810 
so I put nine rows of zeroes so
basically<00:03:36.820> it's<00:03:37.090> like<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:39.000> 0<00:03:40.000> 1<00:03:40.360> which<00:03:40.959> is

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
basically it's like this 0 1 which is

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.480 
basically it's like this 0 1 which is
group<00:03:42.820> which<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.630> group<00:03:44.080> 0<00:03:45.000> image<00:03:46.000> 1<00:03:47.490> bring

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
group which is group 0 image 1 bring

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.460 
group which is group 0 image 1 bring
back<00:03:48.670> at<00:03:48.790> my<00:03:48.880> desk<00:03:49.030> file<00:03:49.300> again<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.290> next

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
back at my desk file again and the next

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.650 
back at my desk file again and the next
one<00:03:50.740> is<00:03:51.000> 0<00:03:52.000> 2<00:03:52.330> which<00:03:52.630> is<00:03:53.370> group<00:03:54.370> 0<00:03:54.400> image<00:03:55.390> 2

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
one is 0 2 which is group 0 image 2

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.050 
one is 0 2 which is group 0 image 2
since<00:03:56.500> like<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.709> said<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.100> have<00:03:57.280> nine<00:03:57.610> friends

since like I said I have nine friends
say<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.570> had<00:03:58.840> nine<00:03:59.080> rules<00:03:59.440> so<00:03:59.980> it's<00:04:00.220> going<00:04:00.340> 20<00:04:00.670> 20

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
say I had nine rules so it's going 20 20

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:10.100 
say I had nine rules so it's going 20 20
30<00:04:01.890> 40<00:04:02.890> 50<00:04:03.989> 60<00:04:04.989> seven<00:04:05.800> and<00:04:05.980> 08<00:04:07.020> so<00:04:08.250> after<00:04:09.250> that

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
you're going to move on back to 0 1

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.530 
you're going to move on back to 0 1
again<00:04:14.140> this<00:04:14.590> row<00:04:14.800> so<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:15.820> guys<00:04:16.209> are<00:04:16.419> wondering

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
right here I read I read over it I

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.680 
right here I read I read over it I
really<00:04:23.070> don't<00:04:23.160> know<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:24.360> know<00:04:24.449> with<00:04:24.600> these

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
really don't know you know with these

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.330 
really don't know you know with these
two<00:04:24.870> zeros<00:04:25.199> or<00:04:25.320> four<00:04:25.530> cuz<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:25.979> have<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.190> put

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
two zeros or four cuz you have to put

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.640 
two zeros or four cuz you have to put
these<00:04:26.460> two<00:04:26.639> zeros<00:04:26.940> in<00:04:27.150> but<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.990> me<00:04:28.139> I<00:04:28.169> believe

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
these two zeros in but to me I believe

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.340 
these two zeros in but to me I believe
that<00:04:28.979> these<00:04:29.669> two<00:04:29.910> zeros<00:04:30.270> are<00:04:30.479> to<00:04:30.840> present<00:04:31.199> the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
that these two zeros are to present the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.950 
that these two zeros are to present the
positioning<00:04:32.040> of<00:04:32.130> your<00:04:32.220> stage<00:04:32.970> which<00:04:33.479> in<00:04:33.720> the

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
positioning of your stage which in the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.330 
positioning of your stage which in the
last<00:04:34.169> three<00:04:34.440> of<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:34.770> guys<00:04:34.919> know<00:04:34.979> how<00:04:35.310> to

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
last three of you guys know how to

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.360 
last three of you guys know how to
position<00:04:35.610> your<00:04:35.790> stage<00:04:36.090> such<00:04:37.050> as<00:04:37.199> the<00:04:37.370> y-axis

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
position your stage such as the y-axis

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.740 
position your stage such as the y-axis
so<00:04:38.699> you'll<00:04:38.880> have<00:04:38.970> to<00:04:39.090> worry<00:04:39.210> about<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.449> they

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
so you'll have to worry about that they

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.330 
so you'll have to worry about that they
all<00:04:39.930> have<00:04:40.199> to<00:04:40.229> be<00:04:40.350> zeros<00:04:40.740> don't<00:04:41.010> mess<00:04:41.190> with

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
all have to be zeros don't mess with

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.820 
all have to be zeros don't mess with
that<00:04:41.370> put<00:04:41.760> 0n<00:04:42.270> on<00:04:42.750> this<00:04:42.930> pad<00:04:43.169> for<00:04:43.440> that<00:04:43.560> section

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
that put 0n on this pad for that section

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.920 
that put 0n on this pad for that section
right<00:04:44.070> here<00:04:44.130> now<00:04:44.940> you<00:04:45.300> guys<00:04:45.449> are<00:04:45.630> wondering

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
remember the time that I put ya my time

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.750 
remember the time that I put ya my time
is<00:04:54.419> 35<00:04:54.930> all<00:04:55.320> right<00:04:55.530> here<00:04:55.710> I<00:04:55.740> put<00:04:55.919> 30<00:04:56.190> cuz<00:04:56.610> I

is 35 all right here I put 30 cuz I
didn't<00:04:57.240> like<00:04:57.360> how<00:04:57.630> it<00:04:57.660> looked<00:04:57.990> it<00:04:58.139> with<00:04:58.440> 35<00:04:58.860> so

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
didn't like how it looked it with 35 so

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.520 
didn't like how it looked it with 35 so
I<00:04:59.400> put<00:04:59.610> it<00:04:59.699> on<00:04:59.789> three<00:05:00.060> so<00:05:00.660> right<00:05:00.900> here<00:05:01.110> just<00:05:01.350> let

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
I put it on three so right here just let

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.800 
I put it on three so right here just let
these<00:05:01.889> letters<00:05:02.310> last<00:05:02.490> column<00:05:02.940> right<00:05:03.060> here<00:05:03.360> you

these letters last column right here you

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.469 
these letters last column right here you
put<00:05:04.020> in<00:05:04.139> which<00:05:04.470> your<00:05:04.620> time<00:05:04.860> is<00:05:05.150> put<00:05:06.150> your<00:05:06.270> time

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
put in which your time is put your time

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.070 
put in which your time is put your time
in<00:05:06.690> right<00:05:06.870> here<00:05:07.910> which<00:05:08.910> is<00:05:09.060> 30<00:05:09.300> for<00:05:09.690> each<00:05:09.780> row

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
in right here which is 30 for each row

and<00:05:10.740> work<00:05:10.889> for<00:05:11.039> your<00:05:11.160> animation<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.639> move

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
and work for your animation to move

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.640 
and work for your animation to move
smoothly<00:05:12.060> like<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:12.479> want<00:05:12.660> it<00:05:12.780> so<00:05:13.380> let's<00:05:13.560> go

smoothly like you want it so let's go

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.430 
smoothly like you want it so let's go
back<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:13.979> review<00:05:14.250> remember<00:05:15.210> you<00:05:15.870> all<00:05:15.930> got<00:05:16.229> put

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
back and review remember you all got put

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.250 
back and review remember you all got put
begin<00:05:16.770> action<00:05:17.220> one<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.639> the<00:05:18.449> first<00:05:18.690> line<00:05:18.930> is

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
begin action one and the first line is

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260 
begin action one and the first line is
the<00:05:19.560> first<00:05:19.800> line<00:05:20.010> right<00:05:20.190> here<00:05:20.400> it's<00:05:20.850> always

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
the first line right here it's always

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.040 
the first line right here it's always
all<00:05:21.449> zeros<00:05:21.900> so<00:05:22.440> this<00:05:22.560> is<00:05:22.680> group<00:05:22.949> 0<00:05:23.810> image0<00:05:24.810> and

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
all zeros so this is group 0 image0 and

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.290 
all zeros so this is group 0 image0 and
you<00:05:25.500> go<00:05:25.620> down<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:25.889> how<00:05:26.280> many<00:05:26.340> whatever<00:05:27.090> your

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
you go down to how many whatever your

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.550 
you go down to how many whatever your
friends<00:05:27.630> are<00:05:27.750> that's<00:05:27.960> how<00:05:28.050> many<00:05:28.169> rows<00:05:28.380> your

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
friends are that's how many rows your

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.159 
friends are that's how many rows your
data<00:05:28.710> mate<00:05:28.950> so<00:05:29.430> remember<00:05:29.729> since<00:05:30.389> I<00:05:30.510> put<00:05:30.900> in<00:05:31.139> my

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
data mate so remember since I put in my

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.490 
data mate so remember since I put in my
tutorial<00:05:32.010> nine<00:05:32.760> images<00:05:33.120> which<00:05:34.110> is<00:05:34.260> now<00:05:34.440> in

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
tutorial nine images which is now in

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.140 
tutorial nine images which is now in
frames<00:05:34.710> you<00:05:35.280> have<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.460> put<00:05:35.669> I<00:05:35.789> have<00:05:35.880> to<00:05:35.970> put

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
frames you have to put I have to put

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.560 
frames you have to put I have to put
nine<00:05:36.360> rolls<00:05:36.750> in<00:05:36.990> so<00:05:37.830> suppose<00:05:38.760> your<00:05:39.210> arm<00:05:39.389> your

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
nine rolls in so suppose your arm your

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.469 
nine rolls in so suppose your arm your
image<00:05:39.870> your<00:05:40.020> row<00:05:40.410> count<00:05:40.710> starts<00:05:41.070> with<00:05:41.190> zero<00:05:41.479> so

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
image your row count starts with zero so

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.029 
image your row count starts with zero so
like<00:05:43.169> I<00:05:43.260> said<00:05:43.320> group<00:05:43.860> 0<00:05:43.889> M<00:05:44.430> is<00:05:44.910> zero<00:05:45.440> group<00:05:46.440> 0<00:05:46.470> M

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
like I said group 0 M is zero group 0 M

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:53.300 
like I said group 0 M is zero group 0 M
is<00:05:47.570> 10<00:05:48.570> m<00:05:48.810> is<00:05:49.910> 20<00:05:50.910> image<00:05:51.360> 3<00:05:51.389> and<00:05:51.960> etc<00:05:52.530> and

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
is 10 m is 20 image 3 and etc and

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.790 
is 10 m is 20 image 3 and etc and
remembered<00:05:54.000> yo<00:05:54.750> you<00:05:55.050> have<00:05:55.169> to<00:05:55.320> put<00:05:55.470> these<00:05:55.590> two

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
remembered yo you have to put these two

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.700 
remembered yo you have to put these two
zeros<00:05:56.190> in<00:05:56.370> you<00:05:56.550> have<00:05:56.760> to<00:05:57.080> put<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.169> two<00:05:58.349> zeros

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
zeros in you have to put the two zeros

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.800 
zeros in you have to put the two zeros
in<00:05:58.889> and<00:05:59.550> don't<00:05:59.789> don't<00:06:00.150> change<00:06:00.419> the<00:06:00.539> number

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
in and don't don't change the number

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.540 
in and don't don't change the number
just<00:06:00.960> keep<00:06:01.110> meant<00:06:01.320> to<00:06:01.470> zeros<00:06:01.830> and<00:06:02.160> like<00:06:02.400> I<00:06:02.490> said

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
just keep meant to zeros and like I said

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
animation in and like I said my

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.210 
animation in and like I said my
animation<00:06:09.539> time<00:06:09.750> is<00:06:09.900> 35<00:06:10.349> I<00:06:10.560> change<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:11.039> third

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
animation time is 35 I change the third

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.760 
animation time is 35 I change the third
because<00:06:11.400> I<00:06:11.580> like<00:06:11.729> high<00:06:11.880> look<00:06:12.210> so<00:06:13.020> whatever

because I like high look so whatever

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.469 
because I like high look so whatever
your<00:06:13.889> animation<00:06:14.370> time<00:06:14.580> is<00:06:14.789> depending<00:06:15.240> on<00:06:15.240> you

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
your animation time is depending on you

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.689 
your animation time is depending on you
depending<00:06:16.199> on<00:06:16.199> you<00:06:16.470> the<00:06:16.650> Creator<00:06:16.919> you<00:06:17.400> put<00:06:17.610> it
