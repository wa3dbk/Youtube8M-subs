00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
videos are all screwed up through the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.010 
videos are all screwed up through the
beginning<00:01:41.820> he<00:01:42.060> has<00:01:42.150> had<00:01:42.329> issues<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
beginning he has had issues with the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.080 
beginning he has had issues with the
audio<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.590> his<00:01:43.770> videos<00:01:44.130> which<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.939> only

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
audio in his videos which I can only

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.910 
audio in his videos which I can only
assume<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.630> because<00:01:45.960> he's<00:01:46.200> deaf<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.649> one<00:01:46.710> ear

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
assume is because he's deaf in one ear

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.530 
assume is because he's deaf in one ear
and<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.759> fact<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.119> he<00:01:48.270> can't

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and because of the fact that he can't

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.480 
and because of the fact that he can't
tell<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.780> difference<00:01:48.899> between<00:01:49.340> 720p<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
tell the difference between 720p and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.090 
tell the difference between 720p and
1080p<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:52.020> only<00:01:52.170> assume<00:01:52.350> he's<00:01:52.710> also

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
1080p I can only assume he's also

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.460 
1080p I can only assume he's also
partially<00:01:53.640> blind<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.570> because<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> fact<00:01:55.409> that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
partially blind so because the fact that

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.499 
partially blind so because the fact that
he's<00:01:55.619> obviously<00:01:55.890> disabled<00:01:56.790> I'm<00:01:57.030> gonna<00:01:57.270> stop
