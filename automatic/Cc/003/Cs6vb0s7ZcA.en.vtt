00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello everyone, I will share this today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.810
 recipe that we were taught in the mountains 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.460
 Bedouin that is, they very often eat 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.570
 such a dish well and let me show you 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.570
 then preparing 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.250
 that is, we need to do about it was finally 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.939
 any that you have now we 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.170
 use 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.990
 dots before lettuce potatoes onions 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.990
 blue carrot tomatoes 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.300
 eggplant before the dough so well and twigs 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.600
 I also use rosemary for taste 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.340
 it is clear that salt and pepper is also needed 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.399
 the same is to taste the night where we 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.620
 started we start cooking let's say so 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.440
 our like a frying pan because it will 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.579
 prepare for everything with us on the grill 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.289
 gently unwind the foil 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.780
 immediately say such a secret of need 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.239
 her do it all at least 3-4 words 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.949
 so that the corrado fire was underneath in no way 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.059
 If this layer is not burned out 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.510
 completely there did not fall on doing here 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.510
 and draw 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.310
 all here so this is because the foil part 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.310
 leave 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.390
 that we will have this much aerated 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.800
 camaro yes further we chop there 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.800
 quietly all our vegetables 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.159
 do not cut the Christmas tree sideways 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.010
 but 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.130
 like that with sprigs of rosemary we decorate 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.440
 but this is more we will not be for beauty 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.440
 now and for the course 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:09.440
 he will give his good such smell further 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.440
 add plenty of salt 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.540
 because then here's this juice with tomato 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.910
 will flow down and just all over 40 and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.600
 some pepper i use too for us 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:29.140
 gave an Arab but it is roughly a mixture 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:33.730
 peppers will call someone later 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.700
 enough health 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:42.240
 to packing 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.240
 watch the edges here we are starting to drive 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:52.140
 1 time we make such a saucepan why am I 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.310
 I say this olga 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.440
 leave further well what will it be 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.820
 top it seems to be no longer important 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.730
 strongly so that the density was just like 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:08.549
 time 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.549
 we cover even doing hermetically 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:24.460
 mother and rammed to do was 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:27.840
 hermetically so so sealed them what 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.840
 cool position so 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:40.039
 and like this several times 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.259
 specifically make such a container 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.529
 but now we will carry on the brazier we will show 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.529
 farther 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.719
 driven into anal 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:59.810
 my building is not left then we put 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.810
 there country moms 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.760
 I hope very important our ready and 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:13.710
 now we will try 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.710
 very hard they take away then hot 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.660
 rushed 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.570
 it smells 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:49.040
 so many layers of foil not yet alone 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:50.900
 clown then talk about it well mean 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.860
 prepared them all this useful 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.860
 of course 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.919
 of course 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.650
 there is a lot of nicotine and neckline 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:44.050
 British you congratulated well what I wear 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:48.400
 I think dim let's finally pour and 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.400
 show all the same people how we post 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:55.040
 such a small company when we spend 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.780
 and the evening today is well and good at the very 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.880
 I really do n't speak much for slaves 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.280
 probably we have no friends and quietly worked 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.840
 would catch up and t-shirts and now still 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.130

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.770
