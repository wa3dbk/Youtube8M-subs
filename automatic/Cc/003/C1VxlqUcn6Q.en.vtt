00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.249 

if<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.290> do<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.620> little<00:00:01.860> review<00:00:02.159> today<00:00:02.700> on<00:00:03.259> the

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
if I do a little review today on the

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.639 
if I do a little review today on the
boost<00:00:04.560> bottle<00:00:05.130> since<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.390> haven't<00:00:07.230> seen<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.440> lot

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
boost bottle since I haven't seen a lot

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.290 
boost bottle since I haven't seen a lot
of<00:00:07.770> reviews<00:00:08.130> or<00:00:08.309> people<00:00:08.580> have<00:00:08.730> actually<00:00:09.150> been

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
of reviews or people have actually been

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.379 
of reviews or people have actually been
using<00:00:09.630> one<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.769> just<00:00:11.400> hit<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.639> thousand<00:00:12.210> miles

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
using one so I just hit a thousand miles

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.070 
using one so I just hit a thousand miles
of<00:00:12.660> mine<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.320> I've<00:00:14.250> been<00:00:14.580> pretty<00:00:15.420> happy<00:00:15.540> with

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
of mine and I've been pretty happy with

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.960 
of mine and I've been pretty happy with
it<00:00:16.139> since<00:00:16.770> it's<00:00:16.949> been<00:00:17.100> installed<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.789> guess

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
it since it's been installed I guess

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.609 
it since it's been installed I guess
I've<00:00:18.119> only<00:00:18.270> had<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:18.869> nine<00:00:19.050> hundred<00:00:19.230> miles

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
I've only had on for nine hundred miles

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.210 
I've only had on for nine hundred miles
but<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.250> mean<00:00:20.520> that's<00:00:20.699> quite<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.970> bit<00:00:21.410> so<00:00:22.410> and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
but I mean that's quite a bit so and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.830 
but I mean that's quite a bit so and
when<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.369> really<00:00:23.789> noticed<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.480> helps<00:00:24.750> with

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
when I really noticed that it helps with

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.640 
when I really noticed that it helps with
it's<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:25.560> necessarily<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> power<00:00:26.640> adder<00:00:27.650> or

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
it's not necessarily a power adder or

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.790 
it's not necessarily a power adder or
anything<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.340> nature<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:30.349> I've<00:00:31.349> noticed

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
anything of that nature but I've noticed

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.200 
anything of that nature but I've noticed
it<00:00:31.980> at<00:00:32.099> higher<00:00:32.309> rpm<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:37.879> motors<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> lot

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
it at higher rpm the motors a lot

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.299 
it at higher rpm the motors a lot
smoother<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.879> I<00:00:42.469> get<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> lot<00:00:43.770> better<00:00:43.920> gas

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
smoother and I get a lot better gas

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.440 
smoother and I get a lot better gas
mileage<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:45.059> higher<00:00:45.270> rpm<00:00:45.840> too<00:00:47.149> which<00:00:48.149> makes

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
mileage at higher rpm too which makes

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.590 
mileage at higher rpm too which makes
sense<00:00:48.719> because<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.410> higher<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.800> RPM<00:00:50.600> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
sense because the higher the RPM the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.270 
sense because the higher the RPM the
more<00:00:51.840> gas<00:00:52.079> you're<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.710> spitting

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
more gas you're going to be spitting

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.650 
more gas you're going to be spitting
back<00:00:53.550> through<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.660> porting<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:56.660> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
back through the the porting and it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.450 
back through the the porting and it
seems<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.469> seems<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.859> catch<00:00:59.100> quite<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
seems like this seems to catch quite a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.069 
seems like this seems to catch quite a
bit<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.090> kind<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.359> sieve<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.870> some

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
bit of it you can kind of sieve and some

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.070 
bit of it you can kind of sieve and some
fluid<00:01:01.500> sitting<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.010> there<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.570> some<00:01:03.570> fluid<00:01:03.960> up

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
fluid sitting in there and some fluid up

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.649 
fluid sitting in there and some fluid up
in<00:01:04.229> there<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.220> gets<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.760> gets<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.420> there

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
in there so it gets it gets up in there

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.289 
in there so it gets it gets up in there
and<00:01:09.170> yeah<00:01:10.250> I've<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.460> been<00:01:11.700> happy<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and yeah I've really been happy with the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.260 
and yeah I've really been happy with the
way<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.659> runs<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.530> engine<00:01:14.010> vibrates<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.090> whole

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
way it runs the engine vibrates a whole

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.649 
way it runs the engine vibrates a whole
heck<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.720> lot<00:01:15.750> less<00:01:16.610> at<00:01:17.610> rpm<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.420> seems

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
heck of a lot less at rpm it just seems

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.800 
heck of a lot less at rpm it just seems
like<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.850> really<00:01:21.030> helps<00:01:21.450> into<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
like it it just really helps into the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.899 
like it it just really helps into the
RPMs<00:01:22.290> that's<00:01:22.560> that's<00:01:22.860> really<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.670> say

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
RPMs that's that's really what I can say

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.190 
RPMs that's that's really what I can say
about<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:25.040> it's<00:01:26.040> worth<00:01:26.250> buying<00:01:26.610> I've

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
about it and it's worth buying I've

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.960 
about it and it's worth buying I've
gotten<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> lot<00:01:28.500> better<00:01:28.710> gas<00:01:29.070> mileage<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.759> it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
gotten a lot better gas mileage with it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.260 
gotten a lot better gas mileage with it
um<00:01:30.439> there<00:01:31.439> are<00:01:31.530> some<00:01:31.860> things<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.400> address<00:01:32.820> with

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
um there are some things to address with

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.069 
um there are some things to address with
it<00:01:33.479> when<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.400> like<00:01:35.720> this<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.840> kind

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it when you have one like this is kind

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.950 
it when you have one like this is kind
of<00:01:37.140> interesting<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.890> got<00:01:38.070> my<00:01:38.189> carburetor

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
of interesting but I got my carburetor

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.480 
of interesting but I got my carburetor
turned<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> way<00:01:40.500> down<00:01:40.710> it'll<00:01:41.040> idle<00:01:41.310> just

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
turned all the way down it'll idle just

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.910 
turned all the way down it'll idle just
fine<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.290> adjust<00:01:43.829> my

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
fine with that and I really I adjust my

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.910 
fine with that and I really I adjust my
idle<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.430> my<00:01:44.549> idle<00:01:44.880> mixture<00:01:45.060> screw<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
idle with my idle mixture screw and the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.030 
idle with my idle mixture screw and the
reason<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.700> because<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:49.040> given

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
reason I do that is because on given

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.080 
reason I do that is because on given
days<00:01:50.250> certain<00:01:51.560> humidity<00:01:52.560> levels<00:01:53.310> temperature

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
days certain humidity levels temperature

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.719 
days certain humidity levels temperature
levels<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:55.350> likes<00:01:55.619> more<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.040> less<00:01:56.219> fuel<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.610> I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
levels it likes more or less fuel and I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.429 
levels it likes more or less fuel and I
really<00:01:57.060> notice<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.600> get<00:01:57.810> really<00:01:58.229> good

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
really notice I can get really good

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.590 
really notice I can get really good
performance<00:01:59.009> out<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.310> these<00:01:59.399> NT<00:01:59.850> carburetors

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
performance out of these NT carburetors

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.319 
performance out of these NT carburetors
if<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.100> stay<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.310> top<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.820> adjustment

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
if I just stay on top of the adjustment

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.300 
if I just stay on top of the adjustment
every<00:02:03.570> day<00:02:03.750> once<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.170> gets<00:02:04.320> fully<00:02:04.619> warmed<00:02:05.009> up

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
every day once it gets fully warmed up

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.499 
every day once it gets fully warmed up
and<00:02:05.909> then<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.570> set<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.259> however<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.700> gets<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
and then I set it to however it gets the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.360 
and then I set it to however it gets the
best<00:02:09.720> throttle<00:02:10.259> response<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.979> know<00:02:11.099> when<00:02:11.310> you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
throttle I've had to use it really I

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.140 
throttle I've had to use it really I
didn't<00:02:30.890> even<00:02:31.010> like<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.280> motorized<00:02:31.850> bike

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
didn't even like the motorized bike

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.000 
didn't even like the motorized bike
until<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.630> put<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.020> on<00:02:33.170> there<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:34.600> run<00:02:35.600> about

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
until I put it on there I run about

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.710 
until I put it on there I run about
here's<00:02:37.010> like<00:02:37.280> normal<00:02:37.850> throttle<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.570> know<00:02:38.600> I

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
here's like normal throttle you know I

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.380 
here's like normal throttle you know I
got<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.930> little<00:02:39.080> play<00:02:39.350> in<00:02:39.380> my<00:02:39.590> handle<00:02:40.390> here's

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
got a little play in my handle here's

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.680 
got a little play in my handle here's
just<00:02:41.690> here's<00:02:42.260> idle<00:02:42.710> throttle<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.520> then<00:02:44.510> I'm

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
just here's idle throttle and then I'm

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.400 
just here's idle throttle and then I'm
running<00:02:44.900> only<00:02:45.170> about<00:02:46.000> idle<00:02:47.000> throttle<00:02:47.480> that

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
running only about idle throttle that

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.560 
running only about idle throttle that
much<00:02:48.680> different<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.400> I'm<00:02:49.520> going<00:02:49.790> like<00:02:49.820> 2025

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
much different and I'm going like 2025

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.670 
much different and I'm going like 2025
miles<00:02:51.080> an<00:02:51.350> hour

obviously<00:02:52.490> I<00:02:52.550> have<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.700> give<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.060> little<00:02:53.180> bit

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
obviously I have to give it a little bit

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.600 
obviously I have to give it a little bit
more<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.660> get<00:02:53.840> there<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:54.410> once<00:02:55.130> I'm<00:02:55.370> there

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
more to get there but once I'm there

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.570 
more to get there but once I'm there
it's<00:02:56.230> it's<00:02:57.230> pretty<00:02:57.470> good<00:02:57.680> cruising<00:02:58.130> speed<00:02:58.430> and

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
it's it's pretty good cruising speed and

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.500 
it's it's pretty good cruising speed and
I've<00:02:58.970> got<00:02:59.240> on<00:02:59.450> like<00:03:00.290> 50<00:03:01.280> 80<00:03:01.520> mile<00:03:01.820> round<00:03:02.120> trips

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
I've got on like 50 80 mile round trips

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.940 
I've got on like 50 80 mile round trips
without<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:03.110> tank<00:03:03.410> even<00:03:03.730> full<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.950> still

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
without this tank even full and I still

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.220 
without this tank even full and I still
have<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.660> sufficient<00:03:08.660> amount<00:03:08.720> left<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:11.230> I've

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
have a sufficient amount left so I've

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.310 
have a sufficient amount left so I've
been<00:03:12.410> pretty<00:03:12.710> impressed<00:03:13.240> but<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:15.110> other

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
been pretty impressed but the other

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.650 
been pretty impressed but the other
thing<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.770> have<00:03:15.800> to<00:03:16.010> do<00:03:16.280> with<00:03:16.460> it<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:17.060> since<00:03:17.540> I

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
thing I have to do with it is since I

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.230 
thing I have to do with it is since I
installed<00:03:17.810> this<00:03:18.260> boost<00:03:18.530> bottle<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:19.160> have<00:03:19.850> to

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
installed this boost bottle I have to

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.360 
installed this boost bottle I have to
let<00:03:20.810> my<00:03:20.840> bike<00:03:21.140> warm<00:03:21.470> up<00:03:21.650> for<00:03:21.830> about<00:03:21.890> five

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
let my bike warm up for about five

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.090 
let my bike warm up for about five
minutes<00:03:22.580> before<00:03:23.420> before<00:03:24.320> then<00:03:24.560> it's<00:03:24.770> almost

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
minutes before before then it's almost

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.070 
minutes before before then it's almost
like<00:03:25.340> it's<00:03:25.550> lean<00:03:25.820> I'll<00:03:26.090> crack<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.600> throttle

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
like it's lean I'll crack the throttle

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.190 
like it's lean I'll crack the throttle
and<00:03:27.610> it's<00:03:28.610> like<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.910> bogs<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.660> it's<00:03:29.810> just<00:03:30.050> too

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
and it's like it bogs and it's just too

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.560 
and it's like it bogs and it's just too
lean<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:31.010> if<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.280> do<00:03:31.400> install<00:03:31.820> a<00:03:31.850> boost<00:03:32.150> bottle

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
lean so if you do install a boost bottle

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.410 
lean so if you do install a boost bottle
I<00:03:32.890> believe<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:34.370> know<00:03:34.490> don't<00:03:34.730> get<00:03:34.820> discouraged

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
I believe you know don't get discouraged

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.050 
I believe you know don't get discouraged
at<00:03:35.570> first<00:03:35.840> because<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.710> sure<00:03:37.070> was<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:37.700> after<00:03:37.910> I

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
at first because I sure was but after I

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.090 
at first because I sure was but after I
let<00:03:38.270> it<00:03:38.390> sit<00:03:39.260> there<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.470> run<00:03:39.650> for<00:03:39.890> five

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
let it sit there and run for five

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.620 
let it sit there and run for five
minutes<00:03:40.460> and<00:03:40.550> I<00:03:40.580> hopped<00:03:40.850> on<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.180> give<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:41.390> some

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
minutes and I hopped on and give it some

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.260 
minutes and I hopped on and give it some
throttle<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:42.080> really<00:03:42.290> took<00:03:42.500> off<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:46.730> really

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
throttle it really took off so it really

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.020 
throttle it really took off so it really
helps<00:03:47.570> with<00:03:47.660> that<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.440> guess<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.280> lot<00:03:49.940> of

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
helps with that and I guess a lot of

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.630 
helps with that and I guess a lot of
people<00:03:50.240> probably<00:03:50.480> aren't<00:03:50.840> real<00:03:51.640> interested

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
people probably aren't real interested

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.490 
people probably aren't real interested
in<00:03:52.730> low<00:03:52.910> end<00:03:53.209> torque<00:03:53.510> but<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.900> really<00:03:54.200> helps

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
in low end torque but it really helps

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.870 
in low end torque but it really helps
with<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.650> low<00:03:54.950> end<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.980> can<00:03:58.160> really<00:03:58.520> with

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
with the low end it can really with

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.520 
with the low end it can really with
these<00:03:59.030> huge<00:03:59.570> tires

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
these huge tires

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.750 
these huge tires
I<00:04:00.560> let<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.490> clutch<00:04:01.700> out<00:04:01.940> at<00:04:02.150> about<00:04:03.160> 6<00:04:04.160> 7<00:04:04.640> 8

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
I let the clutch out at about 6 7 8

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.940 
I let the clutch out at about 6 7 8
miles<00:04:05.030> an<00:04:05.240> hour<00:04:05.420> and<00:04:05.750> it'll<00:04:06.410> get<00:04:06.590> right<00:04:06.770> up<00:04:06.920> to

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
miles an hour and it'll get right up to

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.580 
miles an hour and it'll get right up to
15<00:04:07.580> in<00:04:07.790> a<00:04:07.850> hurry<00:04:08.120> which<00:04:08.630> really<00:04:08.990> amazes<00:04:09.560> me

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
15 in a hurry which really amazes me

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.730 
15 in a hurry which really amazes me
because<00:04:10.360> I<00:04:11.360> mean<00:04:11.660> it's<00:04:11.810> just<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:12.080> big<00:04:12.260> bike<00:04:12.470> and

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
because I mean it's just a big bike and

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.730 
because I mean it's just a big bike and
I'm<00:04:12.800> a<00:04:12.890> 200-pound<00:04:13.550> guy<00:04:13.990> but<00:04:14.990> it'll<00:04:15.350> get<00:04:15.500> right

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
I'm a 200-pound guy but it'll get right

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.370 
I'm a 200-pound guy but it'll get right
up<00:04:15.920> and<00:04:16.070> go<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:17.239> I<00:04:17.900> believe<00:04:18.200> that's

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
up and go and I believe that's

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.940 
up and go and I believe that's
attributed<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.220> boost<00:04:19.430> bottle<00:04:19.820> as<00:04:19.970> well

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
attributed to the boost bottle as well

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.790 
attributed to the boost bottle as well
but<00:04:21.950> again<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:23.120> can't<00:04:23.510> stress<00:04:23.960> enough<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:24.710> you

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
but again I can't stress enough that you

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.420 
but again I can't stress enough that you
really<00:04:25.070> have<00:04:25.220> to<00:04:25.400> have<00:04:25.490> that<00:04:25.700> carburetor

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
really have to have that carburetor

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.830 
really have to have that carburetor
are<00:04:26.780> dialed<00:04:27.780> in<00:04:27.960> just<00:04:28.410> right<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.180> IO<00:04:30.180> and

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
are dialed in just right and IO and

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
are dialed in just right and IO and
since<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.199> installed<00:04:31.380> this<00:04:31.949> I<00:04:32.190> run<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> one<00:04:32.940> notch

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
since I installed this I run a one notch

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.430 
since I installed this I run a one notch
one<00:04:34.860> notch<00:04:35.100> richer<00:04:35.669> on<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.000> slide<00:04:36.300> pin<00:04:36.660> I've

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
one notch richer on the slide pin I've

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.020 
one notch richer on the slide pin I've
noticed<00:04:37.889> that's<00:04:38.009> really<00:04:38.370> helped<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.729> to<00:04:38.759> run

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
noticed that's really helped it to run

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.120 
noticed that's really helped it to run
better<00:04:39.270> so<00:04:40.460> but<00:04:41.460> anyway<00:04:41.729> as<00:04:41.789> you<00:04:41.970> can<00:04:42.120> see<00:04:43.130> only

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
better so but anyway as you can see only

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.070 
better so but anyway as you can see only
being<00:04:44.340> in<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.490> throttle<00:04:44.880> that<00:04:45.240> much<00:04:45.509> and<00:04:45.900> when

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
being in the throttle that much and when

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.409 
being in the throttle that much and when
I'm<00:04:46.229> idling<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:47.100> hardly<00:04:47.520> any<00:04:47.759> throttle<00:04:48.180> at<00:04:48.300> all

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
I'm idling it hardly any throttle at all

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.040 
I'm idling it hardly any throttle at all
anyway<00:04:49.100> that's<00:04:50.100> pretty<00:04:50.250> efficient<00:04:51.150> so<00:04:51.720> and

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
anyway that's pretty efficient so and

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.740 
anyway that's pretty efficient so and
naturally<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:52.620> have<00:04:52.740> a<00:04:52.830> i<00:04:53.160> ported<00:04:54.060> my<00:04:54.210> intake<00:04:54.600> in

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
naturally I have a i ported my intake in

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.540 
naturally I have a i ported my intake in
my<00:04:54.900> exhaust<00:04:55.259> but<00:04:55.620> I<00:04:55.650> mean<00:04:55.860> it's<00:04:56.009> not<00:04:56.130> that<00:04:56.370> big

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
my exhaust but I mean it's not that big

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.110 
my exhaust but I mean it's not that big
of<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.759> deal<00:04:56.970> so<00:04:58.160> if<00:04:59.160> you're<00:04:59.310> afraid<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.759> get<00:04:59.940> one

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
of a deal so if you're afraid to get one

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.890 
of a deal so if you're afraid to get one
you<00:05:00.830> know<00:05:01.830> for<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.340> price<00:05:02.520> they're<00:05:03.030> not<00:05:03.240> bad

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
you know for the price they're not bad

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.700 
you know for the price they're not bad
the<00:05:04.050> only<00:05:04.199> people<00:05:04.470> I<00:05:04.740> really<00:05:05.070> see<00:05:06.110> well<00:05:07.110> a<00:05:07.410> lot

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
the only people I really see well a lot

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.320 
the only people I really see well a lot
of<00:05:07.740> people<00:05:07.830> say<00:05:08.220> negative<00:05:08.460> things<00:05:08.880> about<00:05:09.030> them

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
of people say negative things about them

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.810 
of people say negative things about them
that<00:05:09.419> they<00:05:09.479> don't<00:05:09.720> work<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.229> whatnot<00:05:10.470> but<00:05:11.039> on

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
that they don't work and whatnot but on

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.810 
that they don't work and whatnot but on
these<00:05:12.300> bikes<00:05:12.570> I<00:05:12.870> believe<00:05:13.199> they<00:05:13.410> do<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.949> I<00:05:14.550> feel

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
these bikes I believe they do and I feel

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.540 
these bikes I believe they do and I feel
like<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:15.500> have<00:05:16.500> merit<00:05:16.889> when<00:05:16.979> I<00:05:17.039> say<00:05:17.310> that

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
like I have merit when I say that

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.860 
like I have merit when I say that
because<00:05:17.639> I<00:05:17.759> have<00:05:17.880> a<00:05:17.910> thousand<00:05:18.360> miles<00:05:18.539> on<00:05:18.750> my

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
because I have a thousand miles on my

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.430 
because I have a thousand miles on my
bike

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
bike

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.580 
bike
so<00:05:20.250> in<00:05:20.789> nine<00:05:21.000> hundred<00:05:21.419> with<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.960> boost<00:05:22.169> bottle

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
so in nine hundred with the boost bottle

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.379 
so in nine hundred with the boost bottle
on<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:23.630> so<00:05:24.630> anyway<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:26.490> only<00:05:26.669> people<00:05:26.849> I<00:05:27.090> think

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
on it so anyway the only people I think

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.240 
on it so anyway the only people I think
that<00:05:27.599> don't<00:05:28.020> like<00:05:28.229> them<00:05:28.500> on<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:28.860> motorized

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
that don't like them on the motorized

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.240 
that don't like them on the motorized
bike<00:05:29.490> or<00:05:29.759> people<00:05:30.030> who<00:05:30.470> who<00:05:31.470> either<00:05:31.620> can't<00:05:32.010> tune

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
bike or people who who either can't tune

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.170 
bike or people who who either can't tune
a<00:05:32.370> carburetor<00:05:32.909> A<00:05:33.210> or<00:05:33.960> B<00:05:34.889> have<00:05:35.280> never<00:05:35.610> used<00:05:35.880> one

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
a carburetor A or B have never used one

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.520 
a carburetor A or B have never used one
so<00:05:36.720> and<00:05:37.199> for<00:05:37.860> only<00:05:38.010> twenty<00:05:38.310> or<00:05:38.430> thirty<00:05:38.699> bucks

so and for only twenty or thirty bucks
if<00:05:40.530> you're<00:05:40.889> thinking<00:05:41.610> about<00:05:41.669> doing<00:05:42.060> it<00:05:42.240> you

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
if you're thinking about doing it you

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.000 
if you're thinking about doing it you
might<00:05:42.389> as<00:05:42.599> well<00:05:42.659> go<00:05:42.870> ahead<00:05:43.139> and<00:05:43.289> do<00:05:43.409> it<00:05:43.590> because

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
might as well go ahead and do it because

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.080 
might as well go ahead and do it because
I<00:05:44.659> really<00:05:45.659> liked<00:05:46.229> it<00:05:46.440> and<00:05:46.530> they<00:05:46.650> give<00:05:47.090> plenty

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
I really liked it and they give plenty

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.020 
I really liked it and they give plenty
of<00:05:48.180> good<00:05:48.419> instructions<00:05:49.110> on<00:05:49.349> how<00:05:49.530> to<00:05:50.030> install

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
of good instructions on how to install

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.490 
of good instructions on how to install
it<00:05:51.810> in<00:05:52.110> there<00:05:52.349> and<00:05:52.680> tap<00:05:53.280> it<00:05:53.490> into<00:05:53.639> your<00:05:54.500> intake

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
it in there and tap it into your intake

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.320 
it in there and tap it into your intake
well<00:05:56.370> whatever<00:05:56.610> you<00:05:56.789> want<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.000> call<00:05:57.180> that

well whatever you want to call that

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:04.820 
well whatever you want to call that
intake<00:05:57.750> manifold<00:05:58.320> I<00:05:58.409> guess<00:05:58.849> but<00:06:01.250> anywho<00:06:03.830> there

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
intake manifold I guess but anywho there

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.770 
intake manifold I guess but anywho there
you<00:06:04.949> have<00:06:05.159> it<00:06:05.340> I<00:06:05.550> wouldn't<00:06:06.180> be<00:06:06.300> afraid<00:06:06.539> to

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
you have it I wouldn't be afraid to

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.070 
you have it I wouldn't be afraid to

install one on any motorized bike that

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
install one on any motorized bike that
you<00:06:10.169> might<00:06:10.380> have<00:06:10.650> so<00:06:11.190> wish<00:06:11.820> you<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.060> best
