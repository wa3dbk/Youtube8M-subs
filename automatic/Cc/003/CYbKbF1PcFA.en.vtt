00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.740
 In this video, I am near to charge the heading 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.199
 the answer to your questions was long gone 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.160
 this column pau amma months taxi 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:24.800
 exactly and here it is the 20th anniversary issue 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.740
 issue and questions 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.390
 seven months old and so first 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.510
 question and place gives 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.020
 Olga Ostuni its Katyusha hello hello 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.899
 olya 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.320
 I have a lot of questions for five 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.390
 questions first you watched daddy's daughter 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.940
 if so what season do you like the most 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.460
 like further when you watched for a long time 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.340
 father's daughters when they walked on the CTC and more 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.289
 there was a class head and my 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.890
 favorite season was first and because 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.199
 I think it's always the best season 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.480
 Any series for me personally is the first 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.019
 season to take too supernatural 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.240
 now season 10 and first season to me 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.760
 seems still the most impressionable 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.560
 interesting exciting because 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.200
 probably in the first season we will find out 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.430
 we learn something new only for the first time 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.670
 characters of some of the characters are actors something 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.680
 we should be interested in season 1 and I 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 I think many of you will agree with me 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.990
 I 'm starting to watch TV shows from the first 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.180
 seasons most often and that's why 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.820
 the first season we decide watch the show 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.650
 further or not the first images if 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.479
 they gave you five million rubles so that you 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.820
 bought let's start with the fact that 5 million 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.070
 rubles no one so simply did not give them 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.010
 you must either earn or serve the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.800
 there is something from this opera but for me 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.530
 advertising so something special and I even 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.260
 I do not know what to answer this question and I 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.940
 I only know that I would try to buy 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.610
 enchanted there but he is completely 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.500
 several million dollars third 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.440
 what films on ct you most 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.340
 like at the moment sts I'm not 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:09.720
 I have been looking for a very long time already by chance 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.020
 looked flock of glory February 21 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.230
 and before that I did not have long watched the movie 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.750
 I do not look at the plaintiff and the fourth question 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.180
 This is a very strange question if you 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.940
 what kind of animals would you give 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.010
 wanted to be a really difficult question 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.350
 because such is not always given 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.980
 opportunity to repost when I would 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.920
 wanted to be probably with a dog and 5 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:41.180
 do you know how to dance gangnam style if yes then 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.180
 show I do not seem to know how 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.490
 question from john 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.000
 Yesenova answer you not that Tsoi Kan House 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.570
 has become 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.380
 most likely not, but in any case, rate 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.380
 and look 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.070
 anastasia it creates the following questions 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.910
 even a question why are you still playing 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.630
 dolls, etc. you're already 13 years old 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.180
 answer the question of your videos so let's start 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.940
 with that at the time of the withdrawal moment 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.140
 add that cantary was not 13 years old 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.380
 now I have 14 years, I do not buy Kukui 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.950
 We argue not give dolls and all that but 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.090
 bright neuter 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.640
 and the next question and gives him a coffin and I 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.530
 there is not very similar to Tanya and the grotto 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.800
 There are such books that 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:54.320
 written in my opinion like Harry 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:58.070
 Potter and his granter wrote Katya 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:01.280
 would you like to fly into space but he 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.780
 threw you an example in the second I would like 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.640
 fly into space when i was in 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.440
 primary school was not about years old 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.980
 from 8 to 10 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.830
 ailment 98 and we are with my friend Christina 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.959
 lead me with a friend part 1 and part 2 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.510
 wanted to fly into space and think that 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.030
 plow grow you flew into space but no 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.510
 Now I know beautifully, but I'm already in 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.270
 I don't really want space 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.870
 polina toot asks hi katya fred

 knows that I'm not wasting a video now and 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.750
 really let the camera cut out 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.980

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.060

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.270

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.400
 system if what he has played where very 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.210
 there is often a photo of my sister and my 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.180
 sister 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:10.580
 instagram in which there is and and the photo and there is 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:15.110
 Our general photo for today is asking me 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:19.310
 Olchik Bunny hello my lazy 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.740

 or dasha tracker or even tracker 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.330
 In short, I did not buy them, I just like that 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.370
 just so everyone was such a violent 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.210
 reaction which is very strange though it 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:47.060
 just a photo is nothing more but time is 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.889
 seriously it's like I'm so weird 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.009

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:54.650

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.949
