00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.889
 hello and welcome to my month game 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.969
 let's see in this video the turn of 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.680
 cool space that we have already seen the 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.180
 basic concepts the visions is now 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.670
 the moment to see how the 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.500
 turn sequence 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.180
 The nougat is divided into three parts 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.190
 fundamentals and each of them has 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.500
 a small subdivision worth seems 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.650
 complicated but it is not believe me the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.840
 first step of the turn is in the phase or the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.220
 part of the space marines the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.290
 Marines are always in first place 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.180
 within their turn the Marines have 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.340
 two options two rather two actions 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.650
 followed first in the points phase of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.790
 command where you will decide how many points 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.949
 of command something we will see in the future 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.870
 video they have during this shift this 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.190
 full round let's see it with a little 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.960
 of detail 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.789
 the first thing that takes place during the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.850
 turn of the space marines is the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.100
 command points phase 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.570
 for this we have to keep in mind that 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.309
 we need to have about this board 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.989
 is the broadcast status screen that 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.719
 has several parts we are going to focus 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.640
 in this phase of command points in the 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.830
 first of the rows are here 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.450
 the command points are something very critical 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.840
 very clear and that we will see calmly in a 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.039
 future video because it is the crux of 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.289
 let's say the phase of the marines is what 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.409
 that can give the player victory 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:20.570
 of space marines but to see this 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.460
 first repeated in turn is going to be going to 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.380
 give it a little bit over 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.039
 this phase of command points command that 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.560
 It is the first thing to do 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.720
 we need to have the board and these 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.000
 six scorecards of command points go 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.670
 numbered from 1 to 6 and on the other side 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.920
 are all the same you have to shuffle 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.229
 all mix them a little randomized 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.369
 the and take a random for it I 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.200
 I suggest that the best option is to use 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.460
 one of these black bags does not come with 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.429
 the game but they are so 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.200
 very simple and they are cheap we put all 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.520
 we give them a spin and the player marin 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.619
 spatial the first thing you should do is 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.600
 randomly pick one of them in this case 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.159
 we have caught the number two do not confuse 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.770
 with the 5 that are similar 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.630
 this page must be seen, let's say in 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.159
 secret the player jim stiller can not 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.630
 knowing the number is very important and 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.280
 once the space marine player 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.129
 I had caught and seen him put her 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.069
 zero on the first of the boxes 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.780
 of this track of points sounding to measure 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.049
 who is going through the shift will move 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.000
 this card as many times as you consider 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.799
 necessary, we will talk about this in 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.599
 a future video but you can never 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.980
 exceed the limit number that the 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.959
 exit in this case we have left on 2 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.090
 therefore it can never go from 2 in 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.340
 some time passes from the 2 will lose the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.720
 game is cheating but like the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.730
 player has style does not know what number 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.349
 there's here when I'm in 2 do not know if 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.120
 the instyler player does not know if the 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.519
 Marine player still has 4 points 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.019
 available or 3 or two to insist that 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.840
 we will see it in a future video because 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.310
 this is very critical to clarify the 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.780
 moment that you know that the first phase 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.019
 of the turn is this to take this number 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.209
 see it and place it also if there is at stake 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.739
 Some sergeant has died or if he 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.989
 the mission was a sergeant 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.120
 the sergeant has more rank and more power 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.799
 of command that the Marines 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.510
 so as long as there is a sergeant in 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.580
 game the player of the marines 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.500
 space after catching and seeing this 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.879
 tab if you want to change it can 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.129
 voluntarily return to put the 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.810
 bag will now be able to do things and 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.430
 back to catch it is possible to return to 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.709
 catch it or it is even possible that 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.090
 take a worse one let's make an example 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.950
 Well, in this case we got worse 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.250
 the number 1 but now there is no turn 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.480
 behind 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.890
 we have decided to change it now we 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.890
 we have to be with the 1 which is worse 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.090
 so you have to be a little careful to 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.799
 When deciding if we want to change 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.410
 the card or not because as you see as in 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.360
 this case can be worse 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.040
 once the phase of the points of 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.080
 I send what needs to be done and you have to 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.550
 take into account and is the responsibility of 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.140
 player you have tyler on the one hand carry 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.000
 the account of these points and on the other 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.280
 remember the clock is to turn it around 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.830
 to the revealed because from now the marine 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.820
 space is going to time trial to perform 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.820
 the actions in his turn 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.050
 Now that we have the points of command 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.970
 for the round and second the second part 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.010
 of the turn of the marines is the phase of 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.540
 actions we are not going to get into this 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.879
 video on them because they are quite 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.650
 actions I already have explain the 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.150
 we'll see in the next video but say 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.010
 that each marina has four points of 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.900
 action to spend as well 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.580
 also want to have some point 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.640
 extra with those command points that we have 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.160
 seen in the first part of the turn 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.870
 done this the actions of everything is called 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.579
 let's remember when against the eye it's over 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.200
 the turn the first block turn of the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.480
 space marines and the second one starts 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.980
 block the turn of the gym styler to 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.140
 difference from the marines the instyler 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.300
 they do not have points phase walking but yes 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.250
 they have a small first phase that 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.540
 it's the reinforcement phase something that the 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.600
 sailors do not have and can take 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.790
 less in each turn the steelers will go 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.830
 populating the price and they will go the player will go 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.160
 receiving a series of reinforcements we are going 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.140
 let's see 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.760
 for his part in the turn of the player jim 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.520
 styler the first thing to do is 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.870
 the reinforcement phase the lines tiles no 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.810
 they have command points like they had 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.750
 marines but they do have reinforcements that 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.760
 the marines do not have to do it 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.610
 see in the mission book how much is the 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.930
 reinforcement of the steelers in each of 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.940
 the missions in the green box we 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.440
 will indicate that the player and in style 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.570
 will start with a series of clips and the 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.010
 acb will receive a series of them in each 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.930
 turn the for example in mission 1 the 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.490
 that we are going to play tells us that he receives 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.590
 two reinforcement clips in each shift 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.300
 Well, seeing this what you have to do in 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.160
 this phase of reinforcements is from the stack of 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.169
 clips that are randomized went down 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.479
 salazar choose the number indicated by 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.900
 example 2 in this case good this 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.270
 should all be upside down of course 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.310
 and the player who estimates may see them 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.750
 see the number that is in each of 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.790
 them that as we said the from 1 to 3 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.340
 secretly without the marine player 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.650
 see and you can place them off the board 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.330
 in any of the arrows or points of 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.590
 entry here for example in this in this 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.350
 example we have two entry points 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.150
 could you place the two clips there could 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.520
 place the two clips here or you could 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.139
 place a clip in each of the 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.240
 the arrows if the other arrows what 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.130
 distribute as you want it is important to say 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.000
 the VIPs are placed outside the board 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:57.100
 they are placed neither on the arrow nor inside 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.650
 they will have to be outside waiting besides 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.169
 say that in the clips have a way 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.180
 that is called stalking when some marine 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.979
 space are found let's remove 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.010
 this door when something marine is 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:11.590
 find less than six boxes of a 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.750
 entry point the bleep can not 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.760
 enter its phase but it will have to 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.919
 stay out this is called stalking 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.840
 is left stalking in the following 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.580
 shifts may already enter if the player 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.660
 well the player jim stiller has been wished 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.880
 although there was no marine 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.830
 for some reason the player who estimates 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.570
 you can decide that your clips affect 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.990
 voluntarily that is to say they are not going to enter 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:37.360
 they will stay there just to do more 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.729
 pineapple or create more reinforcements 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.439
 because with the reinforcements already placed the 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:43.300
 second part of the instyler's turn 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:45.129
 it's the action phase just like the 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.840
 marines have action points in this 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.909
 case as the in steelers are more 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.879
 fast are more agile have 6 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:53.080
 action points for each model 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.370
 we will also see in a future video how 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.009
 can spend these actions is something 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.319
 similar to space marines and 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:00.939
 finished the actions the third great 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.620
 big block in the turn of the round 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:04.990
 complete is the phase of installing 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.939
 mission in this phase is checked by a 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.229
 side if either of the two in the two 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:09.909
 sides has met the objective of 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:12.129
 victory that comes in each mission if it is 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:14.319
 so the game is finished besides this 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:16.090
 If it were not like that, you have to turn it around 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:18.610
 and reveal the load of plus points the 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.860
 Checkpoints tab to demonstrate 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.240
 that we have not extended that playing 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.979
 marine has not exceeded and the points of 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.389
 command that I had available at the beginning 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:26.560
 of the shift will have to give to the web 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:28.300
 prove it 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.710
 finally they are removed from the board is a 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.840
 small cleaning phase all 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.300
 chips in turn that no longer make sense 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.340
 for example the fire fire alert 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.050
 the state of guard and some other 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.389
 chips that are placed for the turn 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:43.090
 concrete so recapitulating a bit 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:44.650
 the turn is divided into first phase or 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.600
 part of the space marines that 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.210
 they have the command points and the 

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.639
 second phase actions of the steelers 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.669
 the reinforcements and the actions and third 

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:55.690
 phase of mission status and cleaning 

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:57.370
 Well, do not miss the next video 

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.840
 where we are going to see the actions 

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.470
 that the Marines can make 

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.790
 space 

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.790
 thanks for your time
