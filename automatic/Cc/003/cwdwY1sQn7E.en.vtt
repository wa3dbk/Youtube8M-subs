00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
on you can then I will then grab my

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.700 
on you can then I will then grab my
blending<00:01:14.970> clear<00:01:15.210> which<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.470> clear

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
blending clear which is just your clear

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.310 
blending clear which is just your clear
base<00:01:16.950> coat<00:01:17.250> which<00:01:17.490> allows<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.060> add<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
base coat which allows you add to the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.700 
base coat which allows you add to the
blend<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:21.270> put<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.570> over<00:01:21.630> where<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
blend so just put that over where the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.340 
blend so just put that over where the
blended<00:01:23.100> areas<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.990> actually

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
blended areas going to be that actually

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.319 
blended areas going to be that actually
just<00:01:25.530> helps<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> um<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.979> base<00:01:28.979> coat<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.670> land

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
just helps the um the base coat to land

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.810 
just helps the um the base coat to land
in<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.600> wet<00:01:30.990> coat<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.470> base<00:01:31.799> coat<00:01:32.130> clear<00:01:32.520> base

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
in that wet coat of base coat clear base

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.039 
in that wet coat of base coat clear base
coat<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.829> stops<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> from<00:01:34.979> seeing<00:01:35.430> any

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
coat and stops you from seeing any

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.620 
coat and stops you from seeing any
blotchiness<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.829> clear

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.270 

so<00:01:41.110> I'll<00:01:41.170> turn<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.530> pressure<00:01:41.740> up<00:01:41.950> slightly

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
so I'll turn the pressure up slightly

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.969 
so I'll turn the pressure up slightly
and<00:01:42.790> not<00:01:43.540> putting<00:01:43.869> this<00:01:43.990> last<00:01:44.290> coat<00:01:44.560> on<00:01:44.710> quite

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
and not putting this last coat on quite

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.740 
and not putting this last coat on quite
as<00:01:45.189> wet<00:01:45.369> is<00:01:45.520> just<00:01:45.700> dusting<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.240> I'm<00:01:46.299> sick<00:01:46.570> and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
as wet is just dusting and I'm sick and

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.450 
as wet is just dusting and I'm sick and
get<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.020> effect<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.590> metallic<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.159> stand

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
get the effect of the metallic to stand

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.800 
get the effect of the metallic to stand
up<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.729> bit<00:01:48.909> better<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.740> just<00:01:51.390> flicking<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.630> out

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
up a bit better and just flicking it out

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:22.610 
up a bit better and just flicking it out
over<00:01:53.080> that<00:01:53.200> door<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.770> around<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.610> bumpers

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.980 

so<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.800> must<00:02:23.980> say<00:02:24.160> your<00:02:24.340> pressure<00:02:24.610> gauge<00:02:25.390> on<00:02:25.840> a

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
so you must say your pressure gauge on a

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.650 
so you must say your pressure gauge on a
fun<00:02:26.290> stuff<00:02:27.010> when<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.430> trigger<00:02:27.790> you'll<00:02:28.360> get

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
fun stuff when the trigger you'll get

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.140 
fun stuff when the trigger you'll get
the<00:02:28.780> digital<00:02:29.140> gauge<00:02:29.320> reading<00:02:29.890> one<00:02:30.460> dosage<00:02:30.940> for

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
the digital gauge reading one dosage for

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.390 
the digital gauge reading one dosage for
proximately<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:32.050> you've<00:02:32.170> got<00:02:32.320> pressure<00:02:32.650> now

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
proximately so you've got pressure now

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.449 
proximately so you've got pressure now
they've<00:02:33.670> got

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
they've got

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.490 
they've got
reason<00:02:36.060> being<00:02:36.269> they've<00:02:36.569> got<00:02:36.750> something<00:02:36.989> there

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
reason being they've got something there

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.649 
reason being they've got something there
they<00:02:38.340> actually<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.939> get<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.209> gum<00:02:39.390> nice

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
they actually have to get the gum nice

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.589 
they actually have to get the gum nice
and<00:02:39.959> close<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.530> they<00:02:41.219> are<00:02:41.310> one<00:02:41.519> week<00:02:42.120> away<00:02:42.150> from

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
and close so they are one week away from

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.949 
and close so they are one week away from
the<00:02:42.870> paddle<00:02:43.310> that's<00:02:44.310> why<00:02:44.670> they<00:02:44.879> have<00:02:45.120> big<00:02:45.689> them

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
the paddle that's why they have big them

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.690 
the paddle that's why they have big them
with<00:02:46.260> one<00:02:46.500> time<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:46.950> actually<00:02:47.280> got<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.549> gun

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
with one time you actually got the gun

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.759 
with one time you actually got the gun
so<00:02:47.730> close<00:02:48.299> it's<00:02:49.019> obviously<00:02:49.379> going<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.650> make

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
so close it's obviously going to make

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.190 
so close it's obviously going to make
this<00:02:49.920> smaller<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.609> having<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:51.359> big<00:02:51.540> fan<00:02:51.810> and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
this smaller so having a big fan and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.250 
this smaller so having a big fan and
angry<00:02:52.560> still<00:02:52.950> have<00:02:53.159> a<00:02:53.189> big<00:02:53.430> area

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
angry still have a big area

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.490 
angry still have a big area
when<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.010> got<00:02:56.159> inside<00:02:56.610> but<00:02:57.379> thanks<00:02:58.379> Dale

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
when you got inside but thanks Dale

useless<00:03:01.230> resumes<00:03:02.780> conventional<00:03:03.780> gun<00:03:03.990> and

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
useless resumes conventional gun and

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.710 
useless resumes conventional gun and
then<00:03:04.770> going<00:03:05.069> on

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
then going on

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.270 
then going on
pressure<00:03:07.380> less<00:03:08.100> time

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:24.000 

the<00:03:12.730> other<00:03:12.880> side

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.699 

so<00:03:25.010> you'll<00:03:25.220> set<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.870> fluid<00:03:26.870> needle<00:03:27.290> on<00:03:27.440> that

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
so you'll set the fluid needle on that

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.040 
so you'll set the fluid needle on that
your<00:03:27.890> wine<00:03:28.250> right<00:03:28.730> in<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.300> then<00:03:29.569> you'll<00:03:29.750> wind

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
your wine right in and then you'll wind

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.120 
your wine right in and then you'll wind
it<00:03:30.260> out<00:03:30.530> two<00:03:31.490> turns<00:03:32.470> if<00:03:33.470> you're<00:03:33.770> doing<00:03:34.010> a

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
it out two turns if you're doing a

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.000 
it out two turns if you're doing a
bonnet<00:03:34.520> roof<00:03:34.850> or<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.120> boot<00:03:35.390> lid<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.840> could<00:03:36.080> turn

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
bonnet roof or a boot lid you could turn

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.800 
bonnet roof or a boot lid you could turn
it<00:03:37.130> out<00:03:37.250> an<00:03:37.400> extra<00:03:37.760> half<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.300> turn<00:03:38.540> if<00:03:38.750> you

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
it out an extra half a turn if you

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.020 
it out an extra half a turn if you
wanted<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.410> it's<00:03:39.709> not<00:03:39.860> necessary<00:03:40.400> but<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.880> can

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
wanted to it's not necessary but it can

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.750 
wanted to it's not necessary but it can
be<00:03:41.209> done<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:42.560> if<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.800> see<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.250> really<00:03:43.580> doesn't

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
be done so if you see it really doesn't

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.420 
be done so if you see it really doesn't
take<00:03:44.090> me<00:03:44.239> long<00:03:44.270> at<00:03:44.630> all<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.780> get<00:03:45.709> not<00:03:46.250> many

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
take me long at all to get not many

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.130 
take me long at all to get not many
passes<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.060> might<00:03:47.270> have<00:03:47.360> been<00:03:47.510> five<00:03:47.780> or<00:03:47.959> six

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
passes that might have been five or six

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.810

months or to get the whole board um

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.880 
months or to get the whole board um
that's<00:03:50.570> because<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.959> really<00:03:51.230> have<00:03:51.380> got<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.650> such
