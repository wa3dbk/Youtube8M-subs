00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.730
 Claudia is not hot pepper 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.430
 I'm a biologist, what I like to do 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.660
 in my work is to use the technique of 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.820
 tracking 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.440
 when I did the work with the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.500
 normal methodology 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.450
 It hurt me to see the animals die 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.940
 to hurt the cages 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.449
 so when in day- to- day living 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:57.230
 This is it. It was not cool. I was leaving. 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.970
 works he felt there's the one like me 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.020
 I felt the pain of those animals. 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:06.290
 I saw that the methodology is used 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.170
 it causes too much stress on the animal and 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.660
 day to day living together in studying the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.960
 habitat of the animal upon seeing its 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.190
 food see how it is yours 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.240
 behavior 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.240
 this all makes us make a sound 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.680
 high study of this pro is in 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.170
 means to nature 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.830
 So for me today the jobs that the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.500
 I do with love are used with the technique 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.729
 tracking the results that have been 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.860
 with tracking it is larger than the 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.470
 result of the land of 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.659
 future because with the future technique you 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.479
 has a track of a thousand meters where you 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.659
 distributes the traps and gets trapped 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.040
 that space in the crawl you take 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.659
 the entire area 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.189
 so when you were laughing all 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.680
 they will be giving the whole area 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.750
 There you separate, I have a 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.759
 tree the captive kisses flower 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.770
 so I 'm going to work the flower here 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.960
 I've been full of the bush dog and 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.080
 just passed and he has this trail 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.390
 so I'm going to work there is a way 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.980
 how does it manifest itself in the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.370
 nature so that I can have the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.620
 record is some animals we can is 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.620
 make use of the playback make this flame 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.120
 bring in very close or other agents if 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.120
 approaches him 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.870
 and in charge is the first bottle of 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.890
 own evil because when you charge 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.599
 This I deliver smaller than you 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.910
 call the animal that corrects them 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.930
 but you do not upgrade from 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:17.069
 body 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:19.530
 I will not download the game puts the 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.700
 tracking is best in using the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.310
 active search methodology and is 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.700
 question of observation because you make a 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.920
 study of the animal and you do the 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.319
 himself in this coexistence and 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.620
 automatically you see and feel and 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.769
 can feel the animal to stress 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.750
 So that's when you get killed. 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:47.370
 often with the traps does not have 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.160
 as it always has death of animals and in the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.859
 tracking you can touch the animal 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.480
 you can check it out so 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:04:00.600
 and with him in coexistence with 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.430
 you without any stress without causing 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.090
 no death 0 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.269
 this already exists much longer than if 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.540
 imagine that the keirrison almost this use 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:17.639
 this technique to do your study for 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:21.109
 get your name plus the experience you 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:25.139
 more marked me and that marks me until today is 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:30.800
 the sensitivity I have with the 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:33.270
 owls mainly with a lot of year 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.000
 when I'm in the woods I can 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.729
 feel if she has a tank and 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.979
 first time I do the event 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.009
 in her place it usually comes by 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.349
 on top of me 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.229
 and land on the branch as if 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:50.050
 I feel like I'm arriving It 's like she's through 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.509
 that power them welcome and I 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.869
 I could feel that we were in 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:57.699
 group at the ibituruna peak and were 

00:04:55.869 --> 00:05:01.569
 government representatives and 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:04.240
 representatives of the organ is municipal and 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:08.050
 Event end everyone knew that was going to have 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:12.309
 a special visitor and I invited him 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.349
 to go to the steeple that had 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:16.839
 when I did the playback I thought so 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:20.080
 People, she always comes, but I 'm 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:24.580
 alone and now you have with this group of 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.339
 people she will not 20 and the ipc s is poxa 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.050
 Sometimes just a little I'm here calling to 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:31.629
 show to people that you exist 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:35.229
 and that it needs to be mobilized to 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:37.870
 You keep existing and she comes. 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:41.830
 When she passed with the one on top is the 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.199
 group they were and I said look is 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.680
 fast because she's gone and then they 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:50.759
 they looked at I put the flashlight and she 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.759
 came back over him 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.460
 Hey 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.310
 i
