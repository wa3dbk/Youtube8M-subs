00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
I use these on my short course truck

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.049 
I use these on my short course truck
however<00:00:31.740> they<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.130> make<00:00:32.430> these<00:00:32.610> things<00:00:32.880> for

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059

4x4 Platinum Edition LCG so my theory on
this<00:00:58.170> whole<00:00:58.949> tire<00:00:59.280> thing<00:00:59.640> is<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.329> little<00:01:00.750> bit

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
this whole tire thing is a little bit

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
this whole tire thing is a little bit
more<00:01:01.079> traction<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> lighter<00:01:02.100> vehicle<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
more traction for a lighter vehicle is a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.770 
more traction for a lighter vehicle is a
good<00:01:03.300> thing<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:05.119> quick<00:01:06.119> little<00:01:06.360> model<00:01:06.600> number

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
good thing so quick little model number

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.770 
good thing so quick little model number
on<00:01:06.810> these<00:01:07.229> suburbs<00:01:07.970> 2.0<00:01:09.020> is<00:01:11.299> one<00:01:12.299> one<00:01:12.479> seven

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
on these suburbs 2.0 is one one seven

on these suburbs 2.0 is one one seven
one<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.710> seven<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.640> these<00:01:14.760> are<00:01:15.030> specifically

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
one one seven now these are specifically

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.700 
one one seven now these are specifically
for<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.470> clay<00:01:16.890> track<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.689> why<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.049> says<00:01:19.409> M

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
for a clay track that is why it says M

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.090 
for a clay track that is why it says M
see<00:01:20.250> right<00:01:20.520> there<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:21.090> clay<00:01:21.390> compound<00:01:22.100> there

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
see right there for clay compound there

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.920 
see right there for clay compound there
are<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> few<00:01:23.790> different<00:01:24.119> variations<00:01:24.750> of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
are a few different variations of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.359 
are a few different variations of
compounds<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.590> are<00:01:25.650> available<00:01:26.189> depending

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
compounds that are available depending

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.609 
compounds that are available depending
on<00:01:26.700> your<00:01:26.759> track<00:01:27.150> conditions<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.380> went

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
on your track conditions and I went

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.080 
on your track conditions and I went
ahead<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.950> I've<00:01:29.070> mounted<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.000> these

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
ahead and I've mounted up one of these

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.039 
ahead and I've mounted up one of these
things<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.979> split<00:01:31.979> six<00:01:32.549> wheel<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.270> is

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
things to a split six wheel and that is

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.310 
things to a split six wheel and that is
also<00:01:34.650> gonna<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.850> slash<00:01:36.150> 4x4<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
also gonna be for the slash 4x4 and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.020 
also gonna be for the slash 4x4 and
there's<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> quick<00:01:38.220> bomb<00:01:38.400> lumber<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.790> that

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
there's the quick bomb lumber on that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.510 
there's the quick bomb lumber on that
two<00:01:39.390> seven<00:01:39.780> two<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:40.020> zero<00:01:40.680> two

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
two seven two one zero two

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.569 
two seven two one zero two
I<00:01:41.549> always<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> match<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.320> tires<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
I always like to match up tires and

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.310 
I always like to match up tires and
wheels<00:01:44.759> with<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.210> same<00:01:45.540> company<00:01:45.960> because

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
wheels with the same company because

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.770 
wheels with the same company because
they<00:01:46.439> always<00:01:46.799> tend<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.310> match<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.570> perfectly

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
they always tend to match up perfectly

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.710 
they always tend to match up perfectly
so<00:01:49.740> that's<00:01:50.460> why<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> decided<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.240> go<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
so that's why I decided to go with the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.950 
so that's why I decided to go with the
suburbs<00:01:52.229> 2.0<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.579> split<00:01:53.820> six<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.780> back

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
suburbs 2.0 and this split six now back

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.200 
suburbs 2.0 and this split six now back
to<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.229> suburbs<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.890> 2.0<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.640> basically

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
to the suburbs the 2.0 is basically

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.080 
to the suburbs the 2.0 is basically
their<00:01:57.420> second<00:01:58.020> version<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.399> tire<00:01:59.759> and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
their second version of this tire and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.050 
their second version of this tire and
basically<00:02:01.020> they<00:02:01.259> made<00:02:01.469> their<00:02:01.860> 2.0<00:02:02.430> tires<00:02:02.759> for

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
basically they made their 2.0 tires for

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.719 
basically they made their 2.0 tires for
short<00:02:03.270> course<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.170> little<00:02:04.409> bit<00:02:04.560> wider<00:02:04.950> see

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
short course just a little bit wider see

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.190 
short course just a little bit wider see
a<00:02:05.759> little<00:02:05.909> bit<00:02:06.060> wider<00:02:06.270> track<00:02:06.689> it's<00:02:06.960> still

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
a little bit wider track it's still

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.070 
a little bit wider track it's still
going<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.409> fit<00:02:07.649> within<00:02:08.429> roar<00:02:08.849> spec<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.479> your
