00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.640
 I the arrival of colombia bahrain 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.590
 the photos that we have left to me is that 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.160
 state ie red smoke superstars 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.960
 yes that I have seen as as a country to 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.520
 car towards the colombia national team 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.530
 a fan come in to give the training of 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.020
 Take a picture with Falcao the others 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.910
 children screaming the name ospina 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.700
 they received the truth as if it were 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.290
 the best selection in the world is one of 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.470
 the best practically what is going to 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.320
 upload this game and that's a subject 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.350
 interesting this is operational without playing 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.370
 against bahrain against kuwait 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.350
 footballically I may not provide you 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.570
 but what it shows is that Colombia already 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.010
 is at the level of those old 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.530
 selections like brazil as argentina 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.830
 achieved by other parties split by 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.600
 the matches of the stars equal me 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.710
 it was one of the pekerman's asides and 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.479
 I say yes what is 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.729
 doing because because if you can see 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.920
 the players are not playing everything 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.259
 moderate substitute is adapting to the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.690
 chelsea are five new players that 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.940
 for aesthetics will tell the team of the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.649
 then selection for best play 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.470
 against a weak selection maybe not what 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.720
 that people would like but I do not want to 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.130
 I think you want to risk before 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.869
 a cup america put it to play with a 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.149
 more extensive selection for 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.229
 dismiss it and those who are there are wrong 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.479
 have to look at one thing and that is 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.710
 sportingly speaking they are both 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.540
 last matches before the cup 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.619
 america I understand that people are 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.310
 waiting for a greater challenge 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.409
 but I 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.960
 I understand that here we are talking about 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.970
 business the friendly ones are almost never 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.220
 for something competitive the friendlies are 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.049
 to gather the group to do a review 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.850
 tactically and literally so that the 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.890
 federation gets silver and it is 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.070
 putting a lot of money with this is 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.689
 what man petrodollars are we going to start 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.700
 to have many matches so one would like 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.310
 that we had matches against france 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.780
 find him marias we are not going to have a 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.220
 lots of matches making through 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.899
 let's continue being top 5 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.900
 that simple of journalists can be 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.640
 have and the last ones who entered 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.040
 now to support the selection of 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.200
 new brands coca-cola chevrolet 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.080
 let's say you needed a tasty one if 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.150
 that 's true but but go back to 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.170
 example let's say from last year against 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.450
 who was the last friendly against 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.510
 jordan everyone said good 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.630
 Jordán I know that says serie won 30 no 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.500
 playing well but the team came in 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.849
 trusted world that clear falling in love with 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.670
 the same between before a 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.590
 losing competition 40 30 or 20 against 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.660
 a selection is the same level playing 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.890
 wrong that everyone criticizes between 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.010
 winning 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.660
 but we won and it has already happened 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.400
 historically ever a selection 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.990
 Colombia before a tie in 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.490
 the Jews turned us around and the team 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.530
 he died mentally for the 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.690
 eliminatory of 82 but I want that 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.150
 let's talk about the players because 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.490
 you say there are five new ones and those 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.920
 five new ones there is one in particular that 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.870
 I think it's the name of the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.100
 controversial and is the player of the sports 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.170
 that is to say neighborhoods how do you see that 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.090
 called because it seems to me that there 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.590
 is the politics of iu in social networks 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.450
 to all the fans of holy faith saying 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.450
 and is that daniel towers is Peruvian 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.160
 comes playing well is from last year 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.420
 but the soccer champion - santa fe 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.459
 daniel tower was part of the payroll 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.290
 titular champion football team 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.630
 Colombian this year saw a 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.910
 injury but it has already recovered and all the 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.400
 world knows that there are actors comes almost from 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.290
 One year playing very good level 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.690
 He deserved the call, that is, I believe that I 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.660
 first the one that wilmar several in my 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.270
 opinion yes but I there is not a thing and 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.470
 is that pekerman has it very clear 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.930
 level 1 equal is important but the 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.700
 The player's personal characteristic is 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.320
 even more because he wants to call because in 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.810
 this match against Peru and Dorón Pabón 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.120
 it does as every part is flying is 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.630
 idol in Monterrey but in that match 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.489
 against Peru took that free shot and not 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.600
 they called again because they do not call 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.630
 daniel towers because I encourage 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:27.420
 parade events restaurants 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:29.940
 judgment the polemic in cardona theophilus 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.680
 exact or theophilic but what I and it is that 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.450
 this was the call not that editors 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.100
 I could play why because you can 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.930
 look at Carlos before the media denial 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.660
 came but after the win with the 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.680
 arsenal but I deleted latin abel 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.740
 Aguilar has only played four games 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.870
 between 11 years 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.240
 in all the problems they have in 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.810
 these moments in Monterrey is the only 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.990
 Colombian that does not even enter 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.569
 substitute then was the opportunity that 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.039
 many people believed and a lot of press here in 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.319
 bogota thought it was an opportunity to 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.699
 directors was not given perhaps in the 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.889
 characteristics that suddenly also 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.509
 football does not like pekerman's 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.139
 soon for pekerman damage do not come out 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:11.599
 playing clean first touch the ball not 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.490
 I know he does not like the moral game so much 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.050
 Sanchez does not shoot good passes before never 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.630
 shows a clean Sanchez recovers 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.110
 like that but it's not the one that pulls out but not me 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.460
 me there playing old man's lawyer 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.460
 pekerman not the devil the old 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.740
 because so far he has 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.420
 I won all I won with Theophilus in 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.940
 his moment when he called him in 2012 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.130
 came that crackling and again blue in 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:41.990
 chicharrón in pork crackling 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:44.090
 chicharrón that rescued exactly if 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.790
 then when he is not winning 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.740
 all because she mother Alvarez balanca 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.480
 Were several scales because it is not 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.620
 in this call but consolidated 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.770
 as a great defender of culture 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.140
 The only thing that won us was with a stefan 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.030
 medina that was the last but let's 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.840
 see art what to call and it's fine 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.840
 second chance 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.310
 you also have to be a little fair with 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.830
 this 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.420
 monterrey is playing a lot yes by 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.850
 course one sees the goals of cardona and 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.320
 the goals of peacock but basically it 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.350
 ends is one of the best defenses 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.180
 central ones that there are in the mexican league the 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.130
 problem is that the team was put to 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.500
 debut in selection nothing more and nothing 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.060
 less than against Uruguay that is to throw it 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.770
 to war or talk that 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.960
 really well said that is when I 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.330
 I say 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.310
 to bring 52 players is also like 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.500
 save to save is like taking care of 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.509
 team can put those five players 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.250
 new and putting them friendly place 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:39.160
 you do not know 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.599
 Uruguay or put a friendly Belgium the 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.849
 it makes a Colombian like double the 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:44.199
 war, war 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.729
 being a chichi's daughter back but 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.510
 he also squares his players then 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:50.670
 I think the call was made well 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.910
 of having given the opportunity and the towers 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.020
 but let's wait and see what happens, I think 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.070
 with what he has to give me his matches 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:01.290
 calm and this will serve to know 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.610
 what will happen later who are 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.160
 those that are going to be definitively in 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:09.390
 the list because pablo armero 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.890
 cristian shoe is then Keith Zang to 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.660
 we all want him to recover but 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.610
 he has a serious injury 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.130
 after that, we also work this 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.350
 boy andrade clear you have to try and 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.970
 they are testing left laterals 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.710
 that is a very important thing but 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.180
 come on let's keep seeing photos because in 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.310
 seriously I love that the selection 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.630
 Colombia if you have read the international ones 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.520
 that not only stayed here but 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.520
 they want these guys with turbans
