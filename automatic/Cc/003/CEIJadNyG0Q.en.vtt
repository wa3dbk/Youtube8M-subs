00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
that one and my number 31 is actually a

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.680 
that one and my number 31 is actually a
twist<00:04:30.290> off<00:04:30.530> of<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:31.040> one<00:04:31.340> but<00:04:31.610> it's<00:04:31.820> more<00:04:32.270> of<00:04:32.449> a

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
twist off of that one but it's more of a

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.909 
twist off of that one but it's more of a
free<00:04:33.440> version<00:04:33.680> of<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:35.050> don't<00:04:36.050> like<00:04:36.139> it<00:04:36.470> too

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919

much<00:04:36.949> but<00:04:38.229> it's<00:04:39.229> pretty<00:04:39.860> good<00:04:40.160> it's<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.880> same

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
much but it's pretty good it's the same

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.170 
much but it's pretty good it's the same
idea<00:04:41.570> just<00:04:42.020> little<00:04:42.770> crappier<00:04:43.310> controls<00:04:43.850> and

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180
