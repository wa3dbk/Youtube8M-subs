off<00:00:45.330> of<00:00:45.930> course<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.530> should<00:00:47.220> have<00:00:47.250> tried<00:00:47.580> their

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
off of course I should have tried their

gold coast Dirk has a color called gold
coast<00:00:50.400> I<00:00:50.670> think<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.060> might<00:00:51.240> get<00:00:51.390> close<00:00:51.540> to

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
coast I think that might get close to

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.920 
coast I think that might get close to
this<00:00:52.280> it's<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.640> don't<00:00:53.790> know<00:00:53.970> I<00:00:54.270> still<00:00:54.750> like

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
this it's like I don't know I still like

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.830 
this it's like I don't know I still like
it<00:00:55.160> it<00:00:56.160> looks<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.460> little<00:00:56.550> plum<00:00:56.970> off<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.720> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it it looks a little plum off to the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.940 
it it looks a little plum off to the
distance<00:00:58.610> but<00:00:59.900> it's<00:01:00.900> definitely<00:01:01.110> metallic<00:01:01.829> e

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
distance but it's definitely metallic e

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.429 
distance but it's definitely metallic e
I<00:01:01.980> also<00:01:02.220> put<00:01:02.579> quite<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.300> hardener<00:01:04.290> in

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
I also put quite a bit of a hardener in
