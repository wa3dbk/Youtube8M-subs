00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.330
 All that glitters is not gold or anything 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.330
 what is trash is 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.050
 Once we're good we're here in Palmyra 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.050
 let's meet Paula and her little sister 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.230
 our sale paula she is 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.230
 and now what 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.650
 for light and there we come to my house and I 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.930
 I show everything remembers the discomfort and which 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.590
 of three 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.210
 Y 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.210
 yes brothers to you all 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.719
 Y 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.610
 all right 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.369
 its mission is to convert what 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.369
 we consider trash 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.909
 how important can it become 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.649
 this work with the environment because it is 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.460
 very important because for example the 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.429
 tapas takes about 50 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.380
 years to biodegrade since for 50 years 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.750
 they are polluting the planet 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.270
 good remember the caps and the sindica 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.280
 we are distracted because I know that 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.560
 you elaborate enough things with 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.149
 this and we are going to demonstrate how are you 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.909
 little things that we found a lot in the 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.620
 street polluting and making part of 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.350
 the trash that can be turned 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.259
 an accessory after 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.659
 washing the badges disinfected and 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.470
 sanding then we can start 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.470
 make the teaspoon 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.289
 we put a badge here back 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.680
 here between the union between what they have 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.880
 it's there 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.880
 we take out here 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.489
 well this is the final result of the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.420
 portion and is made with tapas 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:35.819
 beer so that the products that is 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.549
 put rolls that has the paper 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.840
 hygienic to perform these new 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.400
 packaging we're just going to use rolls that or 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.989
 whether they are in dispensers or that 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.280
 the person never has contact with 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.920
 them because if it would not be very anti 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.049
 Specular hygienic if everything is done 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.310
 with orange peel the orange 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.930
 obviously when we make juice then the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.330
 We split in half and we started 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.820
 squeeze 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.660
 here I already have as if I was starting 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.750
 in the middle and I started to cut it 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.580
 then for a pair of scissors 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.290
 let's cut to trim to trim 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.690
 until he tells us if we have to leave 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.880
 a bit 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.390
 because that's the base then we start 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.250
 the product 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.250
 like right now we saw that they were 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.640
 you want and then this we go through with 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.810
 a cloak needle you have to put a 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.410
 thick thread and we cross it 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.320
 completely 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.740
 then we also need dyes 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.840
 Vegetables in a small glass with water 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.940
 and enough food coloring and 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.040
 being pierced with the thread what 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.410
 let's rest for a while until it takes 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.670
 pretty color and then let dry 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.830
 1 to 2 days in the sun and we have 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.750
 this result I have the site can see 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.370
 the first things indication for you is 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.780
 very pretty is a very cool way 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.250
 also to recycle the cans that 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.810
 also it is also too close to 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.680
 just like the tapas and grandmothers a lot 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.379
 free degrade 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.599
 these two little sisters also in your house 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:06.780
 they do something to help the environment 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:10.439
 the vegetables like the tripods this one 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.909
 we put a little tray underneath then 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.650
 seacom because it is not really very 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.979
 dirty then so you do not have to 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.989
 the watchmaker we have all the time is in 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.789
 the pate and we are going to give seedlings 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.800
 also with this two we treat 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.169
 to waste the water at least 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.770
 possible also for example I'm 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:32.370
 bathing I have done the shampoo and 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.840
 they must also soap a whole to 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.840
 to try to save 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.470
 saves time saves water there are vacancies 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.090
 they try to do it they are like simple things 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.919
 but that little by little we can go 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.990
 contributing to improve the environment 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.849
 environment and it is very important that with 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.210
 small actions we achieve great 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.210
 changes 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:06.550
 where my sister works and then there 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.550
 let's show a collection of color 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.690
 this is a jacket as you can see 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.720
 simulates as if it were a jacket 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.300
 home 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.020
 the other design that we have here 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.420
 is 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.270
 a balloon dress 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.550
 this side is how we have our cute 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.740
 world at this time and that's how it's going to 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.360
 to stay if we do not take care of it that's like the 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.670
 way that I have to send a 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.440
 message through design not only 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:44.110
 I'm seeing a message but also 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.910
 I'm contributing by recycling scraps and 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.590
 Well, not using prints and 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.360
 using a very creative technique that 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.310
 is the non-toxic paint on canvas 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.540
 as I had told you then I think 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.810
 that's the importance of 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.810
 collection 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.860
 well we can not change the world but 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.470
 if we try it on the bit where 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.900
 we live we can make a difference 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.199
 this was a chronicle for real time of 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.199
 true
