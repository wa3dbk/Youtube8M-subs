00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 ap 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:12.829
 for everyone today I present you a very well known recipe it's 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.059
 the recipe of the pilaf rice 1 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.640
 so to start this recipe you've been hit a monument 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.380
 vaud is going to be tight the seed is the indigestible pellet of their union 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.109
 and then you cut% into small thin slices 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.179
 then you will take a pressure cooker you warm oil 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.079
 olive 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.890
 if you have not you can take a piece of butter or margarine and there 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.030
 you put the onions on a medium heat and you will sweat them like that 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.789
 for one to two minutes and you add the alliance mold a bus or a 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.340
 little bit lighter and servette at least so relieved but you can 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.510
 to use a clove of garlic it's you who see 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.670
 then you have washed the rice for the past two minutes under clear water 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.660
 and when it is well launched you want to add to the preparation of 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.070
 early winter onions and mold alliance and you mix for 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.300
 well incorporate it all around while everything mixes well 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.250
 so when you mix well like that for a little bit about three 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.130
 minutes 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.930
 you will be able to add a pinch of salt a little bit of mill pepper 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.180
 and for those dried thyme surround or so cool weather if you have the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.540
 chance to have a small garden that is fresh thyme that grows enough it's not 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.860
 very bad 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.150
 give you a good change of preparation so that time is well incorporated 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.440
 with the rest and then you have placed bay leaves so 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.170
 one or I like it 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.200
 in the immediate future because I like it 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.740
 it's a good little lesson so you put them in and give yourself a throw again 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.000
 then you'll be able to add the other one and put yourself back into play and good at 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.930
 again there the preparation you're going to put on a fiery fire 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.540
 and for this duo was going to close the pressure cooker and to go to India to 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.030
 moment when there is pressure you know reduce them fire and let it cook 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.030
 for 6 to 7 minutes no more 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.939
 that's all after the cices this minute of cooking so that gives you to 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.590
 harry yeaggy well inflated and so there is no longer any tour of oman any 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.389
 corrected two seemed to Jura it's really if this minute it's 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:24.199
 accurate ap 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.829
 so for that rice it is ready you can serve better with that has 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.689
 weights are right now it's super good or small lamb chops ah 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.069
 yes and think also before serving to 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.379
 to remove the small bay leaves 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.450
 I wish you a very good appetite and you can find all
