00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.180
 Milan 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 I say something Milan 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.280
 Everyday shadee 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.220
 Hello people, and nice that you are watching a new vlog. 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.960
 My name is milan and today I'm going to show you the little milan and so on part 2. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.840
 And I do this because you really inhuman a lot, look effe this look effe this just, how many people found this fat. 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.360
 I .. I .. I really appreciate this enormously, because this is all lost material, which was once on google videos. 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.520
 But now it has finally been found again. 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.660
 So I really like my personal videos from the past when I was even smaller. 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.080
 .. and also had a passion for making videos. 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.180
 While I actually did not realize how far I could get there. 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 To share that with you, I think that's really great, and I really thank you for that. 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.420
 So I hope I can make some of you smile again .. 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.020
 ..with some new great videos that I have found. 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.100
 I have, as I said, much more, so I think I can go to part five or something. 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.100
 But as I go I just grabbed a small selection of videos that I thought were funny and where I could tell something. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.800
 So let's just start right away. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.860
 With the very first video. 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.740
 Okay, the first video is entitled: "Milan is jumping in the bushes." 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.340
 and as you see here 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.340
 I'm a little weird there, wearing my red shirt. 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.800
 And there are two of those boys there. 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.760
 Those were then the friends from the neighborhood. 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.800
 As some of you may know, I lived in The Hague, in the Houtwijk neighborhood. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.800
 And I didn't really have many friends there. Because I came from Assen, I came from the north, I was a farmer. 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.000
 People didn't think it was really cool to play with me or do things with me. 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.620
 Because I didn't come from The Hague. 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 I was a Hagenaar and not a Hagenees. 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.620
 No matter how crazy it sounds, it's really true. 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.180
 So I met these two guys from the neighborhood 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.660
 They were also friends with Enzo 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.900
 and we started doing stunts, we were crazy about Jackass 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.380
 and I said, you know what, guys, you know what I'm going to do 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.280
 film me, I'm jumping in a bush. 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.780
 And then 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780
 this happened 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.780
 wow 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.660
 look my hands 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.740
 well so all you saw was that scream was really high in one go 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.960
 because I did not expect that there was something in the bushes that caused me such a shock effect. 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.740
 and you also hear someone say "lekah" 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.320
 that was Enzo who was filming and he was so "lekah" 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.380
 but yes like me so there was something in those bushes that made me scream so "ah" so weird 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.240
 We walked further in the neighborhood and then at a certain point I told *** and I all have bumps on my arms 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.800
 So and so immediately grabbed the camera and immediately started filming it and I know that I'm going to explain what happened 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.300
 And that was this video 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.280
 Here I went to explain what happened and what it looked like 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.920
 Naja you will see for yourself 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.880
 This had just happened when I jumped into those bushes 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.940
 There were stinging nettles behind it, just look, all those bumps, a bit here too 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.020
 Either I am allergic to that thing, or there are nettles and I think the latter 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.060
 "That thing" 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.220
 "That thing" says Enzo ff 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.400
 I think it's really brilliant to see it again 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480
 There were also stinging nettles in it or something 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.980
 It was very weird. I got all those crazy bumps on my arms and they were gone the next day 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.760
 But it really started to itch, and I really thought 'what the hell is happening here' 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.880
 yes, it was just a stupid action of me to jump into the bushes
