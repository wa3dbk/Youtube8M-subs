if you combine it with something like

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.920 
if you combine it with something like
the<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:20.970> cable<00:01:21.210> which<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.570> sold<00:01:21.750> separately

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the one cable which is sold separately

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.530 
the one cable which is sold separately
you'll<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.740> able<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.009> connect<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.119> great<00:01:24.420> deal

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
you'll be able to connect a great deal

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.870 
you'll be able to connect a great deal
of<00:01:24.570> different<00:01:25.080> devices<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> very<00:01:26.580> small

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
of different devices with a very small

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.760 
of different devices with a very small
amount<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.270> actual<00:01:27.479> bulk<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.960> carry-on<00:01:28.530> space

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
amount of actual bulk in carry-on space

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.100 
amount of actual bulk in carry-on space
so<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.090> will<00:01:30.270> allow<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.659> connect<00:01:30.990> to

so this will allow you to connect to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.039 
so this will allow you to connect to
Apple<00:01:31.409> devices<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.829> an<00:01:31.979> iPhone<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:33.450> also

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049

Apple devices like an iPhone and also
Android<00:01:34.590> devices<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.430> other<00:01:35.670> things<00:01:36.000> would

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
Android devices and other things would

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.569 
Android devices and other things would
use<00:01:36.329> micro<00:01:36.930> USB<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> candle<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.340> even

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
use micro USB like the candle and even
