how<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:39.030> actually<00:00:39.360> make<00:00:39.899> them<00:00:40.079> look<00:00:40.379> pretty

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
how to actually make them look pretty

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.819 
how to actually make them look pretty
real<00:00:41.489> see<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.120> don't<00:00:43.050> know<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> think<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.649> looks

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
real see I don't know I think that looks

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:44.720 
real see I don't know I think that looks
pretty<00:00:44.070> real<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> me

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.549 
pretty real to me
I<00:00:44.760> actually<00:00:45.660> did<00:00:46.140> use<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.760> I<00:00:48.140> actually<00:00:49.140> didn't

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
I actually did use a I actually didn't

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.639

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
use a dry erase marker to mark the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.470 
use a dry erase marker to mark the
points<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.309> little<00:00:53.520> ahead<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.820> time<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.270> you'll

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
points a little ahead of time as you'll

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.600

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
see in the beginning of the video

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.790 
see in the beginning of the video
because<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:57.270> didn't<00:00:58.170> want<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:58.620> go

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
because I didn't want to just go

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.500 
because I didn't want to just go
willy-nilly<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.030> kind<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.270> plop

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
willy-nilly in and just kind of plop

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.060 
willy-nilly in and just kind of plop
them<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.230> they<00:01:01.350> look<00:01:01.530> all<00:01:01.680> crooked

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
them on and then they look all crooked

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.979 
them on and then they look all crooked
and<00:01:02.160> weird<00:01:02.399> because<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.510> doesn't<00:01:03.750> look<00:01:03.870> this

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and weird because it doesn't look this

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.840 
and weird because it doesn't look this
professionally<00:01:04.589> done<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.580> when's

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
how'd she think she's doing it so I mean

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.609 
how'd she think she's doing it so I mean
you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.720> don't<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> use<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
you can you don't have to use one of

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.289 
you can you don't have to use one of
these<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.189> use<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.400> regular<00:01:14.700> pen<00:01:15.150> or

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
these you can use a regular pen or

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.240 
these you can use a regular pen or
something<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.320> did<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.130> was

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
something I just did this so it was

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.859 
something I just did this so it was
easier<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> wipe<00:01:17.850> off<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.390> made<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.689> any

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
easier to wipe off if I made of any

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.700 
easier to wipe off if I made of any
mistakes<00:01:19.880> but<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.360> pen<00:01:21.600> it'll<00:01:22.380> come<00:01:22.560> off

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
mistakes but like a pen it'll come off

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.399 
mistakes but like a pen it'll come off
when<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.070> try<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.310> take<00:01:23.610> your<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:24.409> beads

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
when you try to take your little beads

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.580 
when you try to take your little beads
off<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.880> glue<00:01:27.150> will<00:01:27.420> pull<00:01:27.689> most<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> pen

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
off the glue will pull most of the pen

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.140 
off the glue will pull most of the pen
ink<00:01:28.799> off<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.460> then<00:01:29.549> all<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.030> is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
ink off and then all you have to do is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.550 
ink off and then all you have to do is
just<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> quick<00:01:30.720> wash<00:01:30.960> it'll<00:01:31.380> come<00:01:31.530> right

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
just do a quick wash it'll come right

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.590 
just do a quick wash it'll come right
off<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.310> don't<00:01:32.369> think<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.670> mentioned<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.299> in

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
off and I don't think I mentioned it in

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.420 
off and I don't think I mentioned it in
the<00:01:33.960> video<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.470> all<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> got<00:01:35.250> these<00:01:35.369> little
