00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:12.230
 hello bed with you 74 today we 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.030
 look at the next modification of the UAZ 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.220
 469 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:28.789
 let's get it on the coast 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:28.789
 start a new game yes really worth 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.510
 if I'm not confusing anything here then he's a little 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.510
 above 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.260
 now we will drive back 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:58.010
 Yes, he guys became higher with something 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.190
 suspension apparently twisted again and all 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.380
 he hessed with stickers 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:09.070
 from the original it seems to me actually 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.070
 no different 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.790
 let's see what he puts 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.790
 general view like a normal UAZ 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:32.260
 kenguryatnik put bank 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.560
 it looks like yes yes that's right 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.560
 dawn bumper put 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:59.160
 repair parts but this is standard 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:59.160
 wheel detail 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.560
 which with crowned eyes full drive 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.560
 four by four 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:17.860
 let's take a little look what 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.920
 actually in it is unusual, I do 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.470
 review on 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.620
 at the request of subscribers asked me 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.450
 two days ago about it I could not yesterday 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.830
 nothing to do because there were others 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.830
 I could not do things 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.330
 honestly i don't see any difference 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.379
 besides these fucking stickers in 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.379
 basically everything is the same 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.800
 if you see any difference then i 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.800
 very happy to be honest I do not see any 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.930
 he is not all that was left 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.930
 except for the wheels actually added and 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.930
 of stickers 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.420
 yes suspension all the same and even 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.290
 actually did not change the only thing 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.200
 probably made higher UAZ set 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.350
 so when you stand on it wheels 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.040
 so that the wheels do not touch the body itself 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:51.440
 car because of this he was pulled up 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:55.600
 little suspension landing was higher but 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.600
 otherwise it is the same UAZ 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.600
 proper 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.159
 differential still robbing us 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.370
 I saw a battle game guys I will show you 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.370
 him 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.390
 here look from this side right 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.630
 the wheel in the direction of the car she 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.690
 shines through 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:48.060
 that is, if here it stands this one 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:52.190
 white rim cast probably or something from 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:57.150
 metal make them here its own 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:00.960
 no so from this side new i think that 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:05.040
 from this side too it will be yes 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.950
 all the same that is one with this 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.340
 hand he is visible on the other hand he is not 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.340
 is visible 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.790
 guys there is nothing nothing to do 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.840
 consider it is actually standard 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:27.050
 azik plastered with stickers screwed 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:30.350
 additionally three wheel modifications she 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.340
 easier bumper to screw it all 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:36.740
 nothing new is in this UAZ 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:40.900
