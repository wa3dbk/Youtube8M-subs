 you are good in this video we are going to do 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.799
 a very useful tutorial I believe to be able to 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.860
 install and use applications 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.110
 Android in our PC either windows mac 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.389
 or linux fixos that has the dock of my 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.730
 mac I have from apple and goals messenger 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.670
 instagram and we can install any 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.710
 Android phone app we start 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.690
 let's start with this useful tutorial 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.540
 guys tell you what we need is 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.070
 the google browser google chrome and 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.720
 when we have google chrome installed 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.940
 if you do not forget jacques for me so 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.170
 least is my default browser what 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.820
 what we have to do is install a 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.460
 extension that is called 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.350
 wilder this extension in the link os what 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.330
 I leave in the description of this video you 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.610
 click here and go here directly if you do not 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.830
 you find it later install 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.660
 this extension and when you already have it 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.480
 let's execute it let's go for 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.410
 example here to the applications of 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.850
 Google 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.640
 let's apply to run the application 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.440
 of the network we are going to minimize all this and 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.970
 well how does this work in the first 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.100
 Once the startup is here you have to 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.560
 create a folder that is called android and 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.940
 because there simply synchronized with 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.340
 this application so that all 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.470
 files are saved there not from 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.940
 here what you need is to download the 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.799
 apk of the application that you want 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.960
 use let's go back a moment 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.150
 because to notice that I recommend the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.820
 apply on the after-down website 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.920
 here you see the url doubt a dot com 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.079
 android you can search in google in bing 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.670
 where you want the apk this you already know 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.450
 how to find them is quite simple 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.189
 but 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.140
 the case what we need basically 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.960
 to run them on mac in windows and 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.670
 linux is this extension of chrome without 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.469
 chrome will not work in that way 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.990
 which is the mother of the lamb of what 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.240
 we need from here simply 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.560
 let's tell you where the apk is in 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.299
 this case I have a folder here 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.280
 with several freckles and we will install 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.560
 for example the to see according what 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.950
 we select and here we have the option 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.659
 to run this application or well 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.340
 integrate it with our system we can 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.159
 tell him that we want to execute it in 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.039
 danske horizontally vertically in mode 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.509
 view of tablet phone view 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.189
 maximized to see the full screen 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.229
 I will use in the view of 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.090
 phone and here as I tell you we have the 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.260
 option to run the application or 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.150
 to create a zip and this is very 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.920
 interesting because in this way we're going 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.569
 to integrated into the system here 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.940
 simply what you have to do is 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.799
 add the extension to the end of the name 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.569
 of the file and select where you want 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.760
 install it in this case to me this from 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.040
 folder to reset by default it's already going 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.560
 alright so well let's create this 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.660
 zip let's go to the end of the and now in 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.360
 the feader let's go to the folder of 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.430
 rc and note that the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.380
 the flipper cit file we're going to 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.990
 unzip once we have it 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.190
 decompressed let's go back to chrome 's 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.740
 agreement guys and once in chrome 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.100
 we have to go to the settings more 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.950
 extensions tools activate the 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.110
 developer mode and load extension 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.790
 uncompressed and we will select by 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.640
 well in this case flap and see that we have 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.110
 decompressed at last do not notice that here 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.459
 we are going to install all these 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.480
 Android apps that we 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.920
 we want 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.630
 if we want to erase some good 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.090
 let's erase for example clash of land 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.230
 that really does not work the the truth 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.720
 that the applications work a lot 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.610
 well most will work for you but 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.230
 not all work in this case clash of 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.300
 plants to me for example does not work 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.160
 so I can delete it directly 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.200
 from here guys and good once 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.600
 let's have this done is as simple as 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.560
 we are going to close all this already 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.300
 it doesn'' T work 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.100
 we can go to the lounge pad of 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.989
 mac and all android apps 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.030
 that we go installing will appear 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.130
 here and we can catch and we can 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.530
 drag to the dock to have them here to 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.120
 manolo we have eliminated it clash of 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.150
 plants let's see for example how 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.650
 it works we go to the mythical flap and see 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.720
 I get rid of the freckle of the installed 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.879
 as you have seen and nothing simply 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.400
 we give the play and we will be able to see 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.379
 play calmly to the flop and see no 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.849
 I'm going to finish the game mother of mine 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.560
 I'm coming out I got a point 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.810
 good guys let's go to another 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.640
 show instagram maybe one of the 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.370
 most useful applications that we can 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.590
 have in our mac or windows or linux 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.780
 if really good then you are amateurs 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.280
 to this social network is not very well 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.040
 notice that we can move with 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.170
 We can give you a comfort like as 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.549
 traditionally and then we can do 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.829
 searches and we can use 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.959
 quietly well all the bill 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.120
 of instagram one hundred percent from 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.739
 our mac this is very well you know 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.750
 that in our computers we can 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.300
 use countless applications but 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.830
 hey it is a plus to have the whole range that 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.990
 gives usroid that we have 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.510
 exclusive applications but really 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.770
 great guys this has been all I hope 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.419
 that you can not support me with a good 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.550
 like and you know we have more things 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.030
 for you and nissan to code puntocom
