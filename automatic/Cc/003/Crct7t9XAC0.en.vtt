00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.200
 then in this video I will try to 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.790
 explain how to go up 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.800
 on the pole and well granted the 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.420
 crucifix tutorial as there is 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.060
 would serve very beautiful 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.710
 in short, then I always did 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.779
 usually with the right leg then go 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.570
 to position the right leg at the pole 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.360
 right arm upper left arm more 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.160
 low with the hand at the height of 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.620
 underpass that pushes against the post e 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.760
 I'm going to hug the pole with my leg 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.649
 left 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.239
 is a position practically equal to 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.600
 that of the crucifix because I go to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.879
 cross and then I pulled up gave 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.870
 important is that when I go to pull 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.629
 on an effort the mans mans arms a 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.850
 so thanks to the legs are the legs 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.480
 that hugging the pole they give us the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.320
 force three climbs under the intersection 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.960
 the hands do not pull up are the mothers who 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.800
 they pull us up once we're in 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.840
 crucifix practically reposition the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.790
 arms one more to a lower one 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.170
 obviously always the right if you have 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.370
 started to climb with the right and 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.790
 we hug the pole first with the 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.740
 families and I pay my knees by moving 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.610
 the legs up then for a moment 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.070
 we remain hanging with your arms so 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.010
 pull up your ankles 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.640
 we hug the pole with the ankles 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.080
 knees and then pull up and then to 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.910
 new 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.610
 pull on the legs hug i 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:52.070
 ankles masters and their knees 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.860
 and then firenze then from a calighe 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.340
 knees up once we're up 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.700
 slowly we want the thing 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.640
 it is important to position the first one 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.110
 the amount the leg on which 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.020
 I focused on the first tutorial 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.980
 because this gives us the strength to 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:18.060
 climb this leg simple or bad 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.810
 in this way we fail to climb the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.290
 point of contact must be the bone of the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.370
 knee and part will stand the foot 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.230
 it must not be the inner thigh because 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.640
 otherwise we let you see 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:41.090
 the difference will be correct 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.090
 I know who knows it incorrectly 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.800
 I slide because I have not taken then me 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.730
 I recommend the first range 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.220
 extremely important when 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.840
 let's talk about imposing higher 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.920
 we must positioned well then 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.850
 knee pushing against the post 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.460
 outside because it also pushes you there 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.630
 then they will say on the legs the first one 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.630
 range helps the second to rise 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:16.490
 reposition the arms first leg 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:21.300
 which helps the second and we pull ourselves up 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:26.120
 we can also do together but it is the 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.120
 first leg than second
