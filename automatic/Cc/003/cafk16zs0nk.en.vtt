00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
already done some chips would cook

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.140 
already done some chips would cook
faster<00:03:00.560> because<00:03:01.040> they're<00:03:01.190> smaller<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:02.060> go

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
faster because they're smaller so go

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.180 
faster because they're smaller so go
ahead<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.390> remove<00:03:02.570> those<00:03:02.990> chips<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:03.920> those
