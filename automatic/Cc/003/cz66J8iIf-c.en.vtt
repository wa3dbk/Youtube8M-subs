00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
and the organ solo that takes place in

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.580 
and the organ solo that takes place in
it<00:00:31.950> it's<00:00:32.130> only<00:00:32.340> four<00:00:32.790> bars<00:00:33.030> long<00:00:33.500> but<00:00:34.500> it

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
it it's only four bars long but it

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.709 
it it's only four bars long but it
involves<00:00:35.129> I've<00:00:35.550> estimated<00:00:35.940> about<00:00:36.360> forty

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
involves I've estimated about forty

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.770 
involves I've estimated about forty
billion<00:00:36.980> individual<00:00:37.980> notes<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.640> we'll<00:00:39.539> dive

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
billion individual notes so we'll dive

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.930 
billion individual notes so we'll dive
in<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.140> start<00:00:40.350> taking<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.649> look<00:00:40.769> at<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.039> alright

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
in and start taking a look at it alright

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.970 
in and start taking a look at it alright
so<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.179> first<00:00:42.210> two<00:00:42.809> measures<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.530> involve

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
so the first two measures here involve

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.599 
so the first two measures here involve
an<00:00:44.280> E<00:00:44.489> minor<00:00:45.030> seven<00:00:45.449> chord<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:48.920> then<00:00:49.920> an<00:00:50.039> a7

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
an E minor seven chord and then an a7

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:56.000 
an E minor seven chord and then an a7
chord<00:00:54.109> I've<00:00:55.109> just<00:00:55.260> thrown<00:00:55.559> around<00:00:55.679> in<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
chord I've just thrown around in a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.349 
chord I've just thrown around in a
couple<00:00:56.159> of<00:00:56.339> different<00:00:56.670> ways<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.179> few

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
couple of different ways and a few

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.639 
couple of different ways and a few
different<00:00:57.600> inversions<00:00:57.839> so<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.289> goes<00:00:58.440> like

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
different inversions so it goes like

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:08.500 
different inversions so it goes like
this

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.030 

so<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> next<00:01:09.840> two<00:01:09.990> bars<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.440> split<00:01:10.650> into<00:01:10.770> two

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
so the next two bars are split into two

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.280 
so the next two bars are split into two
sections<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.640> section<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.540> goes<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
sections the section that goes up and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.600 
sections the section that goes up and
down<00:01:13.410> the<00:01:13.560> e<00:01:13.590> blues<00:01:13.860> scale<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
down the e blues scale and then a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
down the e blues scale and then a
section<00:01:14.940> that<00:01:15.570> rolls<00:01:15.990> back<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.440> forth<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.860> an

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
section that rolls back and forth on an

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.640 
section that rolls back and forth on an
E<00:01:17.220> sus<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:17.970> chords<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.840> e<00:01:18.870> blues<00:01:19.380> scale

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
E sus for chords so the e blues scale

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:31.640 
E sus for chords so the e blues scale
part<00:01:19.950> looks<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.370> this<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:30.140> then<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.290> final

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
part looks like this and then the final

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.830 
part looks like this and then the final
section<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.340> rolls<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.240> down<00:01:33.420> in

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
section just rolls up and down in

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.950 
section just rolls up and down in
sextuplets<00:01:34.560> an<00:01:35.130> e<00:01:35.460> sus<00:01:35.850> four<00:01:36.150> chord<00:01:36.480> e<00:01:36.720> SEZ

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
sextuplets an e sus four chord e SEZ

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.480 
sextuplets an e sus four chord e SEZ
four<00:01:37.140> chord<00:01:37.350> looks<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:41.130> we're

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
four chord looks like this and we're

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.980 
four chord looks like this and we're
just<00:01:41.550> gonna<00:01:41.760> roll<00:01:42.000> up<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> down<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.900> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
just gonna roll up and down with the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.120 
just gonna roll up and down with the
octave<00:01:43.410> on<00:01:43.560> top<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:49.350> when<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.500> put<00:01:49.710> those<00:01:49.830> two

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
octave on top so when you put those two

00:01:50.130 --> 00:02:07.190 
octave on top so when you put those two
bars<00:01:50.310> together<00:01:50.550> sounds<00:01:51.330> like<00:01:51.450> this<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.930> here's

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
bars together sounds like this so here's

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.840 
bars together sounds like this so here's
what<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.440> looks<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.710> if<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.979> play<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.340> entire

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
what it looks like if I play the entire

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:28.000 
what it looks like if I play the entire
four<00:02:09.450> bar<00:02:09.720> solo<00:02:10.260> slow

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.410 

all<00:02:29.010> right<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.610> about<00:02:29.790> wraps<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.270> up

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
all right so that about wraps it up
