00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
already learned the numbers from 0 to 12

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.339 
already learned the numbers from 0 to 12
these<00:00:08.760> numbers<00:00:09.179> have<00:00:09.450> all<00:00:09.690> their<00:00:09.900> own<00:00:10.080> name

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
these numbers have all their own name

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.890 
these numbers have all their own name
the<00:00:11.160> following<00:00:11.670> numbers<00:00:12.059> are<00:00:12.330> compound

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
the following numbers are compound

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.320 
the following numbers are compound
numbers<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:14.070> will<00:00:14.280> show<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.549> how<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.940> build

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
numbers and I will show you how to build

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.990 
numbers and I will show you how to build
them<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:15.980> just<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.400> English<00:00:17.760> we

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
them so just like in English we

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.880 
them so just like in English we
mentioned<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> right<00:00:18.810> number<00:00:19.230> first<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
mentioned the right number first and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.290 
mentioned the right number first and
then<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.369> left<00:00:20.400> number<00:00:21.470> so<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.529> say<00:00:23.029> 13<00:00:24.029> and

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
then the left number so you say 13 and

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.060 
then the left number so you say 13 and
we<00:00:24.810> say<00:00:25.130> 2<00:00:26.130> rights<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:27.349> so<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.769> put

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
we say 2 rights in so we just put

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.170 
we say 2 rights in so we just put
together<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.910> 3<00:00:30.300> which<00:00:30.720> means<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.349> right<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
together the 3 which means the right and

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.620 
together the 3 which means the right and
the<00:00:33.180> 10<00:00:33.480> which<00:00:33.750> means<00:00:33.780> sin<00:00:34.469> all<00:00:34.710> right<00:00:35.630> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the 10 which means sin all right the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.100 
the 10 which means sin all right the
next<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.710> say<00:00:37.980> 14<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.180> say<00:00:39.860> Fiat<00:00:40.860> in

onwards you guys change the order by
which<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:40.049> mentioned<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> numbers<00:01:41.040> by

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
which you mentioned the numbers by

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.679 
which you mentioned the numbers by
saying<00:01:42.270> 22<00:01:42.840> 23<00:01:43.439> 24<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.240> mentioned

saying 22 23 24 and so on you mentioned
the<00:01:45.810> left<00:01:46.020> number<00:01:46.320> first<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.009> then<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> right

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the left number first and then the right

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.020 
the left number first and then the right
number<00:01:48.119> right<00:01:48.860> but<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:50.009> Germans<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.670> keep<00:01:50.880> on

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
number right but we Germans we keep on

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.850 
number right but we Germans we keep on

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
then the left one until number 99 but

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.840 
then the left one until number 99 but
from<00:01:57.299> 2000<00:01:57.899> onwards<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.890> connect<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> numbers

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
from 2000 onwards we connect the numbers

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.209 
from 2000 onwards we connect the numbers
by<00:02:00.090> putting<00:02:00.450> an<00:02:00.570> int<00:02:00.840> which<00:02:01.350> means<00:02:01.680> end<00:02:01.950> in

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
by putting an int which means end in

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.389 
by putting an int which means end in
English<00:02:02.640> between<00:02:03.479> them<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:05.070> see

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
English between them so you can see

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.580 
English between them so you can see
these<00:02:06.030> are<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.329> numbers<00:02:06.869> which<00:02:07.350> are

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
these are the numbers which are

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.390 
these are the numbers which are
mentioned<00:02:08.069> first<00:02:08.629> they<00:02:09.629> are<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.899> right<00:02:10.080> ones

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
mentioned first they are the right ones

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.830 
mentioned first they are the right ones
and<00:02:13.099> here<00:02:14.099> is<00:02:14.250> an<00:02:14.430> exception<00:02:15.060> instead<00:02:15.299> of

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
saying ions with an S we cut the s and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.130 
saying ions with an S we cut the s and
just<00:02:20.970> say<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:23.400> here<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.790> have<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.150> number<00:02:24.299> 20
