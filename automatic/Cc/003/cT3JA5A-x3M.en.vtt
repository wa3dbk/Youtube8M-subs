00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.649
 good friends we continue with this in 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:10.380
 sunny 210 college entrance 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.209
 well we have already finished the subject of 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.129
 Mathematical Thinking 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.310
 in the aspect of arithmetic reasoning 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.369
 now we will move on to the reasoning 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:26.090
 algebraic if we continue in thought 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.279
 mathematical and we're going to see operations 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.870
 as not mine that are expressions 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.120
 algebraic operations with polynomials 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.070
 remarkable products binomial co 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.760
 squared conjugates and binomials with 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.449
 common term binomials cubed also 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.940
 we'll see first-degree equations with 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.340
 mathematical graphical solutions or with 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.530
 second degree equations applications 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.470
 with mathematical graphical solution or 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.720
 applications systems of equations of 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.030
 two or three unknowns graphic solution 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.210
 mathematical or also 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.989
 with applications equations of two or 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.989
 three unknowns 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.910
 and its application representations 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.100
 graphic functions and relationships 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.040
 I agree with these some issues that we will see 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.340
 in this sub-topic of reasoning 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.520
 Hebrew mathematical thinking 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.299
 good 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.359
 let's start with something short my 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.090
 Algebraic reasoning scans 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.360
 algebraic operation as not mine 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.360
 agreement 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.050
 He says 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:48.530
 run the next product 18 x al 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:53.580
 cube and square za the fifth x 6 x 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.690
 cubed and elevated to the exponent 1 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.130
 positive 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.770
 iceta squared does not get the 1 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.930
 simply there it is left without the 1 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.600
 remember that the exponents when 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.330
 we talk about a positive one does not place the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.370
 exponent more in an embargo is taken in 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.700
 account 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.800
 good from here what 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.599
 The following product must be made 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.540
 well really does not tell us if 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:26.590
 do it by dividing it by multiplying it 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.290
 in what is written prayer but in 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.010
 the algebraic problem we mind have a 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.780
 point and that means multiplication 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.700
 so what does this mean we 're going 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.180
 to multiply 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.580
 on the left with the one on the right 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.540
 doing the multiplication we have to 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:50.650
 18 x raised to the bucket by 6x raised to the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.530
 cube will give us a result of 24 forgiveness 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.680
 from 108 x to the sixth because to the sixth 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:02.050
 because the exponents of the x of both 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:05.110
 they add 33 are 6 like and with and 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.750
 three plus one remember that the and has 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.299
 one plus exponent is not yet well placed 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.849
 we take it into account would be an equal 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:17.920
 exponent raised to the cube would be and 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:20.530
 public iceta which is fifth plus the 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.319
 exponent of zeta squared would give us 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.640
 a result of 7 then our 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:30.670
 correct answer would be 108 xa 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.350
 the sixth and the cube 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.380
 iceta 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.800
 to the 7th 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.100
 This is a product made from a 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.600
 good multiplication in the next 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.900
 problem that is the 14 says we will perform 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.440
 the next division does not tell us if it is 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.440
 this 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.670
 if you have to solve the binomial or something 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.370
 so not here we have operations with monkey 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.130
 mine is an algebraic expression of 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:09.400
 algebraic rationing theme remember 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:12.900
 that we are in topic 1.2.1 point 1 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.900
 the next problem I will explain 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.340
 like who says a pencil paper so that 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.350
 can understand how the 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.850
 division if some do not remember 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.850
 how this is solved
