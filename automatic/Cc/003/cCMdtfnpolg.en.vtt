me go ahead and try it there's a there's

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.020 
me go ahead and try it there's a there's
a<00:02:11.019> chance<00:02:11.320> that<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.650> may<00:02:11.860> not<00:02:12.100> work<00:02:12.640> because<00:02:12.820> it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
a chance that it may not work because it

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.670 
a chance that it may not work because it
might<00:02:13.239> short<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:14.110> I'm<00:02:14.200> going<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.410> go<00:02:14.470> ahead<00:02:14.530> and

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
might short so I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.710 
might short so I'm going to go ahead and
try<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.920> carefully<00:02:15.489> plug<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.910> in<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.209> as<00:02:16.600> you

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
try to carefully plug it in and as you

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.990 
try to carefully plug it in and as you
can<00:02:16.810> see<00:02:17.019> here<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.829> recognizes<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.610> as<00:02:18.730> long<00:02:18.970> as

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
can see here it recognizes it as long as

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.900 
can see here it recognizes it as long as
you<00:02:19.239> see<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.980> icon<00:02:20.980> right<00:02:21.489> there<00:02:21.700> at<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
you see that icon right there at the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.900 
you see that icon right there at the
bottom<00:02:22.120> left<00:02:23.079> corner<00:02:23.220> you're<00:02:24.220> good<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.489> go<00:02:24.550> it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
bottom left corner you're good to go it

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.729 
bottom left corner you're good to go it
reads<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.080> be<00:02:26.260> careful<00:02:26.590> with

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
reads it so you have to be careful with

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.670 
reads it so you have to be careful with
that<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:27.069> lot<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.430> times<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.819> would

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
that a lot of times it would

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.130 
that a lot of times it would
because<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.430> metal<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.880> metal<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:31.080> you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
because of the metal to metal and so you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.400 
because of the metal to metal and so you
be<00:02:32.069> careful<00:02:32.430> with<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:34.110> might<00:02:34.290> have

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
be careful with that and you might have

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.500 
be careful with that and you might have
to<00:02:34.470> swipe<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.250> more<00:02:35.459> than<00:02:35.580> once<00:02:35.819> because<00:02:36.239> of<00:02:36.390> it

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
to swipe it more than once because of it

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.580 
to swipe it more than once because of it
but<00:02:36.900> then<00:02:38.060> hopefully<00:02:39.060> square<00:02:39.360> up<00:02:39.450> will<00:02:39.720> come

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
but then hopefully square up will come

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.210 
but then hopefully square up will come
up<00:02:40.800> with<00:02:40.980> another<00:02:41.220> model<00:02:42.150> built<00:02:43.220> specifically

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
up with another model built specifically

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.180 
up with another model built specifically
for<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.790> iPhone<00:02:45.450> 4<00:02:45.810> let's<00:02:46.350> go<00:02:46.470> ahead<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.980> try

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
for the iPhone 4 let's go ahead and try

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.229 
for the iPhone 4 let's go ahead and try
it<00:02:47.220> out<00:02:47.489> first<00:02:49.160> we<00:02:50.160> need<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.459> charge<00:02:50.910> something

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
it out first we need to charge something

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.840 
it out first we need to charge something
so<00:02:51.600> we're<00:02:52.110> going<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.290> put<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.650> amount<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.280> if

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
so we're going to put the amount and if

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.420 
so we're going to put the amount and if
you're<00:02:53.970> going<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.150> be<00:02:54.300> using<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.720> credit<00:02:55.080> card

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
you're going to be using a credit card

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.729 
you're going to be using a credit card
the<00:02:56.430> minimum<00:02:56.880> charge<00:02:57.810> would<00:02:58.080> be<00:02:58.230> one<00:02:58.560> dollar

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
the minimum charge would be one dollar

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.130 
the minimum charge would be one dollar
so<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.160> cannot<00:02:59.519> enter<00:02:59.819> in<00:03:00.209> 50<00:03:00.600> Cent's<00:03:01.019> or

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
so you cannot enter in 50 Cent's or

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.710 
so you cannot enter in 50 Cent's or
anything<00:03:01.440> below<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.860> dollar<00:03:02.310> because<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:03.540> would

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
anything below a dollar because it would

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.190 
anything below a dollar because it would
not<00:03:03.870> work

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
not work

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.559 
not work
so<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.930> next<00:03:07.110> thing<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:07.739> has<00:03:07.920> an<00:03:08.069> optional

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
so the next thing it has an optional

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.600 
so the next thing it has an optional
note<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.900> can<00:03:10.080> plug<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:11.370> I'm<00:03:11.459> going

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
for the aluminum that goes around it

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.200 
for the aluminum that goes around it
once<00:06:32.320> those<00:06:32.530> two<00:06:32.560> connect<00:06:33.250> there<00:06:33.670> is<00:06:33.790> a<00:06:33.820> big

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
once those two connect there is a big

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.180 
once those two connect there is a big
chance<00:06:34.570> that<00:06:34.750> there's<00:06:35.350> going<00:06:35.530> to<00:06:35.590> be<00:06:35.680> a<00:06:35.830> short

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
chance that there's going to be a short

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.980 
chance that there's going to be a short
and<00:06:36.310> the<00:06:36.490> second<00:06:36.850> thing<00:06:37.000> is<00:06:37.210> you<00:06:37.660> got<00:06:37.810> to<00:06:37.960> make

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
and the second thing is you got to make

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.950 
and the second thing is you got to make
