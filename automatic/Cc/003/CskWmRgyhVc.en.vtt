we've come and the what we thought was

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.830 
we've come and the what we thought was
innovative<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:05.270> forward-thinking<00:01:06.270> back

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
innovative and forward-thinking back

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.730 
innovative and forward-thinking back
then<00:01:07.110> either<00:01:07.950> truly<00:01:08.760> was<00:01:09.000> or<00:01:09.299> was<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:09.740> here

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
then either truly was or was not here

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.520 
then either truly was or was not here
let's<00:01:10.950> take<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> look<00:01:11.310> closer<00:01:11.580> look<00:01:11.850> right<00:01:12.090> here

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
let's take a look closer look right here

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.090 
let's take a look closer look right here
first<00:01:13.530> off<00:01:14.480> you'll<00:01:15.480> know<00:01:15.840> or<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.680> may<00:01:16.860> not

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
first off you'll know or you may not

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.490 
first off you'll know or you may not
know<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.940> is<00:01:18.150> not<00:01:18.360> truly<00:01:18.720> quartz<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.440> is

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
know this is not truly quartz this is

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.900 
know this is not truly quartz this is
not<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> quartz<00:01:20.370> watch<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:21.050> electronic<00:01:22.050> watch

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
not a quartz watch it's electronic watch

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.090 
not a quartz watch it's electronic watch
instead<00:01:23.910> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> quartz<00:01:24.690> crystal<00:01:25.320> vibrating

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
instead of the quartz crystal vibrating

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.330 
instead of the quartz crystal vibrating
inside<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.570> tuning<00:01:28.050> fork<00:01:28.340> vibrating

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
inside you have a tuning fork vibrating

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.890 
inside you have a tuning fork vibrating
inside<00:01:31.880> alright<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> next<00:01:33.060> thing<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
inside alright the next thing is the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.800 
inside alright the next thing is the
crystal<00:01:34.380> now<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:34.680> crystal<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.670> used<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> term

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
crystal now the crystal I used the term

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.110 
crystal now the crystal I used the term
carefully<00:01:37.500> isn't<00:01:37.920> real<00:01:38.190> crystal<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:38.970> not

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
carefully isn't real crystal it's not

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.720 
carefully isn't real crystal it's not
glass<00:01:39.480> it's<00:01:40.140> actually<00:01:40.710> acrylic<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.490> was

Omega man on the Moon had a crystal that
was<00:02:06.690> actually<00:02:07.140> truly<00:02:07.409> acrylic<00:02:08.300> that<00:02:09.300> was<00:02:09.450> just

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
was actually truly acrylic that was just

the common thing that was what you used

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.930 
the common thing that was what you used
back<00:02:12.510> then<00:02:12.680> in<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:14.489> 70s<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.410> 60s<00:02:17.060> okay

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
back then in the 70s and in the 60s okay

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.420 
back then in the 70s and in the 60s okay
now<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:21.670> particular<00:02:22.030> watch<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:23.740> crystal

now this particular watch is crystal

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.370 
now this particular watch is crystal
it's<00:02:25.360> not<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.110> original<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.690> pretty

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
it's not the original this is a pretty

old piece here it was replaced but

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.810 
old piece here it was replaced but

not the case here now you can still see
the<00:03:14.170> inner<00:03:14.320> workings<00:03:14.800> pretty<00:03:15.130> well<00:03:15.390> pretty

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
the inner workings pretty well pretty

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.990 
the inner workings pretty well pretty
nice<00:03:18.720> example<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:20.830> electronic<00:03:21.550> movement

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
nice example of the electronic movement

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.270 
nice example of the electronic movement
here<00:03:22.270> that's<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.600> very<00:03:22.959> good<00:03:23.110> shot<00:03:23.410> there<00:03:23.740> and

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
here that's a very good shot there and

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.180 
here that's a very good shot there and
we<00:03:24.670> see<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.600> sweeping<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.620> second<00:03:27.010> hand

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190

that<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.660> have<00:03:38.940> sweeping<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.920> second<00:03:42.340> hands

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
that you have sweeping the second hands

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.780 
that you have sweeping the second hands
at<00:03:42.880> all<00:03:43.350> on<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:45.090> battery-powered<00:03:46.090> watch<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:48.220> if

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
at all on a battery-powered watch and if

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.040 
at all on a battery-powered watch and if
you<00:03:49.090> look<00:03:49.270> real<00:03:49.600> close<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:51.580> notice<00:03:52.120> that<00:03:52.570> this

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
you look real close and notice that this

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.150 
you look real close and notice that this
second<00:03:53.739> hand<00:03:53.920> sweep<00:03:54.430> smoother<00:03:55.120> then<00:03:56.160> your

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
second hand sweep smoother then your

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.590 
second hand sweep smoother then your

another<00:04:04.600> reason<00:04:05.050> why<00:04:05.200> this<00:04:05.260> was<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:06.270> major

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
another reason why this was a major
