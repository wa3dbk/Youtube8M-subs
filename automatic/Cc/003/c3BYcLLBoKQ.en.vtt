00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.419
 have to see why you are getting 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.250
 energy where you do not have to put it 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.930

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.030
 open to my office as I raise about

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.900

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.960

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.669

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.860
 I do not understand that you are very worried 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.270
 for your cousin but I would ask you to be a 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.900
 little bit more mature and do not mix 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.639
