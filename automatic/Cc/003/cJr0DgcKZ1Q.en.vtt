00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
response you'll see the steering wheel

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.959 
response you'll see the steering wheel
actually<00:00:51.629> turning<00:00:52.260> itself<00:00:52.770> from<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> camera

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
actually turning itself from the camera

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
actually turning itself from the camera
monitoring<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> road<00:00:54.750> ahead<00:00:54.930> watching<00:00:55.920> the

monitoring the road ahead watching the
bends<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:56.820> feeding<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.390> input<00:00:57.570> into

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
bends and then feeding that input into

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.360 
bends and then feeding that input into
the<00:00:58.109> steering<00:00:58.410> wheel<00:00:58.559> now<00:00:58.980> if<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.219> were<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the steering wheel now if I were to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.099 
the steering wheel now if I were to
totally<00:00:59.969> let<00:01:00.300> go<00:01:00.510> which<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.780> obviously

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
totally let go which is obviously

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.720 
totally let go which is obviously
illegal<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.100> very<00:01:02.309> careful

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
illegal so I have to be very careful

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.490 
illegal so I have to be very careful
here<00:01:02.910> what<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> system<00:01:03.960> does<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
here what the system does is it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.140 
here what the system does is it
recognizes<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.189> there's<00:01:05.430> no<00:01:05.790> steering

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
recognizes that there's no steering

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.140 
recognizes that there's no steering
input<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:06.689> me<00:01:06.840> whatsoever<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.950> after<00:01:08.820> 10<00:01:09.030> to

input from me whatsoever and after 10 to
15<00:01:09.450> seconds<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.960> would<00:01:10.049> beep<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.590> say<00:01:10.770> look<00:01:10.979> I'm

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
15 seconds it would beep to say look I'm

55 because it says in order to stay in
this<00:01:47.679> lane<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.039> keep<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.250> safe<00:01:48.429> distance<00:01:48.460> from

this lane and keep a safe distance from

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.760 
this lane and keep a safe distance from
that<00:01:49.060> car<00:01:49.360> I<00:01:49.600> will<00:01:49.780> have<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.140> reduce<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.590> speed

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
that car I will have to reduce the speed

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.339 
that car I will have to reduce the speed
accordingly<00:01:51.539> so<00:01:52.539> what<00:01:52.659> this<00:01:52.780> means<00:01:52.840> over<00:01:53.289> a

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:53.349 
accordingly so what this means over a

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:55.679 
accordingly so what this means over a
long<00:01:53.649> journey<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.640> effectively<00:01:55.090> means<00:01:55.209> that

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
long journey it effectively means that

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.809 
long journey it effectively means that
you<00:01:55.869> you've<00:01:56.319> got<00:01:56.619> somebody<00:01:57.130> else<00:01:57.280> supporting

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
you you've got somebody else supporting

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.429 
you you've got somebody else supporting
you<00:01:57.939> which<00:01:58.360> means<00:01:58.569> that<00:01:58.810> you're<00:01:58.929> more<00:01:58.959> alert

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
you which means that you're more alert

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.889 
you which means that you're more alert
it's<00:01:59.740> less<00:02:00.069> tiring<00:02:00.459> over<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.939> long<00:02:01.119> drive<00:02:01.420> you

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
it's less tiring over a long drive you

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.779 
it's less tiring over a long drive you
can<00:02:02.079> look<00:02:02.259> around<00:02:02.380> more<00:02:02.829> check<00:02:03.340> your<00:02:03.520> mirrors

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
can look around more check your mirrors

effectively will happen and I'll show

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.470 
effectively will happen and I'll show
you<00:02:13.660> here<00:02:13.930> if<00:02:14.170> I'm<00:02:14.410> go<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.739> converge<00:02:15.459> lanes<00:02:15.760> the

you here if I'm go to converge lanes the
system<00:02:16.900> beeps<00:02:17.200> at<00:02:17.440> me<00:02:17.560> tries<00:02:17.799> to<00:02:17.950> put<00:02:18.099> me<00:02:18.130> back

system beeps at me tries to put me back

system beeps at me tries to put me back
into<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.819> lane<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.989> if<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.230> do<00:02:20.290> want<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.680> change

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
into the lane so if I do want to change

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.830 
into the lane so if I do want to change
lanes<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.310> have<00:02:21.579> to<00:02:21.730> indicate<00:02:22.000> which<00:02:22.390> makes<00:02:22.599> me

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840

a<00:02:22.870> better<00:02:23.079> driver<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.709> those<00:02:23.859> around<00:02:24.160> me

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
a better driver to those around me

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.770 
a better driver to those around me
because<00:02:24.639> they're<00:02:24.819> seeing<00:02:25.090> what<00:02:25.299> I'm<00:02:25.450> doing

much tighter off a motorway which means

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.250 
much tighter off a motorway which means
that<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.239> talk<00:02:55.510> going<00:02:55.810> through<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.170> the

that the talk going through to the

that the talk going through to the

overpower someone if it did go around

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.619 
overpower someone if it did go around
those<00:02:59.950> bends<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.579> that's<00:03:01.060> never<00:03:01.299> going<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.569> be

those bends and that's never going to be

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.360 
those bends and that's never going to be
the<00:03:01.810> case<00:03:02.019> because<00:03:02.260> ultimately<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.099> driver

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
the case because ultimately the driver

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.130 
the case because ultimately the driver
always<00:03:03.819> has<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.150> be<00:03:04.209> in<00:03:04.269> control<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.930> car

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
always has to be in control of the car

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.250 
always has to be in control of the car
so<00:03:05.890> this<00:03:06.069> system<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:06.720> intended<00:03:07.720> primarily<00:03:07.750> for
