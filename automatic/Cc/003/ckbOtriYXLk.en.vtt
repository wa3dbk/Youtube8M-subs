00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.520
 my name is greece apiaries and 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.070
 we are currently in the department 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.840
 of north of Santander working with the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.210
 municipalities for the project of the 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.250
 library in my house at the time of 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.250
 take on the project we took into account the 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.020
 needs of each neighborhood as we start 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.869
 of some main objectives but 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.840
 we were adding according to how we saw the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.670
 situation for each new development 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.070
 the people who were living 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.649
 some already had the library but no 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.170
 they used it, they had not even 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.330
 uncovered and people who have not 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.550
 moved are those whom we have made 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.440
 calls with whom we owe more 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.870
 do work because those in the neighborhood 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.880
 they have already received workshops have been 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.800
 pending delivery but more without 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.960
 embargo by both families with whom 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.000
 have been avoiding and we have not had the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.530
 same reception that they are interested 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.690
 to acquire the basic library 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.280
 family 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.290
 they had already come had given us 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.840
 some reading classes with respect to 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.820
 the books and they have seemed very very 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.400
 important because they had a book of 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.530
 book stories cooking recipes but 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.270
 Well, it caught my attention the most 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.159
 citizen coexistence that is very 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.580
 important which we all have to 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.620
 read really 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.600
 we have to grab it in practice in 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.960
 The first place is very important 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.970
 reading because because then we 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.090
 we have children our children have to 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.070
 learn to read to know what a 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.830
 story to know how to decipher it because in 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.320
 the colleges because they usually send 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.140
 to read a lot to the bare 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.180
 Like us, I like it too 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.610
 read a lot this is a person that I 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.860
 I read sometimes in my spare time out there 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.100
 I'm alone I grab the books and read 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.530
 because you have to learn from the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.330
 books not only about what sometimes 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.700
 teach but also learn a lot from 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.090
 the books 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.810
 My children have been noticed and 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.890
 me too my husband and they are very books 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.080
 important because one many times in 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.530
 what comes in the books suddenly does not 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.670
 many things that they did not know and I think 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.670
 very important because 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.960
 we learn more 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.800
 reading is very important because we 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.930
 instructs more makes them better people 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.890
 many times according to the book also that 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.180
 read 1 and you learn many things in the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.490
 dynamic with the library is that a 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.930
 Sometimes the girls catch her they get 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.359
 read it 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.790
 because I tell you the truth 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:48.129
 well no no I can not tell you much 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.140
 because I am a person that my 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.969
 parents to me almost never gave me ever 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.819
 they gave me study then I almost did not 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:56.890
 girls and then read them them 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.200
 they are studying and so they grab her 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.969
 I sometimes read heal my mom I want 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.980
 let me read is free or do 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.510
 mommy watch gets in her room and gets 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.019
 read it and sometimes it tells me and 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.569
 as I say I think it's an instrument 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.519
 very special for them and that helps them 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.109
 much as much as in reading for 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.290
 also so that they learn and can leave 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.290
 ahead
