of<00:00:21.449> hardcore<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.289> think<00:00:22.470> part<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.800> is

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
of hardcore and I think part of that is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.669 
of hardcore and I think part of that is
because<00:00:23.310> people<00:00:23.490> are<00:00:23.880> loyal<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.230> because

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:25.679 
because people are loyal to you because

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:26.960 
because people are loyal to you because
they<00:00:25.800> recognize<00:00:26.250> what<00:00:26.489> you<00:00:26.579> gave<00:00:26.759> to<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
they recognize what you gave to the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.759 
they recognize what you gave to the
business<00:00:27.239> and<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.480> don't<00:00:27.660> think<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.560> would

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
business and I don't think you would

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.609
