 video 18 of today that was one 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.450
 videorecetta a bit special because 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.579
 wanted to use all the milk costs 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.980
 coconut that I have in the fridge and I can't 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.750
 I only have to have milk, though 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.820
 admit that it is very good used 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.250
 to cook different dishes this will be 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.079
 a non-vegetarian non-vegetarian recipe 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.690
 so you can use it like mine 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.250
 case of fish or chicken I don't 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.379
 I had the chicken breast so I got myself 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.789
 had to arrange fish with me what 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.409
 I make these videos the recipe 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.240
 I tried it first time so I didn't have it 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.369
 idea of ​​what I would have created instead 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.170
 girls as a recipe is really good 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.880
 so I recommend the methods 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.530
 blather I send a greeting and leave you 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.240
 the videorecetta we send back between two 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.060
 weeks with a new video of the cards 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.670
 King Arthur's ingredients for this 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.040
 recipe are a portion of hake or 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.870
 fish to your liking a glass 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.480
 of coconut milk from the areas 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.360
 finely chopped onion lines 2 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:35.040
 spoons of white curry flour salt 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.990
 and basmati rice position a pot 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.090
 non-stick on a medium-low flame e 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.160
 about 4 tablespoons of water 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.290
 to go and soften mine 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.700
 zucchini and my onion in this case 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.380
 I don't use oil but you can 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.840
 very well use cooking oil 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.150
 because I want the recipe to stay 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.080
 quite light and in any case I prefer 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.950
 use the oil 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.120
 once I have finished my dish raw 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.590
 continuous giorgetto of water up to 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.570
 Pick vegetables are not enough 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.370
 soft and then I go to 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.080
 add my model but you can 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.730
 very well use the fish that most 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.369
 therefore prefer the cod 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.660
 swordfish in short you can pick any 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.910
 towards can immediately milk of 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.510
 coconut and add a little carrie and a 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.510
 pinch of salt 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.190
 once you have poured all the spices e 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.750
 condiments I'm going to raise the flame of the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.950
 fire face him so what the fuck 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.930
 coconut is almost absorbed 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.820
 completely from fish to vegetables 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.350
 making up the like milk of 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.600
 coconut is absorbed too quickly 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.520
 you can pour a little more for it 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.020
 I give an even softer account 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.730
 in this case I decide to go to 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.470
 further break up all the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.060
 morsels of fish so make them 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.230
 even smaller and once the 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.720
 Coconut milk will be almost completely 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.209
 absorbed I go pour the two tablespoons of 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.130
 flour to make everything creamier 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.989
 here too I use classic flour 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.410
 but you can use the fatigue that I most 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.270
 like it 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.760
 once mixed it remains there 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.950
