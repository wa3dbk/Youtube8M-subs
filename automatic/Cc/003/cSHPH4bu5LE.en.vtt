00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.829 
i saw these they just came in and I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.269 
couldn't resist going on a mad shopping
spree<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.289> heard<00:00:16.560> all<00:00:16.590> four<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:18.529> will<00:00:19.529> start<00:00:19.949> with

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
spree I heard all four I will start with

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.730 
spree I heard all four I will start with
the<00:00:20.550> rebel<00:00:21.390> snow<00:00:21.660> speeder<00:00:22.130> at<00:00:23.130> first<00:00:23.730> I

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
the rebel snow speeder at first I

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.779 
the rebel snow speeder at first I
thought<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.890> snowspeeder<00:00:26.340> along<00:00:26.580> with<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
thought the snowspeeder along with the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.029 
thought the snowspeeder along with the
TIE<00:00:26.970> fighter<00:00:27.269> were<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> original<00:00:28.140> box<00:00:28.710> a

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
TIE fighter were in the original box a

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.510 
TIE fighter were in the original box a
reproduction<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> original<00:00:29.970> box<00:00:30.539> anyway

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
reproduction of the original box anyway

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.030 
reproduction of the original box anyway
but<00:00:32.520> looking<00:00:32.820> closer<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.620> know<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.739> these<00:00:35.010> are

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
but looking closer I know that these are

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.229 
but looking closer I know that these are
more<00:00:36.380> current<00:00:37.380> figures<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.280> older<00:00:38.820> box<00:00:39.030> would

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
more current figures the older box would

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.310 
more current figures the older box would
have<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> care<00:00:39.629> appeared<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:42.320> think

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
have the care appeared on it I think

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.990 
have the care appeared on it I think
they<00:00:43.440> might<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.649> used<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> same<00:00:44.399> background

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
they might have used the same background

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.529 
they might have used the same background
and<00:00:45.410> positioned<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.469> figures<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> same

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
and positioned the figures in the same

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.209 
and positioned the figures in the same
manner<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.410> refilled<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
manner and just like refilled it it's a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.369 
manner and just like refilled it it's a
very<00:00:50.399> close<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.329> not<00:00:51.570> quite<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> replica<00:00:52.230> but

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
very close it's not quite a replica but

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.220 
very close it's not quite a replica but
it's<00:00:52.500> very<00:00:52.710> close<00:00:53.010> only<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:54.510> target<00:00:54.899> symbol

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it's very close only a target symbol

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.029 
it's very close only a target symbol
there<00:00:56.780> what<00:00:57.780> else<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.109> found<00:00:58.260> interesting<00:00:58.500> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
fighter just the back of course the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.390 
fighter just the back of course the
original<00:01:37.560> didn't<00:01:37.770> say<00:01:37.829> vintage<00:01:38.130> collection

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400

are<00:01:38.610> only<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.909> target<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.450> I'm<00:01:40.259> wondering

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
are only in target on it I'm wondering

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.090 
are only in target on it I'm wondering
if<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:42.110> use<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> same<00:01:43.320> background<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
if they use the same background and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.060 
if they use the same background and
enclosed<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:45.320> think<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.439> might<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.890> same

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
