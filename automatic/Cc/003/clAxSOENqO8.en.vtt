00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.940
 hello Vladimir Shcherbakov and now 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.469
 I will answer your questions 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.469
 such as place or face on curve 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:25.619
 Now I will show there are two ways how 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.090
 at least two ways here for example we have 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.309
 a curve is a curve that's basic but what 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.540
 it is on the red layer for me then why was 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:41.690
 made promises and place solid pretty 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.690
 we just use the command 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.309
 flow long arm in the matrix 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.989
 or it is simply called flow flow 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:59.570
 links to transform transform here in 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:01.949
 Blend transform we use flow all 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.430
 select the object that will be placed 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.750
 as it is written that is, for example, our salt 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:12.350
 Now choose the curve that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.520
 basic well here it is green near the end 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.979
 as it is here we have the symmetric 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.049
 there will be no difference if so 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.710
 after we selected the first curve 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.570
 she asks we press the right button 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.740
 and pardon moa 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.640
 I repeat the flow command again 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.650
 the object is selected by the right-click interim 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.540
 confirmed that we have completed the selection 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.790
 objects choose the base curve near 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.049
 direct object look what will be he 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.939
 means on but this object will be bent 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.920
 the patient's curve if there is a car she 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.750
 leave the object straight on the little ones 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.090
 objects it is more noticeable practice 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.920
 yourself 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.950
 we need a long object which is along 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.420
 the whole curve so we have it here this option 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.400
 must be enabled in now 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.580
 Well, a copy 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.910
 she copies 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:17.220
 copies our object will remain the original and 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.100
 new object will stretch stretch 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.350
 object along the curve 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.810
 he I with if not if the object is shorter 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.820
 crooked 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.070
 with this turned off, it will be shorter 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.360
 curve if he but if enabled then he 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:36.810
 stretch the whole curve 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:39.970
 all the base curve we choose 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:44.590
 now target curve target curve 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.960
 don't pick her pick near 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.090
 corresponding end ie if 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.280
 objects are symmetrical 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.650
 near that end for example which should 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.400
 if he were already here an example would be narrow 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.010
 here is wide 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.050
 you need it if you clicked near the end 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.290
 which are narrow then we have to click 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.070
 near the same end that we want 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.970
 start all small recounts and although 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.610
 depends on the show itself and our object 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.680
 ripped up he see me there 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.950
 round here oval became because 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.110
 she stretched the length of this curve this 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.150
 the curve does not match if we need a step 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.330
 to stay the same though in this 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.650
 the case is probably not important the length of the curves 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.850
 these must match the place well and now 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.850
 I'll show you the second way right away 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:43.780
 we can just immediately make a curve by 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:49.260
 available curves for this we go to that 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.260
 same helix or here hp 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.600
 alex alex 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:03.430
 he is here in the cake Aleks is the same 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:09.340
 team choose a tank select a curve 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:13.270
 and all we draw around our spiral 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:19.420
 Well, all its parameters are selected around this 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:23.489
 spiral do pipe pipe or here in 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.489
 solid we watch pipe 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.850
 yet again 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.460
 m parameters diameter and other things 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:35.280
 there is like this 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.280
 right click the same radius all 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.759
 but she will be a little bit 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:45.029
 nice and because i didn't count 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:47.430
 thicknesses ie radius and and other things 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:55.939
 Need to play with them a little or 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:55.939
 imagine what you are doing here 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.300
 so thank you for your attention
