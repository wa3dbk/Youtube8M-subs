00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello to you childhood i'm vacano sandy 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.689
 blurted out step by step the essence of the review mods on gta 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.760
 sanandres is also the 45th edition, but I took 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:13.260
 mod called mafia 2 cut cut 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.710
 added from mafia 2 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.060
 that's the principle of how it looks for some reason 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.470
 when I installed the mod I became 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.070
 ekranku and reed by the way I want 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.050
 discuss the solution and resolution costs 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.509
 at 1268 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.749
 although the crane was somehow pretty 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:34.310
 stretched than usual and also 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:37.710
 mod adds speaker this but principle 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:43.100
 here all the hunt for gta 4 at the top of the weapon 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 adds new icons all from mafia 2 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.850
 Also in the car speedometer is added 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.540
 let's principle 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.710
 hijacking a motorcycle, this bum is also won 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.010
 when we like someone thread 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.660
 we kill he appears we wanted 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.129
 search and here we have a speedometer 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.129
 principle like from mafia 2 he also 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.369
 It works very cool . worth 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.110
 cool and so we can go and the way 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.659
 it is a pity that you can not for example put 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.210
 label and we will be pointed to the path from 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.890
 both it was very cool living with us 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.350
 finds this here 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.960
 green striped bath probably 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.510
 apollo stick only opposite but 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.100
 we both have not yet but the principle of an hour 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.939
 Let's do 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.939

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.520
 nose and two stars 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.980
 that's such exact mophie base 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.670
 there was much more to add a speedometer 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:50.270
 also we sight from mafia 2 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.150

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.520
