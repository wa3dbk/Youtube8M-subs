there I'm doing a simple beat and I'm

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.300 
there I'm doing a simple beat and I'm
gonna<00:02:27.959> try<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.260> keep<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.530> low<00:02:28.739> here<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.250> you

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
gonna try and keep it low here so you

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.250

flute sound here and of course the
guitars

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.520 

and<00:02:42.120> their<00:02:43.120> one<00:02:43.330> chords<00:02:43.750> but<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.110> can<00:02:44.260> change

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
custom area so we can strum different

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.930 
custom area so we can strum different
guitars<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:56.230> do<00:02:56.379> have<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.769> vu<00:02:57.159> meter<00:02:57.430> up<00:02:57.730> on

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
guitars you do have the vu meter up on

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.509 
guitars you do have the vu meter up on
top<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.840> can<00:02:59.379> tell<00:02:59.680> you<00:03:00.010> know<00:03:00.099> what<00:03:00.280> what

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519

sounds are going through someone I strum

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.780 
sounds are going through someone I strum
the<00:03:01.900> guitar<00:03:01.959> as<00:03:02.349> you<00:03:02.500> can<00:03:02.650> see<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.010> meter<00:03:03.250> then

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
the guitar as you can see the meter then

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.880 
the guitar as you can see the meter then
rises<00:03:04.450> up<00:03:04.599> and<00:03:04.780> then<00:03:04.930> goes<00:03:05.319> down<00:03:05.349> when<00:03:05.680> all<00:03:05.769> the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
rises up and then goes down when all the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.309 
rises up and then goes down when all the
sound<00:03:06.099> is<00:03:06.280> gone<00:03:06.459> so<00:03:07.090> basically<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.840> can<00:03:08.049> change

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
sound is gone so basically I can change

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.440 
sound is gone so basically I can change
this<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.069> it<00:03:09.160> can<00:03:09.250> also<00:03:09.370> record<00:03:09.849> this<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.329> is

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
this and it can also record this this is

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.180 
this and it can also record this this is
this<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.170> key<00:03:11.319> part<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.650> can<00:03:11.799> make<00:03:11.950> loops

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
this is the key part I can make loops

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.069 
this is the key part I can make loops
and<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.790> can<00:03:12.970> record<00:03:13.120> little<00:03:13.629> bits<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.019> pieces

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
and I can record little bits and pieces

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.670 
and I can record little bits and pieces
songs<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:15.040> stuff<00:03:15.310> like<00:03:15.489> that<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:17.079> maybe

like for instance I have the hoe jib
style<00:03:23.829> setup<00:03:24.459> right<00:03:24.760> now<00:03:24.910> but<00:03:25.359> I<00:03:25.420> can<00:03:25.599> go

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
style setup right now but I can go

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.940 
style setup right now but I can go
through<00:03:25.930> they<00:03:26.049> get<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.319> whole<00:03:26.560> bunch<00:03:26.769> of

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
different ones like for instance funny

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.630 
different ones like for instance funny
spaces<00:03:29.379> we'll<00:03:29.560> just<00:03:29.739> choose<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.250> one<00:03:30.430> and

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
spaces we'll just choose that one and

then we'll go back over here and we'll

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.740 
then we'll go back over here and we'll
see<00:03:33.430> what<00:03:33.549> we<00:03:33.640> got<00:03:33.760> we<00:03:33.849> got<00:03:33.879> a<00:03:34.000> keyboard<00:03:34.390> drums

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
see what we got we got a keyboard drums

that up just a little bit the looper

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.319 
that up just a little bit the looper
basically<00:03:45.430> what<00:03:45.579> happens<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.090> want<00:03:46.239> to

basically what happens you want to
create<00:03:46.599> a<00:03:46.660> loop<00:03:46.900> all<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.200> have<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.380> do<00:03:47.530> let's

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
create a loop all you have to do let's

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.440 
create a loop all you have to do let's
go<00:03:48.130> over<00:03:48.280> to<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.430> looper<00:03:48.669> area<00:03:48.940> hit<00:03:49.329> the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
go over to the looper area hit the

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.670 
go over to the looper area hit the
record<00:03:49.569> button<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:51.870> then<00:03:52.870> hit<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.200> loop<00:03:53.410> and

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
record button and then hit the loop and

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.199 
record button and then hit the loop and
then<00:03:54.220> all<00:03:54.340> of<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.459> sudden<00:03:54.489> your<00:03:54.790> drums<00:03:55.060> are

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
then all of a sudden your drums are

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.819 
then all of a sudden your drums are
going<00:03:55.480> like<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:56.139> you<00:03:56.470> got<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.620> little

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
going like that and you got a little

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.830 
going like that and you got a little
back<00:03:56.950> beat<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:57.819> can<00:03:57.880> strum<00:03:58.299> your<00:03:58.329> guitars

so<00:03:59.260> on<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.620> so<00:03:59.919> forth<00:04:00.310> so<00:04:00.669> backstage<00:04:01.660> now<00:04:02.019> this

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
so on and so forth so backstage now this

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.289 
so on and so forth so backstage now this
is<00:04:02.500> an<00:04:02.590> interesting<00:04:02.709> part<00:04:03.370> with<00:04:03.790> backstage

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
is an interesting part with backstage

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.059 
is an interesting part with backstage
you<00:04:04.480> can<00:04:04.630> actually<00:04:04.780> build<00:04:05.169> bits<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.769> pieces

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
you can actually build bits and pieces

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.610 
you can actually build bits and pieces
so<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:06.819> can<00:04:07.209> have<00:04:07.510> different<00:04:07.959> loops<00:04:08.410> and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
so you can have different loops and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.830 
so you can have different loops and
different<00:04:08.980> recordings<00:04:09.790> in<00:04:09.940> there<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.480> put<00:04:10.720> it

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
different recordings in there you put it

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.809 
different recordings in there you put it
all<00:04:10.959> together<00:04:11.109> so<00:04:11.410> you<00:04:11.620> can<00:04:11.950> make<00:04:12.190> yourself<00:04:12.340> a

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
all together so you can make yourself a

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.360 
all together so you can make yourself a
nice<00:04:13.269> little<00:04:13.510> mixtape<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:15.010> sounds<00:04:15.340> that

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370
