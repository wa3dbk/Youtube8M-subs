00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
I'm going to do I'm going to start with

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.380 
I'm going to do I'm going to start with
the<00:01:25.570> blue<00:01:25.720> lines<00:01:26.490> try<00:01:27.490> not<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.760> drip<00:01:28.090> it<00:01:28.270> and

the blue lines try not to drip it and

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.680 
the blue lines try not to drip it and
make<00:01:28.480> a<00:01:28.510> giant<00:01:28.840> mess

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.420 

and<00:01:36.500> then<00:01:38.410> when<00:01:39.410> you<00:01:39.530> go<00:01:39.650> back<00:01:39.830> in<00:01:39.890> with<00:01:40.100> the

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
and then when you go back in with the

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.320 
and then when you go back in with the
red<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.880> wind<00:01:41.120> up<00:01:42.160> and<00:01:43.160> I'm<00:01:43.850> going<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.060> put<00:01:44.210> the

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
red the wind up and I'm going to put the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.530 
red the wind up and I'm going to put the
red<00:01:44.510> polish<00:01:45.610> see<00:01:46.610> how<00:01:46.730> it's<00:01:46.910> bleeding<00:01:47.390> already

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
red polish see how it's bleeding already

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.460 
red polish see how it's bleeding already
so<00:01:47.960> that's<00:01:48.260> why<00:01:48.440> it's<00:01:48.470> good<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:49.010> have<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:50.470> the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
so that's why it's good to have the the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.260 
so that's why it's good to have the the
blue<00:01:51.620> polish<00:01:51.980> down<00:01:52.190> already<00:01:52.520> then<00:01:53.120> we'll

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
blue polish down already then we'll

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.490 
blue polish down already then we'll
scrape<00:01:53.480> that<00:01:53.660> off<00:01:55.120> pick<00:01:56.120> it<00:01:56.270> up<00:01:56.500> relatively

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
scrape that off pick it up relatively

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.080 
scrape that off pick it up relatively
quickly<00:01:57.890> because<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.400> blue<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.730> already

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
quickly because the blue is already

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.140 
quickly because the blue is already
starting<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.780> you<00:02:00.380> know<00:02:00.410> dry<00:02:00.980> somewhat<00:02:01.580> and

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
starting to you know dry somewhat and

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.860 
starting to you know dry somewhat and
then<00:02:02.300> when<00:02:02.480> stamp<00:02:02.810> this<00:02:02.990> down<00:02:03.260> at<00:02:03.920> an<00:02:04.070> angle

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
then when stamp this down at an angle

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.370 
then when stamp this down at an angle
see<00:02:05.870> that<00:02:06.050> there<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:08.660> it's<00:02:08.810> got<00:02:08.990> sort<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.290> a

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
see that there so it's got sort of a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.780 
see that there so it's got sort of a
Southwestern<00:02:10.070> sort<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.490> thing<00:02:10.850> going<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.390> and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
Southwestern sort of thing going on and

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.190

basically<00:02:45.860> put<00:02:46.099> some<00:02:46.310> dots<00:02:46.900> following<00:02:47.900> the

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
basically put some dots following the

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.110

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
blue lines I'm going to do that on both

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
blue lines I'm going to do that on both
sides<00:02:50.599> keep<00:02:51.020> it<00:02:51.140> even<00:02:52.720> because<00:02:53.720> it's<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.989> lot

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
sides keep it even because it's a lot

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.320 
sides keep it even because it's a lot
how<00:02:54.440> these<00:02:54.739> southwestern<00:02:55.520> designs<00:02:55.849> tend<00:02:56.209> to

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
how these southwestern designs tend to

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.380 
how these southwestern designs tend to
be<00:02:56.450> everything<00:02:56.720> set<00:02:57.110> tends<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.620> be<00:02:57.770> pretty

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
be everything set tends to be pretty

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.190 
be everything set tends to be pretty
uniform<00:02:59.390> see<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.260> there<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.780> then<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:02.959> might

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
uniform see that there and then I might

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.259 
uniform see that there and then I might
even<00:03:03.349> just<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.860> bring<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.130> all<00:03:04.250> together<00:03:04.430> put

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
even just to bring it all together put

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.420 
even just to bring it all together put
little<00:03:05.810> dots<00:03:05.900> underneath<00:03:06.650> see<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.310> little

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
little dots underneath see the little

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.130 
little dots underneath see the little
curve<00:03:07.790> there<00:03:08.209> i'm<00:03:08.450> going<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.720> put<00:03:08.870> little<00:03:09.050> dots

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
curve there i'm going to put little dots

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.820 
curve there i'm going to put little dots
just<00:03:09.590> right<00:03:09.950> underneath<00:03:10.280> those<00:03:11.560> right<00:03:12.560> there

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
just right underneath those right there

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.059 
just right underneath those right there
and<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.819> little<00:03:14.590> crooks<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.900> curves<00:03:18.069> that

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
and the little crooks of the curves that

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.830 
and the little crooks of the curves that
sort<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.400> brings<00:03:19.580> that's<00:03:19.970> all<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.600> pieces

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
sort of brings that's all the pieces

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.400 
sort of brings that's all the pieces
together<00:03:22.360> subtle<00:03:23.360> little<00:03:23.480> detail<00:03:24.019> but<00:03:24.290> it

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
together subtle little detail but it

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.090 
together subtle little detail but it
really<00:03:24.620> adds<00:03:24.860> something<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:26.019> ok<00:03:27.019> so<00:03:27.860> I'm

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
really adds something to it ok so I'm

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.580 
really adds something to it ok so I'm
going<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.340> go<00:03:28.489> ahead<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:28.970> let<00:03:29.750> this<00:03:29.930> glitter

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
going to go ahead and let this glitter

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.979 
going to go ahead and let this glitter
dry<00:03:30.890> really<00:03:31.160> quickly<00:03:31.340> add<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:31.970> top<00:03:32.599> coat<00:03:32.660> and

with top coat on it everything is all
sealed<00:03:39.140> in<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:40.599> if<00:03:41.599> you<00:03:41.989> were<00:03:42.170> doing<00:03:42.410> this<00:03:42.500> on

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
sealed in and if you were doing this on

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.100 
sealed in and if you were doing this on
all<00:03:43.010> of<00:03:43.610> your<00:03:43.760> nails<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:44.360> could<00:03:44.569> you<00:03:44.959> could

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
all of your nails you could you could

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.470 
all of your nails you could you could
change<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.590> angle<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.310> use<00:03:46.580> it<00:03:46.760> on<00:03:46.880> you

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
change the angle that you use it on you

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.120 
change the angle that you use it on you
could<00:03:47.660> probably<00:03:47.840> put<00:03:48.290> this<00:03:48.380> design<00:03:48.560> also<00:03:48.859> on

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
could probably put this design also on

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.160 
could probably put this design also on
the<00:03:49.280> side<00:03:49.519> let's<00:03:49.940> I<00:03:50.060> just<00:03:50.269> smudged<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.780> that's
