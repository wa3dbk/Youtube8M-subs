this<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.869> valve<00:00:22.260> body<00:00:22.500> valve<00:00:23.160> body<00:00:23.400> as<00:00:24.029> you

this is the valve body valve body as you

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.970 
this is the valve body valve body as you
can<00:00:24.330> see<00:00:24.510> from<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.840> explode<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.350> view<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:25.710> is

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
can see from the explode of view here is

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.730

a multi-tiered valve body they have some

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.380 
a multi-tiered valve body they have some
issues<00:00:29.010> with<00:00:29.189> overpressure<00:00:29.820> conditions

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
issues with overpressure conditions

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.540 
issues with overpressure conditions
those<00:00:30.869> overpressure<00:00:31.439> conditions<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.219> create

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
those overpressure conditions can create

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.700 
those overpressure conditions can create
damage<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> forward

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710

clutch<00:00:35.010> drum<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.489> see<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.090> snap

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
clutch drum you can see that the snap

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.459 
clutch drum you can see that the snap
ring<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.980> basically<00:00:37.980> made<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.489> drum<00:00:38.969> itself

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
ring is basically made the drum itself

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.040 
ring is basically made the drum itself
the<00:00:40.469> pressure<00:00:40.800> has<00:00:41.129> made<00:00:41.370> drum<00:00:41.879> fail<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the pressure has made drum fail so the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.020 
the pressure has made drum fail so the
snap<00:00:43.290> ring<00:00:43.500> land<00:00:43.800> that's<00:00:44.040> machined<00:00:44.550> into<00:00:44.760> this

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030

sheet metal drum basically blows off the
end<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> drum<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:50.010> lose<00:00:50.190> forward

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
end of the drum and you lose forward

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.779 
end of the drum and you lose forward
apply<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.899> way<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> remedy<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.219> obviously

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
apply so way to remedy that obviously

100,000<00:01:43.170> miles<00:01:43.320> or<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.770> particular

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
100,000 miles or so this particular

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.080 
100,000 miles or so this particular

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
old so not only do you need to replace

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.770 
old so not only do you need to replace
drum<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.329> address<00:01:51.570> the

drum but you have to address the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.260 
drum but you have to address the
pressure<00:01:51.960> rise<00:01:52.290> issues<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.430> causes<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.149> them

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
pressure rise issues that causes on them

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.819 
pressure rise issues that causes on them
to<00:01:54.329> fail<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> first<00:01:54.810> place<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.350> once<00:01:55.710> you

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
to fail in the first place and once you

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.740 
to fail in the first place and once you
do<00:01:55.979> those<00:01:56.189> things<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.240> have<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.450> pretty

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
do those things you have a pretty

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.860 
do those things you have a pretty
