00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
I've just sent this to the server five

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.270 
I've just sent this to the server five
times<00:04:11.020> so<00:04:11.230> other<00:04:11.410> people<00:04:11.500> will<00:04:11.980> see<00:04:12.190> the

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
message five times and you could do that

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.699 
message five times and you could do that
for<00:04:14.680> hundreds<00:04:15.310> of<00:04:15.370> messages<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:17.260> that's<00:04:17.620> just
