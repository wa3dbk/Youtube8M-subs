in<00:00:01.530> this<00:00:01.889> video<00:00:02.129> we're<00:00:02.459> gonna<00:00:02.669> be<00:00:02.820> talking

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
in this video we're gonna be talking

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.230 
in this video we're gonna be talking
about<00:00:03.479> the<00:00:03.870> quarry<00:00:04.140> cycle<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:05.430> quarry<00:00:05.730> cycle

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
about the quarry cycle the quarry cycle

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.320 
about the quarry cycle the quarry cycle
is<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.480> cycle<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:07.470> involves<00:00:08.430> muscles<00:00:09.060> and

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
is a cycle that involves muscles and

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.339 
is a cycle that involves muscles and
liver<00:00:10.460> now<00:00:11.460> what<00:00:11.790> happens<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.480> glucose

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
liver now what happens is that glucose

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.899 
liver now what happens is that glucose
in<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.220> muscles<00:00:15.589> when<00:00:16.589> the<00:00:17.220> muscles<00:00:17.669> start

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:17.909 
in the muscles when the muscles start

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:22.189 
in the muscles when the muscles start
contracting<00:00:18.689> in<00:00:18.960> anaerobic<00:00:20.900> conditions<00:00:21.900> in

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
contracting in anaerobic conditions in

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.640 
contracting in anaerobic conditions in
which<00:00:23.099> they<00:00:23.429> don't<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.730> enough<00:00:24.359> oxygen<00:00:24.689> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
which they don't have enough oxygen to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.759 
which they don't have enough oxygen to
break<00:00:26.399> down<00:00:26.609> glucose<00:00:27.239> into<00:00:27.810> co2<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:29.689> h2o<00:00:30.769> so

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
break down glucose into co2 and h2o so

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.860 
break down glucose into co2 and h2o so
into<00:00:32.269> carbon<00:00:33.269> dioxide<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.230> water<00:00:35.030> they<00:00:36.030> break

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
into carbon dioxide and water they break

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.970 
into carbon dioxide and water they break
down<00:00:37.109> glucose<00:00:37.800> only<00:00:38.309> throughout<00:00:38.840> glycolysis

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
down glucose only throughout glycolysis

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.419 
down glucose only throughout glycolysis
into<00:00:40.980> pyruvate<00:00:41.929> so<00:00:42.929> one<00:00:43.140> molecule<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.859> glucose

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:44.429 
into pyruvate so one molecule of glucose

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:49.669 
into pyruvate so one molecule of glucose
brings<00:00:45.109> up<00:00:46.109> to<00:00:46.949> two<00:00:47.750> molecules<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.899> pyruvate

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
brings up to two molecules of pyruvate

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.130 
brings up to two molecules of pyruvate
and<00:00:49.969> this<00:00:50.969> as<00:00:51.179> you<00:00:51.359> can<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.570> brings<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.769> a<00:00:53.399> net

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
and this as you can see brings to a net

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.299 
and this as you can see brings to a net
gain<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.410> two<00:00:56.070> molecules<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.940> ATP<00:00:58.070> which<00:00:59.070> is

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
gain of two molecules of ATP which is

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.419 
gain of two molecules of ATP which is
pretty<00:00:59.640> inefficient<00:01:00.679> considering<00:01:01.679> that<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
pretty inefficient considering that the

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.360 
pretty inefficient considering that the
normal<00:01:02.879> breakdown<00:01:03.749> of<00:01:03.989> glucose<00:01:04.620> brings<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
normal breakdown of glucose brings to

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.400 
normal breakdown of glucose brings to
about<00:01:06.320> 33<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.090> molecules<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.240> ATP<00:01:09.450> when

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
about 33 or so molecules of ATP when

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.360 
about 33 or so molecules of ATP when
it's<00:01:11.030> broken<00:01:12.030> down<00:01:12.180> into<00:01:12.590> six<00:01:13.590> molecules<00:01:13.890> of

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
it's broken down into six molecules of

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.070 
it's broken down into six molecules of
co2<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.480> into<00:01:16.140> water<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> what<00:01:18.420> happens<00:01:18.840> is

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
co2 and into water so what happens is

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.410 
co2 and into water so what happens is
that<00:01:19.580> pyruvate<00:01:21.110> inside<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.350> muscles<00:01:22.830> is

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
that pyruvate inside the muscles is

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.410 
that pyruvate inside the muscles is
transformed<00:01:24.420> into<00:01:25.460> lactate<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:26.730> you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.210> see

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
transformed into lactate as you can see

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.360 
transformed into lactate as you can see
in<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.920> picture<00:01:29.510> by<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.570> lactate

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
in this picture by the lactate

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.580 
in this picture by the lactate
dehydrogenase<00:01:32.660> this<00:01:33.660> enzyme<00:01:34.110> by<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> way

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
dehydrogenase this enzyme by the way

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.350 
dehydrogenase this enzyme by the way
takes<00:01:34.920> its<00:01:35.160> name<00:01:35.250> by<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.760> reverse<00:01:36.920> reaction

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
takes its name by the reverse reaction

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.400 
takes its name by the reverse reaction
but<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:40.590> work<00:01:40.800> both<00:01:41.340> ways<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:43.260> it

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
but it can work both ways so what it

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.670 
but it can work both ways so what it
does<00:01:43.650> in<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.160> case<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.730> is<00:01:44.870> an<00:01:45.870> oxidant

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
does in this case it is an oxidant

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.370 
does in this case it is an oxidant
oxidase<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.800> ADH<00:01:49.800> and<00:01:50.210> H+<00:01:51.210> into<00:01:51.810> nad<00:01:52.800> plus<00:01:53.220> and

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
oxidase and ADH and H+ into nad plus and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.280 
oxidase and ADH and H+ into nad plus and
transforms<00:01:55.380> pyruvate<00:01:56.100> into<00:01:56.310> lactate<00:01:57.290> with

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
transforms pyruvate into lactate with

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.210 
transforms pyruvate into lactate with
two<00:01:58.710> more<00:01:58.980> hydrogen's<00:01:59.360> bond<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.220> second

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
two more hydrogen's bond to the second

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.370 
two more hydrogen's bond to the second
carbon<00:02:03.180> number<00:02:03.750> two<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.790> lactate<00:02:06.390> goes<00:02:06.780> into

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
carbon number two so lactate goes into

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.700 
carbon number two so lactate goes into
the<00:02:07.680> bloodstream<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.929> reaches<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.960> liver<00:02:10.380> in

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
the bloodstream and reaches the liver in

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.910 
the bloodstream and reaches the liver in
which<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.720> transformed<00:02:12.720> back<00:02:13.140> into

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
which it's transformed back into

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.690 
which it's transformed back into
pyruvate<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.440> throughout<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.740> reverse

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
pyruvate and throughout the reverse

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.780 
pyruvate and throughout the reverse
process<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.599> glycolysis<00:02:19.290> which<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.489> called

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
process of glycolysis which is called

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.290 
process of glycolysis which is called
gluconeogenesis<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.520> process<00:02:24.090> is

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
gluconeogenesis just this process is

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.040 
gluconeogenesis just this process is
much<00:02:24.959> more<00:02:25.130> expensive<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.790> terms<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.450> ATP

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
much more expensive in terms of ATP

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.800 
much more expensive in terms of ATP
molecules<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.010> fact<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.550> takes<00:02:29.819> six<00:02:30.480> molecules

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
molecules in fact it takes six molecules

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.100 
molecules in fact it takes six molecules
of<00:02:31.290> ATP<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.430> form<00:02:33.030> glucose

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
of ATP to form glucose

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.880 
of ATP to form glucose
unlike<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:36.030> amount<00:02:36.239> of<00:02:36.360> ATP<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:37.380> process

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
unlike the amount of ATP this process

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.050 
unlike the amount of ATP this process
produced<00:02:38.640> which<00:02:39.569> was<00:02:39.780> up<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.410> ATP<00:02:41.220> molecules

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
produced which was up to ATP molecules

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.340 
produced which was up to ATP molecules
so<00:02:43.019> as<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.590> see<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:44.519> six<00:02:44.880> ATP<00:02:45.750> molecules

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
so as you can see the six ATP molecules

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.199 
so as you can see the six ATP molecules
are<00:02:47.420> used<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:49.050> at<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.250> expense<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.970> liver

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
are used but at the expense of the liver

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.009 
are used but at the expense of the liver
so<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.720> liver<00:02:51.989> gives<00:02:52.950> its<00:02:53.220> energy<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:54.019> form

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
so the liver gives its energy to form

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.449 
so the liver gives its energy to form
glucose<00:02:55.620> which<00:02:56.130> is<00:02:56.160> then<00:02:56.610> freed<00:02:57.030> again<00:02:57.830> in<00:02:58.830> the

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
glucose which is then freed again in the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.520 
glucose which is then freed again in the
bloodstream<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.299> go<00:03:00.480> back<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.080> muscles

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
bloodstream to go back to the muscles

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.940 
bloodstream to go back to the muscles
which<00:03:02.310> can<00:03:02.340> use<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.940> for<00:03:03.209> another<00:03:03.950> glycolytic

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
which can use it for another glycolytic

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.590 
which can use it for another glycolytic
cycle<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.920> happens<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:08.910> convenient

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
cycle so this happens this is convenient

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.229 
cycle so this happens this is convenient
for<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.170> body<00:03:10.380> because<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.280> liver<00:03:11.549> has<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.910> lot

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
for the body because the liver has a lot

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.550 
for the body because the liver has a lot
of<00:03:12.450> energy<00:03:13.019> stored<00:03:13.739> within<00:03:14.310> itself<00:03:15.060> as<00:03:15.560> lipids

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
of energy stored within itself as lipids

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.970 
of energy stored within itself as lipids
or<00:03:17.540> glucose<00:03:18.540> under<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.260> form<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.709> glycogen

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
or glucose under the form of glycogen

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.180 
or glucose under the form of glycogen
usually<00:03:20.940> which<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.810> macro<00:03:22.290> molecule<00:03:22.859> of

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
usually which is a macro molecule of

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.630 
usually which is a macro molecule of
glucose<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.709> useful<00:03:26.190> when<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.459> need

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
glucose so this is useful when you need

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.460 
glucose so this is useful when you need
a<00:03:26.850> lot<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.180> energy<00:03:27.420> but<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:27.959> don't<00:03:28.290> have

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
a lot of energy but you don't have

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.210 
a lot of energy but you don't have
enough<00:03:28.920> oxygen<00:03:29.280> for<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.180> normal<00:03:31.220> breaking

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
enough oxygen for the normal breaking

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.780 
enough oxygen for the normal breaking
down<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.670> glucose<00:03:33.120> in<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:34.500> muscles<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.280> as

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
down of glucose in the muscles and as

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.780 
down of glucose in the muscles and as
you<00:03:35.940> can<00:03:36.060> see<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.870> lactate<00:03:37.859> is<00:03:38.070> transformed

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
you can see the lactate is transformed

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.349 
you can see the lactate is transformed
into<00:03:38.970> pyruvate<00:03:39.810> by<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.620> same<00:03:40.980> enzyme<00:03:41.940> the

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
into pyruvate by the same enzyme the

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.180 
into pyruvate by the same enzyme the
lactate<00:03:43.109> dehydrogenase<00:03:43.980> which<00:03:44.670> in<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:45.540> case

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
lactate dehydrogenase which in this case

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:54.670 
lactate dehydrogenase which in this case
reduces<00:03:47.190> nad<00:03:48.090> plus<00:03:48.980> into<00:03:49.980> NADH<00:03:50.760> +<00:03:51.739> H+<00:03:53.150> and

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
reduces nad plus into NADH + H+ and

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.860 
reduces nad plus into NADH + H+ and
transforms<00:03:55.680> lactate<00:03:56.310> into<00:03:56.790> pyruvate<00:03:57.540> which

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
transforms lactate into pyruvate which

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.300 
transforms lactate into pyruvate which
is<00:03:58.049> then<00:03:58.640> transformed<00:03:59.640> into<00:03:59.850> glucose<00:04:00.510> in<00:04:00.690> the

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
is then transformed into glucose in the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.080 
is then transformed into glucose in the
gluconeogenesis<00:04:03.829> so<00:04:04.829> here<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.370> can<00:04:05.609> see<00:04:05.850> the

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
gluconeogenesis so here you can see the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.220 
gluconeogenesis so here you can see the
glycolysis<00:04:07.250> there<00:04:08.250> are<00:04:08.930> different<00:04:09.930> steps

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
glycolysis there are different steps

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.860 
glycolysis there are different steps
most<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.859> which<00:04:11.040> are<00:04:11.220> reversible<00:04:12.030> apart<00:04:12.630> all

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
most of which are reversible apart all

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.340 
most of which are reversible apart all
of<00:04:13.109> them<00:04:13.290> apart<00:04:13.709> from<00:04:13.980> three<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:15.359> first<00:04:15.720> third

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
of them apart from three the first third

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.830 
of them apart from three the first third
and<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:17.639> last<00:04:17.910> steps<00:04:18.539> which<00:04:19.200> are<00:04:19.440> going<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.889> be

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
and the last steps which are going to be

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.550 
and the last steps which are going to be
catalyzed<00:04:21.840> by<00:04:22.140> different<00:04:22.680> enzymes<00:04:23.659> when<00:04:24.659> the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
catalyzed by different enzymes when the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.600 
catalyzed by different enzymes when the
process<00:04:26.159> is<00:04:26.400> being

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
process is being

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.020 
process is being
done<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.599> reverse<00:04:28.960> direction<00:04:29.699> so<00:04:30.699> in<00:04:30.849> the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
done in the reverse direction so in the

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.670 
done in the reverse direction so in the
gluconeogenesis<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:34.780> can<00:04:34.990> see<00:04:35.199> well<00:04:35.500> the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
gluconeogenesis and you can see well the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.559 
gluconeogenesis and you can see well the
the<00:04:36.069> arrows<00:04:36.610> pointing<00:04:37.120> both<00:04:37.360> ways<00:04:37.629> indicate

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
the arrows pointing both ways indicate

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.480 
the arrows pointing both ways indicate
enzymes<00:04:40.569> which<00:04:40.810> can<00:04:41.020> catalyze<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:42.460> reaction

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
enzymes which can catalyze the reaction

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.950 
enzymes which can catalyze the reaction
in<00:04:43.330> both<00:04:43.719> ways<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:45.129> reason<00:04:45.580> why<00:04:45.789> pyruvate<00:04:46.780> is

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
in both ways the reason why pyruvate is

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.189 
in both ways the reason why pyruvate is
transformed<00:04:47.830> into<00:04:48.129> lactate<00:04:48.909> is<00:04:49.199> to
