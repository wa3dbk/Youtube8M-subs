00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
hit by a huge tsunami but Tokyo is a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.220 
hit by a huge tsunami but Tokyo is a
vast<00:00:53.750> agglomeration<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:55.129> of<00:00:56.480> urban<00:00:57.480> scape<00:00:58.050> and

vast agglomeration of of urban scape and
it<00:00:58.980> certainly<00:00:59.190> stretches<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:00.030> out

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it certainly stretches all the way out

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.439 
it certainly stretches all the way out
