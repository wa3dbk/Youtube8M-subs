sets<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.010> these<00:00:29.130> blocks<00:00:29.400> out<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.609> one<00:00:29.939> tree

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
sets of these blocks out of one tree

sets of these blocks out of one tree
that's<00:00:30.750> right<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.320> for<00:00:31.529> every<00:00:31.800> tree<00:00:32.070> they

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
that's right and so for every tree they

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.370 
that's right and so for every tree they
use<00:00:32.460> they<00:00:32.910> plant<00:00:33.270> 100<00:00:33.870> more<00:00:35.960> which<00:00:36.960> stands<00:00:37.260> for
