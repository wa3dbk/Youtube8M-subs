00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.350
 let's see quickly how 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.570
 create a pleasant multi-color text with its low-paved reflection 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.009
 and with a shade too 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.909
 scooter on transparency 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:22.989
 let's start by preparing a worksheet with a new mac file 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.039
 tax reimposed dimensions that interest us 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.819
 I'm coming now 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.489
 add post to 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.000
 15 get lost 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.510
 but everyone will do with 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.030
 fine dimensions serve 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.720
 I confirm in this case 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.500
 the start in white while dreams movie black background 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.090
 then with ass in the foreground nino bucket fill 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.800
 they get 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.530
 my black background 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.930
 I go to tick the text selection so if it is not present which 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.590
 normally we find this black 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.059
 keeping the tax rules in place, other options 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.940
 selection text 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.140
 I choose a size of 36 to see 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.159
 oook 30 to see if the pc can naturally be imposed 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.700
 in the summons in the text 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.570
 hey starting from the center 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.570
 he started to write 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.220
 maybe a little bit too small if I'm not comfortable with it 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.750
 increase the size 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.220
 I confirm this symbol 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760
 now I have nothing but a section on the less 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.990
 if it's not enough, then 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.259
 tick any selection tool e 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.259
 with the paiella freccina 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.259
 we can already move 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.099
 a wide selection of the position you are interested in 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.209
 I'm going to look for a nuance 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.449
 in this window a double click 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.179
 I can see 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:33.049
 bari 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.159
 options are 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.409
 possibility 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.719
 I choose this one 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.399
 creates a variety of colors 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.399
 confirm 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.819
 graph in horizontal then keeping clicked part of left and right 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.539
 charm 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.109
 and I will leave 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.499
 here is the multi-color text 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:58.549
 of departure 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.279
 bear leaving 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.419
 keeping the selection 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.949
 I copy it 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.949
 with modification pair or contucci 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.239
 bond 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.219
 edit paste 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.929
 control pink 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:17.150
 often a second level has been created 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.150
 name of love 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.799
 in the second level e 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.660
 when to move with known world 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.019
 move 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.759
 we see that 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.749
 ade an identical couple 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:34.279
 overlying 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:36.039
 we leave 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.039
 wind in the same position 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.679
 modification list 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:44.669
 TRANSFORMERS 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.669
 reflect vertically 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.179
 we get this reflection downwards then with the tool move 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.039
 let's not lower this to create our specularity 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.739
 and let's take action 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.709
 common of relative touch how this is done to make it - obvious 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:14.009
 to create this 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:15.499
 effect of 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.840
 as a reflection as if it were on a shiny black surface 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.460
 freddure attributes this station 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.120
 below that goes 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.340
 slightly blurred 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.340
 we take our ass niro foreground 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.210
 and with the selection 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.210
 let's look at black transparent ah 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.499
 we confirm 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:45.749
 which we try to 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:48.909
 extend this nuance 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.819
 to reduce the effect 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:51.919
 here 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.379
 maybe with 2 3 steps 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.849
 we are keeping this 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.849
 this trend towards transparency 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.150
 the text does not fit the window well 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.599
 let's take a cutter 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.439
 we adapt naturally 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.439
 all our text 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:19.909
 finished the private work 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.509
 We will monitor 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:24.600
 and we're fine
