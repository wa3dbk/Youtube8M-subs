let<00:00:53.280> me<00:00:53.340> see<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:54.149> exactly<00:00:54.270> what<00:00:55.050> he

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
let me see if I can do exactly what he

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.490 
let me see if I can do exactly what he
did<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.699> know<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.600> far<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:57.930> don't<00:00:58.109> know

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.799 
did but you know so far we don't know
honestly<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.640> easiest<00:00:59.969> probably<00:01:00.300> way<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
honestly the easiest probably way is to

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.349 
honestly the easiest probably way is to
just<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> Olympia<00:01:02.219> from<00:01:02.820> buried<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
let's see Hades

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.730 
let's see Hades
now<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.960> I<00:01:43.990> didn't<00:01:44.350> think<00:01:44.439> it<00:01:44.590> would<00:01:44.649> work

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
now I know I didn't think it would work

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.389 
now I know I didn't think it would work
because<00:01:45.130> if<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.340> look<00:01:45.490> at<00:01:45.579> the<00:01:45.670> fire<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:48.340> just

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
because if you look at the fire it just

00:01:48.399 --> 00:02:04.170 
because if you look at the fire it just
seems<00:01:48.729> like<00:01:48.790> an<00:01:48.970> after<00:01:49.479> effect<00:01:49.720> on

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.130 

alright<00:02:05.180> guys<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:05.480> it's<00:02:05.600> safe<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.780> say<00:02:06.110> that

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
alright guys so it's safe to say that

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.230 
alright guys so it's safe to say that
it's<00:02:06.500> kind<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:06.890> been<00:02:07.100> debunked<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.760> went<00:02:08.090> back

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
it's kind of been debunked I went back

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.790 
it's kind of been debunked I went back
and<00:02:08.390> turn<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:08.690> power<00:02:08.930> off<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.320> I<00:02:09.410> tried<00:02:09.680> it

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
and turn the power off and I tried it

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.310 
and turn the power off and I tried it
again<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.100> it<00:02:10.190> still<00:02:10.369> didn't<00:02:10.759> work<00:02:11.080> if<00:02:12.080> you

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
again and it still didn't work if you

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.680 
again and it still didn't work if you
notice<00:02:12.680> in<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.890> video<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.520> Dennison<00:02:14.120> creates

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
notice in the video the Dennison creates

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.110 
notice in the video the Dennison creates
a<00:02:14.780> portal<00:02:15.230> over<00:02:15.710> by<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:15.980> side<00:02:16.250> where<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.880> I

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
a portal over by the side where is I

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.030 
a portal over by the side where is I
think<00:02:17.540> couple<00:02:18.020> times<00:02:18.230> in<00:02:18.410> this<00:02:18.470> video<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.890> can

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
think couple times in this video you can

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.440 
think couple times in this video you can
see<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.190> Dennison<00:02:19.670> doesn't<00:02:20.030> run<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.300> that

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
see the Dennison doesn't run to that

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.080 
see the Dennison doesn't run to that
spot<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.800> don't<00:02:21.860> think<00:02:22.070> they<00:02:22.340> have<00:02:22.520> they

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
spot and I don't think they have they

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.700 
spot and I don't think they have they
can<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:23.420> dig<00:02:23.570> anywhere<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.050> think<00:02:24.410> they<00:02:24.530> have

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
can just dig anywhere I think they have

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.340 
can just dig anywhere I think they have
to<00:02:24.800> run<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.070> set<00:02:25.310> points<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.690> if<00:02:26.990> there<00:02:27.140> was<00:02:27.320> a

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
to run to set points so if there was a

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.990 
to run to set points so if there was a
portal<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:27.920> don't<00:02:28.190> think<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:28.490> would<00:02:28.580> go<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.820> the

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
portal I don't think it would go to the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.030 
portal I don't think it would go to the
spot<00:02:29.210> scene<00:02:29.420> in<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.660> video<00:02:29.870> really<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.830> just

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
spot scene in that video really I just

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.700 
spot scene in that video really I just
think<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.280> comes<00:02:31.430> down<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.670> being<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.570> good<00:02:33.290> fake

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
think it comes down to being a good fake

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.060 
think it comes down to being a good fake
I<00:02:34.040> was<00:02:34.970> convinced<00:02:35.390> at<00:02:35.480> first<00:02:35.720> but<00:02:36.020> I<00:02:36.230> think<00:02:36.950> on

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
I was convinced at first but I think on

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.060 
I was convinced at first but I think on
subsequent<00:02:37.459> like<00:02:38.390> on<00:02:38.630> real<00:02:38.900> watches<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.950> know

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
subsequent like on real watches you know

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.070 
subsequent like on real watches you know
someone<00:02:40.430> be<00:02:40.550> able<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.820> point<00:02:41.030> out<00:02:41.240> some<00:02:41.570> flaws

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
someone be able to point out some flaws

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.870 
someone be able to point out some flaws
in<00:02:42.320> it<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.890> know<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.010> tried<00:02:43.280> doing<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.700> but

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
in it you know I tried doing that but

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.150 
in it you know I tried doing that but
you<00:02:44.270> know<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.510> ammo<00:02:44.690> counts<00:02:45.140> right<00:02:45.440> things

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
you know the ammo counts right things

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.600 
you know the ammo counts right things
just<00:02:46.459> look<00:02:46.670> right<00:02:46.850> so<00:02:47.090> far<00:02:47.270> but<00:02:48.250> obviously<00:02:49.250> it

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
just look right so far but obviously it

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.310 
just look right so far but obviously it
just<00:02:49.640> doesn't<00:02:50.090> seem<00:02:50.209> real<00:02:50.450> unless<00:02:50.870> there's<00:02:51.140> of

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
just doesn't seem real unless there's of

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.640 
just doesn't seem real unless there's of
course<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.860> third<00:02:52.459> step<00:02:52.820> or<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.390> step<00:02:54.050> that<00:02:54.170> he

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
course a third step or the step that he

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.150 
course a third step or the step that he
hasn't<00:02:54.800> told<00:02:55.070> us<00:02:55.220> or<00:02:56.000> whatever<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.650> unless<00:02:57.980> he

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
hasn't told us or whatever and unless he

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.980 
hasn't told us or whatever and unless he
like<00:02:58.370> he<00:02:58.520> can<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:59.150> can<00:02:59.300> share<00:02:59.510> clips<00:02:59.720> in<00:02:59.840> black

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
like he can you can share clips in black

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.199 
like he can you can share clips in black
ops<00:03:00.140> 2<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:00.950> he<00:03:01.100> can<00:03:01.250> share<00:03:01.430> that<00:03:01.550> actual<00:03:01.880> proper

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
ops 2 so he can share that actual proper

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.790 
ops 2 so he can share that actual proper
clip<00:03:02.450> instead<00:03:02.630> of<00:03:02.900> get<00:03:03.020> Meis<00:03:03.140> camcorder<00:03:03.709> and

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
clip instead of get Meis camcorder and

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.190 
clip instead of get Meis camcorder and
just<00:03:03.980> recording<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.550> so<00:03:04.959> it's<00:03:05.959> no<00:03:06.170> problem

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
just recording it so it's no problem
