really<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.580> thing<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.910> made<00:02:27.060> me<00:02:27.180> fall<00:02:27.390> in

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
really the thing that made me fall in

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.120 
really the thing that made me fall in
love<00:02:27.510> with<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.870> not<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.260> love<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.710> blade<00:02:28.920> shape

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
love with is not I love the blade shape

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.910 
love with is not I love the blade shape
of<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.510> full<00:02:30.720> flat<00:02:30.990> ground<00:02:31.260> which<00:02:31.770> is

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
of it it is full flat ground which is

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.760 
of it it is full flat ground which is
good<00:02:35.180> now<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.240> blade<00:02:36.780> steel<00:02:37.230> zdp<00:02:38.130> 189<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.770> don't

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
good now the blade steel zdp 189 I don't

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.200 
good now the blade steel zdp 189 I don't
know<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> lot<00:02:41.520> about<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:43.340> what<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.370> read<00:02:44.820> up<00:02:45.000> on

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
know a lot about it what I read up on

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.780 
know a lot about it what I read up on
its<00:02:45.660> supposed<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.470> hold<00:02:47.100> an<00:02:47.250> edge<00:02:47.400> really<00:02:47.430> well

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
its supposed to hold an edge really well

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.320 
its supposed to hold an edge really well
and<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:49.550> guess<00:02:50.550> that's<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.120> most

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
and I guess that's one of the most

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.180 
and I guess that's one of the most
important<00:02:51.750> things<00:02:51.930> about<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.200> blade<00:02:52.470> still<00:02:52.830> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
important things about a blade still the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.040 
important things about a blade still the
next<00:02:53.430> thing<00:02:53.580> would<00:02:53.700> be<00:02:53.910> rust<00:02:54.240> resistance<00:02:54.840> and

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
next thing would be rust resistance and

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.350 
next thing would be rust resistance and
that<00:02:55.500> I'm<00:02:55.800> just<00:02:55.830> not<00:02:56.400> one<00:02:56.700> hundred<00:02:56.760> percent<00:02:56.940> on

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
that I'm just not one hundred percent on

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.390 
that I'm just not one hundred percent on
so<00:02:57.630> if<00:02:57.780> anybody<00:02:58.140> out<00:02:58.230> there<00:02:58.500> knows<00:02:58.770> feel<00:02:59.100> free

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
so if anybody out there knows feel free

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:08.350 
so if anybody out there knows feel free
to<00:02:59.930> leave<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.080> in<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.230> comments

a<00:05:01.190> blade<00:05:01.729> about<00:05:02.150> three<00:05:02.419> and<00:05:02.479> a<00:05:02.570> half<00:05:02.600> inches

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
a blade about three and a half inches

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:12.620 
a blade about three and a half inches
and

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.820 

call<00:05:13.630> that<00:05:13.780> four<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.080> half<00:05:14.110> inches<00:05:14.440> closed

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
call that four and a half inches closed

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.980 
call that four and a half inches closed
which<00:05:15.820> I<00:05:15.940> guess<00:05:15.970> three<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:16.420> a<00:05:16.450> half<00:05:16.480> plus<00:05:16.840> four

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
which I guess three and a half plus four

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.010 
which I guess three and a half plus four
and<00:05:17.080> a<00:05:17.110> half<00:05:17.170> that's<00:05:17.440> going<00:05:17.710> be<00:05:17.830> eight<00:05:17.950> right

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.160 

let's<00:05:23.020> see<00:05:23.910> one<00:05:24.910> thing<00:05:24.940> that<00:05:25.750> I<00:05:25.780> did<00:05:25.900> notice

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
let's see one thing that I did notice

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.050 
let's see one thing that I did notice
about<00:05:26.350> this<00:05:26.620> knife<00:05:26.830> while<00:05:27.100> carrying<00:05:27.490> it<00:05:27.640> is

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.400 

for<00:05:31.060> some<00:05:31.240> people<00:05:31.270> this<00:05:31.630> would<00:05:31.810> probably<00:05:31.930> be<00:05:32.200> a

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
for some people this would probably be a

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.110 
for some people this would probably be a
primary<00:05:33.340> blade<00:05:33.880> because<00:05:34.210> of<00:05:34.450> the<00:05:34.510> size<00:05:34.690> of<00:05:34.960> it

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
primary blade because of the size of it

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.640 
primary blade because of the size of it
for<00:05:37.120> me<00:05:37.360> it's<00:05:37.660> really<00:05:38.050> that<00:05:38.290> middle<00:05:38.620> ground

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
for me it's really that middle ground

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.510 
for me it's really that middle ground
it's<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:40.840> me<00:05:40.960> it's<00:05:41.040> smaller<00:05:42.040> than<00:05:42.160> what<00:05:42.490> a

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
it's to me it's smaller than what a

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.550 
it's to me it's smaller than what a
primary<00:05:42.970> blade<00:05:43.210> would<00:05:43.360> be<00:05:43.480> because<00:05:43.690> as<00:05:44.110> you<00:05:44.350> as

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
primary blade would be because as you as

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.320 
primary blade would be because as you as
most<00:05:45.070> do<00:05:45.190> you<00:05:45.220> know<00:05:45.400> I<00:05:45.580> like<00:05:45.790> hearing<00:05:46.060> the

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
most do you know I like hearing the

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:52.380 
most do you know I like hearing the
military<00:05:47.020> and<00:05:49.950> it's<00:05:50.950> too<00:05:51.430> big<00:05:51.700> to<00:05:51.970> really<00:05:52.210> be<00:05:52.360> a

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
military and it's too big to really be a

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.420 
military and it's too big to really be a
small<00:05:52.930> secondary<00:05:53.470> knife<00:05:53.740> so<00:05:53.950> it's<00:05:54.070> that<00:05:54.220> kind

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
small secondary knife so it's that kind

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.920 
small secondary knife so it's that kind
of<00:05:54.490> in<00:05:54.640> the<00:05:54.670> middle<00:05:54.940> it<00:05:55.360> would<00:05:55.480> be<00:05:55.600> a<00:05:55.630> big

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
of in the middle it would be a big

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.250 
of in the middle it would be a big
secondary<00:05:56.830> life<00:05:57.040> and<00:05:57.450> so<00:05:58.450> what<00:05:58.600> I<00:05:58.630> brought<00:05:58.900> was

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
secondary life and so what I brought was

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.050 
secondary life and so what I brought was
a<00:05:59.290> couple<00:06:00.280> of<00:06:00.430> knives<00:06:00.580> for<00:06:00.850> comparison's<00:06:01.390> sake

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
a couple of knives for comparison's sake

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:10.719 
a couple of knives for comparison's sake
so<00:06:04.060> here's<00:06:04.330> the<00:06:04.480> delica

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:19.779 

and<00:06:16.419> so<00:06:17.419> yeah<00:06:17.659> that's<00:06:17.839> about<00:06:18.020> an<00:06:18.229> inch<00:06:18.789> the

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
and so yeah that's about an inch the

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.489 
and so yeah that's about an inch the
search<00:06:20.120> to<00:06:20.330> is<00:06:20.419> about<00:06:20.599> an<00:06:20.689> inch<00:06:20.809> longer

00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:21.499 
search to is about an inch longer

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:29.549 
search to is about an inch longer
overall<00:06:22.219> the<00:06:22.430> modelica<00:06:23.919> in<00:06:25.059> the<00:06:26.059> Endura<00:06:28.180> is

00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:29.559 
overall the modelica in the Endura is

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:33.869 
overall the modelica in the Endura is
going<00:06:30.559> to<00:06:30.620> be<00:06:30.740> about<00:06:30.830> the<00:06:31.219> same<00:06:31.729> about<00:06:32.419> an<00:06:32.710> inch

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:33.879 
going to be about the same about an inch

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:37.119 
going to be about the same about an inch
but<00:06:34.879> longer<00:06:35.389> than<00:06:35.839> the<00:06:35.960> stretch<00:06:36.229> so<00:06:36.620> it<00:06:36.949> really

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:37.129 
but longer than the stretch so it really

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.179 
but longer than the stretch so it really
is<00:06:37.309> a<00:06:37.339> good<00:06:37.520> in<00:06:37.819> between<00:06:38.349> if<00:06:39.349> you<00:06:39.830> fill<00:06:40.039> the

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:40.189 
is a good in between if you fill the

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:41.769 
is a good in between if you fill the
ender<00:06:40.400> is<00:06:40.550> just<00:06:40.759> a<00:06:40.819> little<00:06:40.999> too<00:06:41.240> big<00:06:41.479> for<00:06:41.539> your

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:41.779 
ender is just a little too big for your

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.170 
ender is just a little too big for your
liking<00:06:42.339> their<00:06:43.339> stretch<00:06:43.580> will<00:06:43.759> probably<00:06:44.029> fit

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
liking their stretch will probably fit

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.959 
liking their stretch will probably fit
the<00:06:44.270> bill<00:06:44.419> really<00:06:44.749> nice<00:06:44.960> for<00:06:45.229> you<00:06:45.409> I<00:06:45.759> mean<00:06:46.759> the

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:46.969 
the bill really nice for you I mean the

00:06:46.969 --> 00:07:01.559 
the bill really nice for you I mean the
ergonomics<00:06:47.779> editor<00:06:48.110> great

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:01.569 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:03.809 

oh<00:07:01.740> let's<00:07:02.740> see<00:07:02.979> what<00:07:03.249> else<00:07:03.279> did<00:07:03.580> I<00:07:03.639> want<00:07:03.669> to

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:03.819

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:07.139 
oh let's see what else did I want to
talk<00:07:03.999> about<00:07:04.029> on<00:07:04.360> this<00:07:04.449> knife<00:07:06.089> everyone<00:07:07.089> to

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:07.149 
talk about on this knife everyone to

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:13.739 
talk about on this knife everyone to
talk<00:07:07.270> about<00:07:07.479> anything<00:07:07.719> else<00:07:12.029> well<00:07:13.029> i<00:07:13.270> think<00:07:13.479> i

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:13.749 
talk about anything else well i think i

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:15.510 
talk about anything else well i think i
pretty<00:07:14.259> much<00:07:14.289> covered<00:07:14.439> what<00:07:14.979> I<00:07:15.009> wanted<00:07:15.249> to<00:07:15.339> say

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 
pretty much covered what I wanted to say

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.730 
pretty much covered what I wanted to say
about<00:07:15.639> it<00:07:18.240> the<00:07:19.240> only<00:07:19.449> thing<00:07:19.599> is<00:07:19.779> is<00:07:20.110> the<00:07:20.529> blade

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740 
about it the only thing is is the blade

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.169 
about it the only thing is is the blade
might<00:07:21.099> need<00:07:21.399> just<00:07:21.669> a<00:07:21.909> tiny<00:07:22.360> bit<00:07:22.749> of<00:07:23.020> a<00:07:23.080> touch-up

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:24.179 
might need just a tiny bit of a touch-up

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:26.549 
might need just a tiny bit of a touch-up
because<00:07:25.179> I<00:07:25.209> did<00:07:25.449> buy<00:07:25.479> this<00:07:25.659> knife<00:07:26.020> secondhand

00:07:26.549 --> 00:07:26.559 
because I did buy this knife secondhand

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:29.879 
because I did buy this knife secondhand
from<00:07:26.649> sue<00:07:26.919> and<00:07:27.659> it<00:07:28.659> is<00:07:28.959> not<00:07:29.139> here<00:07:29.499> popping

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:29.889 
from sue and it is not here popping

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:31.799 
from sue and it is not here popping
sharp<00:07:30.159> but<00:07:30.339> it<00:07:30.429> will<00:07:30.639> slice<00:07:31.149> the<00:07:31.330> paper<00:07:31.539> very

00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:31.809 
sharp but it will slice the paper very

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:33.329 
sharp but it will slice the paper very
well<00:07:32.080> I've<00:07:32.379> already<00:07:32.559> done<00:07:32.860> that<00:07:32.889> plenty<00:07:33.189> of

00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:33.339 
well I've already done that plenty of

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:37.409 
well I've already done that plenty of
times<00:07:33.990> so<00:07:34.990> it<00:07:35.409> is<00:07:35.649> still<00:07:36.129> a<00:07:36.159> very<00:07:36.459> sharp<00:07:36.789> as<00:07:37.089> is

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:37.419 
times so it is still a very sharp as is

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:43.350 
times so it is still a very sharp as is
blade<00:07:37.779> very<00:07:38.169> very<00:07:38.649> very<00:07:38.860> cool<00:07:41.219> so<00:07:42.219> I<00:07:42.639> guess

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 
blade very very very cool so I guess

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.709 
blade very very very cool so I guess
that's<00:07:43.659> it<00:07:43.839> guys<00:07:45.389> trying<00:07:46.389> to<00:07:46.479> think<00:07:46.629> of

00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:46.719 
that's it guys trying to think of

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:48.540 
that's it guys trying to think of
anything<00:07:46.990> else<00:07:47.110> I<00:07:47.319> I<00:07:47.619> don't<00:07:48.009> want<00:07:48.129> to<00:07:48.189> say<00:07:48.339> here

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:48.550 
anything else I I don't want to say here

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.249 
anything else I I don't want to say here
but<00:07:49.209> I<00:07:49.330> can't<00:07:49.569> so<00:07:49.899> I'm<00:07:50.349> out<00:07:50.529> of<00:07:50.559> here<00:07:50.649> by
