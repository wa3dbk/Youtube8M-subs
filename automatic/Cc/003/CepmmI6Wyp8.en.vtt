but yeah it's pretty effective in my

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.530 
but yeah it's pretty effective in my
opinion<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.430> especially<00:04:03.880> when<00:04:04.270> you<00:04:04.330> do<00:04:04.420> it

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
opinion and especially when you do it

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.440 
opinion and especially when you do it
overnight<00:04:04.780> because<00:04:05.290> there<00:04:05.740> are<00:04:05.860> hardly<00:04:06.220> any

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
overnight because there are hardly any

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.060 
overnight because there are hardly any
players<00:04:07.450> online<00:04:07.720> then<00:04:08.020> so<00:04:08.260> it's<00:04:08.410> easy<00:04:08.620> profit

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070
