going to enjoy doing this little cheat
code<00:01:52.880> right<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.149> actually<00:01:54.299> changed

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
code right here I'm actually changed

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.499 
code right here I'm actually changed
into<00:01:55.500> Franklin<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.219> went<00:01:56.820> ahead<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.270> shown

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
into Franklin I went ahead and shown

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.330 
into Franklin I went ahead and shown
Trevor<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.259> Michaels<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.829> now<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> thought<00:01:59.280> I

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
Trevor and Michaels so now I thought I

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.160 
Trevor and Michaels so now I thought I
would<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.729> Franklin<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.450> couple<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.930> free

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
would be Franklin for a couple of free

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.219 
would be Franklin for a couple of free
falls<00:02:01.439> from<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.740> sky<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:03.420> they're<00:02:03.930> actually

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
falls from the sky and they're actually

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.020 
falls from the sky and they're actually
referring<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.770> as<00:02:04.979> Skyfall<00:02:05.460> like<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.820> said

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
referring to this as Skyfall like I said

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.760 
referring to this as Skyfall like I said
but<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> lot<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.689> people<00:02:07.049> are<00:02:07.170> probably<00:02:07.320> going

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
but a lot of people are probably going

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.889 
but a lot of people are probably going
to<00:02:07.829> be<00:02:07.920> referring<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.390> Superman

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
to be referring to this as the Superman

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.029

cheat<00:02:10.200> code

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
cheat code

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.649 
cheat code
and<00:02:11.220> hopefully<00:02:11.580> everyone<00:02:12.030> has<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.390> good<00:02:12.599> time

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659

and hopefully everyone has a good time
with<00:02:13.019> this<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.830> very<00:02:13.980> fast<00:02:14.550> way<00:02:14.760> to

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
with this it is a very fast way to

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.460 
with this it is a very fast way to
travel<00:02:15.150> around<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.599> map<00:02:15.780> if<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:15.989> don't<00:02:16.290> want

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
travel around the map if you don't want

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
to take a taxi but like I said you do

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.289 
to take a taxi but like I said you do
have<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.560> little<00:02:19.799> risk<00:02:20.040> there<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.610> dying<00:02:20.940> once

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
have the little risk there of dying once

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.229 
have the little risk there of dying once
you<00:02:21.450> land<00:02:21.659> but<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.830> respawn<00:02:23.129> and<00:02:23.580> you'll

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
you land but you can respawn and you'll

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.880 
you land but you can respawn and you'll
be<00:02:24.390> right<00:02:24.690> near<00:02:24.930> where<00:02:24.959> ever<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.470> want<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.709> be

just<00:02:26.640> use<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.970> cheat<00:02:27.180> code<00:02:27.360> like<00:02:27.599> I<00:02:27.750> said<00:02:27.989> and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
just use the cheat code like I said and

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.660 
just use the cheat code like I said and
right<00:02:28.349> here<00:02:28.530> I'm<00:02:28.620> trying<00:02:28.799> to<00:02:29.010> fly<00:02:29.190> into<00:02:29.549> the

right here I'm trying to fly into the
atomic<00:02:29.970> blimp<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:31.290> know<00:02:31.410> I'm<00:02:31.530> trying<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.950> see

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
atomic blimp you know I'm trying to see

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.670 
atomic blimp you know I'm trying to see
if<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.280> can<00:02:32.430> land<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.209> possibly<00:02:34.140> hijack

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
if I can land on it and possibly hijack

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.229 
if I can land on it and possibly hijack
it<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.920> know<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.129> have<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.489> get<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.940> bottom

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
it I know you have to get in the bottom

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.059 
it I know you have to get in the bottom
of<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.569> but<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.200> was<00:02:37.379> thinking<00:02:37.470> since<00:02:37.950> I'm

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
of it but I was thinking since I'm

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.530 
of it but I was thinking since I'm
already<00:02:38.340> using<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.819> cheat<00:02:39.030> code<00:02:39.060> maybe

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
already using a cheat code maybe

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.970 
already using a cheat code maybe
there'll<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:39.840> some<00:02:40.140> kind<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.409> glitch<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.920> I

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
there'll be some kind of glitch and I

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.530 
there'll be some kind of glitch and I
can<00:02:41.129> just<00:02:41.310> be<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:41.879> start<00:02:42.090> driving<00:02:42.299> it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
can just be in it and start driving it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.110 
can just be in it and start driving it
but<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.959> didn't<00:02:43.140> happen<00:02:43.260> there<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.670> one<00:02:44.910> more

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
but it didn't happen there so one more

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.670 
but it didn't happen there so one more
time<00:02:45.150> I'm<00:02:45.510> gonna<00:02:45.599> go<00:02:45.900> straight<00:02:46.230> into<00:02:46.560> this

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
time I'm gonna go straight into this

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.559 
time I'm gonna go straight into this
atomic<00:02:47.040> blimp<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.610> see<00:02:47.760> if<00:02:47.849> I<00:02:47.970> can<00:02:48.120> hit<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.450> or

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
atomic blimp and see if I can hit it or

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.190 
atomic blimp and see if I can hit it or
do<00:02:48.720> something<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:50.549> there<00:02:51.299> it<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.569> Franklin

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
do something and there it is Franklin

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.199 
do something and there it is Franklin
just<00:02:52.410> went<00:02:52.709> headfirst<00:02:53.010> into<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.700> atomic

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
just went headfirst into the atomic

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.960 
just went headfirst into the atomic
blimp<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.750> just<00:02:54.959> plummets<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.650> his<00:02:55.799> death<00:02:56.069> but

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
blimp and just plummets to his death but

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.490 
blimp and just plummets to his death but
I<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.269> thought<00:02:57.359> this<00:02:57.569> was<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:57.959> cool<00:02:58.170> so

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500
