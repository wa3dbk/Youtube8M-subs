00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.380
 so to start his little workshop of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.570
 montage i will introduce you to the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.340
 planing mount laurent geoffrey who has 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.649
 been specially designed for their 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 soup of the heath ans pc clarified on 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.629
 concludes baby competitors of course but 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.559
 adaptable on many others to their 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:48.180
 so here is the planing mount with a 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.950
 internal plumbing system a ball of 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.870
 holds a holding hook and 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.579
 merrion the task for your bac ling and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.500
 the little trip the thief you go 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.059
 able to install pretty much where you 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.809
 so I want to explain to you quickly 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.149
 do this little editing 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.149
 just take a flow competitors 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.380
 for my part I dig a little bit 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.330
 the back of the set for a 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.420
 better penetration 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.600
 I simply present my editing 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.820
 in the baby's body will conquer fit able to 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.390
 play pau so here is the lead 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.800
 went straight in I came 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.550
 depressed my hook the hold here is 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.330
 to prevent theirs from moving and 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.490
 Then I will come and take my child 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.260
 triple thieves if one back of theirs 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.060
 so to avoid that I have a banner 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.820
 who walks a little too softly if I 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.770
 want army forward I do a little 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:53.320
 turn and I want to fit nicely on 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.980
 avoid one too cowardly bagnÃ¨res a 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.980
 second turn 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.650
 and that's so I have a baby conclude with 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.600
 an internal leaded assembly in 2 g and the 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.580
 little blue thieves so if ever the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.550
 fish are a little eyes or whatever 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.290
 it is I little back my little trip the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.200
 flying she was presenting more about 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.260
 the back I even have some margin 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.840
 to present presti in caudal axis for 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.840
 the trout a little furrow 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.940
 so here we go 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.769
 ac the small mount to have fallen to the ground 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.440
 easy to install his afternoon after thirty 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.410
 so we can install it on the bitrate 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.490
 competitors like here but also on 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.630
 at this telethon or any other trip all to 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.390
 kind of their one can put it on to 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.100
 sandra there is no problem on the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.450
 anyone ever wanted to have fun 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.170
 mount a hovering length on a 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.860
 sandra that might be the right idea 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.860
 to create the difference 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.720
 so I'm going further from this 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.930
 mounting there which allows us to 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.930
 recover all the weapons so 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.390
 if I want to insert my planing mount 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:36.210
 in a sandra for example I propose 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.560
 presently bridge in the center of their game 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.560
 the sink up to that 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.980
 so sincere i get home well from there 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.980
 I guide him with my fingers 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:53.880
 there I come to block theirs with the 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.220
 Small hook attachment is my friend 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.520
 rays that will serve me to tie and 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.630
 I have more than come 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.050
 m of a lot side involves as I the 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.350
 wish 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:12.690
 so be below for peaches 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:16.620
 between two waters this is above 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:20.900
 for peaches to scratch the bottoms that 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.700
 avoid leaving the assembly and that's it 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.400
 that a little simple assembly a la 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.260
 head mounting hovering it's a small 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.240
 headed leaded me I call that a head 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.790
 lower its internal leaded frames 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.500
 which is really very smart that allows 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.900
 to balance them back down 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.080
 enough by hovering and in addition allows a 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.610
 arming to age graphs that allows 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.190
 to the fish during the fight of not 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:49.850
 damage them directly good little 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.850
 design 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.370
 of the language 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.740
 on the skateboard are basic 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.539
 he
