00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
lot of research how to pair the

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.750 
lot of research how to pair the
controller<00:00:14.389> with<00:00:15.389> your<00:00:15.960> Mac<00:00:16.800> wirelessly<00:00:17.400> to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
controller with your Mac wirelessly to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.599 
controller with your Mac wirelessly to
use<00:00:18.529> joystick<00:00:19.529> mapper<00:00:19.830> I've<00:00:20.220> been<00:00:20.400> doing<00:00:20.550> a

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609
