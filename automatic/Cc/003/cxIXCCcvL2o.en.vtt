more here and there i'm not a huge fan
of<00:00:56.640> tennis<00:00:56.999> but<00:00:57.239> over<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.260> years<00:00:58.320> Serena's

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
of tennis but over the years Serena's

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.229 
of tennis but over the years Serena's
growing<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.339> me<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:01.399> but<00:01:02.399> yeah<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:02.999> when<00:01:03.149> it

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
growing on me and but yeah but when it

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.040 
growing on me and but yeah but when it
comes<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.569> match<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.379> matchup<00:01:04.949> I

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
comes to this match this matchup I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.670 
comes to this match this matchup I
believed<00:01:07.050> her<00:01:07.170> history<00:01:08.090> I<00:01:09.090> believe<00:01:10.080> Williams

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
believed her history I believe Williams

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.580 
believed her history I believe Williams
has<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.520> 17<00:01:12.270> matches<00:01:13.230> out<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.880> 19

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
has one like 17 matches out of 19

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.340 
has one like 17 matches out of 19
against<00:01:16.590> Maria<00:01:17.010> Sharapova<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
against Maria Sharapova so the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.290 
against Maria Sharapova so the
likelihood<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.890> Maria<00:01:20.400> winning<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.000> match

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
likelihood of Maria winning this match

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.470 
likelihood of Maria winning this match
is<00:01:21.690> pretty<00:01:22.140> low<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.350> my<00:01:22.620> opinion<00:01:23.360> but<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.450> think

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
is pretty low in my opinion but I think

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.820 
is pretty low in my opinion but I think
yeah<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> think<00:01:25.020> she's<00:01:25.320> definitely<00:01:25.800> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
yeah I think she's definitely the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.190 
yeah I think she's definitely the
underdog<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.690> when<00:01:27.690> it<00:01:27.780> comes<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> this

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
underdog here when it comes to this

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.540 
underdog here when it comes to this
matchup<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.800> think<00:01:28.880> Maria<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.840> look<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.200> so

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
matchup I think Maria is the look is so

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.210 
matchup I think Maria is the look is so
that<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.700> lesser<00:01:33.060> player<00:01:33.860> in<00:01:34.860> terms<00:01:35.100> of

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that the lesser player in terms of

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.400 
that the lesser player in terms of
skills<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:35.790> everything<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.450> all<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.260> stuff

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
skills and everything and all that stuff

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.700 
skills and everything and all that stuff
but<00:01:38.510> I'm<00:01:39.510> actually<00:01:39.900> running<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> out

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
but I'm actually running for the out

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.370 
but I'm actually running for the out
there<00:01:40.980> I'm<00:01:41.400> hoping<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.390> Maria<00:01:42.720> will<00:01:42.930> win<00:01:43.110> but

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
there I'm hoping that Maria will win but

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.620 
there I'm hoping that Maria will win but
I<00:01:43.410> think<00:01:43.890> every<00:01:44.610> novel<00:01:44.820> definitely<00:01:45.330> windows

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
I think every novel definitely windows

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.050 
I think every novel definitely windows
in<00:01:45.840> maybe<00:01:46.050> in<00:01:46.170> three<00:01:46.410> sets<00:01:46.650> yeah<00:01:47.520> i<00:01:47.550> would<00:01:47.820> say

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
in maybe in three sets yeah i would say

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.460 
in maybe in three sets yeah i would say
three<00:01:48.300> sets<00:01:50.660> probably<00:01:51.660> like<00:01:51.750> similar<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.200> her

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
three sets probably like similar to her

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.070 
three sets probably like similar to her
her<00:01:52.650> last<00:01:52.920> much<00:01:53.220> when<00:01:53.490> she<00:01:53.610> fought<00:01:53.790> my<00:01:54.570> chief

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
her last much when she fought my chief

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.270 
her last much when she fought my chief
when<00:01:55.860> she<00:01:56.130> faced<00:01:56.810> what's<00:01:57.810> what's<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.500> pastor

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
when she faced what's what's a pastor

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.110 
when she faced what's what's a pastor
for<00:01:59.490> face<00:01:59.790> whatever<00:02:00.720> when<00:02:01.020> she<00:02:01.170> played

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
for face whatever when she played

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.150 
for face whatever when she played
Azarenka<00:02:03.120> I<00:02:03.530> think<00:02:04.530> would<00:02:04.680> probably<00:02:05.040> result

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
Azarenka I think would probably result

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.280 
Azarenka I think would probably result
of<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.550> same<00:02:05.850> thing<00:02:06.060> or<00:02:06.210> maybe<00:02:06.270> even<00:02:06.480> Watson

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
of that same thing or maybe even Watson

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.469 
of that same thing or maybe even Watson
now<00:02:07.680> Watson<00:02:08.129> was<00:02:08.310> pretty<00:02:08.519> damn<00:02:08.640> competitive<00:02:09.000> I

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
now Watson was pretty damn competitive I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.150 
now Watson was pretty damn competitive I
don't<00:02:09.929> think<00:02:09.989> about<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.349> competitive<00:02:10.920> but<00:02:11.129> I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
don't think about that competitive but I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.059 
don't think about that competitive but I
think<00:02:11.489> Serena<00:02:11.940> Serena<00:02:12.269> book<00:02:12.660> has<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.260> but

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
think Serena Serena book has this but

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.610 
think Serena Serena book has this but
I'm<00:02:15.060> hoping<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.510> Maria<00:02:15.959> can<00:02:16.200> at<00:02:16.319> least<00:02:16.410> make

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
I'm hoping that Maria can at least make

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.399 
I'm hoping that Maria can at least make
