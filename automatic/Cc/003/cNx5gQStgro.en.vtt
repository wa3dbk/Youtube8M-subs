00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.370
 to exaggerate 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.320
 such as relief ink or a pen in the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.940

 To Use Satin Ribbon Extract In Color 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.610
 black and glitter furtacor so let's 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.430
 start the first step is to take one of the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.980
 and create an opening in the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.610
 superior as you can see in the image 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.160
 It's a half-moon and I even scored the eye. 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:06.920
 and do not get edosn and now it's just 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:10.160
 cut out the half-moon 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.130
 is yes and this will be the back of the 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.430
 our bunny on the front we 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.670
 We put a whole small plate rabbit 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.790
 It will be like this now, so just go through 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.299
 glue on the sides and join a small 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.299
 other 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.980
 How do I intend to put several eggs? 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.010

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.500
 I will reinforce the collage by stapling the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.500

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.319
 let's reserve and let it dry 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.750
 Meanwhile let's get that sock 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.450
 moon that we take off from the first little plate 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.629
 to make the bunny's ears 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.079
 this half moon will serve as a template for 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.299
 another ear and let's cut out another one 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.639

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:03.560

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.549
 measure 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:16.759
 first because it's very simple it does not have 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.979
 Secrets I do not have to teach and then 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.620
 because everything will vary according to the 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.530
 Okay, what do you guys use, okay?
