some<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.390> these<00:01:42.479> things<00:01:42.659> are<00:01:42.899> definitely

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
some of these things are definitely

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.830 
some of these things are definitely
harder<00:01:43.920> than<00:01:44.130> others<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.610> get<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.270> challenges

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
harder than others to get the challenges

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.510 
harder than others to get the challenges
and<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.200> guys<00:01:46.350> will<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> few

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and you guys will see that here in a few

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.969 
and you guys will see that here in a few
minutes<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.990> I'll<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.259> over<00:01:49.470> how<00:01:49.649> they<00:01:49.829> get

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
minutes and I'll go over how they get

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.130 
minutes and I'll go over how they get
each<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.250> every<00:01:50.460> one<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.610> them<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.720> played

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
each and every one of them but I played

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.980 
each and every one of them but I played
a<00:01:52.170> lot<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.470> hardcore<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.149> done<00:01:54.390> -<00:01:54.630> so

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
a lot of hardcore to get this done - so

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.050 
a lot of hardcore to get this done - so
I'll<00:01:55.680> mention<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> few<00:01:56.399> seconds<00:01:56.850> but

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I'll mention that here a few seconds but

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.030 
I'll mention that here a few seconds but
uh<00:01:57.090> let's<00:01:57.750> see<00:01:57.840> how<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.020> goes<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.469> how<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:58.920> you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
uh let's see how it goes so how do you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.100 
uh let's see how it goes so how do you
get<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.280> thing<00:01:59.490> gold<00:01:59.759> well<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.689> come<00:02:00.960> into

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
get this thing gold well you come into

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.569 
get this thing gold well you come into
your<00:02:01.259> created<00:02:01.560> class<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:02.009> go<00:02:02.130> down<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.460> your

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
your created class you go down to your

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.969 
your created class you go down to your
small<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.570> go<00:02:03.810> into<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.500> hit<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> y

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
small you go into it you hit the y

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.560 
small you go into it you hit the y
button<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.549> then<00:02:05.729> let's<00:02:06.060> take<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> look<00:02:06.420> here

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
button and then let's take a look here

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.240 
button and then let's take a look here
so<00:02:07.049> first<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.469> know<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.829> normal<00:02:08.099> thing

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
so first you know it's the normal thing

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.770 
so first you know it's the normal thing
you<00:02:08.340> got<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.489> get<00:02:08.729> five<00:02:09.030> destroy<00:02:09.569> five

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
you got to get five destroy five

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.720 
you got to get five destroy five
aircrafts<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.590> then<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.129> goes<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> line

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
aircrafts and then that goes on the line

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.760 
aircrafts and then that goes on the line
ten<00:02:12.110> twenty<00:02:13.110> and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
ten twenty and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.350 
ten twenty and
get<00:02:13.950> through<00:02:14.100> these<00:02:14.250> these<00:02:14.520> cameras<00:02:14.940> here<00:02:15.150> and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
get through these these cameras here and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.570 
get through these these cameras here and
basically<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:16.440> last<00:02:16.620> one<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.310> know<00:02:17.400> this

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
basically the last one is you know this

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.280 
basically the last one is you know this
cryptic<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.210> that's<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.660> hundred<00:02:18.840> aircraft

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
cryptic and that's a hundred aircraft

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.020 
cryptic and that's a hundred aircraft
with<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> small<00:02:19.770> 100<00:02:20.160> aircraft<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.730> then<00:02:20.970> you

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
with a small 100 aircraft and then you

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.550 
with a small 100 aircraft and then you
move<00:02:21.210> on<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.510> other<00:02:21.660> challenges<00:02:22.350> what<00:02:22.530> are

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560

the other challenges you have to get 10
impact<00:02:25.680> kills<00:02:25.980> with<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.220> small<00:02:26.550> now<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> found<00:02:27.300> to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
impact kills with a small now I found to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.600 
impact kills with a small now I found to
get<00:02:27.960> these<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.380> went<00:02:28.800> into<00:02:28.890> hardcore<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.490> that

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
get these I went into hardcore and that

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.610 
get these I went into hardcore and that
seemed<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.030> be<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.570> lot<00:02:30.810> easier<00:02:31.200> than<00:02:31.320> playing

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
seemed to be a lot easier than playing

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.770 
seemed to be a lot easier than playing
non<00:02:31.920> hardcore<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.580> that's<00:02:33.420> such<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.630> little

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
I think it's amazing I think this thing

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.460 
I think it's amazing I think this thing
is<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.460> beastly<00:03:33.180> along<00:03:33.900> with<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.110> other<00:03:34.230> gold

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.900 
is so beastly along with the other gold
weapons<00:03:34.620> I<00:03:34.860> know<00:03:34.920> I<00:03:35.010> say<00:03:35.220> each<00:03:35.400> time<00:03:35.640> but<00:03:35.880> I

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
weapons I know I say each time but I

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.520 
weapons I know I say each time but I
think<00:03:36.120> they<00:03:36.210> really<00:03:36.780> came<00:03:36.960> through<00:03:36.990> with<00:03:37.260> this

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530

think they really came through with this
gold<00:03:37.740> on<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.370> they<00:03:38.970> don't<00:03:39.120> make<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.240> too

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
gold on this and they don't make it too

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.270 
gold on this and they don't make it too
too<00:03:39.630> difficult<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.140> get<00:03:40.350> but<00:03:40.890> then<00:03:41.010> again<00:03:41.100> you
