00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:09.120
 Hello everyone yesterday you watched mine 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.490
 video about how I was going to work and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:21.460
 I'll show you croquet back today 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:24.029
 home roads almost the same I already on 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.519
 parking day will end now 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.199
 4:30 pm 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.619
 work schedule and me 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:38.699
 since less free to me 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.699
 the main thing is to be at work between 9am and you 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.750
 the main thing is there 40 hours a week from work 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.179
 so i can come all morning 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.570
 I can come to 8 I can come to 9 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:56.289
 not just can not go 3 I 4 I 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.260
 I can enter 9 pm but I like it so much 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.230
 me so there is some time when 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.570
 it is necessary to be found if suddenly 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:11.560
 there rallies need to be held or else 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:18.030
 something how do you distribute yourself as 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.030
 it is more convenient for you so generally we left 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:28.119
 I left with you already from the parking lot and 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:47.479
 go right away right 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:52.490
 two three 4 5 six lanes at a crossroads 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.709
 In general, the road of 3 lanes 2 leaves more true 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.630
 two additional bands are formed for 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:02:00.110
 turning left one extra for 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.479
 turning right speed on this 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:08.780
 a small road which turned 30 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:11.450
 miles per hour it's about 50 kilometers to 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.660
 an hour this is considered a residential area therefore 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.660
 here 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.799
 lift you well and here are my apartments 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.799
 all I arrived 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.819
 it is necessary to open the turnover on the cards but 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.220
 there sits a security who nobody 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.080
 besides residents but only 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.780
 residents invited their voices 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.880
 but this box where it is written about him 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.600
 from the abyss tighten this box where 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:50.510
 I need a card physics opened 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:54.230
 the window of his mouth opens you will not 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:00.470
 apparently but the guard I wish you no 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:05.810
 greets me with a wave 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.870
 and mail costs Bo-bo will check if 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.450
 something there 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.970
 and here is our house in which we rented 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:18.610
 our new ports we have our own parking under 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.849
 its if someone else there becomes his 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.370
 immediately take out from there but bad that 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:29.680
 only one parking space per apartment 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.900
 here but if two cars can 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.150
 put on the parking for guests 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.390
