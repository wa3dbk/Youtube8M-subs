00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
and it's a tough job making a game over

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.160 
and it's a tough job making a game over
your<00:01:09.820> network<00:01:10.210> but<00:01:10.540> still<00:01:10.810> keeping<00:01:11.020> the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
your network but still keeping the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.740 
your network but still keeping the
visuals<00:01:11.620> this<00:01:12.010> look<00:01:12.790> this<00:01:12.940> cool<00:01:13.150> I<00:01:13.390> mean

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
visuals this look this cool I mean

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.200 
visuals this look this cool I mean
firstly<00:01:14.230> no<00:01:14.380> other<00:01:14.530> game<00:01:14.770> has<00:01:15.040> this<00:01:15.370> level

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
firstly no other game has this level

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.990 
firstly no other game has this level
destruction<00:01:16.480> and<00:01:17.430> definitely<00:01:18.430> no<00:01:18.640> other<00:01:18.820> game

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
destruction and definitely no other game

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.420 
destruction and definitely no other game
has<00:01:19.270> this<00:01:19.510> over<00:01:19.930> network<00:01:20.350> which<00:01:20.830> has<00:01:21.190> been<00:01:21.400> a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
has this over network which has been a

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.820 
has this over network which has been a
real<00:01:21.610> challenge<00:01:21.640> because<00:01:22.350> every<00:01:23.350> wall<00:01:23.560> every

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
real challenge because every wall every

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.060 
real challenge because every wall every
object<00:01:24.540> everything<00:01:25.540> all<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.320> effects<00:01:26.950> have

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
object everything all the effects have

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.070 
object everything all the effects have
to<00:01:27.190> play<00:01:27.400> networked<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:29.400> yeah<00:01:30.400> it's<00:01:30.640> not<00:01:30.790> easy

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
to play networked and yeah it's not easy

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.000 
to play networked and yeah it's not easy
which<00:01:32.080> is<00:01:32.230> why<00:01:32.350> we're<00:01:32.560> doing<00:01:32.650> this<00:01:34.800> so<00:01:35.800> I<00:01:35.860> mean

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
which is why we're doing this so I mean

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.630 
which is why we're doing this so I mean
the<00:01:36.970> destruction<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.780> not<00:01:38.140> only<00:01:38.460> looking<00:01:39.460> nice

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
the destruction is not only looking nice

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.550 
the destruction is not only looking nice
it<00:01:39.970> actually<00:01:40.180> matters<00:01:40.510> when<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.260> destroy

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
it actually matters when you destroy

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.480 
it actually matters when you destroy
stuff<00:01:43.260> when<00:01:44.260> you<00:01:44.380> go<00:01:44.500> through<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.800> house<00:01:45.100> and

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
stuff when you go through a house and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.700 
stuff when you go through a house and
you<00:01:46.000> see<00:01:46.210> someone<00:01:46.660> in<00:01:46.840> there<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.200> can<00:01:47.440> just

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
you see someone in there you can just

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.740 
you see someone in there you can just
blow<00:01:48.700> away<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:49.660> wall<00:01:49.900> is<00:01:50.080> covered<00:01:50.380> or<00:01:51.310> I<00:01:51.790> use

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
blow away this wall is covered or I use

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.140 
blow away this wall is covered or I use
the<00:01:52.900> tank<00:01:53.170> running<00:01:53.710> for<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.369> you<00:01:54.580> pass<00:01:55.119> a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
the tank running for you and you pass a

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.359 
the tank running for you and you pass a
bridge<00:01:55.509> you<00:01:55.660> can<00:01:55.690> just<00:01:55.930> blow<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.830> up<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.190> he'll

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
bridge you can just blow it up and he'll

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.550 
bridge you can just blow it up and he'll
fall<00:01:57.820> down<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.119> it<00:01:58.210> hopefully<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.509> all<00:02:02.229> kinds

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
fall down to it hopefully so all kinds

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.140 
fall down to it hopefully so all kinds
of<00:02:02.590> stuff<00:02:02.770> can<00:02:03.070> be<00:02:03.130> destroyed<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.700> most

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
of stuff can be destroyed and most

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.180 
of stuff can be destroyed and most
everything<00:02:04.780> has<00:02:05.140> partial<00:02:05.650> destruction<00:02:05.800> as

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
everything has partial destruction as

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.570 
everything has partial destruction as
well<00:02:07.500> listen<00:02:08.500> here<00:02:08.740> you<00:02:08.800> can<00:02:08.920> see<00:02:09.040> some<00:02:09.070> couple

course<00:02:22.460> you<00:02:22.550> have<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.730> keep<00:02:22.820> some<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.270> bits

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
course you have to keep some of the bits

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.570 
course you have to keep some of the bits
still<00:02:24.110> indestructible<00:02:24.500> for<00:02:25.040> for<00:02:25.490> the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
still indestructible for for the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.820 
still indestructible for for the
gameplay<00:02:25.940> otherwise<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:27.080> have<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.260> totally

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
gameplay otherwise we have a totally

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.280 
gameplay otherwise we have a totally
flat<00:02:28.040> world<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.910> that's<00:02:29.120> not<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:29.780> much<00:02:29.960> fun

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.480 

but<00:02:33.290> maybe<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> usual<00:02:33.740> game<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.160> would<00:02:34.280> see

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
but maybe in a usual game you would see

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.670 
but maybe in a usual game you would see
these<00:02:35.330> sandbags<00:02:35.600> and<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.080> can't<00:02:36.320> get<00:02:36.410> past

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
these sandbags and you can't get past

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.100 
these sandbags and you can't get past
them<00:02:36.890> why<00:02:37.040> not<00:02:37.280> shoot<00:02:37.610> them<00:02:37.850> down<00:02:38.000> instead

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.280 

oops<00:02:43.420> now<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.450> happen<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.780> shoot<00:02:44.990> down<00:02:45.110> the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
oops now I happen to shoot down the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.900 
oops now I happen to shoot down the
barrels<00:02:45.680> as<00:02:46.010> well<00:02:46.220> because<00:02:46.490> we<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.760> lot<00:02:46.880> of

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
barrels as well because we have a lot of

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.820 
barrels as well because we have a lot of
chain<00:02:47.150> reactions<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.750> chain<00:02:48.290> reactions<00:02:48.709> in

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
chain reactions and chain reactions in

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.040 
chain reactions and chain reactions in
the<00:02:48.890> game<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:49.340> if<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.270> shoot<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.450> barrel<00:02:50.870> it

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
the game so if you shoot a barrel it

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.479 
the game so if you shoot a barrel it
might<00:02:51.260> hear<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.530> car<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.100> car<00:02:52.250> might

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
might hear the car and the car might

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.220 
might hear the car and the car might
explode<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.120> might<00:02:53.390> hit<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.570> tree<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.080> falls

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
explode it might hit a tree that falls

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.770 
explode it might hit a tree that falls
down<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.770> house<00:02:55.270> that's<00:02:56.270> really<00:02:56.450> fun<00:02:56.690> you

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
down to the house that's really fun you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.030 
down to the house that's really fun you
can<00:02:56.959> get<00:02:57.170> there<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.470> can<00:02:57.620> have<00:02:57.739> unexpected

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
can get there you can have unexpected

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.830 
can get there you can have unexpected
scenes<00:02:58.989> here<00:02:59.989> we<00:03:00.080> have<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.230> couple<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.590> trees

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
scenes here we have a couple of trees

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.420 
scenes here we have a couple of trees
what<00:03:02.840> happens<00:03:03.110> if<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.320> blow<00:03:03.620> draenei<00:03:03.920> decided

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
what happens if I blow draenei decided

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.000 
what happens if I blow draenei decided
the<00:03:05.420> trees<00:03:05.690> fault<00:03:07.330> yeah<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.570> that<00:03:09.560> also<00:03:09.739> goes

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
the trees fault yeah and that also goes

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.500 
the trees fault yeah and that also goes
for<00:03:10.070> if<00:03:10.580> it<00:03:10.760> falls<00:03:11.150> down<00:03:11.270> on<00:03:11.450> enemy<00:03:12.200> AI<00:03:12.459> he'll

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
for if it falls down on enemy AI he'll

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.449 
for if it falls down on enemy AI he'll
probably<00:03:14.510> die<00:03:14.870> for<00:03:15.170> me<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:18.739> let's<00:03:19.010> jump<00:03:19.280> into

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
probably die for me and let's jump into

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:29.930 
probably die for me and let's jump into
a<00:03:19.549> tank<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:19.970> see<00:03:20.120> what<00:03:20.239> happens

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.540 

there<00:03:30.940> we<00:03:31.030> go

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.830 

as<00:03:35.550> we<00:03:35.730> said<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:35.940> most<00:03:36.420> objects<00:03:36.720> are

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
as we said I most objects are

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.780 
as we said I most objects are
destructible<00:03:37.320> so<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.710> can<00:03:38.040> also<00:03:38.190> run<00:03:38.550> down

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
destructible so you can also run down

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.100 
destructible so you can also run down
trees<00:03:39.090> with<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.050> tank<00:03:40.350> for<00:03:40.710> example<00:03:42.110> create

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
trees with a tank for example create

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.480 
trees with a tank for example create
some<00:03:43.290> obstacles<00:03:43.890> in<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.100> way

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.720 

and<00:03:49.240> obviously<00:03:49.900> that's<00:03:50.170> also<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.580> kind<00:03:51.580> of

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
and obviously that's also a kind of

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.220 
and obviously that's also a kind of
tactical<00:03:52.090> thing<00:03:52.360> because<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.810> can<00:03:53.020> run

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
tactical thing because you can run

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.050 
tactical thing because you can run
through<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.500> entire<00:03:54.040> forest<00:03:54.460> with<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.670> tank<00:03:54.940> if

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
through a entire forest with a tank if

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.970 
through a entire forest with a tank if
you<00:03:55.120> want<00:03:55.330> to<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:56.290> run<00:03:56.620> through<00:03:56.740> it<00:03:56.860> like

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
you want to and run through it like

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.980 
you want to and run through it like
butter<00:03:58.020> but<00:03:59.020> with<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.470> Humvee<00:03:59.860> you<00:04:00.160> will<00:04:00.990> smash

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
butter but with a Humvee you will smash

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.730 
butter but with a Humvee you will smash
into<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.260> tree<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.710> just<00:04:03.460> stop<00:04:03.910> by<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.210> I<00:04:04.740> mean

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
into the tree and just stop by it I mean

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.770 
into the tree and just stop by it I mean
well<00:04:06.280> when<00:04:06.640> we've<00:04:06.850> got<00:04:07.120> used<00:04:07.360> to<00:04:07.540> the

our<00:04:49.270> chain<00:04:49.510> reaction<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:50.080> makes<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.440> trees

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
our chain reaction that makes the trees

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.360 
our chain reaction that makes the trees
fall<00:04:51.010> as<00:04:51.220> well<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:53.590> obviously<00:04:53.860> I'd<00:04:54.250> like

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
fall as well and obviously I'd like

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.210 
fall as well and obviously I'd like
Hannah<00:04:54.580> stuff<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:55.650> always<00:04:56.650> had<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.860> look<00:04:57.010> around

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
Hannah stuff I always had to look around

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.560 
Hannah stuff I always had to look around
here<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.670> you're<00:04:58.450> not<00:04:58.540> safe<00:05:02.790> and<00:05:03.790> then<00:05:04.420> their

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
here and you're not safe and then their

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.140 
here and you're not safe and then their
own<00:05:04.980> effects<00:05:05.980> of<00:05:06.100> different<00:05:06.220> scale<00:05:06.640> of<00:05:06.850> course

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
own effects of different scale of course

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.240 
own effects of different scale of course
we're<00:05:07.420> trying<00:05:07.690> out<00:05:07.900> still<00:05:08.200> yeah<00:05:08.740> what<00:05:09.010> looks

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
we're trying out still yeah what looks

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.700 
we're trying out still yeah what looks
it<00:05:10.180> looks<00:05:10.330> nice<00:05:10.600> and<00:05:10.870> how<00:05:10.960> far<00:05:11.110> we<00:05:11.260> can<00:05:11.350> take<00:05:11.410> it

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
it looks nice and how far we can take it

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.130 
it looks nice and how far we can take it
yeah<00:05:12.250> we've<00:05:12.670> done<00:05:12.850> some<00:05:13.090> really<00:05:13.450> cool<00:05:13.660> testing

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
yeah we've done some really cool testing

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.610 
yeah we've done some really cool testing
but<00:05:14.410> I<00:05:14.470> mean<00:05:14.920> scale<00:05:15.700> wise<00:05:15.940> we<00:05:16.750> want<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.050> want<00:05:17.530> to

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
but I mean scale wise we want to want to

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.650 
but I mean scale wise we want to want to
have<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.950> destruction<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:18.610> fits<00:05:19.360> with<00:05:19.600> the

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
have a destruction that fits with the

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.560 
have a destruction that fits with the
Battlefield<00:05:20.230> franchise<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:23.880> its<00:05:24.880> most<00:05:25.360> in

large scale I mean entire wall of the
house<00:05:28.300> is<00:05:28.600> pretty<00:05:29.050> large<00:05:29.260> scale<00:05:29.590> and<00:05:29.740> not<00:05:29.800> just

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
house is pretty large scale and not just

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.850 
house is pretty large scale and not just
bits<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.330> pieces<00:05:31.750> over<00:05:34.350> let's<00:05:35.350> try<00:05:35.500> cheering

houses we've been discussing that back

fire the smoke the smoke columns to fog
everything<00:06:25.360> you<00:06:26.360> will<00:06:26.540> see<00:06:26.780> that<00:06:26.930> you<00:06:26.990> have

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 
everything you will see that you have

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.110 
everything you will see that you have
been<00:06:27.380> there<00:06:30.100> yeah<00:06:31.100> so<00:06:31.280> one<00:06:31.430> less<00:06:31.580> thing<00:06:31.850> we<00:06:31.880> can

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
been there yeah so one less thing we can

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.690 
been there yeah so one less thing we can
point<00:06:32.270> out<00:06:32.450> is<00:06:32.660> the<00:06:33.040> dynamic<00:06:34.040> side<00:06:34.460> of<00:06:34.580> this

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
point out is the dynamic side of this

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.040 
point out is the dynamic side of this
everything<00:06:35.570> is<00:06:35.660> dynamic<00:06:36.140> and<00:06:37.780> the<00:06:38.780> game<00:06:38.930> we

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
everything is dynamic and the game we

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.630 
everything is dynamic and the game we
can<00:06:39.230> rotate<00:06:39.350> the<00:06:39.620> Sun<00:06:39.800> here<00:06:39.920> just<00:06:40.160> to<00:06:40.280> show<00:06:40.430> off

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:40.640 
can rotate the Sun here just to show off

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.610 
can rotate the Sun here just to show off
what<00:06:41.390> happens<00:06:41.780> you<00:06:41.960> know<00:06:42.080> all<00:06:42.230> the<00:06:42.350> particles

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
what happens you know all the particles

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.000 
what happens you know all the particles
are<00:06:42.980> dynamic<00:06:43.490> dynamical<00:06:44.420> it's<00:06:44.660> and<00:06:45.010> how

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
are dynamic dynamical it's and how

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
are dynamic dynamical it's and how
successful<00:06:46.400> also<00:06:48.520> we<00:06:49.520> have<00:06:49.640> to<00:06:49.760> do<00:06:49.880> that

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
successful also we have to do that

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.360 
successful also we have to do that
because<00:06:50.240> everything<00:06:50.870> is<00:06:51.190> changing<00:06:52.190> all<00:06:52.310> the

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
because everything is changing all the

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.570 
because everything is changing all the
time<00:06:52.520> so<00:06:53.270> nothing<00:06:53.570> can<00:06:53.600> be<00:06:53.870> static<00:06:54.200> and<00:06:54.410> we<00:06:55.340> try

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
time so nothing can be static and we try

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.040 
time so nothing can be static and we try
to<00:06:55.610> push<00:06:55.820> this<00:06:56.000> real<00:06:56.300> far<00:06:56.570> so<00:06:56.750> we<00:06:56.810> can<00:06:56.960> have

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
to push this real far so we can have

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.660 
to push this real far so we can have
dynamic<00:06:57.260> weather<00:06:57.650> as<00:06:57.860> well<00:06:58.040> and<00:06:58.280> you<00:06:58.400> will<00:06:58.520> see

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:58.670 
dynamic weather as well and you will see

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.940 
dynamic weather as well and you will see
the<00:06:58.700> light<00:06:58.970> change<00:06:59.330> during<00:07:00.200> gameplay<00:07:00.500> so<00:07:00.740> you

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
the light change during gameplay so you

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.730 
the light change during gameplay so you
can<00:07:01.100> start<00:07:01.310> with<00:07:01.460> the<00:07:01.520> morning<00:07:01.940> and<00:07:02.090> end<00:07:02.240> up<00:07:02.390> an

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
can start with the morning and end up an

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.520 
can start with the morning and end up an
overcast<00:07:03.740> afternoon
