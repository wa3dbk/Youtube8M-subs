00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
that's not actually a guarantee I'm

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.720 
that's not actually a guarantee I'm
gonna<00:00:39.940> be<00:00:40.150> a<00:00:40.180> dick<00:00:40.449> here<00:00:40.660> for<00:00:40.839> a<00:00:40.870> second<00:00:41.610> let<00:00:42.610> it

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
gonna be a dick here for a second let it

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:51.840 
gonna be a dick here for a second let it
right<00:00:43.000> now<00:00:43.600> ah<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.710> yeah<00:00:51.129> fallout<00:00:51.489> 3<00:00:51.670> could

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
right now ah so yeah fallout 3 could

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.520 
right now ah so yeah fallout 3 could
resume<00:00:52.089> as<00:00:52.390> early<00:00:52.629> as<00:00:52.720> tomorrow<00:00:52.900> that's<00:00:53.379> not<00:00:53.500> a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
resume as early as tomorrow that's not a

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.380 
resume as early as tomorrow that's not a
guarantee<00:00:53.799> though<00:00:54.220> because<00:00:54.640> obviously<00:00:55.089> I

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
guarantee though because obviously I

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.450 
guarantee though because obviously I
might<00:00:55.659> not<00:00:55.809> get<00:00:56.019> to<00:00:56.229> it<00:00:56.260> which<00:00:56.799> would<00:00:57.010> be<00:00:59.460> with

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
might not get to it which would be with

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.219 
might not get to it which would be with
that<00:01:00.610> come<00:01:00.820> from<00:01:00.939> I<00:01:01.210> might<00:01:01.809> not<00:01:01.930> be<00:01:02.049> able<00:01:02.170> to

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
that come from I might not be able to

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.020 
that come from I might not be able to
record<00:01:02.409> tomorrow<00:01:02.769> that<00:01:03.129> possibility<00:01:03.850> is

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
record tomorrow that possibility is

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.789 
record tomorrow that possibility is
always<00:01:04.150> open<00:01:04.479> and<00:01:04.900> I'm<00:01:05.080> not<00:01:05.260> saying<00:01:05.560> that

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
always open and I'm not saying that

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.340 
always open and I'm not saying that
how<00:01:06.130> would<00:01:06.250> it<00:01:06.430> dig<00:01:07.290> shotgun<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.470> crotch

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
how would it dig shotgun to the crotch

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.830 
how would it dig shotgun to the crotch
alright<00:01:11.350> I<00:01:12.180> might<00:01:13.180> not<00:01:13.330> be<00:01:13.390> able<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.540> record

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
alright I might not be able to record

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.210 
alright I might not be able to record
tomorrow<00:01:13.960> which<00:01:14.290> is<00:01:14.320> unlikely<00:01:14.890> I'll<00:01:15.040> probably

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
tomorrow which is unlikely I'll probably

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.920 
tomorrow which is unlikely I'll probably
be<00:01:15.400> able<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.549> record<00:01:15.850> but<00:01:16.180> I<00:01:16.240> also<00:01:16.450> might<00:01:16.750> not

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
be able to record but I also might not

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.140 
be able to record but I also might not
get<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.380> part<00:01:17.650> yet<00:01:20.460> though<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:21.670> is<00:01:21.820> likely

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
get to the part yet though it is likely

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.609 
get to the part yet though it is likely
that<00:01:22.299> I<00:01:22.509> will<00:01:22.659> get<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:22.900> that<00:01:22.930> part<00:01:23.229> so<00:01:23.409> it<00:01:23.530> is

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
that I will get to that part so it is

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.800 
that I will get to that part so it is
likely<00:01:23.859> that<00:01:24.070> fallout<00:01:24.939> 3<00:01:25.149> could<00:01:25.329> be<00:01:25.359> uploaded

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
likely that fallout 3 could be uploaded

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.989 
likely that fallout 3 could be uploaded
tomorrow<00:01:26.170> again<00:01:26.469> blah<00:01:27.429> blah<00:01:27.670> blah

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:27.999 
tomorrow again blah blah blah

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:29.459 
tomorrow again blah blah blah
that<00:01:28.119> means<00:01:28.270> Max<00:01:28.509> Payne<00:01:28.749> will<00:01:28.869> be<00:01:28.990> put<00:01:29.170> on<00:01:29.289> hold

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
that means Max Payne will be put on hold

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.539 
that means Max Payne will be put on hold
until<00:01:29.740> fallout<00:01:30.640> stone<00:01:30.969> again<00:01:31.240> which<00:01:32.369> could<00:01:33.369> go

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
until fallout stone again which could go

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.739 
until fallout stone again which could go
into<00:01:33.789> August<00:01:35.789> actually<00:01:36.789> no<00:01:37.270> will<00:01:37.509> go<00:01:37.630> in

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749 
into August actually no will go in

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:39.380 
into August actually no will go in
August<00:01:38.049> what<00:01:38.140> am<00:01:38.229> I<00:01:38.289> talking<00:01:38.590> about

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
August what am I talking about

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.730 
August what am I talking about
as<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.450> phone<00:01:40.719> ringing<00:01:40.960> I'll<00:01:41.259> get<00:01:41.380> back<00:01:41.530> to<00:01:41.560> this

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
as a phone ringing I'll get back to this

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.120 
as a phone ringing I'll get back to this
after<00:01:42.039> this<00:01:42.130> cutscene

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.859 

it<00:01:46.700> could<00:01:46.850> have<00:01:46.939> been<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:47.179> a<00:01:47.299> junkie<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:47.719> need

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
it could have been just a junkie in need

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.090 
it could have been just a junkie in need
of<00:01:47.899> a<00:01:48.109> fix<00:01:48.319> but<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.679> turned<00:01:48.859> out<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.009> be

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
of a fix but it turned out to be

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.429 
of a fix but it turned out to be
something<00:01:49.460> more<00:01:49.609> sinister<00:01:49.880> than<00:01:50.149> that<00:01:50.450> how

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
something more sinister than that how

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:59.230 
something more sinister than that how
much<00:01:51.640> pain<00:01:52.840> no<00:01:57.700> tell<00:01:58.700> me<00:01:58.819> something<00:01:59.119> I<00:01:59.209> don't

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
much pain no tell me something I don't

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.810 
much pain no tell me something I don't
know<00:01:59.509> they<00:02:00.109> know<00:02:00.409> you<00:02:00.649> were<00:02:00.770> there

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.580 

July's<00:02:08.450> sirens<00:02:09.350> singing<00:02:09.590> off-key

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.020 

I<00:02:12.650> had<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.190> few<00:02:13.340> minutes<00:02:13.610> while<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.819> SWAT

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
I had a few minutes while the SWAT

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.300 
I had a few minutes while the SWAT
people<00:02:14.390> go<00:02:14.480> through<00:02:14.629> their<00:02:14.810> usual<00:02:15.200> routine<00:02:15.310> by

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
people go through their usual routine by

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.430 
people go through their usual routine by
the<00:02:16.370> time<00:02:16.610> they<00:02:16.760> busted<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.599> needed<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.319> be

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
the time they busted in I needed to be

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:30.880 
the time they busted in I needed to be
long<00:02:18.650> gone

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.199 

all<00:02:31.890> right<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.130> as<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.310> was<00:02:32.370> saying<00:02:32.430> I'll

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
all right so as I was saying I'll

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.470 
all right so as I was saying I'll
probably<00:02:33.390> go<00:02:33.569> into<00:02:33.690> September<00:02:34.880> not<00:02:35.880> August

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
probably go into September not August

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.900 
probably go into September not August
considering<00:02:37.319> that<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.590> DLC<00:02:38.099> comes<00:02:38.400> out<00:02:38.610> in

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
turned out the Russian had plenty of

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.750 
turned out the Russian had plenty of
guts<00:03:28.319> one<00:03:29.319> thing<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.620> can<00:03:29.769> count<00:03:29.799> on<00:03:30.189> you<00:03:30.579> push

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
guts one thing you can count on you push

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.490 
guts one thing you can count on you push
a<00:03:30.790> man<00:03:30.970> too<00:03:31.209> far<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.689> sooner<00:03:31.989> or<00:03:32.019> later<00:03:32.139> he'd

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
a man too far and sooner or later he'd

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.149 
a man too far and sooner or later he'd
start<00:03:32.799> pushing<00:03:33.129> back<00:03:34.409> it<00:03:35.409> kind<00:03:35.650> of<00:03:35.680> sucks<00:03:36.010> to

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
start pushing back it kind of sucks to

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.800 
start pushing back it kind of sucks to
have<00:03:36.250> commentary<00:03:36.909> on<00:03:37.090> this<00:03:37.299> because<00:03:37.599> there's

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
have commentary on this because there's

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.690 
have commentary on this because there's
always<00:03:37.900> little<00:03:38.200> cutscenes<00:03:38.799> like<00:03:39.069> everywhere

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
always little cutscenes like everywhere

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.619 
always little cutscenes like everywhere
so<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:40.480> do<00:03:41.319> have<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.680> stop<00:03:41.799> talking<00:03:42.629> pretty

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
so I do have to stop talking pretty

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.670 
so I do have to stop talking pretty
often<00:03:43.900> but<00:03:44.530> anyway<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.840> this<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.139> way<00:03:47.260> out<00:03:47.459> no

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
often but anyway is this the way out no

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.189 
often but anyway is this the way out no
well<00:03:51.359> this<00:03:52.359> is<00:03:52.690> quite<00:03:53.139> the<00:03:53.560> conundrum<00:03:55.199> all

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
well this is quite the conundrum all

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.229 
well this is quite the conundrum all
this<00:03:56.349> will<00:03:56.470> give<00:03:56.590> me<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.739> chance<00:03:56.949> to<00:03:57.220> talk<00:03:57.910> for<00:03:58.150> a

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
this will give me a chance to talk for a

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.059 
this will give me a chance to talk for a
second<00:03:59.280> obviously<00:04:00.959> was<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:01.989> stupid<00:04:02.500> key<00:04:02.859> go

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
second obviously was that stupid key go

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:10.589 
second obviously was that stupid key go
to<00:04:05.819> something<00:04:06.819> in<00:04:06.940> here<00:04:07.150> perhaps<00:04:09.599> something

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
to something in here perhaps something

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.409 
to something in here perhaps something
not<00:04:10.840> in<00:04:11.049> here<00:04:11.349> most<00:04:12.099> likely<00:04:12.280> not<00:04:15.030> but<00:04:16.030> anyway

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
not in here most likely not but anyway

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.289 
not in here most likely not but anyway
by<00:04:16.599> that<00:04:16.750> time<00:04:16.930> I'll<00:04:17.079> probably<00:04:17.409> doing<00:04:18.299> halo

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
by that time I'll probably doing halo

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.390 
by that time I'll probably doing halo
ODST

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
ODST

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.950 
ODST
which<00:04:21.400> comes<00:04:21.639> out<00:04:21.789> in<00:04:22.030> late<00:04:22.419> September<00:04:22.930> I

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
which comes out in late September I

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.120 
which comes out in late September I
think<00:04:23.289> so<00:04:23.820> hopefully<00:04:24.820> between<00:04:25.680> fallout<00:04:26.680> 3

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
think so hopefully between fallout 3

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.409 
think so hopefully between fallout 3
ends<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:28.080> ODST<00:04:29.080> begins<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.800> can<00:04:29.949> do<00:04:30.099> I<00:04:30.669> can

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
ends and ODST begins I can do I can

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.779 
ends and ODST begins I can do I can
finish<00:04:31.690> this<00:04:31.960> up<00:04:33.780> now<00:04:34.780> there<00:04:34.960> we<00:04:35.050> go
