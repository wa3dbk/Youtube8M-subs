yeah<00:01:46.319> it's<00:01:46.470> definitely<00:01:46.649> an<00:01:46.860> incentive<00:01:47.280> I

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
yeah it's definitely an incentive I

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.789 
yeah it's definitely an incentive I
think<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.539> why<00:01:48.959> can<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.349> at<00:01:49.590> this

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
think you know why can see the at this

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.410 
think you know why can see the at this

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
and finishing the season is like the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.800

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
looked too too far ahead of who we've

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.690 
looked too too far ahead of who we've
got<00:01:59.909> after<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.509> week<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:00.929> all<00:02:01.049> about

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
focusing on each week this week a tall

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.230 
focusing on each week this week a tall
tower<00:02:04.709> and<00:02:05.009> we've<00:02:05.369> got<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> home<00:02:05.670> game<00:02:05.849> and<00:02:06.090> we

season<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:10.019> know<00:02:10.049> every<00:02:10.349> every<00:02:10.829> point<00:02:11.039> you

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
season you know every every point you

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.630 
season you know every every point you
can<00:02:11.370> get<00:02:11.549> is<00:02:12.349> it's<00:02:13.349> crucial<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.860> we're

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
can get is it's crucial and we're

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.490 
can get is it's crucial and we're
sitting<00:02:14.760> eight<00:02:15.000> at<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.239> moment<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.720> probably

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
sitting eight at the moment and probably

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.099 
sitting eight at the moment and probably
not<00:02:16.980> where<00:02:17.190> we'd<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.700> diva<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.810> only<00:02:18.989> way

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
not where we'd like to diva the only way

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.680 
not where we'd like to diva the only way
for<00:02:19.350> us<00:02:19.380> really<00:02:19.739> is<00:02:20.090> put<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.180> performances

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
we're probably playing a little bit

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.059 
we're probably playing a little bit
better<00:02:36.959> than<00:02:37.139> what<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.410> were<00:02:37.530> last<00:02:37.739> time<00:02:37.920> we

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
better than what we were last time we

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.309 
better than what we were last time we
played<00:02:38.100> them<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.430> hopefully<00:02:39.030> things<00:02:39.989> can<00:02:40.200> turn

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
played them so hopefully things can turn

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.030 
played them so hopefully things can turn
around

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
around

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.539 
around
I<00:02:42.200> don't<00:02:43.200> fit<00:02:43.349> with<00:02:43.439> item<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.860> mayor<00:02:44.159> gingers

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
I don't fit with item a mayor gingers

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.039 
I don't fit with item a mayor gingers
just<00:02:44.760> some<00:02:44.909> bumps<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.269> bruises<00:02:45.359> which<00:02:45.870> should

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
just some bumps and bruises which should

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.220 
just some bumps and bruises which should
expect<00:02:46.439> from<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:47.640> know<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.909> intensity<00:02:48.359> again

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
expect from you know the intensity again

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.369 
expect from you know the intensity again
but<00:02:50.269> you<00:02:51.269> always<00:02:51.510> deal<00:02:51.719> with<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.019> bumps<00:02:52.260> and

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
but you always deal with the bumps and

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.009 
but you always deal with the bumps and
bruises<00:02:52.439> a<00:02:52.709> bit<00:02:52.859> less<00:02:53.040> after<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.430> victor<00:02:53.849> so<00:02:54.840> you

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
bruises a bit less after a victor so you

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.599 
bruises a bit less after a victor so you
have<00:02:55.200> one's<00:02:55.439> got<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.650> smile<00:02:55.920> on<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.129> faces<00:02:56.370> at
