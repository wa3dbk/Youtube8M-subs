00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:32.510
 hey i am df welcome to a new one 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.250
 edition of survival camping on the 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.670
 idea has brought me survival julian 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.150
 He asked me in a comment 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.440
 gonna be my daypack 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.360
 I thought that was great, too 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.220
 a new idea for my series doubt 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.470
 camping then i have about it 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.370
 thought and found that me 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.000
 the theme quite in 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.290
 conscience conflicts brings why 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.540
 depends on my definition of the word 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.870
 Survive together for me personally 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.449
 survival means survival without 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.750
 any tools only with the things 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.900
 that one wears on the body that means one 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.440
 unexpectedly comes into an emergency situation 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.030
 and then tries to punch through 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.729
 it is then a normal case then 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.920
 no daypack available 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.830
 would be perfectly equipped for this 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.090
 situation to survive 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.250
 on the other hand gives his daypack 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.870
 or such emergency equipment of course 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.660
 also a certain delight 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.790
 I think that's what each of us already has 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.380
 he made his backpack 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.790
 has stuffed with all sorts 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.060
 things you might need 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.670
 could if it were times as far as the making 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.980
 yes also a huge fun 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.540
 but now it is guaranteed that you 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.660
 the backpack does not have it if you 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.240
 actually gets into an emergency situation 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.640
 the same is true for a etc 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.230
 even if it means I'm mine 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.860
 for sure 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.460
 just when you need it 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.490
 you do not have it for what it is 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.740
 a daypack actually a good one 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.070
 daypack is therefore only for 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.470
 planned trips with a survival so one 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.530
 of course, emergency has nothing to do 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.680
 but rather with camping 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.160
 but that fits the title of my series 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.050
 doubt camping so and now i show 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.220
 what do I usually mean to mine 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.220
 take excursions 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.580
 this is my maximum equipment 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.090
 more so that is not guaranteed with 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.550
 the less but now to the individual 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.410
 I would like to start with 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.150
 I love my seat backpack 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.310
 everything because I always have a clean one 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.739
 seated by the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.840
 wearing frame here he wears himself 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.930
 but not so comfortable and 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.060
 weighs at least one and a half kilo with it 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.190
 I always have my bum bag in 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.540
 The smaller objects I am 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.980
 always wants to have it at hand 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.590
 for example my knife or my mobile phone 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.910
 besides, I always have trash bags with me 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.250
 it is natural for the original 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.650
 secondly, as additional 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.780
 transport container for objects but 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.209
 also for water or too 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.620
 collect rainwater if you can 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.350
 cuts apart in a plane 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.790
 forms or seal a shell 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.489
 if that still has a hole in the roof 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.420
 or as a glove if for example 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:34.690
 Burning collects with the partie 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.060
 toilet paper is not always only 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.860
 for the original purpose but also 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.660
 to clean my equipment for 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.760
 for example the cookware or my 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.320
 knife is also suitable 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.170
 excellent as a detonator 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.680
 if you detach a layer of it sturdy 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.109
 fuze 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.540
 we come to fire because I take my 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.900
 normal lighter with with 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.549
 flint 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.439
 I do not have to share that with the p 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.400
 they're always going to break me and 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.269
 additionally a spark steel 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.670
 I also always have a string 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:09.620
 with the one with me to the emergency a fire 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.060
 Making a bow could be considered as a knife 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.209
 I'm always my swiss knife that 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.980
 workcamp with it not only has a big one 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.130
 lockable blade but also one 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.530
 saw tweezers a can opener one 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.910
 scissors and everything else too 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.610
 I still find eerie with run 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.150
 practically in addition one more 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.180
 cutlery with because i fork and 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.800
 spoon would not like to give up 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.270
 It is also a replacement 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.380
 if the blade of mine 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.449
 Swiss knives for whatever reasons 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.960
 I should break it too 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.620
 Here's a sound to it 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.600
 drink 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.740
 I take a 0.5 liter bottle 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.020
 with tap water 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.630
 if it is foreseeable that this is too little 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.460
 that's a second one with me 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.889
 want to cook something for me, namely mine 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.660
 Bundeswehr cookware with food 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.470
 usually only very little 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.660
 or not at all 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.570
 and if so, it must be something small 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.539
 lightweight, energetic and durable 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.729
 be such as this mussliriegel 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:10.970
 to protect I transport see in 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.979
 a lockable plastic can I 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.460
 Also as a transport container for water 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.260
 could take 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.940
 my mobile phone is always with me 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.990
 this is my spare phone now because 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.050
 i just with my main 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.669
 mobile movies you can not only 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.409
 to make an emergency call but you can 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.010
 also the gps and navi functions 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.289
 use 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.639
 you can take pictures and videos and 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.880
 if i have videos i take it 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.380
 also mostly this little tripod with 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.699
 and I have my whole on it 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.370
 Planting books saved 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.260
 of course, everything offline just like that 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.590
 navi means I do not need any 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.330
 Internet connection goes to here 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.659
 my standard equipment which i 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.570
 Mostly everything has now 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:55.820
 Comes bonus for example man m 71 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.440
 Of course, that's a lot of stuff 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.030
 more practical than every time a whole 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.630
 to ignite campfire 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.240
 and, moreover, is less noticeable as well 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.320
 sometimes I have a little dynamo 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.060
 solar flashlight 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.220
 but I do not usually need 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.430
 because my phone has a strong video light 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.220
 next to it, as already mentioned, the second 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.820
 water bottle sometimes I take myself 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:24.240
 still a strong part with or just mine 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.770
 car better and occasionally I take 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.160
 me also my note sleeping bag with 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.150
 his sleeping bag 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.190
 when i'm not seated pressure 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:36.060
 says it sometimes has 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:38.390
 A few insulated seat cushions with that 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.390
 it already 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.210
 Let us now come to an important question 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.070
 that's what weighs the whole I have the 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.510
 complete equipment so the maximum 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:07:01.790
 equipment stuck in my backpack 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:02.470
 and look what weighs four and a half 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.400
 kilo 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.530
 if i only use the standard equipment 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.300
 take it three and a half kilo 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.100
 and if i place the seated backpacks 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.960
 just a normal substance pressure says 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:19.190
 it is two and a half kilo 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:22.700
 I think that's acceptable so that 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:25.430
 Thanks again for today 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.820
 watching sports and up to 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.820
 next time
