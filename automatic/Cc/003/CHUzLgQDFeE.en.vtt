some<00:00:07.230> arrows<00:00:07.799> really<00:00:08.189> fast<00:00:08.460> this<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.179> the

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
some arrows really fast this is the

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.940 
some arrows really fast this is the
tutorial<00:00:09.660> for<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.290> found<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.800> couple

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
tutorial for you I found a couple

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.820 
tutorial for you I found a couple
resources<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.759> are<00:00:11.880> really<00:00:12.269> cool<00:00:12.650> so<00:00:13.650> this

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
resources that are really cool so this

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.129 
resources that are really cool so this
one's<00:00:14.070> called<00:00:14.280> arrow<00:00:14.610> toolkit<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.540> it's<00:00:15.929> by

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
one's called arrow toolkit and it's by

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.439 
one's called arrow toolkit and it's by
oliver<00:00:16.740> Vogel<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.340> I'll<00:00:17.820> put<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> link<00:00:18.300> in

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
oliver Vogel and I'll put a link in

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.349 
oliver Vogel and I'll put a link in
there<00:00:18.770> this<00:00:19.770> one<00:00:20.070> actually<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.609> not<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.970> plugin

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
there this one actually is not a plugin

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.939 
there this one actually is not a plugin
it's<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.689> preset<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.230> if<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.680> go<00:00:22.800> ahead<00:00:22.859> and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
it's a preset so if you go ahead and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.660 
it's a preset so if you go ahead and
download<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.869> it<00:00:24.869> opens<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.560> as<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.890> c4d<00:00:26.490> so

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
download it it opens up as a c4d so

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.790 
download it it opens up as a c4d so
we'll<00:00:26.789> double<00:00:27.029> click<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:28.560> when<00:00:28.710> you

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
we'll double click that and when you

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.500 
we'll double click that and when you
open<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.250> doesn't<00:00:30.000> really<00:00:30.150> look<00:00:30.330> that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
open it doesn't really look that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.930 
open it doesn't really look that
impressive<00:00:30.630> or<00:00:31.199> much<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.949> an<00:00:32.099> arrow<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
impressive or much like an arrow the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.290 
impressive or much like an arrow the
reason<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.410> need<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.890> spline<00:00:35.430> to

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
reason is you need to have a spline to

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.119 
reason is you need to have a spline to
wrap<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.719> around<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.410> make<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> circle

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
wrap it around so if we make a circle

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.990 
wrap it around so if we make a circle
spline<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:39.690> level<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.800> out<00:00:41.040> make<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.460> 90

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
spline and level that out make it 90

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.420 
spline and level that out make it 90
scale<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.620> right<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.040> spline

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
scale it up all right this is the spline

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.250 
scale it up all right this is the spline
we're<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> use<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> arrow<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.170> if

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
we're going to use for the arrow so if

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.229 
we're going to use for the arrow so if
we<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.590> into<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> arrow<00:00:47.070> tool<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.969> tab

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
we go into the arrow tool in the tab

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.450 
we go into the arrow tool in the tab
called<00:00:48.539> user<00:00:48.840> data<00:00:49.200> there's<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> spline<00:00:50.160> field

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
called user data there's a spline field

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
called user data there's a spline field
so<00:00:50.730> we'll<00:00:50.879> drag<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.360> circle<00:00:51.809> spine<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.289> there

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
so we'll drag that circle spine in there

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.680 
so we'll drag that circle spine in there
and<00:00:52.680> now<00:00:53.430> we're<00:00:53.670> talking<00:00:53.850> now<00:00:54.239> we're<00:00:54.420> getting

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
and now we're talking now we're getting

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.830 
and now we're talking now we're getting
that<00:00:54.809> sweet<00:00:55.170> arrow<00:00:55.559> alright<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:57.300> got<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> lot

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that sweet arrow alright you got a lot

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.299 
that sweet arrow alright you got a lot
of<00:00:58.079> options<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:58.770> I'll<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:58.920> run<00:00:59.280> over

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
of options in here I'll just run over

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.479 
of options in here I'll just run over
them<00:00:59.609> real<00:00:59.730> quick<00:01:00.000> got<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.870> offset<00:01:01.489> your

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
them real quick got your offset your

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.969 
them real quick got your offset your
length<00:01:02.879> offset<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.470> even<00:01:04.589> change<00:01:04.860> your

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
length offset you can even change your

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.770 
length offset you can even change your
mesh<00:01:05.369> subdivisions<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.510> which<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
mesh subdivisions in here which is

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.380 
mesh subdivisions in here which is
really<00:01:06.990> cool<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.220> banking<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:09.180> some

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
really cool and the banking get some

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.899 
really cool and the banking get some
rotation<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:09.990> there<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.439> then<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> arrow

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
rotation on there and then on the arrow

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.450 
rotation on there and then on the arrow
base<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.659> actually<00:01:12.990> change<00:01:13.409> kind<00:01:14.400> of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
base you can actually change kind of

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.560 
base you can actually change kind of
extrusion<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.390> arrow<00:01:15.720> height<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:17.570> scaling

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
extrusion with arrow height and scaling

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.999 
extrusion with arrow height and scaling
of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> ends<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.650> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> have

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
of the ends so that you can kind of have

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.830 
of the ends so that you can kind of have
it<00:01:20.100> go<00:01:20.220> down<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.820> tail<00:01:21.180> which<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
it go down to a little tail which is

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.890 
it go down to a little tail which is
kind<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> cool<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:23.430> then<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> head<00:01:24.360> position

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
kind of cool and then the head position

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.550 
kind of cool and then the head position
is<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.640> kind<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.909> modify<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.630> arrow<00:01:28.140> head

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
is you can kind of modify the arrow head

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.640 
is you can kind of modify the arrow head
right<00:01:29.060> there's<00:01:30.060> quite<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> bit<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.619> oh

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
right there's quite a bit of you know oh

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.080 
right there's quite a bit of you know oh
I<00:01:31.770> guess<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.280> rotate<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.610> too<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:32.970> is

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
I guess you can rotate it too which is

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.240 
I guess you can rotate it too which is
pretty<00:01:33.299> cool<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.619> arrow<00:01:34.890> tool

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
pretty cool that is the arrow tool

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030 
pretty cool that is the arrow tool
pretty<00:01:36.030> cool<00:01:36.210> pretty<00:01:36.509> customizable<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
pretty cool pretty customizable the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.300 
pretty cool pretty customizable the
other<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.490> I'm<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> show<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.090> is

actually a plug-in and that one is
called<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.140> arrow<00:01:43.320> maker<00:01:43.619> by<00:01:43.860> micro<00:01:44.369> bian<00:01:44.579> and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
called the arrow maker by micro bian and

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.819 
called the arrow maker by micro bian and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
customizations you can do on that pretty

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.970 
customizations you can do on that pretty
sweet<00:02:17.200> stuff<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.890> then<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.060> tail<00:02:19.390> width<00:02:20.020> tail

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.850 
sweet stuff and then the tail width tail
height<00:02:21.390> tail<00:02:22.390> indentation<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.380> mean<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.680> is

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
height tail indentation I mean this is

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.320 
height tail indentation I mean this is
ridiculous<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.400> guy<00:02:24.760> has<00:02:24.940> thought<00:02:25.150> of

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
ridiculous this guy has thought of

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.930 
ridiculous this guy has thought of
everything<00:02:25.540> right<00:02:26.140> can<00:02:26.920> change<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.430> tapering

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
everything right can change the tapering

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.790 
everything right can change the tapering
alright<00:02:28.750> that's<00:02:28.900> pretty<00:02:29.110> cool<00:02:29.290> but<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.590> even

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
alright that's pretty cool but the even

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.250 
alright that's pretty cool but the even
cooler<00:02:30.100> part<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.490> automation<00:02:31.300> right<00:02:31.510> if<00:02:32.110> you

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
cooler part is automation right if you

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.800 
cooler part is automation right if you
go<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.590> automation<00:02:32.980> tab<00:02:33.600> through<00:02:34.600> user

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
go to the automation tab through user

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.800 
go to the automation tab through user
data<00:02:35.110> he<00:02:35.320> set<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.710> up<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.130> there<00:02:36.490> are<00:02:36.810> just

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
data he set it up so that there are just

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.630 
data he set it up so that there are just
one<00:02:38.230> button<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.680> click<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.310> will<00:02:39.400> perform

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
one button to click and it will perform

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.460 
one button to click and it will perform
a<00:02:39.940> function<00:02:40.300> for<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.600> so<00:02:40.810> if<00:02:40.930> we<00:02:41.050> want<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.320> put

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
a function for you so if we want to put

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.680 
a function for you so if we want to put
it<00:02:41.560> in<00:02:41.650> extrude<00:02:42.130> NURBS<00:02:42.160> boom<00:02:42.820> instantly<00:02:43.480> it's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
it in extrude NURBS boom instantly it's

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.720 
it in extrude NURBS boom instantly it's
an<00:02:43.750> extrude<00:02:44.080> NURBS<00:02:44.110> fill<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.800> cap<00:02:45.100> just<00:02:45.520> check

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
an extrude NURBS fill a cap just check

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.630 
an extrude NURBS fill a cap just check
that<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.890> if<00:02:47.890> we<00:02:48.010> want<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.220> add<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.490> to<00:02:48.520> a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
that on if we want to add it to a

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.430 
that on if we want to add it to a
mograph<00:02:49.000> cloner<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.600> just<00:02:49.780> click<00:02:50.020> there<00:02:50.290> and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
mograph cloner you just click there and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.370 
mograph cloner you just click there and
it<00:02:50.680> dumps<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.070> in<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> cloner<00:02:51.430> for<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:53.170> then

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
it dumps it in a cloner for you and then

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.590 
it dumps it in a cloner for you and then
add<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.710> spline<00:02:54.220> wrap<00:02:54.490> deform<00:02:55.000> which<00:02:55.240> is<00:02:55.390> pretty

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
add a spline wrap deform which is pretty

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.020 
add a spline wrap deform which is pretty
cool<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.080> we'll<00:02:56.200> do<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.440> same<00:02:56.620> thing<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.700> make

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
cool so we'll do the same thing but make

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.150 
cool so we'll do the same thing but make
a<00:02:58.060> circle<00:02:58.750> spline<00:03:00.060> scale<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.300> up<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:02.160> go

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
a circle spline scale that up and go

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.940 
a circle spline scale that up and go
back<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.580> our<00:03:04.470> let's<00:03:05.470> go<00:03:05.560> back<00:03:05.770> to<00:03:05.890> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
back to our let's go back to the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.480 
back to our let's go back to the
arrow-maker

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
arrow-maker

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.050 
arrow-maker
and<00:03:06.640> then<00:03:07.030> we'll<00:03:07.210> drag<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.750> spline<00:03:08.640> into<00:03:09.640> the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
and then we'll drag that spline into the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.240 
and then we'll drag that spline into the
spline<00:03:10.300> field<00:03:10.540> see<00:03:10.930> what<00:03:11.050> happens<00:03:11.350> nothing<00:03:12.130> at

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
spline field see what happens nothing at

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.770 
spline field see what happens nothing at
first<00:03:12.520> because<00:03:12.700> we<00:03:12.880> have<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.120> click<00:03:13.570> the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
first because we have to click the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.980 
first because we have to click the
button<00:03:14.140> here<00:03:14.170> we<00:03:14.500> go<00:03:14.740> boom<00:03:15.580> there<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.120> stuck

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
button here we go boom there it is stuck

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.260 
button here we go boom there it is stuck
along<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.470> spline<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:18.100> what<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.730> does<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:19.090> it

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
along the spline and what it does is it

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.530 
along the spline and what it does is it
actually<00:03:19.480> dumps<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.620> into<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:20.950> spline<00:03:21.370> wrap<00:03:21.580> so

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
actually dumps it into a spline wrap so

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.850 
actually dumps it into a spline wrap so
on<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.750> spline<00:03:23.020> wrap<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.380> know<00:03:23.500> we<00:03:23.650> can

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
on the spline wrap you know we can

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.300 
on the spline wrap you know we can
change<00:03:24.580> our<00:03:24.730> offset<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.210> what<00:03:25.300> not<00:03:26.010> yeah<00:03:27.010> so

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
change our offset and what not yeah so

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.220 
change our offset and what not yeah so
this<00:03:27.700> one<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.180> actually<00:03:28.570> really<00:03:28.840> impressive

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
this one is actually really impressive

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.890 
this one is actually really impressive
to<00:03:29.500> me<00:03:29.620> he's<00:03:30.310> got<00:03:30.550> a<00:03:30.580> lot<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:30.940> options<00:03:31.540> on<00:03:31.750> how

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
to me he's got a lot of options on how

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.560 
to me he's got a lot of options on how
to<00:03:31.930> customize<00:03:32.230> stuff<00:03:32.770> really<00:03:33.460> cool<00:03:33.790> stuff<00:03:34.060> so
