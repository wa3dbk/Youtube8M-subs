 decided to introduce you to my products 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.500
 favorites with which I realize my 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.690
 master vanilla and therefore 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.790

 which allows me to have a twister 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.880
 today I have a twist or so like 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.490
 I make a movie with the webcam is that the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.390
 year but there was not given top I 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.270
 do not know if it's actually my property 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.300
 see the definition but loops but 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.340
 I wanted to introduce it's my top 3 my 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.440
 top three actually wanted presented by 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.640
 order of preference so the first 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.680
 product that can be used to 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.540
 make your vanilla havrin from the gold stock 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.340
 defined only expensive it's more 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.649
 practice it's shea butter me 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.360
 I do not use in the form of construction site 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.280
 shea but could use butter 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.820
 pure shea will be exactly the same 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.010
 result 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.489
 so my judicial shea 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.280
 presented in my video in English you 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.040
 I present my routine and my advice 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.040
 to have the hair all 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.370
 flexible So here like me stand 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.500
 derek a little hair in front of me 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.380
 filming you in a few days a few 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.120
 effective cosmetic recipes and 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.130
 simple and among these recipes 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.530
 he will have how to achieve a nice of 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.619
 shea butter in the second place you have the log 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.240
 scorer from home cross of author so it's 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.010
 a butter that I like a lot 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.840
 whenever I actually make you 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.240
 that I present you a product I 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.119
 will put pictures of the definition that 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.490
 I get with his products so he has 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.649
 really an impeccable composition does not 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.660
 the no parabens no oil at 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.570
 home no mineral oil is not there from 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.970
 color activities german le 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.280
 composition and to show clean in 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.800
 but the downside that I find is 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.110
 its price is rather expensive 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.759
 like that it's a butter and the colors 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.550
 yellow and 1 is really we can 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.470
 get beautiful definition of curls 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.300
 it's really at Beijing and in addition a bar 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.530
 so take the time it rivals us 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.450
 shocked that's the interest is 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.820
 overrepresented products that I 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.040
 prefers among all these talents acted of a 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.650
 cutter and so who maintains the laws 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.630
 that twists is done naturally 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.030
 firing the roads the salt blinds and the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.440
 natural movements the door there from 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.049
 hydration and shine 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.610
 it sets in shape is there and that the 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.680
 underlines the natural movement of 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.080
 loops and I would say in addition that he does not 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.800
 leaves absolutely no residue thereof 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.200
 flagship product 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.360
 to define but good two define barrels 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.920
 28 start and when I actually use it 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.970
 you speak 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.670
 my hair is also moisturizing and 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.160
 the sous when I undo the vanilla 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.600
 and I noticed towards this product there 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.030
 when I make a vanilla with his 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.740
 products if I undo the ten vanilla 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.410
 minutes later I already have my son hue 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.420
 was over it's the definition takes 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.830
 very quickly so it's my top 3 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.950
 are the products that I use for 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.810
 close vanilla i wanted to come back if 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.760
 you are looking for if you come to his senses 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.620
 economic effective even you to see that 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.030
 that rather successful today is the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.110
 shea butter otherwise you have it 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.130
 others and for people who have 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.350
 thicker hair I had to 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.260
 use in the past but I do not 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.420
 used it more because it does not give 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.140
 definition really perfect for me 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.050
 that I have fine hair except the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.350
 range for hair and loses that will be the 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.730
