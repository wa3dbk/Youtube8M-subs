I I personally feel that it makes it
feel<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.370> little<00:02:15.550> more<00:02:15.670> solid<00:02:17.159> my<00:02:18.159> girl<00:02:18.370> says<00:02:18.580> it

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
feel a little more solid my girl says it

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.050 
feel a little more solid my girl says it
added<00:02:19.120> extra<00:02:19.720> size<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:21.010> girth<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:21.640> which<00:02:21.849> I

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
added extra size and girth to it which I

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.649 
added extra size and girth to it which I
don't<00:02:22.180> feel<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:22.900> my<00:02:22.989> hand<00:02:23.230> at<00:02:23.470> all<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.540> me

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
don't feel in my hand at all so to me

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.210 
don't feel in my hand at all so to me
it's<00:02:25.810> fun<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:28.680> don't<00:02:29.680> know<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:29.830> seems<00:02:29.860> this

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
it's fun and I don't know it seems this

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.920 
it's fun and I don't know it seems this
seems<00:02:30.489> pretty<00:02:30.549> good<00:02:30.910> if<00:02:31.599> I<00:02:31.720> had<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.900> choose

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
seems pretty good if I had to choose

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.570 
seems pretty good if I had to choose
between<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.830> otterbox<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.459> would

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
between this and the otterbox I would

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.550 
between this and the otterbox I would
probably<00:02:33.670> choose<00:02:33.970> this<00:02:34.209> one<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:35.140> one<00:02:35.379> that

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
probably choose this one this one that

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.190 
probably choose this one this one that
is<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:36.129> little<00:02:36.549> more<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.209> rubber<00:02:37.480> finish<00:02:37.989> on

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
is a little more of a rubber finish on

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.500 
is a little more of a rubber finish on
the<00:02:38.290> back<00:02:38.640> compared<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.819> outer<00:02:40.000> box<00:02:40.269> which

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
the back compared to the outer box which

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.300 
the back compared to the outer box which
has<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:41.049> real<00:02:41.650> slippery<00:02:42.220> back<00:02:43.260> which<00:02:44.260> just<00:02:44.620> if

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
has the real slippery back which just if

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.710 
has the real slippery back which just if
they're<00:02:45.549> like<00:02:45.670> driving<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.329> you<00:02:46.390> put<00:02:46.569> it<00:02:46.599> down

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
they're like driving and you put it down

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.960 
they're like driving and you put it down
on<00:02:46.870> your<00:02:47.170> dash<00:02:47.349> real<00:02:47.680> quick<00:02:47.920> those<00:02:48.400> slide<00:02:48.760> all

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
on your dash real quick those slide all

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.789 
on your dash real quick those slide all
over<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.269> place<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:50.079> one<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.319> feel<00:02:50.620> it

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
over the place this one I feel it

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.150 
over the place this one I feel it
actually<00:02:51.220> was<00:02:52.150> staying<00:02:52.599> in<00:02:52.870> place<00:02:53.260> at<00:02:53.590> least<00:02:53.769> a

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
actually was staying in place at least a

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.589 
actually was staying in place at least a
little<00:02:55.030> longer<00:02:55.390> than<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.319> outer<00:02:56.500> box<00:02:56.799> would

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
little longer than the outer box would

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.920 
little longer than the outer box would
so<00:02:58.829> that's<00:02:59.829> my<00:03:00.540> review<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.220> look<00:03:03.220> at<00:03:03.430> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
so that's my review and look at the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.630 
so that's my review and look at the
seidio<00:03:04.930> active<00:03:04.989> case<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.340> ultimate

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
seidio active case and the ultimate

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.559 
seidio active case and the ultimate
screen<00:03:07.299> guard<00:03:07.569> from<00:03:07.720> CDO<00:03:08.049> which<00:03:08.940> if<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.329> was

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
screen guard from CDO which if I was

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.170 
screen guard from CDO which if I was
somebody<00:03:11.160> if<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.250> was<00:03:12.430> looking<00:03:12.760> for<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:12.970> screen

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
somebody if I was looking for a screen

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.780 
somebody if I was looking for a screen
guard<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.629> would<00:03:14.349> look<00:03:14.560> at<00:03:15.099> another<00:03:15.459> type

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
guard I would look at another type

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.729 
guard I would look at another type
because<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.269> CD<00:03:16.510> 01<00:03:16.660> seemed<00:03:17.169> sort<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.530> crappy

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
because the CD 01 seemed sort of crappy

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.120 
because the CD 01 seemed sort of crappy
to<00:03:17.950> me<00:03:18.480> maybe<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.690> SPG<00:03:20.260> screen<00:03:20.680> guards<00:03:21.040> are

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
to me maybe the SPG screen guards are

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.860 
to me maybe the SPG screen guards are
better<00:03:21.310> if<00:03:21.459> they'd<00:03:21.609> seen<00:03:21.669> better<00:03:22.030> alright

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
better if they'd seen better alright

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.160 
better if they'd seen better alright
thanks<00:03:23.410> for<00:03:23.500> watching<00:03:23.769> lid
