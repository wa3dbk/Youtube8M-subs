00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
my new LED arrays that i got for

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.839 
my new LED arrays that i got for
creating<00:00:22.150> end<00:00:22.390> of<00:00:22.540> train<00:00:22.810> devices<00:00:23.380> and<00:00:23.849> flesh

well<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:55.270> red<00:00:55.660> loop<00:00:55.899> festoon<00:00:56.469> dome<00:00:56.800> array<00:00:57.340> is

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
well this red loop festoon dome array is

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.540 
well this red loop festoon dome array is
quite<00:00:58.420> bright<00:00:58.719> and<00:00:59.289> it's<00:00:59.680> actually<00:00:59.829> also<00:01:00.219> very

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
quite bright and it's actually also very

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.029 
quite bright and it's actually also very
small<00:01:00.879> so<00:01:01.360> it<00:01:02.110> would<00:01:02.260> work<00:01:02.379> really<00:01:02.559> good<00:01:02.829> for

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
small so it would work really good for

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.859 
small so it would work really good for
those<00:01:03.190> guys<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:03.760> are<00:01:03.850> building<00:01:04.030> end<00:01:04.720> of

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
those guys that are building end of

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.310 
those guys that are building end of
train<00:01:05.080> devices<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.649> they<00:01:05.710> only<00:01:05.860> want<00:01:06.130> one

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
train devices and they only want one

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.490

small<00:01:08.320> window<00:01:09.600> these<00:01:10.600> leds<00:01:11.080> are<00:01:11.259> all<00:01:12.000> flat<00:01:13.000> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
small window these leds are all flat and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.600 
small window these leds are all flat and
they<00:01:14.500> don't<00:01:14.619> look<00:01:14.830> like<00:01:14.890> leds<00:01:15.369> when<00:01:15.520> they're

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
they don't look like leds when they're

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.870 
they don't look like leds when they're
off<00:01:15.760> they<00:01:16.090> are<00:01:16.650> clear<00:01:17.650> or<00:01:17.860> white<00:01:17.920> colored<00:01:18.670> when

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
off they are clear or white colored when

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.450 
off they are clear or white colored when
they're<00:01:19.000> off<00:01:19.150> and<00:01:19.920> again<00:01:20.920> i'm<00:01:21.100> just<00:01:21.280> showing

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
they're off and again i'm just showing

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.690 
they're off and again i'm just showing
that<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:23.140> know<00:01:23.260> with<00:01:23.439> any<00:01:23.560> size<00:01:24.159> array<00:01:24.640> you

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
that you know with any size array you

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.780 
that you know with any size array you
can<00:01:24.880> make<00:01:25.210> it<00:01:25.360> flash<00:01:25.689> different<00:01:26.110> patterns

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
can make it flash different patterns

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.649 
can make it flash different patterns
this<00:01:27.790> is<00:01:27.939> a<00:01:27.970> 25<00:01:28.930> loop<00:01:29.530> array<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.509> excuse<00:01:31.509> me<00:01:31.630> a

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
this is a 25 loop array and excuse me a

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.890 
this is a 25 loop array and excuse me a
25<00:01:31.960> LED<00:01:32.409> array<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.520> it's<00:01:34.390> actually<00:01:34.689> kind<00:01:34.869> of

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
25 LED array and it's actually kind of

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.950 
25 LED array and it's actually kind of
big<00:01:35.049> it's<00:01:35.259> about<00:01:35.439> one<00:01:35.650> inch<00:01:35.830> by<00:01:36.040> one<00:01:36.070> inch<00:01:36.960> so

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
big it's about one inch by one inch so

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.749 
big it's about one inch by one inch so
it's<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.320> little<00:01:38.470> bit<00:01:38.560> big<00:01:38.799> but<00:01:38.829> for<00:01:39.579> those<00:01:39.700> that

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
it's a little bit big but for those that

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.970 
it's a little bit big but for those that
want<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.420> lot<00:01:40.720> of<00:01:40.750> light<00:01:41.049> that<00:01:41.680> will<00:01:41.829> work

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
want a lot of light that will work

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.220 
want a lot of light that will work
I<00:01:43.040> found<00:01:44.030> these<00:01:44.120> really<00:01:44.270> cool<00:01:44.600> bulbs<00:01:45.050> they're

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
I found these really cool bulbs they're

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:52.270 
I found these really cool bulbs they're
called<00:01:46.390> Oh<00:01:48.820> Sidewinders<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:51.380> thought

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
called Oh Sidewinders and I thought

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.130 
called Oh Sidewinders and I thought
those<00:01:52.460> were<00:01:52.580> kind<00:01:52.790> of<00:01:52.880> neat<00:01:53.060> because<00:01:53.360> those

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
those were kind of neat because those

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.040 
those were kind of neat because those
would<00:01:54.290> look<00:01:54.320> good<00:01:54.560> for<00:01:54.830> like<00:01:55.190> cab<00:01:55.490> beacons<00:01:56.050> the

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
would look good for like cab beacons the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.290 
would look good for like cab beacons the
particular<00:01:57.530> flash<00:01:58.040> module<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:58.580> I<00:01:58.700> have<00:01:58.880> can

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
particular flash module that I have can

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.170 
particular flash module that I have can
alternate<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.170> strobes<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:01.000> it<00:02:02.000> looks

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
alternate the strobes and it looks

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.610 
alternate the strobes and it looks
really<00:02:02.390> neat<00:02:02.660> I<00:02:02.870> don't<00:02:03.110> have<00:02:03.230> it<00:02:03.320> hooked<00:02:03.380> up

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
really neat I don't have it hooked up

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.650 
really neat I don't have it hooked up
but<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:03.920> don't<00:02:04.040> have<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.190> picture<00:02:04.370> of<00:02:04.550> it<00:02:04.700> but<00:02:04.910> it

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
but I don't have a picture of it but it

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.550 
but I don't have a picture of it but it
looks<00:02:05.840> really<00:02:05.990> neat<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.290> have<00:02:06.380> those

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
looks really neat to have those

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.810 
looks really neat to have those
alternating<00:02:06.980> so<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:07.310> have<00:02:07.430> like<00:02:07.580> two<00:02:07.640> of

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
alternating so you have like two of

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.120 
alternating so you have like two of
those<00:02:07.970> on<00:02:08.180> top<00:02:08.210> of<00:02:08.480> a<00:02:08.540> cab<00:02:08.780> roof<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.380> have<00:02:09.920> them

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
those on top of a cab roof and have them

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.060 
those on top of a cab roof and have them
alternating<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:11.230> anyway<00:02:12.230> well<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:12.710> just<00:02:12.890> wanted

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
alternating so anyway well I just wanted

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.200 
alternating so anyway well I just wanted
to<00:02:13.130> share<00:02:13.250> these<00:02:13.400> with<00:02:13.460> you<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.880> kind<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.060> give

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
to share these with you and kind of give

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.300 
to share these with you and kind of give
you<00:02:14.300> an<00:02:14.330> idea<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.720> some<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.800> projects<00:02:16.220> that

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
you an idea of some of the projects that

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.400 
you an idea of some of the projects that
I'm<00:02:16.460> working<00:02:16.490> on<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.210> they<00:02:18.140> might<00:02:18.290> work

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
I'm working on and they might work

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.020
