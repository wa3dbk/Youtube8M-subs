00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
and I believe you can join her covenant

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.950 
and I believe you can join her covenant
I'm<00:05:23.310> not<00:05:23.610> too<00:05:23.760> sure<00:05:23.940> how<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.150> covenants<00:05:24.690> work

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
I'm not too sure how the covenants work

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.920 
I'm not too sure how the covenants work
because<00:05:25.380> only<00:05:25.830> one<00:05:26.430> covenant<00:05:26.880> I<00:05:27.000> know<00:05:27.060> of<00:05:27.420> they

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
because only one covenant I know of they

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.540 
because only one covenant I know of they
actually<00:05:28.350> will<00:05:28.470> ask<00:05:28.680> you<00:05:28.950> do<00:05:29.160> you<00:05:29.310> want<00:05:29.490> to

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
actually will ask you do you want to

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.210 
actually will ask you do you want to
join<00:05:29.820> this<00:05:30.510> one<00:05:30.810> I<00:05:31.080> never<00:05:31.380> got<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.860> option

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
join this one I never got the option

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.400 
join this one I never got the option
like<00:05:32.400> do<00:05:32.760> you<00:05:32.880> want<00:05:33.090> to<00:05:33.180> join<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.660> think<00:05:34.260> you

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
like do you want to join I think you

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.080 
like do you want to join I think you
automatically<00:05:35.130> joint<00:05:35.520> when<00:05:35.730> you<00:05:35.820> do<00:05:35.970> the

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
automatically joint when you do the

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.630 
automatically joint when you do the
quest<00:05:36.360> though<00:05:36.630> so<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:37.920> Covenant<00:05:38.430> is<00:05:38.610> the

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
quest though so the Covenant is the

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.840 
quest though so the Covenant is the
hunter<00:05:39.270> of<00:05:39.540> hunters<00:05:40.140> and<00:05:40.530> I<00:05:41.310> believe<00:05:41.640> it's

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
hunter of hunters and I believe it's

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.340 
hunter of hunters and I believe it's
kind<00:05:42.060> of<00:05:42.120> like<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.360> blue<00:05:42.540> sentinels<00:05:43.050> at<00:05:43.200> least

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
kind of like the blue sentinels at least

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.280 
kind of like the blue sentinels at least
it<00:05:43.500> sounds<00:05:43.919> like<00:05:44.070> that<00:05:44.250> you<00:05:44.550> hunt<00:05:44.850> bad<00:05:45.690> hunters

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
it sounds like that you hunt bad hunters

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.200 
it sounds like that you hunt bad hunters
and<00:05:46.910> he<00:05:47.910> is<00:05:48.090> did<00:05:48.419> so<00:05:49.230> what<00:05:50.010> up<00:05:50.190> anyway<00:05:51.000> we're
