when<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.470> was<00:00:19.680> younger<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.189> wanted<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.580> be

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
when I was younger I really wanted to be

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.970 
when I was younger I really wanted to be
a<00:00:20.730> rhythmic<00:00:21.119> gymnast<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:21.779> then<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.050> grew<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> few

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
a rhythmic gymnast but then I grew a few

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.130 
a rhythmic gymnast but then I grew a few
inches<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.580> figured<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.359> was<00:00:24.960> no

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
inches and I figured that that was no

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.839 
inches and I figured that that was no
longer<00:00:25.380> going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.769> happen<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.430> then<00:00:26.519> as<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.820> got

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
longer going to happen and then as I got

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.089 
longer going to happen and then as I got
a<00:00:27.029> little<00:00:27.119> bit<00:00:27.449> older<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:28.109> actually<00:00:28.529> wanted<00:00:29.039> to

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
way I played that week and I kind of

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.420 
way I played that week and I kind of
carried<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.080> on<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> offseason<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.340> I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
carried that on to the offseason and I

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.220 
carried that on to the offseason and I
came<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.760> this<00:02:33.910> giant<00:02:34.120> open<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.900> ended<00:02:35.110> up

as<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.870> partner<00:02:50.910> next<00:02:51.910> I'd<00:02:52.030> probably<00:02:52.239> play<00:02:52.510> with

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
as a partner next I'd probably play with

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.210 
as a partner next I'd probably play with
Novak<00:02:53.110> just<00:02:53.440> because<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.709> would<00:02:53.769> be<00:02:53.920> really

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
Novak just because it would be really

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.370 
Novak just because it would be really
entertaining<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:55.840> know<00:02:55.959> we've<00:02:56.140> had<00:02:56.320> a

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
few skits between each other and that

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.890 
few skits between each other and that
would<00:02:58.510> just<00:02:58.720> make<00:02:59.380> for<00:02:59.650> pure<00:02:59.890> entertainment
