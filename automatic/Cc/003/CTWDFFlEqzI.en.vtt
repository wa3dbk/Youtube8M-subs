 compatible with this mixer for 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.500
 able to make our mixes because of 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.740
 that a computer is needed to 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.539

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.280
 mixer 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.790
 and this is the main thing that comes in the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.829
 box 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.000
 after seeing what has been the 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.000
 we are going to open it 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.790
 let's remove 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.860
 and the first thing we can see 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.540
 is the mixer we are going to first remove 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.920
 this cable that as they say the box is of 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.960
 2 meters and it is to connect the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.960
 mixer with the computer 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.590
 here comes what has been the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.840
 software 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.310
 was the computer installed and it's 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.769
 so that it can work quite well 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.180
 It's a mixer, although I've seen 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.519
 youtube that also works with the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.870
 virtual dj this program that if not what 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.970
 know I recommend it 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.040

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.040

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.040
 foundry 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.460

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.030
 protections so that it will not be damaged 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.030

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.590

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.610
 of what is being a laptop and therefore 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.910
 here are the different volumes for 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.980
