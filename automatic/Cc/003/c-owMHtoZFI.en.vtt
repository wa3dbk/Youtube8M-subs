00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
wear high up and use a lobster claw that

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.410 
wear high up and use a lobster claw that
was<00:02:19.160> too<00:02:19.370> loose<00:02:19.580> let's<00:02:19.910> do<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> little<00:02:20.270> tighter

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.699 

all<00:02:25.420> right<00:02:25.629> so<00:02:25.870> then<00:02:26.019> you<00:02:26.170> can<00:02:26.290> do<00:02:26.409> it<00:02:26.560> like

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
all right so then you can do it like

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.729 
all right so then you can do it like
this<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.280> have<00:02:27.819> something<00:02:28.090> dangling<00:02:28.659> down<00:02:29.080> or

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
this and have something dangling down or

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.229 
this and have something dangling down or
you<00:02:29.920> can<00:02:30.069> bring<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.370> back<00:02:30.489> cut<00:02:30.730> up<00:02:30.819> just<00:02:31.030> like

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
you can bring it back cut up just like

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.890 
you can bring it back cut up just like
before<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.430> like<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:33.659> so<00:02:34.659> there<00:02:34.810> is

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
before and have it like this so there is

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.670 
before and have it like this so there is
another<00:02:35.170> way<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.409> wear<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:37.230> now<00:02:38.230> another

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
another way to wear that now another

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.110 
another way to wear that now another

you're<00:03:06.849> not<00:03:06.940> going<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.180> put<00:03:07.329> it<00:03:07.420> through<00:03:07.450> a

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
you're not going to put it through a

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.770 
you're not going to put it through a
loop<00:03:07.930> but<00:03:08.409> you<00:03:08.560> just<00:03:08.940> go<00:03:09.940> like<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.299> you<00:03:10.540> rest

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
loop but you just go like this you rest

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.610 
loop but you just go like this you rest
it<00:03:10.989> inside<00:03:11.819> so<00:03:12.819> then<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.060> can<00:03:13.239> choose<00:03:13.540> if<00:03:14.260> you

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
wearing this just gives you another look

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.600 
wearing this just gives you another look
you<00:05:39.729> can<00:05:39.879> also<00:05:40.000> twist<00:05:40.449> another<00:05:41.610> another

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
you can also twist another another

you can also twist another another
necklace<00:05:42.909> in<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:43.449> to<00:05:43.569> create<00:05:43.930> a<00:05:43.960> chunkier

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
then once again

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.360 
then once again
you<00:05:49.150> can<00:05:49.270> always<00:05:49.419> take<00:05:49.750> an<00:05:49.900> enhancer<00:05:50.409> and<00:05:50.740> put

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
you can always take an enhancer and put

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.909 
you can always take an enhancer and put
it<00:05:51.460> on<00:05:51.750> and<00:05:52.750> find<00:05:53.110> whichever<00:05:53.620> way<00:05:54.009> that<00:05:54.659> it's

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
it on and find whichever way that it's

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.260 
it on and find whichever way that it's
twisted

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
twisted

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.070 
twisted
and<00:05:59.270> I<00:05:59.390> can't<00:05:59.630> see<00:05:59.900> him<00:05:59.990> here<00:06:01.540> it's<00:06:02.540> okay

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
and I can't see him here it's okay

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.230 
and I can't see him here it's okay
and<00:06:03.289> then<00:06:03.860> so<00:06:04.129> you<00:06:04.159> have<00:06:04.340> a<00:06:04.370> twisted<00:06:04.849> look<00:06:05.030> with

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
and then so you have a twisted look with

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.900 
and then so you have a twisted look with
an<00:06:05.360> enhancer
