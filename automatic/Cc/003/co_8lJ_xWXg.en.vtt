think it works well especially with

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.210 
think it works well especially with
Minecraft<00:01:37.140> concerning<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> main<00:01:37.799> character

Minecraft concerning the main character
for<00:01:38.369> Minecraft<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.909> didn't<00:01:39.119> know<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
for Minecraft if you didn't know the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.630 
for Minecraft if you didn't know the
default<00:01:39.689> skin<00:01:39.930> his<00:01:40.229> name<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.650> Steve<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
default skin his name is Steve so it

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.130 
default skin his name is Steve so it
works<00:01:41.820> really<00:01:41.939> well<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.869> I
