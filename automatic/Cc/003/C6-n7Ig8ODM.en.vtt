00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
way to the back and screw through that

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.589 
way to the back and screw through that
portion<00:01:39.819> directly<00:01:40.819> to<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.030> wolf<00:01:41.239> so<00:01:41.479> it's

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
portion directly to the wolf so it's

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:42.969 
portion directly to the wolf so it's
attached<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.229> then<00:01:42.259> I<00:01:42.380> would<00:01:42.560> just<00:01:42.709> hot<00:01:42.950> glue

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
a plywood rectangle and then you'd spray

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.309 
a plywood rectangle and then you'd spray
adhesive<00:01:49.520> some<00:01:50.090> foam<00:01:50.299> cover<00:01:50.989> that<00:01:51.200> with
