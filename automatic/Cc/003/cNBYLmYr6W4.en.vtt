00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.590 
dent is big enough it can actually
affect<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.290> LCD<00:00:34.920> check<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.059> bottom<00:00:36.450> make

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
affect the LCD check the bottom make

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.270 
affect the LCD check the bottom make
sure<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.899> not<00:00:37.050> too<00:00:37.350> bad<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.680> condition<00:00:37.800> you

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
sure it's not too bad of condition you

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000 
sure it's not too bad of condition you
also<00:00:39.210> want<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> take<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.809> look<00:00:40.079> at<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.379> serial

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
also want to take a look at that serial

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.979 
also want to take a look at that serial
number<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.610> make<00:00:41.850> sure<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.239> matches<00:00:42.480> up<00:00:42.750> with

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
number and make sure it matches up with

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.270 
number and make sure it matches up with
a<00:00:43.050> system<00:00:43.530> serial<00:00:43.950> number<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:45.829> not<00:00:46.829> you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
a system serial number if not you

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.470 
a system serial number if not you
probably<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> computer<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:48.360> been

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
probably have a computer that's been

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.290 
probably have a computer that's been
worked<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.079> which<00:00:49.860> makes<00:00:50.219> me<00:00:50.460> nervous<00:00:50.640> usually

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
computer specs so here we have a 2.5 3

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.939 
computer specs so here we have a 2.5 3
gigahertz<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.340> 4<00:00:59.550> gigs<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.910> ram<00:01:00.739> you<00:01:01.739> want<00:01:01.890> to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
gigahertz with 4 gigs of ram you want to

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.109 
gigahertz with 4 gigs of ram you want to
go<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> system<00:01:02.609> report<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:04.939> always<00:01:05.939> like

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
go to system report then I always like

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
go to system report then I always like
checking<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.600> power<00:01:06.810> see<00:01:07.650> how<00:01:07.710> many<00:01:07.890> battery

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
checking the power see how many battery

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.520 
checking the power see how many battery
cycles<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> computer<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:12.320> make<00:01:13.320> sure

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
cycles are on the computer and make sure

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.539 
cycles are on the computer and make sure
it's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> normal<00:01:14.220> condition<00:01:15.500> if<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:17.340> buy<00:01:17.520> a
