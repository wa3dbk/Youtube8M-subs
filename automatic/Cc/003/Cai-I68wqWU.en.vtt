00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
trouble this is the curling iron that I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.250 
trouble this is the curling iron that I
use<00:02:12.360> them<00:02:12.660> without<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260

use them without the
clam<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:15.120> believe<00:02:15.599> this<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.870> like<00:02:16.019> an<00:02:16.739> inch
