 hi how about you guys and girls from youtube 

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:09.340
 today I bring you here a new 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.459
 as we would say a decoration or a 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.490
 Effect tutorial ovens 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.980
 smart and how they heard ovens 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.920
 smart and good let's see what it is 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.210
 what they do these are the smart ones 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.210
 let's put here others 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.350
 ok well this is the type one that what 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.590
 you do 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.980
 go up then that this town that we have 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.130
 Market Stall 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.220
 that goes up so that it activates when 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.590
 we are burning something and so 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.059
 can see is a good effect on this 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.059
 now let's see what these do 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.010
 very well 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.770
 what you can see this activates the globe 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.580
 and also very good 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.180
 it looks excellent very very good and while 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.250
 this matter 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.580
 cut the video so that we do not get 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.850
 very long ok already finished burning alone 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.170
 we give here the button and it returns to its 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.140
 normality and here the same 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.560
 okay 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.149
 now what we are going to do 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.799
 how to create it so let's go to it okay 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.720
 friends now let's catch what 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.720
 we need what will be 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:42.970
 reston a torch these repeaters 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.300
 one the little button 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.340
 1 or 2 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.560
 the kind of material we want that 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.210
 leave when you start to burn 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.520
 the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.720
 there's coal so I'll put it this time 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.510
 green 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.770
 and the covers of those who want me 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.220
 I will put them 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.000
 it's a floor 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.490
 red and I'll use some crystal for the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.890
 Type 1 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.240
 ok so let's put our ovens 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.830
 here 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.830
 and we are going to cover them 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:29.370
 here one here and now I have to 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.319
 use a slab that we use them 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.450
 we know less with this 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.379
 well there's no other touched to use 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.650
 wood although it remains but it does not matter anymore 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.190
 is 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.210
 for your design 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.530
 there it is does not look so bad either and 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:53.239
 now let's put here crystal 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.240
 to give it a more elegant touch 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:01.660
 and we put 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:04.950
 rp sticky pistons 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.740
 we look at each other looking up 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.650
 this and we put the material this 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.890
 now we put here 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:21.330
 3 remove the middle one 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.330
 and we put the sand 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.940
 there is 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.260
 now here we are going to put 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.970
 a torch 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.830
 here a repeater 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.830
 and the button here 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.580
 let's put to burn something to see 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.580
 I have nothing to put here 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.470
 because something is missing 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:04.110
 missing speakers here and now 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.110
 it works 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.020
 okay 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.840
 and here the same thing we're going to put to burn 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.390
 it has taken everything 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.970
 but what 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.750
 ok let's finish the type 1 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:32.500
 and here it went up and to restore we're just going 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.230
 and to vote ok now we go with type 2 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.650
 ok for the guy we're going to need the 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:42.340
 furnaces the coal obviously to burn 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.510
 to verify that the rest works 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.510
 the torch 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:53.009
 the lamps of the rest 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.580
 what else 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:58.580
 the cover we are going to put brown wool 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:05.999
 and from this to see ok 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:08.590
 we put the two ovens to be separated and 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:13.390
 separated there are 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:16.870
 and we put the wool in the middle and there is or the 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.020
 material that we have chosen to create 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.000
 this is there 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.920
 now we leave space here for the 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.430
 lamps 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.430
 very good very well 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.550
 ok it looks very nice and we are going to catch 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.780
 repeaters 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:42.720
 it's pistons but yes 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:46.470
 the sticky the one that is not sticky 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:50.420
 ok sorry if I mess up a lot and now 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.420
 we need sand 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.580
 and we continue putting the material of this 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.580
 shape 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:04.350
 so now we put you here and tanger 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.529
 of the half we put the chaca high 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.219
 now they are here 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:09.219
 very well 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:15.630

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.470
 button here 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.810
 okay 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.270
 and with this we turn it off and when 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.230
 let's go burn 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:31.350
 In the things 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.800
 good but I'm 100% sure it's going to 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.800
 function 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:45.230
