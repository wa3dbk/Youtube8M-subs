00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.099
 good evening the channel audience plus one 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.670
 see what we have here a good manicardi 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.380
 going from one side to the other 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.389
 completely autonomous people look at it 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.660
 There's nothing inside him I can prove. 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.350
 for you and enough bullshit with the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.930
 engine is a galera to the one here is a 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.359
 system of transporting items with 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.349
 some system differences that I made 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.179
 previously 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.160
 let's see in action that it is easier to 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.690
 Let's talk, let's put three 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.600
 tomorrow's blocks and enterprise 3g 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.000
 three blocks of gold and we will see the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.530
 cart has captured the items to it goes 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.690
 pass the ball to each other here what 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.170
 It's down here, passed the items to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.510
 he 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.500
 carts for the other cart back in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.719
 his place 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.620
 now this one has reached its destination 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.719
 Last 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.090
 He delivers the items and returns to the house. 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.149
 of it then the first difference that 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.370
 you notice is that the system is no longer 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.809
 occurring continuously are some 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.070
 systems is useful what the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.930
 car behavior and running 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.850
 continuously but if this is not the case you 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.119
 can adopt this new system that I did 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.840
 here we basically see in action 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.020
 again it will only work on demand 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.619
 He will always stay, come on. 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.479
 put some items here and this is the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.299
 charging system is not enough to charge a 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.840
 cart when you load it and send it 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.400
 this is a system that loads 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.229
 in fact, it unloads a cart to the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.590
 same time charging another then you 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.210
 can mix the two systems not only the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.790
 two systems are of load that I 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.030
 I showed discharge school and one of 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.670
 load that this one is here mixed in 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.710
 system is sometimes half way through the already delivered 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.710
 It's kind of hard to see, so let's go 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.140
 see them separated here 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.479
 this is the discharge system o 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.790
 cart will stop here and will play the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.630
 skepticism break this will activate this 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.420
 buyer 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.520
 This is not going to cause a father here. 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.369
 because if they are being fed 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.290
 by the torch and when it connects him here 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.080
 already fed so it does not change anything 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.840
 sure however that torch will go out when 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.650
 block is fed and option continues 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.060
 being fed 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:22.860
 the block when finally o the holeshot 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.829
 people are full of empty hawks 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.700
 Turns the comparator on and off the block 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.319
 a pique afterwards and if stão triggers 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.970
 this block and sent a cart though 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.709
 so that's how we work for 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.359
 that he is always off it 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.459
 only gives a human push cart though 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.709
 important thing of this system 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.260
 is that the pulse is too short then the 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.019
 Okay, Peter and Peter on level 4 for 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.959
 extend this pulse to the point of 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.769
 cart getting is getting turned on though 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.569
 huh 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.609
 and this here then is the charging system 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.720
 stand is being here europe begins 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.030
 on ice 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.250
 works the same way when the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.540
 cart is full because there is no more 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.730
 items do not break 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.250
 then you here pay here it're one 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.970
 wrist and send the guy away because already 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.370
 has filled these two systems here neither 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.200
 Grandpa over here this time I'm not going 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.939
 build with you this very topic 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.099
 simple you can copy if you 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.980
 to land now is the current system 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.680
 completinho already points to the Hopi 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.840
 rail and exhaust system only pay 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.940
 attention that has a comparator below 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.190
 Yeah, but you can pause and copy it. 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.199
 easy to do and how did you 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.449
 two systems can be mixed in one 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:36.000
 only that is the case that I made here a 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.620
 whooper only serves to download to 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.040
 up and loaded from below 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.510
 they come back for a little place it a 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.040
 another interesting thing that gives you 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.620
 manipulate these blocks here and 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.479
 transform them is internal ie they 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.909
 they are in a lucky line because here 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.889
 are four transport lines 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.530
 completely independent and this is the 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.459
 island circuit 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.729
 basically the same thing we just 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.340
 when the signal stream is loaded here 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:05.220
 runs up here and there is this guy that 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.319
 option of a pulse and that pulse 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.030
 transmitted to see Peter and 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.780
 cart goes away again is ready 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.599
 to another 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.479
 Let's put it here, you see, here it is. 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.099
 an item 2 3 and 4 will send these 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.620
 carts to get the items for you 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.539
 see you working so you can see that they 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.940
 there are completely independent 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.430
 this one got a last 23 item got 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.060
 four years and has're all here already 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.980
 people 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.560
 I had some videos in here, I did. 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.940
 another tutorial sometimes seems like 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.100
 was here already the 321 jewel and this 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.200
 here is the system that carries the cart 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.540
 and this is the one that unloads, if we 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.050
 put some videos will put these 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.060
 appeals here ó put in the many will not 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.110
 take 16 here 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.450
 this one we'll put eight 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.510
 The one with 16 is going to put eight 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.610
 months here we will also put the 4 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.979
 In this one, we're going to 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.050
 download elsewhere 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.790
 You will see that ellison and here is no 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.380
 only four items have already been 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.450
 they are completely independent and 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.700
 they can stay put one on the side of the 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.370
 others can see all marked are 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.470
 Empty already delivered for you 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.900
 copy the system that is quite simple wine 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.240
 there is only to do is only you can use now 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.639
 copy because they are all the same 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.200
 then who will detect if comparator 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.060
 here and break 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.610
 here under the sky in the bar or in 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.840
 another break is not what you want 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.580
 going out of the cinema goes through this story 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.070
 Here, here comes the Chinese. 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.160
 signal drop detector and returns 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:42.960
 sinop lose 4x and send it away 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.640
 the rebellion is good it's structural it 's quick 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.060
 I do not build because really that 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.750
 system that only looks you can 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.490
 copy and also say that this video 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.950
 here is an experiment I'm doing 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.600
 here on the channel, I do not know if I can 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.729
 keep this, but I'm trying to do the 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.320
 next people now 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.490
 Some are complaining, I'm 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.680
 posting a video in English and 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.320
 Portuguese 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.060
 stay calm, one thing you need 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.200
 even to spread the content of the channel 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.639
 giving it very right and have some ideas 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.740
 and I thought about separating into two channels 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.660
 but until then I do not know if you need 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.200
 so that the first test I will 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.090
 do is try try to put the same 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.160
 video in two languages ​​in Portuguese and 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.710
 English so everyone is happy all 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.969
 world can watch 100% of the content 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.369
 that I put online 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:35.679
 Of course there is a cost, that's it. 

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:37.569
 twice as long as the product 

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:40.269
 because I do not want to make a video only and 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:41.979
 Voice over, I know, I'm not going either. 

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:43.329
 making caption does at most 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.249
 notes 

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:46.899
 only it's not very cool either 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:49.089
 I recorded a video and I also speaking 

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:50.829
 English 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:54.159
 If you go there, you'll laugh. 

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:55.919
 You'll see that my English is there. 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:59.259
 much to learn yet but the 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:00.909
 importance I'll try anyway and 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:02.589
 If you give it, give it a try. 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:04.389
 something that we do not lock 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.979
 I'm fine 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:10.179
 I hope you like this new one. 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:11.709
 I also use this system here to 

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:13.929
 leave the channel for you is the channel 

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:15.279
 hamster club he tried to make a 

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:17.349
 system of these here also only that he 

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:19.779
 made one that is much more complete is 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:21.549
 variable load that this theme here 

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:23.469
 You in Tupi the cart it can catch 

00:07:21.549 --> 00:07:27.039
 the system then it is good if they carry 

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:29.139
 both of items caught breaching plus one 

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:31.719
 both of items caught hop and so he 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:33.699
 works best're any tutorial 

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:35.050
 If a survival comes out, explain it to you. 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:36.879
 exactly what I'm talking about 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.339
 but if you want a very complete system 

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:41.259
 even a little more complex than 

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:43.419
 This one is looking for the club link. 

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:45.489
 hamster that will be in the description of this 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:47.679
 video here for those who want to see more 

00:07:45.489 --> 00:07:51.249
 accept his video is in English 

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:53.079
 is also then that is people are so 

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:55.089
 I had this channel news for today 

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:58.149
 Let's try betting on both languages. 

00:07:55.089 --> 00:08:00.839
 I do not know if it will work but twisting 

00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:03.489
 for the people that everything is going to work right 

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:12.129
 said hello a big hug 

00:08:03.489 --> 00:08:14.969
 a beautiful sound work also told work 

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:18.799
 football needs coal and the light 

00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:18.799
 and she is happy while
