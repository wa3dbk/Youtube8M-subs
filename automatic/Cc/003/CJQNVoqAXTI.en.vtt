second<00:00:58.150> thought<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.630> their<00:00:58.780> passing<00:00:59.260> my<00:00:59.710> very

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
second thought to their passing my very

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.180 
second thought to their passing my very
first<00:01:00.280> job<00:01:00.550> they<00:01:01.450> flew<00:01:01.750> me<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:02.440> Singapore<00:01:03.010> and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
first job they flew me to Singapore and

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.180 
first job they flew me to Singapore and
this<00:01:03.519> is<00:01:03.699> in<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.000> early<00:01:04.330> 80s<00:01:05.110> I<00:01:05.290> think<00:01:05.320> they<00:01:06.040> on

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
this is in the early 80s I think they on

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.190 
this is in the early 80s I think they on
twenty-two<00:01:06.970> years<00:01:07.180> old<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.690> it<00:01:07.960> could<00:01:08.110> be

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
twenty-two years old and it could be

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.010 
twenty-two years old and it could be
better<00:01:08.380> if<00:01:08.650> you<00:01:09.130> talk<00:01:10.120> to<00:01:10.360> any<00:01:10.570> one<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:10.840> our

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
better if you talk to any one of our

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.750 
better if you talk to any one of our
pilots<00:01:11.500> there's<00:01:11.710> all<00:01:11.920> their<00:01:12.250> stories<00:01:12.610> would

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
pilots there's all their stories would

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.460 
pilots there's all their stories would
be<00:01:12.790> different<00:01:13.300> how<00:01:13.510> they<00:01:13.690> got<00:01:13.810> involved<00:01:14.170> in

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
be different how they got involved in

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.490 
be different how they got involved in
this<00:01:14.620> my<00:01:15.430> story<00:01:15.790> is<00:01:16.150> probably<00:01:16.630> nothing<00:01:17.140> like

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
this my story is probably nothing like

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.480 
this my story is probably nothing like
anybody<00:01:18.159> else's<00:01:18.520> story<00:01:18.850> but<00:01:19.480> in<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.780> end

there's<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.580> significant<00:01:22.180> amount<00:01:22.360> of<00:01:22.510> seagoing

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
there's a significant amount of seagoing

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.920 
there's a significant amount of seagoing
experiences<00:01:24.159> it's<00:01:24.340> necessary<00:01:24.930> significant

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
experiences it's necessary significant

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.590

we're<00:01:32.050> trying<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.440> find<00:01:32.620> a<00:01:32.710> place<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:33.280> can<00:01:33.880> put

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
we're trying to find a place I can put

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.640 
we're trying to find a place I can put
this<00:01:34.240> thousand<00:01:34.750> foot<00:01:34.900> ship<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.440> every

this thousand foot ship and every
tonight<00:01:35.950> that's<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.210> real<00:01:37.420> essential<00:01:37.840> part

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
tonight that's the real essential part

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.860 
tonight that's the real essential part
of<00:01:38.410> piloting<00:01:38.830> is<00:01:39.040> that<00:01:39.340> local<00:01:39.730> knowledge<00:01:39.910> what

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
of piloting is that local knowledge what

ships<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:40.320> once<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:40.680> ship<00:03:41.130> is<00:03:41.310> on<00:03:41.430> that
