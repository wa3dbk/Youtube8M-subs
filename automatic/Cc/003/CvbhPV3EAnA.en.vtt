into those uppercuts Mike Ross trying to
approach<00:03:10.100> on<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.340> ground<00:03:10.549> in<00:03:10.730> filtration

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
approach on the ground in filtration

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.940 
approach on the ground in filtration
finding<00:03:11.510> ways<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.840> virtually<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:12.560> might<00:03:12.799> be

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
finding ways to virtually it might be

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.530 
finding ways to virtually it might be
good<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.160> just<00:03:13.310> try<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.640> stop<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.060> aerial<00:03:14.390> game

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
good to just try to stop the aerial game

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.910 
good to just try to stop the aerial game
altogether<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:15.080> seems<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.530> be<00:03:15.560> where<00:03:15.799> he

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
altogether that seems to be where he

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.830 
altogether that seems to be where he
keeps<00:03:16.130> on<00:03:16.220> getting<00:03:16.340> tagged<00:03:16.700> by<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> bee<00:03:17.390> oh

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
keeps on getting tagged by a bee oh

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.800 
keeps on getting tagged by a bee oh
that's<00:03:18.530> desperation<00:03:19.400> ultra<00:03:19.790> like<00:03:20.299> that's<00:03:20.570> not

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
that's desperation ultra like that's not

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.400 
that's desperation ultra like that's not
a<00:03:20.870> good<00:03:21.049> play<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:22.310> does<00:03:22.579> not<00:03:22.730> pay<00:03:22.940> off<00:03:23.200> at<00:03:24.200> this

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
a good play it does not pay off at this

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.620 
a good play it does not pay off at this
level<00:03:24.620> it's<00:03:24.829> very<00:03:25.010> hard<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.329> basically<00:03:26.329> walk

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
level it's very hard to basically walk

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.750 
level it's very hard to basically walk
out<00:03:26.780> like<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:27.110> so<00:03:27.650> now<00:03:27.829> Mike<00:03:28.070> must<00:03:28.370> win<00:03:28.610> this

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
out like that so now Mike must win this

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.120 
out like that so now Mike must win this
last<00:03:29.060> round<00:03:29.530> where<00:03:30.530> he's<00:03:30.680> fighting<00:03:31.010> for<00:03:31.070> his

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
last round where he's fighting for his

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.670 
last round where he's fighting for his
tournament<00:03:31.459> life<00:03:31.900> in<00:03:32.900> filtration<00:03:33.110> off<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.650> a

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
tournament life in filtration off to a

tournament life in filtration off to a
fairly<00:03:33.980> strong<00:03:34.130> start<00:03:34.489> I'll<00:03:34.670> crumpled<00:03:35.209> by<00:03:35.360> the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
fairly strong start I'll crumpled by the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.770 
fairly strong start I'll crumpled by the
focus<00:03:35.810> attack<00:03:36.610> an<00:03:37.610> infiltration<00:03:38.420> looking

Ross<00:03:57.410> it's<00:03:57.769> got<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:58.010> be<00:03:58.070> demoralized<00:03:58.610> by<00:03:58.700> that

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
Ross it's got to be demoralized by that

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.310 
Ross it's got to be demoralized by that
but<00:03:59.120> he's<00:03:59.209> actually<00:03:59.390> still<00:03:59.750> very<00:03:59.959> much<00:04:00.110> in

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
but he's actually still very much in

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.110 
but he's actually still very much in
this<00:04:00.470> one<00:04:00.680> he<00:04:01.220> just<00:04:01.400> needs<00:04:01.610> to<00:04:01.730> find<00:04:01.880> his<00:04:02.090> way

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
this one he just needs to find his way

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.710 
this one he just needs to find his way
forward<00:04:02.630> it's<00:04:03.200> an<00:04:03.350> IC<00:04:03.500> x<00:04:03.680> head<00:04:03.890> but<00:04:04.540> yeah<00:04:05.540> the

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
forward it's an IC x head but yeah the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.270 
forward it's an IC x head but yeah the
opportunities<00:04:06.320> are<00:04:06.350> there<00:04:06.530> again<00:04:07.010> simple

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
opportunities are there again simple

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.670 
opportunities are there again simple
tration<00:04:07.700> he's<00:04:07.880> just<00:04:08.150> not<00:04:08.590> exploiting<00:04:09.590> the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
tration he's just not exploiting the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.160 
tration he's just not exploiting the
