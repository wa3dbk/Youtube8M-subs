00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.810
 there are many ways to reduce consumption 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.429
 systems to do the displacements a little more 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.380
 small is certainly the solution 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.089
 better and to reduce the displacement yes 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.740
 can remove a cylinder someone has 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.859
 even removed two never a day and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.720
 peugeot stopped at three for 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.060
 the accuracy is a turbodiesel 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.470
 three 1100 cylinders and a 1200 petrol 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.950
 with a few more horses 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.719
 82 against 75 in short, a new one 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.250
 generation of more efficient engines e 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.940
 lighter than the classic four 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.460
 cylinders 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.469
 there is also a technical explanation more 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.450
 cylinders there are more friction 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.250
 indoor 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.070
 so yes the small displacements better 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.719
 3d 4 there is a price to pay for or less 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.770
 cylinders means more vibrations e 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.570
 noisiness 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.469
 in this case, in addition to the noise level e 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.480
 to vibrations 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.370
 we evaluate consumption and performance for 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.260
 two cars that are successful and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.000
 they are also competitors among themselves 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.739
 Korean is a bit more economical 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.210
 peugeot even gives itself some air from 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.540
 premium and is indeed built 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.540
 very well 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.619
 let's start from the French with 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.840
 this petrol engine and with that 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.740
 setting that is the most beautiful costs 16 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.740
 thousand euros 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.380
 inside we find a cockpit 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.540
 modern and of sure effect 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.790
 with a particularity the small steering wheel 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.220
 much smaller than all cars of 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.930
 this segment is also lower than the 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.730
 particularity is that the tools now yes 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.990
 they look from above during while we are 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.420
 always been used to watching 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.000
 through the races this combination 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.470
 of steering wheel and pedals and instruments combined 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.420
 to the jerky adjustment of the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.460
 backrest requires a riding position 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.990
 which is more favorable for low riders 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.110
 and medium height rather than for most 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.110
 tall 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.040
 the Korean in comparison with the French e 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.930
 less sti rose even if recently has 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.360
 had a nice freshen up that I am 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.730
 improved finishes do not have a tablet 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.540
 like the 208 but also his is a system 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.390
 touch screen 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:23.900
 although installed in the market it is the sound 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:26.209
 edition and costs 14,650 euros for both 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.459
 length close to 4 meters and 4 seats 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.920
 comfortable some space for luggage and 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.530
 the ideal agility to move on the mixed 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.959
 how it drives but let's get back to our engines 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.640
 with three cylinders and their vibrations 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.800
 with this instrument he leaned on 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.800
 seat the least real-time measurements 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.230
 the peugeot has a maximum vibration of 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.780
 0.39 g at â€‹â€‹ascension and 0.0 21 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.780
 practically nothing to the minimum the hyundai 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.990
 instead it totals 0.31 c at the time of 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.650
 start the diesel and mark 0.07 g per 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.390
 minimum three times more than the French 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.130
 well there was to expect it adhering you know 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.960
 that diesel engines vibrate more than 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.430
 those with petrol but this engine of the 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.650
 jute and can really make his where a 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.750
 on but a little but not very little in 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.550
 highway 15 do with a liter but it is 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.730
 very homogeneous in the answer and up to 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.230
 4,000 laps has no hesitation 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.090
 peugeot that obviously with fewer copies a 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.220
 provision needs to rise more 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.160
 up those laps but in this progress 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.380
 it is not a lightning in fact it is a little slow it 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.520
 you can see well in the second half by throwing the 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.380
 car at 70 per hour 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.970
 after a kilometer the first arrives 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.060
 hyundai in sixth that nothing weight in 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.250
 fifth and not just the match between three 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.200
 petrol and diesel cylinders shows that 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.670
 compared to the four cylinders it is not 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.300
 it loses almost nothing just a few 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.190
 extra vibration but not too many 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.740
 what should not really be missing 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.080
 however it is the turbocharger on diesels is 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.610
 a matter taken for granted on petrol instead 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.290
 it's not for nothing 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.290
 and sincerely misses it
