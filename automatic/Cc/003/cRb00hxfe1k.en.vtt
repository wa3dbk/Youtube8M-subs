00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.439
 scientific knowledge provided 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.160
 that we had access to more 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:36.980
 information related to adhesives 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:40.940
 with the important is the choice is the 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.030
 knowledge the indication is to know the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.400
 patient for which you are going to indicate 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:54.680
 what kurati that bandage sticker 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:57.619
 that duct tape we need today 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.390
 to be aware that the role of the 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.449
 nurses is so important since the 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.839
 acquisition until the selection of the 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.839
 medical use 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.060
 this is important because in 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.580
 any time or at some point in the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.150
 hospitalization the patient will receive some 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.689
 care that requires the use of this adhesive 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.689
 doctor 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.340
 and this makes us start to 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.950
 think of some things first of them 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.009
 conditions of the patient's skin 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.610
 this patient who will receive the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.610
 sticker 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.340
 what are the clinical conditions that 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.940
 patient and 3rd, what are the tapes 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.539
 stickers or the adhesive bandage I go 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.459
 need for this patient and 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.370
 that the maintenance of the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.780
 integrity of your skin so that 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.209
 today we are trying to raise awareness 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.680
 people to have a look 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.680
 differentiated for this situation 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.280
 it is not enough just to have the product 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.130
 available select the best product 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.890
 I have to know how to apply the product and 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.090
 I also have to know how to make your 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.300
 removal 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.730
 today it is common to find several 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.220
 people with multiple recipes telling 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.030
 people look the best way it is so 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.100
 roast 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.680
 in fact there is a technique of 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.680
 application a removal technique
