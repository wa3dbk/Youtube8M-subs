out<00:00:15.630> some<00:00:15.900> fpv<00:00:16.620> and<00:00:16.940> I<00:00:17.940> also<00:00:18.210> got<00:00:19.050> this

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
out some fpv and I also got this

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.400 
out some fpv and I also got this
hexacopter<00:00:20.720> from<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:22.170> friend<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.740> mine<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.160> I

hexacopter from a friend of mine and I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.830 
hexacopter from a friend of mine and I
installed<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.950> a<00:00:26.010> gene<00:00:26.460> awesome<00:00:26.910> GPS<00:00:27.480> system

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
installed in a gene awesome GPS system

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.869 
installed in a gene awesome GPS system
the<00:00:28.260> NASA<00:00:28.500> lite<00:00:28.920> version<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:30.120> I<00:00:31.669> thought<00:00:32.669> I

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
the NASA lite version and I thought I

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.170 
the NASA lite version and I thought I
wanted<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> try<00:00:33.930> out<00:00:34.250> brushless<00:00:35.250> gimbal<00:00:35.640> as

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
wanted to try out brushless gimbal as

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.780 
wanted to try out brushless gimbal as
well<00:00:36.870> there<00:00:37.559> are<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> lot<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.949> cheap<00:00:38.309> versions

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
well there are a lot of cheap versions

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.229 
well there are a lot of cheap versions
out<00:00:38.940> there<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.510> storm<00:00:40.199> and<00:00:40.610> tie<00:00:41.610> rods<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
out there like storm and tie rods and

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.719 
out there like storm and tie rods and
other<00:00:45.830> also<00:00:46.830> good<00:00:47.570> brushless<00:00:48.570> gimbal<00:00:49.430> but<00:00:50.430> I

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
other also good brushless gimbal but I

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:55.579 
other also good brushless gimbal but I
went<00:00:51.720> for<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> young<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:53.129> Jimbo<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.420> has<00:00:54.659> got

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
went for the young one Jimbo it has got

that I talked to has been very positive
about<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:05.720> Jimbo<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.970> jin<00:01:08.970> bo<00:01:09.150> Kimble<00:01:09.840> okay

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020

about this Jimbo but jin bo Kimble okay
this<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.470> harder<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.130> set<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.759> because<00:01:15.240> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
this one is harder to set up because you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.660 
this one is harder to set up because you
need<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> bit<00:01:16.590> knowledge<00:01:17.039> about

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
need to have a bit knowledge about

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.899 
need to have a bit knowledge about
setting<00:01:18.149> up<00:01:18.270> stuff<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.810> I'm<00:01:19.579> not<00:01:20.579> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
setting up stuff and I'm not the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.819 
setting up stuff and I'm not the
sharpest<00:01:21.180> knife<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:22.200> drawer<00:01:22.289> but<00:01:23.659> but<00:01:24.829> I'd

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
sharpest knife in the drawer but but I'd

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.270 
sharpest knife in the drawer but but I'd
like<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> learn<00:01:26.369> as<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:27.329> try<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.560> went<00:01:29.189> for

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
like to learn as I try so I went for

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.349 
like to learn as I try so I went for
this<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.759> whole<00:01:32.759> program

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
this one and we have a whole program

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.920 
this one and we have a whole program
based<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.289> setting<00:01:34.859> up<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.609> with<00:01:36.479> other

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
based on setting up this one with other

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.149 
based on setting up this one with other
virtuous<00:01:38.030> demos<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:40.079> plug<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.530> play<00:01:40.799> I

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
virtuous demos you just plug and play I

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.120 
virtuous demos you just plug and play I
will<00:01:41.789> just<00:01:41.969> make<00:01:42.179> sure<00:01:42.359> that<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.649> Center<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
will just make sure that you Center the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.270 
will just make sure that you Center the
camera<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:45.179> looks<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.799> centered

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
camera it looks like it's not centered

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.700 
camera it looks like it's not centered
but<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.570> all<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.929> wires<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.320> are

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
but I have all the wires that are

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.450 
but I have all the wires that are
pulling<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.460> down<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> bit<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:52.039> Robin<00:01:53.039> other

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
pulling it down a bit but Robin other

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.389 
pulling it down a bit but Robin other
than<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.789> it's<00:01:54.270> okay<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:56.100> I'm<00:01:56.189> going<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
do now i'm going to plug the bearing I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.880 
do now i'm going to plug the bearing I
need<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.979> put<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.789> small<00:02:00.090> tree<00:02:00.299> sale<00:02:00.539> in<00:02:00.890> just

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
need to put a small tree sale in just

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.669 
need to put a small tree sale in just
power<00:02:02.189> up<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.759> hexacopter<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.109> the<00:02:04.350> receiver

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
power up the hexacopter and the receiver

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.469 
power up the hexacopter and the receiver
because<00:02:05.509> one<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.979> wires<00:02:08.490> going<00:02:08.940> from<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
because one of the wires going from the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.070 
because one of the wires going from the
receiver<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.470> into<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.910> control<00:02:12.270> box<00:02:12.600> of<00:02:12.840> the

receiver and into the control box of the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.260 
receiver and into the control box of the
UN<00:02:13.350> one<00:02:14.780> gives<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:16.080> big<00:02:16.860> power<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.940> receiver

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
UN one gives a big power to the receiver

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.330 
UN one gives a big power to the receiver
and<00:02:18.630> everything

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
and everything

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.130 
and everything
will<00:02:19.459> start<00:02:19.730> blinking<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.569> making<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:21.019> loud

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
will start blinking and making a loud

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.589 
will start blinking and making a loud
noise<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:21.739> I'm<00:02:22.069> going<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.489> pour<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.910> up<00:02:23.120> all<00:02:23.540> the

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
noise so I'm going to pour it up all the

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.250 
noise so I'm going to pour it up all the
way<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.769> you<00:02:25.069> can<00:02:25.250> see<00:02:25.430> how<00:02:25.580> it<00:02:25.610> works

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
way so that you can see how it works

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.740 
way so that you can see how it works
anyway<00:02:27.819> turn<00:02:28.819> on<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.030> radio<00:02:29.860> I'm<00:02:30.860> powering<00:02:31.310> up

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
anyway turn on the radio I'm powering up

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.500 
anyway turn on the radio I'm powering up
the<00:02:32.750> hexacopter<00:02:33.670> just<00:02:34.670> put<00:02:34.849> a<00:02:34.879> small<00:02:35.150> Theresa

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
the hexacopter just put a small Theresa

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.650 
the hexacopter just put a small Theresa
battery<00:02:36.400> like<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.500> will<00:02:39.670> find<00:02:40.670> some

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.960 

okay<00:02:44.660> it's<00:02:45.290> harder<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.680> find<00:02:45.980> him<00:02:46.310> the

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
okay it's harder to find him the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.890 
okay it's harder to find him the
satellites<00:02:47.450> in<00:02:47.930> here<00:02:48.290> because<00:02:49.690> when<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.780> go

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
satellites in here because when you go

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.630 
satellites in here because when you go
outside<00:02:51.190> blink<00:02:52.840> green<00:02:53.840> all<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.170> time<00:02:54.430> ok<00:02:55.430> and

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
outside blink green all the time ok and

the jimbo and we do like this no wrong

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.089 
the jimbo and we do like this no wrong
where<00:03:10.489> this<00:03:11.239> one<00:03:13.690> like<00:03:14.690> that<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:15.590> can<00:03:15.799> see<00:03:15.980> it

where this one like that you can see it
centers<00:03:18.610> genius<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.500> have<00:03:22.280> on<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:23.150> gear

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
centers genius and I have on the gear

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.710 
centers genius and I have on the gear
channel<00:03:24.139> I<00:03:24.319> have<00:03:24.980> put<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.519> tilt<00:03:25.819> because<00:03:26.389> I

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
channel I have put the tilt because I

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.110 
channel I have put the tilt because I
can<00:03:27.019> use<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.260> on<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.859> scroll<00:03:28.160> button<00:03:28.340> but

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
can use it on the scroll button but

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.509 
can use it on the scroll button but
until<00:03:29.359> I<00:03:29.569> get<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.410> radio<00:03:30.620> with<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.010> scrolls

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
until I get the radio with the scrolls

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.660 
until I get the radio with the scrolls
on<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.880> side<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.829> just<00:03:33.829> want<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.250> have<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:34.400> on

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
on the side I just want to have it on

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.479 
on the side I just want to have it on
one<00:03:35.510> switch<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.139> it's<00:03:36.650> easier<00:03:36.980> for<00:03:37.010> me<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.280> do

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
one switch so it's easier for me to do

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.819 
one switch so it's easier for me to do
like<00:03:37.639> this<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.880> as<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.329> can<00:03:41.510> see<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:42.590> camera

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
like this and as you can see the camera

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:50.550 
like this and as you can see the camera
tilts<00:03:44.829> and<00:03:45.829> back<00:03:46.489> again

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.330 

okay<00:03:51.560> now<00:03:51.740> i<00:03:51.800> have<00:03:52.190> turn<00:03:52.520> on<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:54.160> go<00:03:55.160> pro

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
okay now i have turn on the go pro

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.810 
okay now i have turn on the go pro
camera<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:55.960> can<00:03:56.960> just<00:03:57.350> put<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.040> on<00:03:58.160> record<00:03:58.370> so

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
camera I can just put it on record so

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.180 
camera I can just put it on record so
that<00:03:58.850> we<00:03:59.210> can<00:03:59.420> do<00:03:59.990> a<00:04:00.050> split<00:04:00.320> screen<00:04:01.900> like<00:04:02.900> this

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
that we can do a split screen like this

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:12.060 
that we can do a split screen like this
ad<00:04:05.410> after<00:04:06.410> some<00:04:06.590> major<00:04:06.860> setups<00:04:07.490> you<00:04:08.060> can<00:04:08.240> see

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:22.990 

everything<00:04:13.070> works<00:04:13.310> well<00:04:14.740> quite<00:04:15.740> cool<00:04:22.000> the

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
everything works well quite cool the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.980 
everything works well quite cool the
only<00:04:23.360> thing<00:04:23.570> that<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:24.080> big<00:04:25.040> concern<00:04:25.610> but<00:04:25.990> but

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
only thing that a big concern but but

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:34.030 
only thing that a big concern but but
that<00:04:28.210> we<00:04:29.210> will<00:04:29.450> find<00:04:29.720> out<00:04:29.900> later<00:04:30.140> is<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:33.040> Joe

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
that we will find out later is the Joe

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.820 
that we will find out later is the Joe
killer<00:04:34.460> on<00:04:34.760> this<00:04:35.330> one<00:04:35.600> they<00:04:35.930> are<00:04:36.110> so<00:04:36.470> big

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
killer on this one they are so big

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.260 
killer on this one they are so big
they're<00:04:37.520> like<00:04:37.730> big<00:04:38.180> cushions<00:04:38.780> so<00:04:40.060> I'm<00:04:41.060> not

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
they're like big cushions so I'm not

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.270 
they're like big cushions so I'm not
sure<00:04:41.360> how<00:04:42.080> much<00:04:42.290> they<00:04:42.350> can<00:04:42.620> kill<00:04:43.070> the

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
sure how much they can kill the

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.710 
sure how much they can kill the
vibrations<00:04:43.880> but<00:04:44.150> I<00:04:45.110> hope<00:04:45.590> on<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:47.000> test<00:04:47.540> flight

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
vibrations but I hope on a test flight

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.280 
vibrations but I hope on a test flight
that<00:04:48.170> I<00:04:48.350> will<00:04:48.530> find<00:04:48.800> this<00:04:48.920> out<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:50.210> one<00:04:51.050> of<00:04:51.080> the

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
that I will find this out and one of the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.000 
that I will find this out and one of the
things<00:04:51.350> that<00:04:51.860> I'm<00:04:53.050> thinking<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.230> and<00:04:54.560> which<00:04:55.310> I

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
things that I'm thinking of and which I

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.260 
things that I'm thinking of and which I
don't<00:04:58.010> know<00:04:58.220> because<00:04:58.430> I<00:04:58.700> never<00:04:58.910> tried<00:04:59.210> to

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
don't know because I never tried to

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.100 
don't know because I never tried to
purchase<00:04:59.810> gimbal<00:05:00.680> before<00:05:01.280> is<00:05:01.490> that<00:05:01.850> when<00:05:02.450> I<00:05:02.660> do

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
purchase gimbal before is that when I do

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.020 
purchase gimbal before is that when I do
like<00:05:03.380> this<00:05:03.590> I<00:05:03.800> just<00:05:04.040> touch<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.280> with<00:05:04.610> my<00:05:04.640> finger

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
like this I just touch it with my finger

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.020 
like this I just touch it with my finger
and<00:05:07.030> will<00:05:08.030> go<00:05:08.150> down<00:05:08.360> on<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.230> sides<00:05:09.880> even<00:05:10.880> which

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
and will go down on the sides even which

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.970 
and will go down on the sides even which
sides<00:05:11.390> i<00:05:11.660> do<00:05:11.890> but<00:05:12.890> mostly<00:05:13.280> this<00:05:13.460> one<00:05:13.700> and

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
sides i do but mostly this one and

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.440 
sides i do but mostly this one and
perhaps<00:05:15.980> it's<00:05:16.280> supposed<00:05:16.640> to<00:05:16.730> do<00:05:16.880> that<00:05:17.060> I<00:05:17.270> don't

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
perhaps it's supposed to do that I don't

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.350 
perhaps it's supposed to do that I don't
know<00:05:17.630> but<00:05:17.900> I<00:05:18.320> hope<00:05:18.410> that<00:05:18.970> some<00:05:19.970> of<00:05:20.000> you<00:05:20.210> guys

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
testing it and after knowing the program

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.650

better<00:05:34.940> I<00:05:35.320> can<00:05:36.320> do<00:05:37.030> programming<00:05:38.030> video

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
better I can do programming video

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.190 
better I can do programming video
because<00:05:39.380> the<00:05:39.740> ones<00:05:39.980> that<00:05:40.310> are<00:05:40.580> out<00:05:41.030> on<00:05:41.419> you<00:05:42.050> two

bad english i do bad english too but not
that<00:05:50.690> bad<00:05:50.990> and<00:05:52.480> perhaps<00:05:53.480> we<00:05:53.720> can<00:05:53.870> make<00:05:54.169> a<00:05:54.200> good

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
that bad and perhaps we can make a good

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.940 
that bad and perhaps we can make a good
video<00:05:54.560> but<00:05:55.280> i<00:05:55.490> need<00:05:55.910> to<00:05:55.940> find<00:05:56.210> out<00:05:57.250> bits

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
video but i need to find out bits

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.570 
video but i need to find out bits
stuff<00:05:59.610> before<00:06:00.510> I<00:06:00.540> do<00:06:01.070> kind<00:06:02.070> of<00:06:02.130> leader<00:06:02.340> like

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
stuff before I do kind of leader like
