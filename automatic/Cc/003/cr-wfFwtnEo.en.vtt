00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
we're going to use the tail to be a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.150 
we're going to use the tail to be a
really<00:01:26.720> big<00:01:26.960> part<00:01:27.289> on<00:01:27.440> him<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:27.890> it's<00:01:28.039> gonna

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
put the big bushy tail then it'll look

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:46.690 
put the big bushy tail then it'll look
fine<00:01:44.350> okay<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:45.410> now<00:01:45.860> we're<00:01:46.070> just<00:01:46.100> rolling<00:01:46.610> out

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
fine okay so now we're just rolling out

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.999 
fine okay so now we're just rolling out
the<00:01:46.910> tail<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:47.690> now<00:01:47.899> we're<00:01:48.110> kind<00:01:48.259> of<00:01:48.410> rolling<00:01:48.710> it

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
the tail so now we're kind of rolling it

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.969 
the tail so now we're kind of rolling it
on<00:01:49.280> both<00:01:50.000> sides<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.780> make<00:01:50.899> both<00:01:51.140> sides<00:01:51.170> point

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
on both sides to make both sides point

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.010 
on both sides to make both sides point
here<00:01:55.000> kind<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.030> get<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.390> like<00:01:56.509> a<00:01:56.539> boomerang

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
shape so now I'm just um making the ends

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:18.790 
shape so now I'm just um making the ends
a<00:02:05.750> little<00:02:05.780> bit<00:02:06.050> point<00:02:06.410> here

towards<00:03:13.700> his<00:03:13.880> nose<00:03:14.180> just<00:03:14.570> like<00:03:14.720> his<00:03:14.900> fur<00:03:15.230> would

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
towards his nose just like his fur would

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.480

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
and gray so his fur is a mixture of

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.600 
and gray so his fur is a mixture of

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
black and gray if you want to make yours

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.840 
black and gray if you want to make yours
a<00:03:46.700> silver<00:03:47.330> or<00:03:47.600> a<00:03:48.020> very<00:03:48.440> light<00:03:48.800> gray<00:03:49.100> Husky<00:03:49.580> then

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
a silver or a very light gray Husky then

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.480 
a silver or a very light gray Husky then
I<00:03:49.970> would<00:03:50.209> just<00:03:50.290> tell<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.320> to<00:03:51.620> do<00:03:51.770> all<00:03:52.070> gray

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
I would just tell you to do all gray

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.000 
I would just tell you to do all gray
here<00:03:52.910> instead<00:03:53.240> of<00:03:53.360> doing<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.750> block<00:03:53.990> but<00:03:54.980> I

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
here instead of doing the block but I

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.890 
here instead of doing the block but I
think<00:03:55.430> that<00:03:55.550> this<00:03:55.700> adds<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.090> lot<00:03:56.209> of<00:03:56.270> depth<00:03:56.600> and

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
think that this adds a lot of depth and

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.290 
think that this adds a lot of depth and
you<00:03:56.930> know<00:03:57.290> just<00:03:57.590> go<00:03:57.770> really<00:03:58.520> messy<00:03:59.000> because

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
you know just go really messy because

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.870 
you know just go really messy because
remember<00:04:00.050> that<00:04:00.410> it's<00:04:00.590> fur<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.250> it's<00:04:01.400> not<00:04:01.580> neat

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
remember that it's fur so it's not neat

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.710 
remember that it's fur so it's not neat
so<00:04:02.770> you<00:04:03.770> want<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:04.040> frame<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.550> face<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:05.240> do<00:04:05.540> the

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
so you want to frame the face and do the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.060 
so you want to frame the face and do the

body and everything like that just

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.920 
body and everything like that just
really<00:04:07.400> put<00:04:07.670> it<00:04:07.790> everywhere<00:04:07.910> that<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.630> want

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
really put it everywhere that you want

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.289 
really put it everywhere that you want
there<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.590> be<00:04:09.890> either<00:04:10.340> gray<00:04:10.640> or<00:04:10.880> black<00:04:15.820> okay<00:04:16.820> so

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
now you're just doing the body as well

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.250 
but Huskies usually have a black outline
around<00:04:53.130> their<00:04:53.280> eyes<00:04:53.430> anyways<00:04:54.000> so<00:04:54.750> this<00:04:55.080> was

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
around their eyes anyways so this was

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.110 
around their eyes anyways so this was
just<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.590> kind<00:04:55.800> of<00:04:55.890> give<00:04:56.010> me<00:04:56.160> an<00:04:56.250> idea<00:04:56.340> of<00:04:56.790> where

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
just to kind of give me an idea of where

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.480

I wanted its face to be so that the rest

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.120 
I wanted its face to be so that the rest
of<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.700> fur<00:05:00.030> can<00:05:00.330> kind<00:05:00.570> of<00:05:00.720> frame<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.410> so<00:05:01.920> now

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
of the fur can kind of frame it so now
