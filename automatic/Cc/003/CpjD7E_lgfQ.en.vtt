around<00:00:17.279> with<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.850> new<00:00:18.029> repeater<00:00:18.600> lock

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
around with the new repeater lock

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.529 
around with the new repeater lock
function<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:20.640> has<00:00:20.820> been<00:00:21.000> released<00:00:21.300> with

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
function and that has been released with

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.189 
function and that has been released with
the<00:00:21.689> snapshot<00:00:22.140> 12w<00:00:22.949> 42<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.750> case<00:00:24.990> you

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
don't know what this does showed intro

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.570 
don't know what this does showed intro
in<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.900> now<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.590> opportunity<00:00:28.890> to

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
in that we now have the opportunity to

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.100 
in that we now have the opportunity to
save<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:31.340> odd<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.730> set<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> repeater<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.719> fixed

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
save a odd to set a repeater on a fixed

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.860 
save a odd to set a repeater on a fixed
output<00:00:34.320> as<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.250> there's<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.870> small

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
output as you can see there's a small

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.170 
output as you can see there's a small
bar<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.070> repeater<00:00:38.489> now<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.940> if<00:00:39.030> I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
bar on on this repeater now and if I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.139 
bar on on this repeater now and if I
remove<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:40.530> torch<00:00:40.800> behind<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.579> still<00:00:41.910> have

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
remove the torch behind it I still have

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.660 
remove the torch behind it I still have
a<00:00:42.180> signal<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.930> repeater<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.670> this

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
a signal on this repeater and this

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.860 
a signal on this repeater and this
function<00:00:45.329> opens<00:00:45.780> up<00:00:46.050> new<00:00:46.980> opportunities<00:00:47.870> in

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
function opens up new opportunities in

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.619 
function opens up new opportunities in
reston<00:00:49.680> contraptions<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:51.120> started<00:00:51.539> to

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
reston contraptions and I started to

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.229 
reston contraptions and I started to
play<00:00:51.840> around<00:00:52.079> with<00:00:52.460> flip-flops<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.789> what<00:00:54.090> we

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
play around with flip-flops and what we

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.700 
play around with flip-flops and what we
have<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.640> 80<00:00:56.640> flip-flop<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.710> well

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
have here is 80 flip-flop that well

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.330 
have here is 80 flip-flop that well
basically<00:00:59.190> hasn't<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.910> has<00:01:00.149> no<00:01:00.390> pistons<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
basically hasn't it has no pistons in it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.160 
basically hasn't it has no pistons in it
let<00:01:02.340> me<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.640> show<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.850> how<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.180> works<00:01:06.170> it's

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
let me just show you how it works it's

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.310 
let me just show you how it works it's
actually<00:01:07.380> pretty<00:01:07.799> fast<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.640> speed<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.320> of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
actually pretty fast the speed of the of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.940 
actually pretty fast the speed of the of
the<00:01:11.130> secretary<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.080> only<00:01:13.080> problem<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the secretary and only problem here is

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.890 
the secretary and only problem here is
if<00:01:15.890> I<00:01:16.890> spam<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.340> button<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:19.430> jams<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.900> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
if I spam this button it jams up as you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.530 
if I spam this button it jams up as you
can<00:01:22.049> see<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.439> repeater<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.820> has<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.509> be

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
can see this repeater here it has to be

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.609 
can see this repeater here it has to be
offered<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.380> work<00:01:25.939> but<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.060> besides<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.320> it's

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
offered to work but it besides that it's

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.240 
offered to work but it besides that it's
it's<00:01:28.950> quite<00:01:29.220> nice<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.700> pretty<00:01:29.970> small<00:01:30.799> s<00:01:31.799> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
it's quite nice it's pretty small s it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.569 
it's quite nice it's pretty small s it
has<00:01:32.460> no<00:01:32.640> pistons<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:34.200> actually<00:01:34.740> five

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
has no pistons in it it's actually five

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.550 
has no pistons in it it's actually five
by<00:01:36.590> four<00:01:37.590> by<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.659> you<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:39.780> well<00:01:40.290> by<00:01:40.500> two

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
by four by one and you know well by two

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.590 
by four by one and you know well by two
maybe<00:01:41.100> because<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.549> these<00:01:41.790> two<00:01:42.030> red<00:01:42.240> stones

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
maybe because of these two red stones

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.830 
maybe because of these two red stones
but<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.960> could<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.259> well<00:01:44.090> remove<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.540> one

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
but you could as well remove this one

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.450 
but you could as well remove this one
and<00:01:46.110> use<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> torch<00:01:47.009> here<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:49.979> works<00:01:50.250> as

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
and use a torch here so this works as

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.039 
and use a torch here so this works as
well<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:52.520> yeah<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:54.799> in<00:01:55.799> terms<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.399> size<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
well and yeah in in terms of size and

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.859 
well and yeah in in terms of size and
this<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.430> best<00:01:59.640> t<00:02:00.240> flip-flop<00:02:00.750> or

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
this is like the the best t flip-flop or

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.010 
this is like the the best t flip-flop or
the<00:02:00.990> most<00:02:01.229> compact<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.979> know<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:03.840> also

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the most compact that I know and it also

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.240 
the most compact that I know and it also
is<00:02:04.259> pretty<00:02:04.530> fast<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:06.420> too<00:02:06.630> bad

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
is pretty fast so this is not too bad

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.410 
is pretty fast so this is not too bad
now<00:02:08.250> let<00:02:08.429> me<00:02:08.459> show<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.729> how<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.940> build<00:02:09.209> it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
now let me show you how to build it

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.229 
now let me show you how to build it
let's<00:02:10.289> start<00:02:10.410> with<00:02:10.679> our<00:02:10.830> inputs<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.640> just

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
let's start with our inputs and just

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.380 
let's start with our inputs and just
going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.480> mark

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
going to mark

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.120 
going to mark
this<00:02:13.450> plug<00:02:13.720> as<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.110> input<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.710> put<00:02:14.920> another

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
this plug as the input and put another

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.420 
this plug as the input and put another
one<00:02:15.340> behind<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:16.140> torch<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.170> decide<00:02:17.709> redstone

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
one behind a torch to decide redstone

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.270 
one behind a torch to decide redstone
and<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:19.030> repeater<00:02:19.620> next<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:20.830> repeater

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
and a repeater next to that repeater

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.930 
and a repeater next to that repeater
replaced<00:02:22.050> another<00:02:23.050> one<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:24.190> make<00:02:24.370> use<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.640> this

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
replaced another one to make use of this

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.290 
replaced another one to make use of this
new<00:02:25.240> lock<00:02:25.690> function<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.410> one<00:02:26.650> behind<00:02:27.300> then

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
new lock function and one behind then

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.970 
new lock function and one behind then
we're<00:02:28.510> going<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.750> place<00:02:28.930> redstone<00:02:29.230> here

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
we're going to place redstone here

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.190 
we're going to place redstone here
redstone<00:02:30.700> on<00:02:30.880> top<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.420> block<00:02:31.690> where<00:02:32.080> the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
redstone on top of the block where the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.710 
redstone on top of the block where the
torch<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.680> at<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:34.120> going<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.420> be<00:02:34.540> our

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
torch is at this is going to be our

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.240 
torch is at this is going to be our
output<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.590> we<00:02:36.400> have<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.790> bring<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.330> signal

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
output and we have to bring a signal

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.750 
output and we have to bring a signal
back<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.989> first<00:02:40.989> repeater<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.709> this<00:02:42.520> has

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
back to this first repeater and this has

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.640 
back to this first repeater and this has
to<00:02:43.030> be<00:02:43.180> set<00:02:45.030> well<00:02:46.030> basically<00:02:46.930> these<00:02:47.230> three

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
to be set well basically these three

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.550 
to be set well basically these three
repeaters<00:02:48.190> have<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.610> be<00:02:49.540> set<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.080> delay<00:02:50.530> of

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
repeaters have to be set on a delay of

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.000 
repeaters have to be set on a delay of
10<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.280> total<00:02:51.519> so<00:02:52.450> we<00:02:52.570> make<00:02:52.750> for<00:02:52.989> here<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.680> here

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
10 in total so we make for here to here

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.990 
10 in total so we make for here to here
and<00:02:54.190> for<00:02:54.580> here<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.120> we<00:02:55.959> have<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.170> delay<00:02:56.590> of

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
and for here and we have a delay of

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.490 
and for here and we have a delay of
exactly<00:02:58.000> 10<00:02:58.239> redstone<00:02:58.630> tix<00:02:58.900> which<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.290> one

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
exactly 10 redstone tix which is one

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.060 
exactly 10 redstone tix which is one
second<00:03:00.010> now<00:03:00.670> place<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:00.970> button<00:03:01.420> over<00:03:01.660> here<00:03:02.070> just

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
second now place a button over here just

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.970 
second now place a button over here just
mark<00:03:04.200> some<00:03:05.200> kind<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:06.840> output<00:03:07.840> with<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.560> piston

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
mark some kind of output with the piston

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.060 
mark some kind of output with the piston
here<00:03:09.250> press<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.390> button<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.769> does<00:03:11.920> not

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
here press the button and it does not

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.880 
here press the button and it does not
work<00:03:12.280> why<00:03:12.670> not<00:03:12.910> all<00:03:13.750> right<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.350> forgot<00:03:14.680> a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
work why not all right I forgot a

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.860 
work why not all right I forgot a
redstone<00:03:15.250> over<00:03:15.519> here<00:03:15.730> there<00:03:16.000> we<00:03:16.120> go<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:18.870> oh

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
redstone over here there we go and oh

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.500 
redstone over here there we go and oh
yeah<00:03:20.079> forgot<00:03:20.440> another<00:03:20.829> thing<00:03:21.160> very<00:03:21.970> important

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
yeah forgot another thing very important

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.780 
yeah forgot another thing very important
this<00:03:22.720> repeater<00:03:23.290> here<00:03:23.410> has<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.459> be<00:03:24.579> set<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:24.880> two

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
this repeater here has to be set to two

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.990 
this repeater here has to be set to two
there<00:03:27.790> we<00:03:27.970> go<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:29.220> what<00:03:30.220> basically<00:03:30.640> happens

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
there we go so what basically happens

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.300 
there we go so what basically happens
here<00:03:31.600> is<00:03:31.750> this<00:03:32.170> signal<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.120> brought<00:03:35.310> from

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
here is this signal that is brought from

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.460 
here is this signal that is brought from
the<00:03:36.519> button<00:03:36.820> and<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:38.459> actually<00:03:39.959> 1.1<00:03:40.959> seconds

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
the button and is actually 1.1 seconds

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.890 
the button and is actually 1.1 seconds
long<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:41.769> this<00:03:42.100> is<00:03:42.250> just<00:03:42.489> enough<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.570> that<00:03:43.600> when

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
long so this is just enough so that when

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.670 
long so this is just enough so that when
this<00:03:44.110> repeater<00:03:44.590> locks<00:03:45.100> this<00:03:45.459> repeater<00:03:46.680> that

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
this repeater locks this repeater that

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.600 
this repeater locks this repeater that
it<00:03:49.230> remembers<00:03:50.230> that<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.680> on<00:03:50.829> signal<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:51.549> to

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
it remembers that the on signal so to

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.640 
it remembers that the on signal so to
say<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.329> sets<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:52.959> repeater<00:03:53.380> on<00:03:53.470> the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
say and and sets this repeater on the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.390 
say and and sets this repeater on the
fixed<00:03:54.010> output<00:03:54.930> over<00:03:55.930> here<00:03:56.110> we<00:03:56.290> have<00:03:56.320> two<00:03:57.160> other

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
fixed output over here we have two other

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.890 
fixed output over here we have two other
versions<00:03:58.000> of<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.959> repeater<00:04:00.480> well<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.660> key

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
versions of the repeater well the key

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.330 
versions of the repeater well the key
flip-flop<00:04:02.320> with<00:04:02.500> our<00:04:02.650> Pistons<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.130> have<00:04:03.220> no

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
flip-flop with our Pistons I have no

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.880 
flip-flop with our Pistons I have no
idea<00:04:03.579> how<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:03.670> call<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.500> we<00:04:05.500> can<00:04:05.680> put<00:04:05.860> a

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
idea how to call it and we can put a

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.840 
idea how to call it and we can put a
monostable<00:04:06.280> circuit<00:04:06.970> in<00:04:07.120> front<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
monostable circuit in front of the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.360 
monostable circuit in front of the
repeater<00:04:10.150> thing<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.720> this<00:04:11.709> well<00:04:12.100> as<00:04:12.310> a

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
repeater thing and this well as a

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.780 
repeater thing and this well as a
reminder<00:04:12.790> what<00:04:13.299> this<00:04:13.329> will<00:04:13.600> help<00:04:13.750> on<00:04:14.370> we<00:04:15.370> won't

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
reminder what this will help on we won't

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.180 
reminder what this will help on we won't
need<00:04:15.940> as<00:04:16.150> much<00:04:16.269> repeaters<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:16.989> as<00:04:17.919> a<00:04:17.950> reminder

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
need as much repeaters and as a reminder

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.800 
need as much repeaters and as a reminder
and<00:04:18.810> we<00:04:19.810> need<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.560> delay<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:20.919> signal<00:04:21.690> that<00:04:22.690> we

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
and we need to delay the signal that we

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.350 
and we need to delay the signal that we
bring<00:04:23.080> back<00:04:23.349> from<00:04:23.979> our<00:04:24.099> output<00:04:24.640> to<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:24.940> first

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
bring back from our output to the first

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.970 
bring back from our output to the first
repeater<00:04:25.810> here

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
repeater here

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.520 
repeater here
we<00:04:27.460> need<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.670> delay<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.210> one<00:04:28.510> second<00:04:28.990> over<00:04:29.260> here

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
we need to delay of one second over here

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.560 
we need to delay of one second over here
and<00:04:29.620> if<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.920> signal<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.850> is<00:04:31.000> triggering<00:04:31.360> the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
and if the signal that is triggering the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.610 
and if the signal that is triggering the
whole<00:04:31.720> thing<00:04:32.020> is<00:04:32.260> shorter<00:04:33.070> than<00:04:33.100> one<00:04:33.970> second

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
whole thing is shorter than one second

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.130 
whole thing is shorter than one second
precisely<00:04:35.620> we<00:04:36.280> have<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:36.970> tick<00:04:37.330> off<00:04:37.510> three<00:04:37.810> over

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
precisely we have a tick off three over

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.850 
precisely we have a tick off three over
here<00:04:38.440> and<00:04:39.150> then<00:04:40.150> we<00:04:40.360> can<00:04:40.500> we<00:04:41.500> need<00:04:41.650> less

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
here and then we can we need less

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.610 
here and then we can we need less
repeaters<00:04:42.600> when<00:04:43.600> we<00:04:43.720> bring<00:04:43.930> back<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.290> signal

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
repeaters when we bring back the signal

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.560 
repeaters when we bring back the signal
from<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.830> output<00:04:45.310> let<00:04:46.090> me<00:04:46.180> just<00:04:46.390> show<00:04:46.540> you

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
from the output let me just show you

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.700 
from the output let me just show you
that<00:04:47.790> on<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:49.120> down<00:04:49.300> side<00:04:49.570> this<00:04:49.840> is<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.230> little

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
that on the down side this is a little

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.740 
that on the down side this is a little
slower<00:04:51.550> than<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.660> one<00:04:52.960> over<00:04:53.140> there<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:54.750> while

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
slower than the one over there and while

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.390 
slower than the one over there and while
you<00:04:55.870> actually<00:04:56.200> don't<00:04:56.350> save<00:04:56.620> up<00:04:56.740> on<00:04:56.890> resources

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
you actually don't save up on resources

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.610 
you actually don't save up on resources
since<00:04:57.700> you<00:04:57.850> need<00:04:58.060> repeater<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.200> piston

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
since you need repeater and a piston

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.860

Florida<00:05:00.040> for<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.340> monastery<00:05:00.880> circuit<00:05:01.360> we

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
Florida for the monastery circuit we

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.780 
Florida for the monastery circuit we
have<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.140> same<00:05:02.350> thing<00:05:02.650> over<00:05:02.830> here<00:05:03.010> just<00:05:03.520> a

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
have the same thing over here just a

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.690 
have the same thing over here just a
different<00:05:04.300> monostable<00:05:04.750> circuit<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.770> when

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
different monostable circuit and when

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.010 
different monostable circuit and when
the<00:05:06.790> downside<00:05:07.270> here<00:05:07.480> is<00:05:07.570> we<00:05:07.720> need<00:05:07.840> two

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
the downside here is we need two

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.440 
the downside here is we need two
repeaters<00:05:08.500> to<00:05:09.100> make<00:05:09.280> this<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.490> three<00:05:09.940> take<00:05:10.210> long

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
repeaters to make this a three take long

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.490 
repeaters to make this a three take long
signal<00:05:10.840> because<00:05:12.150> it<00:05:13.150> has<00:05:13.390> to<00:05:13.630> be<00:05:13.750> three<00:05:14.050> tix

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.170 

let<00:05:17.500> me<00:05:17.620> just<00:05:17.830> remove<00:05:18.160> that<00:05:18.340> now<00:05:18.640> we<00:05:18.700> have<00:05:18.910> a<00:05:18.940> to

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
let me just remove that now we have a to

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.870 
let me just remove that now we have a to
tick<00:05:19.420> no<00:05:19.930> wait<00:05:20.200> this<00:05:20.380> is<00:05:20.530> not<00:05:20.710> good<00:05:20.890> how<00:05:21.670> to<00:05:21.730> do

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
tick no wait this is not good how to do

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.940 
tick no wait this is not good how to do
it<00:05:22.000> like<00:05:22.150> this<00:05:22.360> now<00:05:22.750> we<00:05:22.810> have<00:05:23.080> a<00:05:23.110> to<00:05:23.410> tick<00:05:23.680> and<00:05:23.890> I

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
it like this now we have a to tick and I

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.970 
it like this now we have a to tick and I
can<00:05:24.100> show<00:05:24.310> you<00:05:24.370> nothing<00:05:24.910> happens<00:05:25.330> I<00:05:25.860> hope<00:05:26.860> you

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
can show you nothing happens I hope you

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.550 
can show you nothing happens I hope you

enjoyed this little tutorial as said the
new<00:05:29.680> repeater<00:05:30.040> function<00:05:30.520> will<00:05:30.820> open<00:05:31.120> up<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.330> lot

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
new repeater function will open up a lot

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.180 
new repeater function will open up a lot
of<00:05:31.630> new<00:05:31.720> opportunities<00:05:31.990> which<00:05:32.620> is<00:05:32.740> quite<00:05:32.980> nice

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
of new opportunities which is quite nice

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.670 
of new opportunities which is quite nice
and<00:05:33.490> I<00:05:33.550> just<00:05:33.580> wanted<00:05:33.820> to<00:05:34.260> to<00:05:35.260> share<00:05:35.500> this
