00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.330
 skins dot com link in description 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.710
 recommend zdarova gangsters subscriber 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.839
 Nikita sent us secret information 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.910
 which we just have to check so 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.939
 this is one of my favorite heroes in dota 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.000
 tinker and on it as you see a few 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.220
 steam boots 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.810
 classic for tinker tore off and 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.359
 actually not at all classic for 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.500
 tinker guardian vulture as you know or 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.430
 I do not know if tinker refresh there is no arcane 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.559
 that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.570
 Arcana not REFRESH face that is REFRESH 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.040
 faces of measles will have all the skills of a tinker 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.800
 nothing new this is all about it 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.430
 but know the arcana does not refresh faces however 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.440
 guardian greaves gives you the opportunity to tinker 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.600
 their refresh is not there that is like aptly and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.199
 Guardian they Greaves using ulta 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.120
 tinker 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.590
 stop that is when on them 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.469
 falls off again you can zayuzat 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.840
 how can this be used in battle tinker 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.760
 can pour allies not 160 man is 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.950
 guardian grivs or how much he is there 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.110
 floods 160 and as many as 320 mana 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.270
 if he has enough mana for that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.909
 to refresh the face again he can 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.640
 fill accordingly 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.119
 480 mana I can tell you that 408 is dark 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.770
 very much and probably 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.720
 as Nikitaâ€™s subscriber correctly noted 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.920
 the beginning of the video 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.210
 probably it will probably fix it 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.829
 fixed because well enough 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.350
 big mana bay the only thing i 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.329
 I can say in justification 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.270
 This chip is that of the tinker of course 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.880
 if you collect nitro was beaten over 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.430
 you immediately leaves the ambulance with 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.310
 very brutal men who you 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.560
 spend spend 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.860
 brought to the nearest bunk will tie to 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.509
 she and accordingly will prick you 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.579
 aminazin therefore I would not recommend 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.350
 all but guardian vulture to collect on tinker 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.119
 but as you see in the situation when 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.549
 let's say the team has no support at all 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.500
 and everyone you beat off with a tinker pulled mid and 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.009
 In general, you want to help the team in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.200
 there is no batching all you need to collect on the tinker 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.000
 garden neck of this nonsense just that is 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.530
 besides even the second boot, except that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.120
 grass catching on a tinker first dog to me 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.470
 what to collect here options just to be 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.560
 him 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.830
 Guards Grivs do not know the second boot 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.630
 guys if only you have over farm and you 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.020
 really want to help the team 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.650
 well the devil knows the devil knows because 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.480
 that i learn he has a need 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.050
 this boot nonetheless really 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.900
 he pours mana gives a lot of hp and again 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.390
 the same will be decided that is, you can pour mana 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.430
 quite a lot like that 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.570
 subscriber that sent thank you what 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.570
 looked and good luck
