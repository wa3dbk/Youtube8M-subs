ways to do this the way that I do this

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.279 
ways to do this the way that I do this
is<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:55.880> little<00:01:55.970> overhead<00:01:56.539> finger<00:01:56.929> trick<00:01:57.140> just

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
is a little overhead finger trick just

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.359 
is a little overhead finger trick just
put<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.560> through<00:01:57.679> there<00:01:57.830> like<00:01:57.979> that<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.280> make

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
put it through there like that and make

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.639 
put it through there like that and make
an<00:01:58.490> overhand<00:01:58.880> loop<00:01:59.259> you're<00:02:00.259> gonna<00:02:00.350> take<00:02:00.530> this

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
an overhand loop you're gonna take this

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.490 
an overhand loop you're gonna take this
entire<00:02:00.860> loop<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.580> bring<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.300> over<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.289> hook

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
entire loop and bring it over the hook

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.969 
entire loop and bring it over the hook
so<00:02:03.679> hold<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:03.890> line<00:02:04.100> for<00:02:04.280> me<00:02:04.369> Chris<00:02:05.649> you<00:02:06.649> bring

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
so hold that line for me Chris you bring

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:14.030 
so hold that line for me Chris you bring
that<00:02:07.009> now<00:02:07.700> bring<00:02:07.940> that<00:02:07.970> through<00:02:08.270> there

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.100 

and<00:02:14.939> you<00:02:15.090> want<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.299> get<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.540> underneath<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and you want to get this underneath the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.140 
and you want to get this underneath the
barbs<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:17.189> know<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.370> come<00:02:17.549> as<00:02:17.700> close<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:18.000> that

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
barbs you know to come as close to that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.990 
barbs you know to come as close to that
hook<00:02:18.299> shank<00:02:18.540> as<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.810> possibly<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:19.879> just<00:02:20.879> like

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
hook shank as you possibly can just like

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.699 
hook shank as you possibly can just like
that

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
that

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.759 
that
now<00:02:22.709> with<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.849> piece<00:02:24.409> you're<00:02:25.409> gonna<00:02:25.560> want<00:02:25.739> to

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
now with this piece you're gonna want to

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.160 
now with this piece you're gonna want to
level<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.189> off<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:28.019> hold<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.409> flush

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
level that off so you can hold it flush

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.140 
level that off so you can hold it flush
and<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.260> want<00:02:31.409> that<00:02:31.560> hook<00:02:31.739> shank<00:02:32.310> as<00:02:32.640> parallel

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
and you want that hook shank as parallel

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.110 
and you want that hook shank as parallel
as<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.989> can<00:02:34.140> possibly<00:02:34.290> get<00:02:34.799> it<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.909> be<00:02:36.030> in

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
as you can possibly get it to be in

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.780 
as you can possibly get it to be in
level<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:37.769> want<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.950> get<00:02:38.040> all<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.340> slack<00:02:38.640> out

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
level you want to get all the slack out

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.910 
level you want to get all the slack out
of<00:02:38.849> that<00:02:39.060> line<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.049> possibly<00:02:40.230> can

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
of that line that you possibly can

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.140 
of that line that you possibly can
and<00:02:41.040> then<00:02:41.879> what<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.269> do<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.930> literally

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
and then what I like to do is literally

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.099 
and then what I like to do is literally
double<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.239> thing<00:02:45.450> around<00:02:45.659> my<00:02:45.810> hand<00:02:46.049> a

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
double this thing around my hand a

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:52.520 
double this thing around my hand a
couple<00:02:46.230> times<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.129> can<00:02:47.310> get<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.459> good<00:02:47.640> grip<00:02:51.530> so

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
couple times so I can get a good grip so

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.140 
couple times so I can get a good grip so
the<00:02:52.650> trick<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.129> is<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.579> have<00:02:53.700> enough<00:02:53.970> tension

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
the trick is is to have enough tension

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.680 
the trick is is to have enough tension
on<00:02:54.389> it<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.629> keep<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.930> flush<00:02:55.139> does<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.530> hurt

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
on it to keep it flush does that hurt

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.360 
on it to keep it flush does that hurt
they<00:02:57.690> keep<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.019> flush<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:59.069> be<00:02:59.159> able<00:02:59.310> to

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
they keep it flush and to be able to

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.979 
they keep it flush and to be able to
pull<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.670> out<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.909> way<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.299> entered<00:03:00.569> so

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
pull it out the way that it entered so

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.229 
pull it out the way that it entered so
let<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.349> hook<00:03:01.500> go<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:02.400> kind<00:03:02.609> of<00:03:02.700> find<00:03:03.000> its

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
let the hook go and kind of find its

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.089 
let the hook go and kind of find its
natural<00:03:03.480> position<00:03:03.870> because<00:03:04.680> what<00:03:04.859> it's<00:03:04.980> going

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
natural position because what it's going

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.979 
natural position because what it's going
to<00:03:05.159> do<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:05.519> gonna<00:03:05.639> level<00:03:06.060> out<00:03:06.180> if<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.840> went

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
to do is it's gonna level out if it went

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.210 
to do is it's gonna level out if it went
in<00:03:07.109> and<00:03:07.260> caught<00:03:07.349> a<00:03:07.379> tendon<00:03:07.799> or<00:03:07.920> something

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
in and caught a tendon or something

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.800 
in and caught a tendon or something
that's<00:03:08.370> going<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.519> turn<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.329> you<00:03:09.450> can<00:03:09.599> fill

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
that's going to turn but you can fill

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.940 
that's going to turn but you can fill
that<00:03:09.840> by<00:03:10.079> pushing<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.500> hook<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.799> that's

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
that by pushing on the hook and that's

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.229 
that by pushing on the hook and that's
why<00:03:11.069> I<00:03:11.099> laid<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.459> hook<00:03:11.639> over<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:11.940> make<00:03:12.090> sure

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
why I laid that hook over to make sure

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.970 
why I laid that hook over to make sure
it<00:03:12.299> didn't<00:03:12.480> have<00:03:12.569> ahold<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:13.019> tendon<00:03:13.409> if<00:03:13.859> he's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
it didn't have ahold of a tendon if he's

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.800 
it didn't have ahold of a tendon if he's
got<00:03:14.159> a<00:03:14.190> tendon<00:03:14.549> running<00:03:14.790> down<00:03:14.909> his<00:03:15.000> hand<00:03:15.269> you

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
got a tendon running down his hand you

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.089 
got a tendon running down his hand you
snatched<00:03:16.139> that<00:03:16.260> out<00:03:16.409> of<00:03:16.500> there<00:03:16.620> backwards<00:03:17.010> you

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
snatched that out of there backwards you

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.520 
snatched that out of there backwards you
could<00:03:17.250> rupture<00:03:17.519> or<00:03:18.060> tear<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.419> real<00:03:19.079> set<00:03:19.379> you

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
could rupture or tear a real set you

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.140 
could rupture or tear a real set you
know<00:03:19.650> important<00:03:20.370> part<00:03:20.609> of<00:03:20.669> the<00:03:20.790> way<00:03:20.879> that<00:03:21.030> your

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
know important part of the way that your

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.180 
know important part of the way that your
hand<00:03:21.359> functions<00:03:21.810> there<00:03:22.349> was<00:03:22.470> no<00:03:22.650> deflection

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
hand functions there was no deflection

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.680 
hand functions there was no deflection
in<00:03:23.609> there<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.120> didn't<00:03:24.299> feel<00:03:24.449> a<00:03:24.480> little

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
in there and you didn't feel a little

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.119 
in there and you didn't feel a little
pop<00:03:24.930> you'd<00:03:25.169> have<00:03:25.260> Phillip<00:03:25.530> pop<00:03:25.680> like<00:03:25.859> a<00:03:25.889> guitar

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
pop you'd have Phillip pop like a guitar

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.369 
pop you'd have Phillip pop like a guitar
string<00:03:26.340> had<00:03:27.209> there<00:03:27.359> been<00:03:27.540> anything<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.169> there

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
string had there been anything in there

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.909 
string had there been anything in there
so<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:29.459> way<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.879> works<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.419> is<00:03:31.349> it's

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
so the way that this works is is it's

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.559 
so the way that this works is is it's
pretty<00:03:32.129> simple<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.730> pull<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.090> part<00:03:33.359> down

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
pretty simple you pull this part down

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.839 
pretty simple you pull this part down
and<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.290> lay<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.590> flush<00:03:34.889> what<00:03:35.459> I'm<00:03:35.549> gonna<00:03:35.669> need

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
and you lay it flush what I'm gonna need
