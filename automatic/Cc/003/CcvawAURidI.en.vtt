this button here to open the door inside

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.470 
this button here to open the door inside
you<00:00:52.410> see<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> ring<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.120> which<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> plate

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
you see the ring on which the plate

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.400 
you see the ring on which the plate
rotates<00:00:55.280> this<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> vent<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> grill

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
rotates this is the vent for the grill

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.630 
rotates this is the vent for the grill
this<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> plate<00:00:58.859> from<00:00:59.340> where<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
this is the plate from where the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.889 
this is the plate from where the
microwaves<00:01:00.059> enter<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> cable<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.629> oven

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
microwaves enter the cable so this oven

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.070 
microwaves enter the cable so this oven
basically<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.159> output<00:01:05.519> has<00:01:05.610> 700<00:01:06.150> watts<00:01:06.360> but

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
basically the output has 700 watts but

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.469 
basically the output has 700 watts but
the<00:01:07.200> input<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.590> 1200<00:01:08.130> watts<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the input is 1200 watts so that is the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.810 
the input is 1200 watts so that is the
thing<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.780> should<00:01:09.810> consider<00:01:10.799> because<00:01:11.729> your

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
thing you should consider because your

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.440 
thing you should consider because your
electricity<00:01:12.450> consumption<00:01:12.780> depends<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
electricity consumption depends on it

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.760 
electricity consumption depends on it
the<00:01:15.450> total<00:01:15.750> weight<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.430> 11.5<00:01:17.430> kg<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.619> it<00:01:19.619> does

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the total weight is 11.5 kg and it does

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.880 
the total weight is 11.5 kg and it does
not<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.100> convection<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:21.170> baking<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
not have convection so if baking is a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
not have convection so if baking is a
main<00:01:23.070> purpose<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.210> might<00:01:24.420> avoid

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
main purpose for you you might avoid

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.469 
main purpose for you you might avoid
