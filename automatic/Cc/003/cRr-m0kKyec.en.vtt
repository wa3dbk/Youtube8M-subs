00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.240
 bia hi friends in the channel we're here 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.990
 as you see in a forest with mine 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:26.400
 generally accepts it is always said not 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:30.150
 cut the broken trees and twigs 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.820
 go in this case we will make an exception 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.970
 in fact, a friend of ours asked us 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.160
 seeing our videos he said a 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.269
 beautiful wood to cut but not 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.000
 I can use modern means of transport 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:48.250
 tractors because too steep and then 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.309
 also to respect the plants i 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.630
 animals that experience noise and therefore 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.280
 in a friendly way we have decided to 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.860
 solve them in this problem so 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.070
 I quietly cut these trees 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.600
 you see this coppice so it goes 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.490
 regularly cut every few years 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.820
 because the forest doesn't hurt but it's good 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.979
 grows better grows more lush 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.470
 otherwise too many trees and too much 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.720
 crowded like in our cities 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.110
 practically the forest more than that not 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.770
 grows up then i get to work e 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.369
 you will see what we will do on 7 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.369
 in this muscle 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.320
 ok 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.300
 follow us further and see in the 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.370
 next video what would you save 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.670
 We are friends of the channel here 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.830
 second video here is what we are 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.120
 managed to do after a few hours of 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.270
 work 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.150
 we are now finishing up this 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.840
 slide you see this is a slide for 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.400
 the wood we built this in 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.420
 within hours 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.420
 using a field frame that you 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.550
 we will show in a special video that 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.920
 will in fact deal in the field frames in 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.560
 this case was used to make one 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.850
 slide but can also be used for 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.190
 make beds on the tables of the fagots 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.489
 and we'll see how this is done here is one 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.700
 wood slide is the first part of the 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.700
 of the slide will be done with others 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.920
 pieces and practically stretch out 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.420
 up to the whole hill to bring 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.269
 the ready to the valley are ready enough 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.820
 small therefore also a structure of 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.760
 this type may be fine then 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.280
 now I will do the first test 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.680
 here is a nice freshly cut trunk 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.709
 I put it in the slide let's see if 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.709
 it works 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:26.160
 slips perfectly we see with others 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.160
 it all works pretty well 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.290
 perfect then friends of the channel I hope 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.790
 you enjoyed this ours 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.950
 realization we see our work 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.150
 it always takes place in the woods in the woods 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.109
 we are at home 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.500
 we are happy to be helpful too 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:52.799
 to friends and certainly there 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.569
 they will reciprocate courtesy when there 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.090
 you will see in the woods you will see we are in 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.510
 woods of our friends 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:03.000
 we believe we pay attention to them well and 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.919
 I hope you will soon be one of ours 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.319
