00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.220
 after the new range rover comes now the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.950
 new range rover sport doing one 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.719
 Landrover the term sport 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.150
 obviously very seriously whole four 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.449
 120 kilos has the new range rover sport 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.480
 of the vintage 2013 using 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.980
 every quantity of aluminum slimmed down 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.630
 never a range rover for itself 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.760
 light-footed and agile 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.130
 Today we are testing here in the Sauerland 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.260
 new range rover sport of the new range 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.690
 rover sport is something very special 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.210
 is usually a derivative of the range 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.340
 rovers but the range rover is also new 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.340
 and above all things is technological 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.079
 something completely new because he now has one 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.180
 complete aluminum construction 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.390
 this also applies to the range rover 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.129
 sport of the range rover sport is based on the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.469
 So far, many may not 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.989
 do not really know the range 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.699
 rover but on the discovery 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.070
 He was also cheaper 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.629
 offered and was relatively heavy 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.300
 Of course you wanted that now 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.689
 he is also based on the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.869
 Range Rover and is through the aluminum 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.880
 construction particularly easy the vehicle 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.170
 currently has three motors two 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.600
 diesel and a v8 engine gasoline and 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.759
 starts at 59,000 euros 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.830
 It is a really elegant vehicle 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.540
 he always had the elegance earlier 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.040
 which might be a bit intrusive 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.930
 now he is not quite like that anymore 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.060
 intrusive very sporty and before 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.979
 he really convinces all things 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.840
 with excellent athletic 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.509
 driving the sporty 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.880
 Driving characteristics can be said 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.970
 describe that he is very tight 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.040
 really excellent border area has 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.840
 the car has a very late one 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.509
 border area but the announces itself still 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.759
 it's fun and of course that's what makes it happen 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.369
 also for driving safety the engines 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.180
 speak for themselves a v8 is hardly 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.270
 to beat 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.820
 the sound is excellent and if you are 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.619
 then sees that vehicle 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.590
 actually suitable for cruising 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.729
 There is a great car and it glides 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.729
 will find his fans 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.420
 but he finds his fans especially 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.550
 through the well-tuned chassis and 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.870
 in interaction with the motors 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.880
 successful compromise between 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.640
 athletic hardness and that of the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.620
 Target groups expected comfort 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.540
 range rover sport shows up as well 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.940
 continue the design idea of ​​the series 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.860
 he is allowed to but because of his 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.630
 sportiness even to the modern 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.250
 drawn level can lean 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.930
 Nevertheless, he works next to his 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.459
 sportiness very massive and 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.950
 the quality of the spot is just under 15 cm shorter 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.930
 and five and a half inches shallower than 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.850
 the range rover 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.190
 he has a more inclined tailgate 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.350
 and instead of the shark gills smaller ones 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.050
 dynamic air outlets at the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.860
 The style is also pervasive 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.170
 of the interior clear lines and on the 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.690
 essential reduced operating elements 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.940
 so the number of switches was again 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.290
 halved and the passenger finds up 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.390
 on the key to the opening of the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.519
 Glove box and the wheel for the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.330
 Air vents only the big one with 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.110
 leather-covered dashboard in front of him 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.120
 especially what you get in the restaurant 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.190
 athletes have achieved weight savings 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.930
 The car is 440 kilograms lighter than 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.010
 the predecessor thereby have of course 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.019
 completely different possibilities in the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.790
 driving dynamics while consuming everything car 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.380
 is as athletic as never before and also 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.970
 at the same time as economical as never before 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.590
 the range rover sport was sooner 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.480
 she level gave our bestseller that 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.010
 top model in our program 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.570
 and he will probably get back on his feet 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.450
 place two back we have fight 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.560
 now about 1000 range rover 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.720
 Comparative period about 3000 range 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.760
 rover sport and in the relationship not 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.170
 we also kept it up 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.790
 be three different at the beginning 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.560
 Engines on offer have two diesel engines 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.470
 Gasoline at the diesel we each have 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.750
 three liters of engines have one 258 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.260
 ps the other the greater power 292 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.410
 ps 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.519
 our top model is the 58 supercharged 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.150
 with 510 ps 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.489
 the prices start at 59 1600 euro for 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.650
 the ttv 6 supercharge the top model 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.650
 costs at least 88 1600 euro 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.360
 even if you use it much more often 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.519
 the côte d'azur or in california 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.199
 will also be in germany 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.600
 the car sure the fan base 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.979
 Enlarge help because the entry is 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.350
 by the evoque already easier 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.500
 become 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.410
 in the 292 ps variant the accelerates 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.610
 v6 the sport in 7.2 seconds on tempo 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:40.530
 100 and creates 222 km according to the plant 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:43.020
 h tip at prices from 59 1600 euro 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.940
 the goals are safely achieved 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.010
 because the discovery is good 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.010
 equipped priced already very close
