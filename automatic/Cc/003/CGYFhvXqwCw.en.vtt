00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.279
 to fix it 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.529
 good evening welcome to this temple 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.380
 of knowledge is clear in the forest of 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.470
 obscurantism because today we have a 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.599
 intellectual of shaft christine spider 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.599
 [Music] 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.570
 let's start right now with the pse cut is 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.150
 I explain them are very easy rules and 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.800
 basic for each answer that you do not 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.380
 you know you 're taking off a garment ok 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.410
 [Music] 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.770
 [Applause] 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.350
 the first question says well who is the 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.940
 character that we are seeing in the photo 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:50.860
 in the snapshot has a potential and 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:53.309
 the answer center is where 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.309
 we start 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.560
 [Applause] 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.550
 [Music] 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.550
 Y 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.280
 the second question you say what's it called 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.229
 rather the presidential candidate of 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.509
 the alternative alliance pablo longueira 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:18.030
 alternative of andrés allamand and 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.030
 alternative c manuel josé ossandón 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.140
 efe 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.140
 5 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.860
 now for backdrop context longueira 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.860
 the answer unfortunately is 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.860
 incorrect 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.799
 love me so little my love none of the 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.260
 three the presidential candidate of the 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.260
 alliance is evelyn matthei 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:59.659
 scientific and we go for the third and with 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.570
 many agencies that answer well 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.200
 lies reordering the letters of the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.810
 word risk okey risk you do not 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.910
 about what name of a balloon own 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:18.280
 can be generated if you reorder the 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.280
 letters of the word rivers sergio 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.630
 unfortunately correct 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.670
 you know so we can go back to politics 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.549
 because if we do not, we're not going to fly it like 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.209
 the president of venezuela calls for prayer 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:38.530
 before josé pepe mujica nicolás maduro or 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.530

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.670
 Amen 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.980

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.240
 [Applause] 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.040
 hugo chávez is dead and not dead 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:04.260
 with you he died in the little black skirt of 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.260
 world with nothing far away 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.069
 let's go with the little skirt we go for the 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.069
 skirt 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.030
 now 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.730
 the basis of the love note 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.330
 they report that the next question is 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:29.590
 down there now I do not know if I learn 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.470

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.400

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.070

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.169
 [Applause] 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.310
 this is my part 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.660
 we only contemplate the artistic beauty to 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.310
 interior times now I opened my mouth 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.669

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.669
 pancreas 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.110
