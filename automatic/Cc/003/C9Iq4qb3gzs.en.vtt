it's<00:02:59.129> a<00:02:59.190> very<00:02:59.370> hard<00:02:59.459> job<00:02:59.549> at<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.879> same<00:03:00.060> time<00:03:00.239> it

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
it's a very hard job at the same time it

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.100

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
foot back there and then you can just

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.920 
foot back there and then you can just
turn<00:03:05.640> if<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.060> really<00:03:06.360> needs<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.629> do<00:03:06.780> that

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
it is brilliant for just about

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.229 
it is brilliant for just about
everything

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
everything

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.039 
everything
virtually<00:03:15.239> this<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.540> just<00:03:15.780> like<00:03:15.930> the

virtually this is just like the

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.250 
virtually this is just like the
all-in-one<00:03:16.739> board<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:18.060> has<00:03:18.260> perfect

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
something it's concave is perfect its

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.080 
something it's concave is perfect its
weight<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:31.139> perfect<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:32.069> not<00:03:32.220> heavy<00:03:32.400> with

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
weight is perfect it's not heavy with

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.470 
weight is perfect it's not heavy with
this<00:03:33.239> board<00:03:33.450> I've<00:03:33.599> no<00:03:33.930> felt<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.739> in<00:03:35.010> control

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
this board I've no felt so in control

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.740 
this board I've no felt so in control
and<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.840> have<00:03:36.989> tried<00:03:37.319> quite<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.069> few<00:03:38.340> boards<00:03:39.120> it's

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
and I have tried quite a few boards it's

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.069 
and I have tried quite a few boards it's
the<00:03:39.840> perfect<00:03:40.019> board<00:03:40.349> for<00:03:40.410> me<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:40.980> I'm<00:03:41.790> 5<00:03:42.780> foot

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
the perfect board for me and I'm 5 foot

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.390 
the perfect board for me and I'm 5 foot
8<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:44.299> 115<00:03:45.299> pounds<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.950> if<00:03:47.130> you're<00:03:47.310> around

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
8 and 115 pounds so if you're around

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.430 
8 and 115 pounds so if you're around
that<00:03:47.700> then<00:03:48.389> you<00:03:48.720> should<00:03:48.930> know<00:03:49.079> that<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:49.349> would

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
that then you should know that it would

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.170 
that then you should know that it would
be<00:03:49.500> perfect<00:03:49.919> for<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.280> too<00:03:50.519> but<00:03:50.880> if<00:03:51.060> you're

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
be perfect for you too but if you're

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.490 
be perfect for you too but if you're
gonna<00:03:51.299> get<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.630> anywhere<00:03:51.930> near<00:03:52.109> not<00:03:52.260> around

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
gonna get it anywhere near not around

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.409 
gonna get it anywhere near not around

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
that then I just wouldn't even worry

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.140 
that then I just wouldn't even worry
because<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:55.169> mean<00:03:55.889> I've<00:03:56.639> seen<00:03:56.760> other<00:03:57.000> people

brilliant for them as well and it's just
if<00:04:01.109> you're<00:04:01.200> gonna<00:04:01.319> get<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:01.769> you<00:04:01.980> could<00:04:02.099> just

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
if you're gonna get this you could just

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.580 
if you're gonna get this you could just
can't<00:04:02.430> go<00:04:02.579> wrong<00:04:02.870> with<00:04:03.870> any<00:04:04.109> other<00:04:04.319> board<00:04:04.470> you

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
can't go wrong with any other board you

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.990 
can't go wrong with any other board you
just<00:04:04.650> can't<00:04:04.980> go<00:04:05.130> wrong<00:04:05.160> just<00:04:07.340> this<00:04:08.340> this<00:04:08.880> is

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
just can't go wrong just this this is

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.809 
just can't go wrong just this this is
like<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.209> god<00:04:10.069> okay<00:04:11.069> so<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.310> weaknesses<00:04:11.790> of

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
like a god okay so the weaknesses of

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.009 
like a god okay so the weaknesses of
this<00:04:12.090> board

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.420 

I<00:04:20.380> guess<00:04:21.380> it's<00:04:21.650> expensive

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
I guess it's expensive

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.040 
I guess it's expensive
uh<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:25.220> would<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:25.729> be<00:04:25.910> worth<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.210> price<00:04:26.360> okay

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
uh it would so be worth the price okay

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.290 
uh it would so be worth the price okay
I<00:04:27.080> would<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:27.740> advise<00:04:28.160> you<00:04:28.460> on<00:04:28.490> saving<00:04:29.150> up<00:04:29.270> for

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
I would so advise you on saving up for

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.150 
I would so advise you on saving up for
this<00:04:29.599> board<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:30.289> would<00:04:30.590> recommend<00:04:30.919> this<00:04:30.979> board
