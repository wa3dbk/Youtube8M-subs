00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.920
 don't really have the best firth 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.700
 of course because for example have none 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.469
 focus for that may also be called in it 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.090

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.780
 shit the start guys this start is that 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.240
 we normally man 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.189

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.499
 I can't get through of course 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.460
 be through all those things what they don't care about 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.990
 have thrown me a head as yet 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.310
 fairly automatically gone man 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.920
 because I have that is technical and I have 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.299
 but that grenade-like resist thingy 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.340
 also a clear you that is one 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.959
 score snare and now I have gone for the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.940
 other two score is and then I have to 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.080
 both again 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.670
 so of course I hope it will work 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.350
 I rely on little less and I have to 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.580
 just be careful that we can 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.900

 of course you don't want to die anymore 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.870
 I also have no deadlines or anything 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.870
 the mood is those standards 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.520

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.950
 point that was really brilliant elephant 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.380

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.130
 gryphon 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.560

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.280

 about out 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.440
 I can imagine this arrow yet 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.430
 a call but the problem is therefore me 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.660
 actually had to score twice my score 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.760
 strings aleman that i am the one ever 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.489
 IJsselstreek because I now get up 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.169
 so first call them because otherwise about 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.080
 lex of course but that is now one 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.880
 I can also roux down more thing with roux 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.169
 I can also call you in now 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.550
 make kills then the team goes 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.390
 members pass so faster 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.130
 if the only thing after 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.350
 what I have now, but that's just the way it is 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.370
 I can do nothing about it 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.780
 but that does n't matter I like it 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.820
 sometime instructions sit man 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.320
 it is I really just never really top 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.390
 call of duty ghosts is one of the 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.680
 very first time in this kind of bows 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.940
 I also like boys once in a while 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.710
 there is another one running 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.300
 you can go outside then you die 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.070
 nice and smart boy like a helicopter 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.720
 in the air then walk out 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.980
 brilliant capable of drinking to tropical like 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.580
 k see you see she just took through the wall 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.170
 out 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.730
 so of course nice a lot I have 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.380
 also and they go to 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.810
 pan condition can see you can see them all 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.160
 nice to see ironically the thing is also open 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.940
 pretty strong if I may 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.050
 say 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.580
 this is like a man standing all of them 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.140
 within 1 2 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.550
 I can also pick 3 because as a number 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.380
 three can also pick up, I'm going to laugh no 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.090
 ok i can also get out if i square 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.380
 keep pressed yes ok no we can 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.820
 let's try killing it up 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.290
 grab with my 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.300
 With my m I of course show you because we 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.340
 must try own i have no focus 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.510
 man must try it out so again 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.520
 to get my score sticks on that yet 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.870
 a bit nicer than the big question but we 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.270
 can already try guys that one 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.400
 hot broken to broken also still 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.720
 guys i don't know if my team is that 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.740
 have understood but that does not matter 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.370
 I'll just go to the other side 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.080
 the map 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.750
 and chances still overtake man scorsese I 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.230
 hope man will succeed it as one 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.810
 keep going now that's no 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.520
 want an m7 second moto with and m27 la 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.960
 see that's that thing you can't do anything there 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.760
 against doing so easy is that thing 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.440
 so strong boy that is no longer normal 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.610
 thus there is if you shoot with it 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.830
 just a dick right away and now we go 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.450
 bad man go away guys you have now 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.770

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.300
 therefore had alecto he is sitting there 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.440
 all the time and he already made me one 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.450
 chilled a few times 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.710
 but i put one of these away the by that they 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.810

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.190
 I wanted to find emmy's boys after and 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.320
 Combs Scorsese still get more time 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.360
 man still have to make 10 kills 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.010
 and then last game and I 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.180
 at least 11 kills follow my needs for 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.900
 it is not possible to do this
