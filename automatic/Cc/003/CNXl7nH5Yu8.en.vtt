go<00:02:11.009> all<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.220> way<00:02:11.340> down<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.540> number<00:02:12.870> four<00:02:13.230> as

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
go all the way down to number four as

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.289 
go all the way down to number four as
you<00:02:13.769> can<00:02:13.920> see<00:02:14.099> there<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.819> as<00:02:14.909> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.150> see

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
you can see there so as you can see

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.759 
you can see there so as you can see
that's<00:02:15.390> now<00:02:15.629> pointed<00:02:16.110> at<00:02:16.230> number<00:02:16.530> four<00:02:16.739> and

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
that's now pointed at number four and

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.949 
that's now pointed at number four and
the<00:02:17.040> lever<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.580> still<00:02:17.849> right<00:02:18.030> up<00:02:18.060> here<00:02:18.450> now<00:02:18.900> to

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
the lever is still right up here now to

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.500 
the lever is still right up here now to
use<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:20.280> reset<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.909> neutral

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
use this to reset to neutral

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.360 
use this to reset to neutral
rather<00:02:21.959> than<00:02:22.200> coming<00:02:22.680> down<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.010> slowing<00:02:23.220> down

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
rather than coming down to slowing down

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.770 
rather than coming down to slowing down
to<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.610> sharp<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:23.970> then<00:02:24.060> clicking<00:02:24.300> back<00:02:24.600> up

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.450 
to a sharp and then clicking back up
with<00:02:25.200> your<00:02:25.350> leaver<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.920> try<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.250> find<00:02:26.430> neutral

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
with your leaver to try and find neutral

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.180 
with your leaver to try and find neutral
as<00:02:27.520> as<00:02:28.330> you're<00:02:28.660> coming<00:02:28.870> up<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.680> stop<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:30.130> a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
as as you're coming up to a stop to a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.530

something<00:02:31.990> similar<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.620> simply<00:02:32.950> put<00:02:33.100> the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
something similar you simply put the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.430 
something similar you simply put the
heel<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.550> your<00:02:33.580> foot<00:02:33.850> on<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.240> press<00:02:35.170> down

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
heel of your foot on and press down

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.520 
heel of your foot on and press down
right<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.460> way<00:02:36.580> down<00:02:36.610> until<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.420> stops<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:38.110> the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
right the way down until it stops on the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.470 
right the way down until it stops on the
eccentric<00:02:38.890> cam<00:02:39.370> adjuster<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.270> see

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
eccentric cam adjuster that you see

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.370 
eccentric cam adjuster that you see
there<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.830> is<00:02:42.010> how<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.220> adjust<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:43.380> to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
there this is how you adjust it to

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.010 
there this is how you adjust it to
ensure<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.520> stops<00:02:45.880> at<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.360> neutral<00:02:46.810> and

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
ensure that it stops at the neutral and

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.350 
ensure that it stops at the neutral and
not<00:02:47.290> going<00:02:47.470> into<00:02:47.650> first<00:02:48.010> or<00:02:48.280> second<00:02:48.820> because

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
not going into first or second because

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.780 
not going into first or second because
it<00:02:49.660> will<00:02:49.780> need<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.020> little<00:02:50.440> bit<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.680> fine-tuning

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
it will need a little bit of fine-tuning

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.300 
it will need a little bit of fine-tuning
so<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.510> undo<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:53.020> front<00:02:53.320> bolt<00:02:53.530> turn<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
so you undo this front bolt turn the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.670 
so you undo this front bolt turn the
eccentric<00:02:54.790> cam<00:02:55.000> until<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:56.020> stops<00:02:56.470> it's

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
eccentric cam until that stops it's

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.620 
eccentric cam until that stops it's
exactly<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.310> right<00:02:57.430> place<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.030> then<00:02:58.420> tighten

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
exactly the right place and then tighten

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.770 
exactly the right place and then tighten
it<00:02:58.810> back<00:02:58.960> up<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.680> as<00:02:59.770> you<00:02:59.860> can<00:03:00.010> see<00:03:00.220> there

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
it back up and as you can see there

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.910 
it back up and as you can see there
we're<00:03:01.780> back<00:03:01.960> in<00:03:02.140> neutral<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.800> wheel

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
we're back in neutral and the wheel

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.200 
we're back in neutral and the wheel
spinning<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.730> takes<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.030> back<00:03:04.060> to

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
spinning and that takes you back to

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:14.970 
spinning and that takes you back to
neutral<00:03:04.600> between<00:03:04.720> first<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.290> second

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.310 

and<00:03:16.150> one<00:03:17.150> of<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.390> little<00:03:17.540> useful<00:03:17.900> feature

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
and one of the little useful feature

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.630 
and one of the little useful feature
that<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.590> lot<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.800> people<00:03:19.160> don't<00:03:19.310> realize

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
that a lot of people don't realize

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.640 
that a lot of people don't realize
because<00:03:20.270> this<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.570> only<00:03:20.720> designed<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.320> be<00:03:21.440> used

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
because this is only designed to be used

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.380 
because this is only designed to be used
with<00:03:21.890> heel<00:03:22.220> of<00:03:22.370> your<00:03:22.400> boot<00:03:22.610> in<00:03:22.850> second<00:03:23.210> third

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
first gear set off and then have to come

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.570 
first gear set off and then have to come
to<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:28.970> stop<00:03:30.010> I'm<00:03:31.010> just<00:03:31.220> going<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.459> demonstrate

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
to a stop I'm just going to demonstrate

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.430 
to a stop I'm just going to demonstrate
here<00:03:32.240> by<00:03:32.620> walking<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.770> first<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:35.440> hopefully

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
here by walking to first and hopefully

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.199 
here by walking to first and hopefully
so<00:03:36.950> that<00:03:37.130> let<00:03:37.220> me<00:03:37.250> just<00:03:37.310> do<00:03:37.550> that<00:03:37.580> again<00:03:37.730> for

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
so that let me just do that again for

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.530 
so that let me just do that again for
you<00:03:38.300> and<00:03:38.990> you'll<00:03:39.350> see<00:03:39.670> now<00:03:40.670> what<00:03:40.880> happens<00:03:41.300> is

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
you and you'll see now what happens is

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.930 
you and you'll see now what happens is
is<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.110> little<00:03:42.380> point<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.830> this<00:03:42.980> this<00:03:43.459> slot<00:03:43.790> of

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
is the little point of this this slot of

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.850 
is the little point of this this slot of
the<00:03:44.000> back<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.360> actually<00:03:44.750> widened<00:03:45.260> top<00:03:45.680> and

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
the back is actually widened top and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.340 
the back is actually widened top and
bottom<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.209> allows<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.690> pointer<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:48.200> move

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
bottom so it allows the pointer to move

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.020 
bottom so it allows the pointer to move
up<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.620> down<00:03:48.680> just<00:03:49.070> that<00:03:49.220> little<00:03:49.550> bit<00:03:49.730> to

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
up and down just that little bit to

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.420 
up and down just that little bit to
indicate<00:03:50.450> first<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.770> the<00:03:51.890> pointer<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.310> now

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
indicate first so the pointer is now

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.520 
indicate first so the pointer is now
pointing<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.910> fast<00:03:53.150> gear<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:53.989> as<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.320> can<00:03:54.470> see

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
pointing it fast gear and as you can see

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.250 
pointing it fast gear and as you can see
that's<00:03:54.980> locked<00:03:55.340> now<00:03:56.180> pressing<00:03:56.630> down<00:03:56.959> on<00:03:56.989> this

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
that's locked now pressing down on this

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.350 
that's locked now pressing down on this
won't<00:03:57.470> do<00:03:57.620> anything<00:03:57.890> or<00:03:58.310> what<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.610> can<00:03:58.940> do<00:03:59.180> is

won't do anything or what you can do is

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.140 
won't do anything or what you can do is
