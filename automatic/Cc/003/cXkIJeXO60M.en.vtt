00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.250
 hello welcome to this review inside 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.620
 air where we bring you a device 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.970
 really interesting normally 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.590
 our phones do not get 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.450
 complete the day but before they are 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.500
 finish the battery with the batteries 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.850
 external of nokia dc 16 and dc 19 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.859
 we will get an increase of 2200 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.350
 milliamps for the first and 3200 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.330
 milliamps for the second this 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.830
 suppose we can have up to two and 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.750
 three charges of what our phone 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.050
 could perform normally with only one 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.210
 drums 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.220
 These two models are compatible with 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.989
 all phones on the market except 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.030
 with apple with which if you want 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.460
 increase the duration of your samsung from your 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.860
 htc or your sony you can also buy 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.629
 this Nokia battery as we see it 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.060
 They sell different colors among which 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:56.550
 we highlight the red blue black and white 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.220
 both model 10 and 19 with the model 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.380
 of 16 have an attractive design 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.910
 circular that is represented by the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.520
 same colors that we find in the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.350
 line range of the same brand to open 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.630
 the box we will have to remove the tab 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.440
 from the top and pull the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.810
 above compartment 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.550
 inside we will find a cardboard 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.920
 white that contains all the elements 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.250
 needed to be able to work this 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.520
 battery model 13 16 has a weight of 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.530
 only 75 grams while that of 19 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.320
 It rises to 78 grams 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.690
 the f-16 model the most economical of 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.220
 the two will take about 300 to load 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.100
 minutes until full filling 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.180
 while the model of 13 19 will take 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.400
 only 200 minutes 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.470
 inside the box along with the 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.880
 other components we can find the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.620
 user manuals where we are given 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.630
 recommendations on how to prolong the 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.490
 life of our battery as well as the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.659
 guarantee that Nokia provides 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.670
 let's remember it's two years 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.039
 in a plastic bag in the part 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.280
 front of the white cardboard we will find 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.399
 the battery as we see comes wrapped in 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.140
 a plastic and has a circular design 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.450
 To the touch we can say that the plastic 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.640
 It seems of quite good quality as well 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.280
 you have the Nokia logo engraved on 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.410
 relief if you look at the ports and 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.599
 connections in each of the parties 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.970
 we have one of the ports in this case 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.799
 in this part is the mini usb port and 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.140
 in this other the usb port to load 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.239
 our device in the case of the 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.410
 ce battery 19 both ports 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.410
 find in one place 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.700
 the battery has a moderate weight that 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.109
 without being too heavy nor it is lightweight 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.239
 what we can leave forgetting 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.069
 carry it in your pockets however if 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.319
 we carry something with us as 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.090
 a bag or a backpack yes we can 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.069
 Carry this accessory and make sure that 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.069
 the battery will last us all day 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.219
 A cable is included in the package 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.870
 microusb to usb to properly load the 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.480
 battery from our computer or from 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.730
 our charger with usb or else charge 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.640
 our device from the battery 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.340
 this cable as we can see is very short 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.890
 in the case of the f-16 battery we 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.409
 will provide a current of 950 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.209
 milliamps while that of c 19 us 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.209
 will provide 1200 milliamps 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.880
 using another cable we can also 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.130
 charge both devices at the same time 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.620
 both the Nokia battery and our 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.840
 phone in this case we will take a cable 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.150
 auxiliary not included and we will connect it to 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.040
 our charger or to our computer and 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.720
 on the other side we will introduce the cable 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.200
 included to connect it to our 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.200
 phone 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.739
 as we can see in our image 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.540
 phone that was running out 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.370
 battery right now it's charging 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.760
 using the power of the batteries of 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.439
 nokia 13 16 and dc 19 we'll just have to 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.090
 leave it connected and we can use 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.420
 our phone perfectly while 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.420
 it is loaded 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.590
 on top of the two batteries 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.870
 we will find in the part where 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.969
 connects to external power 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.829
 small lights that will show us the 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.439
 charge that the battery currently has 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.139
 for example in this example we can see 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.480
 As the battery is full to more than 50% 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.280
 so we can perfectly control the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.500
 loads that we have left and not stay without 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.870
 unexpectedly battery 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.060
 we are usually tempted to buy 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.160
 batteries of unknown brands due to 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.750
 its low price but the truth in the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.910
 performance tests of these batteries 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.430
 from Nokia I have found that they work 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.620
 much better than those batteries like that 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.690
 example with the number 920 that is the one 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.700
 we can see on the screen I had for 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.280
 charge the phone up to twice and 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.080
 mean that is about 8 hours of use 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.870
 which usually makes the device I 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.580
 could perform up to 26 or 27 hours 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.580
 only with one charge of this battery 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.270
 in the case of nokia lumia 1520 that already 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.830
 of itself has an incredible battery 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.540
 increases its duration to almost double 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.390
 of what the device can handle 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.520
 default 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.950
