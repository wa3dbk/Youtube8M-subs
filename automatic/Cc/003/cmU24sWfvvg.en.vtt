00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.529
 girls how are good guys because 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.769
 I imagine that many times and videos of 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.030
 as well 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.790
 it's my second video 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.189
 in fact, letting me know and improve a 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.170
 little bit what is the process of 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.810
 transition in 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.910
 the people who were told that 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.630
 they cut the chest or those that did not 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.240
 they wanted to do as this is my case 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.099
 and I just finished washing my hair with 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.150
 products that previously had 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.580
 mentioned in the previous video 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.940
 It turns out that I washed my hair with 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.890
 shampoo of share per fer 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.840
 compared to the shampoos that I had 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.120
 used previously 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.800
 use the gentle shampoo I will not bring it closer 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.960
 because as the lens is bringing me closer 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.649
 here he is focused 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.050
 the soft one is here 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.460
 in mind that I tried the shampoo a lot 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.950
 and the conditioner does not 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.660
 the conditioner put my hair a 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.660
 little bit like sevilla with a little 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.640
 appreciate here because I do not know if you can notice 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.940
 but from here down is the dog 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.950
 to the hoist and this whole part of here is the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.600
 so if you can see it but more or 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.790
 less if you are in the process go 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.220
 to understand it 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.410
 that when dealing conditioner 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.730
 soft that does not work so try this one 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.670
 They agree that he had told them he had 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.060
 listened to the recommendation did not either 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.720
 pro I do not care but almost the same but 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.910
 when I compare my natural hair 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.890
 generalized if he could notice that he was making a 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.890
 good effect on straightened hair 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.480
 rinse the hair but previously it is 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.630
 before I forgot I had used the 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.860
 mask 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.050
 we are treating our hair that we have 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.730
 especially softness that are 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.010
 it turns out with our hair that a little 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.810
 dry 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.270
 the dell streak de mai I do not know if it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.490
 they agree that is good 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.069
 tremendous this mask 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.200
 and when I muggle it but I was 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.349
 well smooth then I put on the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.069
 13m conditioner and is the only one that 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.530
 it hurts but well 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.939
 and with the advice of the girls of 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.939
 do it by part so that it does not 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.700
 unravel and after 13 I did so 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.280
 what 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.620
 a note and that is 13 m is for 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.010
 crowley hair 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.440
 what happens that like all the hair does not 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.909
 is completely curled or the effect is not 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.000
 it will be the same but through the process of 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:45.569
 transition this works pretty well 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.920
 Now I'm going to put some 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.260
 living of the products that had 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.940
 previously taught a little oil 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.450
 as I had told you earlier that 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.450
 it is macadamia and coconut oil the living 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.190
 that 's the only thing I'm going to put me 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.320
 I'm going to leave a little with the towel 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.330
 try when you are going to dry with 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.260
 the pole accelerates like this 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.150
 or rub you but otherwise well 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.400
 then I'm going to do 630 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.310
 I will show you another video 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.540
 then I have the braid already made and how 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.670
 I wrap it 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.189
 by then dawn tomorrow a little 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.170
 with the air that gives you to understand 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.819
 that all the hair is curled instead of 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.510
 go to the lounge 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.459
 perform my hair with blow and with 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.739
 iron so you can see that both 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.920
 they're the same, I 'm going to do it 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.670
 way to get used to the step and 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.670
 to curly hair 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.379
 jealous 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.739
 this 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.530
 d 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.020
 or soft hair and also he 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.840
 I mixed it a little bit 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.680
 in the end I put him as a little 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.490
 ah 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:55.050
 like wet or wet hair 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.389
 as it was in process that two but that 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.889
 is already being done and 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.370
 mostly when the hair is due to 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.020
 perform 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.470
 what they are doing is stronger but 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.470
 point 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.880
 Occasional that with which we are not in 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.880
 3d 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:28.670
 and then then proceed to catch them 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.670
 the elderly 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.160
 a return 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.960
 does not have 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.920
 to the level you want and everything 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.870
 it depends on how long he is 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.100
 to me as I want it to last me a lot 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.250
 because I'm not doing it 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.250
 braids all the times 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.250
 until 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.530
 yes 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.430
 scarf or if you like to leave it like that to me 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.430
 like to cover it 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:30.940
 and if it happens all day 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.940
 there are people who like to go out with 3a 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.160
 there are people who get 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.450
 I'm going to take at least some 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.450
 the final result 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.500
 and I get new products that I 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.020
 progress if you want or write 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:25.050
 know them their opinions 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.400
 He had said before the process 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:34.129
 transition for the people we leave 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:39.129
 grow 

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:40.719
 without giving us service it 's a bit difficult 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:43.539
 have people who are going through the 

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:45.669
 same situation as you give us advice 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:48.429
 mutually helps us to make it happen 

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:52.380
 this transition in a super way 

00:07:48.429 --> 00:07:56.510
 extra friend archi positive 

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.510
 say a lot to everyone
