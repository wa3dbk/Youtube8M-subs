00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.240
 at that time there was a program at the age of 16 that divided into 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.270
 I have used the speech very intensively for three years in a row 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.550
 Friends that has just evolved over the years sometime came 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.100
 then the first long-distance trips, especially to North America to Canada 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:21.300
 and from there to the episode then Mary Cottbus goes up Peru's streets and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.179
 Fits the go up to 5000 meters while that was supposed to charm with 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.999
 drive a car over his passport 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.549
 a decree that of course the incredible quality of nature and 

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:35.690
 Kayak through the paddles between the big ice floes 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.570
 that was very very impressive very special experience 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.700
 my name is Thomas Merker I am 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.370
 responsible for vehicle construction for a number of years 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.510
 new money advice 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.270
 as leader of the series 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.920
 we are here in the mountain Bremen here is the RCA produced 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.479
 but the corner is 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.989
 a very challenging task 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.110
 a comfortable it in Vienna 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.950
 to create but also a sporty vehicle to represent that driving pleasure 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.060
 conveys a high degree of robustness and also at the same time 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.930
 To drive skills outside the paved roads so be that 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.920
 should be called that pro football world 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.540
 I was very pleasant that the vehicle just follow a great 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.280
 that's something for me 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.640
 personally always 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.460
 Involving Phil has something to do with the color, however 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.200
 even with engineering knowledge it's their bike trial and error and someday 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.500
 Then we told the dolls Bolt that we are satisfied and that's the way it is for both of us 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.690
 it's own this conclusion already is it be it's fast in the morning 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.160
 At first he embodies the language that makes the language an art as well 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.000
 and that includes big racers because I think they make big wheels 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.010
 new vehicle visually attractive 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.200
 there always when something new arises, of course, first 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.910
 surprise effects in England is felt 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.120
 Of course, this encouragement, in particular, will be felt 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.970
 Of course, these animals confirmed that quite often courageous 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.650
 Decisions are also effective 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.229
 Also for that reason we have incredible demand for the motto 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.640
 already have and also our internal solution the thing quite critical 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.640
 massive on what he gets the car as well 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:27.199
 Papenburg is a downhill Mercedes is there's high speed 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:29.249
 Somalia percent up 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.109
 One can vehicles clips top speed of up to 2 50 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.809
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.450
 such a watery one is a complete jester vehicles 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.789
 at high speeds 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.059
 when they are not ready to go 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.879
 when noises vehicles 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.879
 after a long straight can 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.159
 that should have because we do not accept it 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.079
 but just continue straight ahead 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.079
 Now you can use them as normal cars 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:05.999
 this is natural 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:09.670
 Albiol Kunst on work development license and all driving behavior too 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.609
 realize 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.200
 but the morals important as reserves to keep in mind the vehicle again 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.659
 breaks out or even into a private so the driver of the team should spot the commercial 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.249
 improved 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:24.990
 Replacement of the vehicle we need a blender and so-called countries 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.309
 Keith countries are Scandinavia 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:28.879
 every winter 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.299
 be carried out winterproof 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.639
 what the initiators are avoiding between Tüßling Dubai or in South Africa 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:38.189
 partly also in North America 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.209
 we are very confident i assume there will be no big ones 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.509
 Knowledge of the new findings 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.389
 if you are with a vehicle 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.869
 in the end its its manifestation there must ensure that one 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:53.269
 Mercedes is born 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.519
 then you have to 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.909
 a certain 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.829
 Love have a certain inclination for the car manufacturer also to drive one 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.139
 Vehicle and when driving he lives the the whole of the vehicle and 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.749
 that's why I do that very often and percent a bit 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.889
 The wealth of experience grows with every drive home
