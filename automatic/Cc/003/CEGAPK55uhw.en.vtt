00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
the past couple years at Bouma we've

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.770 
the past couple years at Bouma we've
been<00:00:15.010> working<00:00:15.250> on<00:00:15.369> this<00:00:16.090> collection<00:00:16.360> called

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
been working on this collection called

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.390 
been working on this collection called
the<00:00:16.840> fossa<00:00:17.050> collection<00:00:17.529> to<00:00:17.920> create<00:00:18.039> running

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
the fossa collection to create running

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.550 
the fossa collection to create running
shoes<00:00:18.610> that<00:00:18.880> our<00:00:19.840> building<00:00:20.140> the<00:00:20.199> philosophy

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
shoes that our building the philosophy

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.450 
shoes that our building the philosophy
of<00:00:20.589> less<00:00:20.800> is<00:00:20.949> more

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
of less is more

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.060 
of less is more
we<00:00:21.699> created<00:00:22.150> a<00:00:22.179> numbering<00:00:22.480> system<00:00:22.599> that<00:00:23.199> to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
we created a numbering system that to

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.040 
we created a numbering system that to
give<00:00:24.250> an<00:00:24.369> idea<00:00:24.669> of<00:00:24.939> where<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.269> Schuette<00:00:25.689> was

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
give an idea of where the Schuette was

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.439 
give an idea of where the Schuette was
that<00:00:26.230> in<00:00:26.410> terms<00:00:26.650> of<00:00:26.800> cushioning<00:00:27.160> from<00:00:27.880> zero<00:00:28.150> to

rocker shape of the stool the strolling
actually<00:00:41.559> it<00:00:41.649> doesn't<00:00:41.800> have<00:00:42.010> a<00:00:42.039> flat<00:00:42.280> slot<00:00:42.609> so

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
actually it doesn't have a flat slot so

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.479 
actually it doesn't have a flat slot so
as<00:00:43.449> you<00:00:43.600> come<00:00:43.719> through<00:00:44.039> you<00:00:45.039> strike<00:00:45.340> the

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
as you come through you strike the

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.069 
as you come through you strike the
ground<00:00:45.699> and<00:00:46.090> you<00:00:46.180> roll<00:00:46.359> through<00:00:46.570> effortlessly

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
ground and you roll through effortlessly

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.240 
ground and you roll through effortlessly
there's<00:00:47.350> no<00:00:47.440> point<00:00:47.680> where<00:00:47.829> it's<00:00:47.920> gonna<00:00:48.010> slow

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
there's no point where it's gonna slow

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.860 
there's no point where it's gonna slow
you<00:00:48.309> down<00:00:48.489> at<00:00:48.670> all<00:00:48.760> so<00:00:49.359> the<00:00:49.510> center<00:00:49.750> of<00:00:49.780> gravity

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
you down at all so the center of gravity

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.319 
you down at all so the center of gravity
in<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.350> shoe<00:00:50.559> is<00:00:50.620> actually<00:00:51.070> closer<00:00:51.969> to<00:00:52.120> the

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
in the shoe is actually closer to the

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.790 
in the shoe is actually closer to the
actual<00:00:52.660> center<00:00:53.079> of<00:00:53.109> the<00:00:53.199> shoes<00:00:53.440> it's<00:00:53.620> around

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
actual center of the shoes it's around

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.529 
actual center of the shoes it's around
about<00:00:53.890> here<00:00:54.219> where<00:00:54.460> a<00:00:54.730> lot<00:00:55.059> of<00:00:55.180> traditional

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
about here where a lot of traditional

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.569 
about here where a lot of traditional
running<00:00:55.719> shoes<00:00:56.050> it's<00:00:56.260> actually<00:00:56.679> back<00:00:57.190> much

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
running shoes it's actually back much

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.060 
running shoes it's actually back much
farther<00:00:57.789> what<00:00:58.420> we<00:00:58.570> want<00:00:58.809> is<00:00:58.989> to<00:00:59.019> allow<00:01:00.010> the

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
farther what we want is to allow the

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.860 
farther what we want is to allow the
foot<00:01:00.460> tech<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:00.969> what's<00:01:01.120> natural<00:01:01.480> econo

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
foot tech and what's natural econo

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.439 
foot tech and what's natural econo
so<00:01:02.350> having<00:01:03.129> a<00:01:03.190> more<00:01:03.370> center<00:01:03.699> to<00:01:03.910> point<00:01:04.210> of

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
so having a more center to point of

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.420 
so having a more center to point of
gravity<00:01:05.080> allows<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.830> land<00:01:06.010> in<00:01:06.220> a<00:01:06.280> more

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
gravity allows you to land in a more

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.640 
gravity allows you to land in a more
centered<00:01:06.730> way<00:01:06.910> the<00:01:07.420> Flex<00:01:07.630> is<00:01:07.810> based<00:01:08.350> on<00:01:08.530> this

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
centered way the Flex is based on this

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.620 
centered way the Flex is based on this
360<00:01:09.250> flex<00:01:09.520> story<00:01:09.760> so<00:01:10.030> from<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.270> bottom<00:01:10.540> you

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
360 flex story so from the bottom you

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.970 
360 flex story so from the bottom you
can<00:01:10.750> see<00:01:10.900> that<00:01:11.080> there's<00:01:11.260> flex<00:01:11.620> grooves<00:01:11.740> all

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
can see that there's flex grooves all

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.560 
can see that there's flex grooves all
the<00:01:12.070> way<00:01:12.160> around<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:13.000> then<00:01:13.120> as<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.330> look<00:01:13.390> at

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
the way around and then as you look at

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.150 
the way around and then as you look at
the<00:01:13.660> top<00:01:13.810> of<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:13.960> join<00:01:14.110> those<00:01:14.800> flex<00:01:15.070> grooves

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
the top of the join those flex grooves

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.010 
the top of the join those flex grooves
also<00:01:15.640> correspond<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.420> top<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.780> join

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
also correspond to the top of the join

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.660 
also correspond to the top of the join
and<00:01:17.620> then<00:01:17.770> as<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:17.980> come<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.340> front<00:01:18.460> of<00:01:18.610> the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
and then as you come to the front of the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.880 
and then as you come to the front of the
shoe<00:01:18.820> we've<00:01:19.450> created<00:01:19.630> these<00:01:19.840> flex<00:01:20.440> tones<00:01:20.650> and

the hop of the tooling which also

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.610 
the hop of the tooling which also
correspond<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.840> bottom<00:01:23.110> of<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.260> tooling

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
correspond to the bottom of the tooling

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.110 
correspond to the bottom of the tooling
which<00:01:24.040> gives<00:01:24.220> you<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.340> nice<00:01:24.490> harmonic<00:01:24.880> flex

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
which gives you a nice harmonic flex

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.880 
which gives you a nice harmonic flex

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.980 
onto the medial side because then your
foot<00:01:42.400> will<00:01:42.910> be<00:01:43.030> encouraged<00:01:43.510> to<00:01:43.660> enter<00:01:43.750> into

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
foot will be encouraged to enter into

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.870 
foot will be encouraged to enter into
over<00:01:44.170> pronation

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
over pronation

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.120 
over pronation
so<00:01:45.030> allowing<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.020> foot<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.229> continue<00:01:46.829> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
so allowing the foot to continue and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.160 
so allowing the foot to continue and
flow<00:01:47.490> easily<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.149> lateral<00:01:48.479> edge<00:01:48.630> helps

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
flow easily on that lateral edge helps

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.800 
flow easily on that lateral edge helps
keep<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> foot<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.310> neutral<00:01:50.610> position

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
keep the foot in the neutral position

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.210 
keep the foot in the neutral position
the<00:01:51.810> idea<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.289> hundred<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.770> built<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.070> this

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
the idea of the hundred is built on this

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310 
the idea of the hundred is built on this
idea<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.970> catch<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.630> release

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
idea of catch and release

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.340 
idea of catch and release
so<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.039> foot<00:01:56.189> comes<00:01:56.399> down<00:01:56.490> during<00:01:56.939> impact

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
so as the foot comes down during impact

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.169 
so as the foot comes down during impact
the<00:01:58.350> normal<00:01:59.280> tendency<00:01:59.429> of<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> foot<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.030> to

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
the normal tendency of the foot is to

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.419 
the normal tendency of the foot is to
pronate<00:02:00.450> Grover<00:02:01.079> coordinators<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.070> tooling

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
pronate Grover coordinators the tooling

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.429 
pronate Grover coordinators the tooling
actually<00:02:02.850> cradles<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.869> shoe<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.229> catches

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
actually cradles the shoe so it catches

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.600 
actually cradles the shoe so it catches
your<00:02:04.710> foot<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.159> coming<00:02:05.399> through<00:02:05.429> that

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
your foot as it's coming through that

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.850 
your foot as it's coming through that
pronation<00:02:06.060> you'd<00:02:06.509> see<00:02:06.659> from<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.960> meal<00:02:07.380> heel

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
pronation you'd see from the meal heel

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.770 
pronation you'd see from the meal heel
here<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.340> built<00:02:08.700> up<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.420> has<00:02:09.599> these

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
here it's built up it has these

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.509 
here it's built up it has these
dimensions<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.470> give<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.860> an<00:02:11.009> inherent

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
dimensions that give you an inherent

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.490 
dimensions that give you an inherent
stability<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.660> then<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.110> roll<00:02:13.290> forward

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
stability and then as you roll forward

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.839 
stability and then as you roll forward
there's<00:02:14.040> nothing<00:02:14.280> that's<00:02:14.400> going<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.550> stop<00:02:14.610> you
