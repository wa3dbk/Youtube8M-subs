00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
using because that's not the really big

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.840 
using because that's not the really big
part<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.940> video<00:00:39.440> gun<00:00:40.440> scale<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.579> what

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
part of this video gun scale is not what

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.490 
part of this video gun scale is not what
i'm<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.930> video<00:00:43.260> it's

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
i'm going for in this video it's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.869 
i'm going for in this video it's
actually<00:00:43.890> Maya<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:45.180> way<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.390> use<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.050> map<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
actually Maya the way I use the map and

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.380 
actually Maya the way I use the map and
to<00:00:47.879> add<00:00:48.000> my<00:00:48.149> advantage<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> I'm<00:00:51.270> gonna

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
to add my advantage and so I'm gonna

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.720 
to add my advantage and so I'm gonna
start<00:00:51.660> off<00:00:51.840> by<00:00:52.020> saying<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.739> think<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.430> big

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
start off by saying that I think a big

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.580 
start off by saying that I think a big
part<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:54.390> rushing<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.489> definitely<00:00:56.489> definitely

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
part of rushing is definitely definitely

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.260 
part of rushing is definitely definitely
to<00:00:58.590> never<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.879> stopped<00:01:00.270> moving<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:02.270> um

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
to never really stopped moving and um

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.299 
to never really stopped moving and um
the<00:01:03.629> reason<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.019> say<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.439> because<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.129> you

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the reason I say this is because if you

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.300 
the reason I say this is because if you
stop<00:01:05.610> moving<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.869> give<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.110> enemy<00:01:07.470> team<00:01:07.830> more

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
stop moving you give the enemy team more

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.580 
stop moving you give the enemy team more
time<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:09.090> either<00:01:09.240> plant<00:01:10.490> diffuse<00:01:12.409> choose<00:01:13.409> me

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
time to either plant diffuse choose me

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.530 
time to either plant diffuse choose me
and<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:15.030> know<00:01:15.259> get<00:01:16.259> away<00:01:16.380> from<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:17.540> now

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and or you know get away from you now

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.719 
and or you know get away from you now
just<00:01:18.840> because<00:01:19.170> you're<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.500> mmm<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.490> because

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
just because you're not mmm just because

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.310 
just because you're not mmm just because
you<00:01:20.820> never<00:01:20.939> stop<00:01:21.270> moving<00:01:21.450> doesn't<00:01:21.990> mean<00:01:22.140> you

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
you never stop moving doesn't mean you

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.219 
you never stop moving doesn't mean you
just<00:01:22.950> go<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.479> randomly<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.960> start

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
just go out randomly and just start

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.560 
just go out randomly and just start
shooting<00:01:25.470> stuff<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.090> smart<00:01:27.450> with

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
shooting stuff you have to be smart with

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.020 
shooting stuff you have to be smart with
it<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.680> hard<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.610> smart

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
it but it's not that hard to be smart

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.100 
it but it's not that hard to be smart
with<00:01:30.210> your<00:01:30.270> rushing<00:01:31.640> another<00:01:32.640> big<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.659> I

stress this big important thing to your
success<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.720> rushing<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.290> your<00:01:40.710> kill<00:01:40.979> streets

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
success in rushing is your kill streets

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.880 
success in rushing is your kill streets
if<00:01:41.579> you're<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.659> out<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.680> chill

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
if you're going out there with the chill

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.219 
if you're going out there with the chill

and<00:01:46.290> dogs<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:47.009> will<00:01:47.220> not<00:01:47.460> find<00:01:48.030> yourself

successful<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.560> rushing<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:51.350> think<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:53.399> go

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
successful with rushing I think the go

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.160 
successful with rushing I think the go
to<00:01:54.149> kill<00:01:55.110> streak<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.590> UAV<00:01:56.869> other<00:01:57.869> than<00:01:58.020> that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to kill streak is UAV other than that

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.830 
to kill streak is UAV other than that
it's<00:01:58.320> completely<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.520> but<00:01:59.820> from<00:02:00.659> my

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it's completely up to you but from my

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.880 
it's completely up to you but from my
experience<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:02.329> find<00:02:03.329> myself<00:02:03.509> more<00:02:04.110> successful

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
experience I find myself more successful

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.240 
experience I find myself more successful
with<00:02:05.100> rushing<00:02:06.000> when<00:02:06.149> i<00:02:06.210> use<00:02:06.570> UAV<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.530> it's

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
with rushing when i use UAV and it's

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.449 
with rushing when i use UAV and it's
kind<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.580> self-explanatory<00:02:08.970> why<00:02:09.979> but<00:02:10.979> let<00:02:11.430> me

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.070 
places that are obvious and that aren't
obvious<00:04:53.189> it's<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:53.969> kind<00:04:54.509> of<00:04:54.569> a<00:04:55.099> 50-50<00:04:56.099> thing

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
obvious it's a kind of a 50-50 thing

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.290 
obvious it's a kind of a 50-50 thing
some<00:04:58.080> people<00:04:58.379> think<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:58.740> okay<00:04:59.310> this<00:04:59.669> is<00:04:59.819> such

some people think that okay this is such
an<00:05:00.479> obvious<00:05:00.870> spot<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.409> if<00:05:01.530> I<00:05:01.620> camp<00:05:01.889> here

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
an obvious spot that if I camp here

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.610 
an obvious spot that if I camp here
there's<00:05:02.699> no<00:05:02.940> way<00:05:03.240> anyone<00:05:03.659> will<00:05:04.080> guess<00:05:04.409> that

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
there's no way anyone will guess that

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.459 
there's no way anyone will guess that
I'm<00:05:04.740> here<00:05:05.039> because<00:05:05.690> some<00:05:06.690> people<00:05:06.960> tend<00:05:07.319> to

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
I'm here because some people tend to

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.580

and who's stupid enough to camp there

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.369 
and who's stupid enough to camp there
but<00:05:13.379> in<00:05:13.560> reality<00:05:14.479> some<00:05:15.479> people<00:05:15.840> will<00:05:16.050> camp

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379
