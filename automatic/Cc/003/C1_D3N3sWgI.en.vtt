hey guys I'm back another GoPro tips and
tricks<00:00:07.240> video<00:00:07.720> in<00:00:08.190> this<00:00:09.190> video<00:00:09.430> I'm<00:00:09.760> getting

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.369 
tricks video in this video I'm getting
doing<00:00:10.150> a<00:00:10.180> weight<00:00:10.450> comparison<00:00:11.080> between<00:00:11.200> the

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:11.379 
doing a weight comparison between the

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.189 
doing a weight comparison between the
gopro<00:00:11.830> hero2<00:00:12.129> out<00:00:13.030> of<00:00:13.389> the<00:00:13.539> case<00:00:13.780> and<00:00:13.990> the

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:14.199 
gopro hero2 out of the case and the

gopro hero2 out of the case and the
gopro<00:00:14.530> hero3<00:00:14.799> out<00:00:15.280> of<00:00:15.459> the<00:00:15.610> case<00:00:15.850> i<00:00:16.119> think<00:00:16.960> the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
gopro hero3 out of the case i think the

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.210 
gopro hero3 out of the case i think the
results<00:00:17.320> will<00:00:17.350> surprise<00:00:17.680> you<00:00:17.860> a<00:00:17.890> little<00:00:17.949> a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
results will surprise you a little a

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.950 
results will surprise you a little a
little<00:00:18.250> bit<00:00:18.970> of<00:00:19.029> recap<00:00:19.359> we<00:00:19.630> need<00:00:19.720> to<00:00:19.810> remember

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
little bit of recap we need to remember

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.419 
little bit of recap we need to remember
that<00:00:20.109> we've<00:00:20.320> done<00:00:20.470> this<00:00:20.679> weight<00:00:20.920> comparison

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:21.429 
that we've done this weight comparison

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.640 
that we've done this weight comparison
before<00:00:21.599> with<00:00:22.599> the<00:00:22.750> cameras<00:00:23.169> in<00:00:23.349> the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
before with the cameras in the

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.040 
before with the cameras in the
waterproof<00:00:24.070> housings<00:00:24.550> what<00:00:25.210> we<00:00:25.330> found<00:00:25.599> was<00:00:25.929> a

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
waterproof housings what we found was a

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.279 
waterproof housings what we found was a
both<00:00:26.349> weighed<00:00:26.710> exactly<00:00:26.949> the<00:00:27.640> same<00:00:27.939> at<00:00:28.539> 180

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
both weighed exactly the same at 180

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.259 
both weighed exactly the same at 180
grams<00:00:29.619> well<00:00:30.460> not<00:00:30.579> going<00:00:30.699> to<00:00:30.789> go<00:00:30.849> ahead<00:00:30.970> and<00:00:31.150> put

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
grams well not going to go ahead and put

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.080 
grams well not going to go ahead and put
the<00:00:31.390> hero<00:00:31.570> 2<00:00:31.839> on<00:00:32.050> the<00:00:32.920> scale<00:00:33.190> and<00:00:33.790> we<00:00:33.940> see<00:00:34.060> that

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
the hero 2 on the scale and we see that

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.200 
the hero 2 on the scale and we see that
it<00:00:34.390> weighs<00:00:34.600> in<00:00:34.840> at<00:00:34.870> right<00:00:35.350> around<00:00:35.379> 100<00:00:36.370> grams

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
it weighs in at right around 100 grams

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.080 
it weighs in at right around 100 grams
well<00:00:38.079> switch<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.920> hero<00:00:39.160> 3<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:42.100> we'll<00:00:42.969> see

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
well switch the hero 3 and we'll see

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.360 
well switch the hero 3 and we'll see
that<00:00:43.210> it<00:00:43.300> weighs<00:00:43.480> in<00:00:43.690> at<00:00:43.899> right<00:00:44.199> around<00:00:44.370> 80

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
that it weighs in at right around 80

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.330 
that it weighs in at right around 80
grams<00:00:45.879> so<00:00:46.120> there<00:00:46.270> is<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.840> 20<00:00:47.379> gram<00:00:47.680> difference

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
grams so there is a 20 gram difference

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.090 
grams so there is a 20 gram difference
in<00:00:48.609> the<00:00:49.420> weight<00:00:49.660> of<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.079> cameras<00:00:50.649> when

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
in the weight of the cameras when

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.000 
in the weight of the cameras when
they're<00:00:51.309> not<00:00:51.670> in<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.690> housings<00:00:53.140> but<00:00:53.829> in<00:00:53.920> the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
they're not in the housings but in the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.860 
they're not in the housings but in the
housings<00:00:54.429> that<00:00:54.579> weight<00:00:54.789> goes<00:00:55.000> back<00:00:55.269> up<00:00:55.300> to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
housings that weight goes back up to

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.680 
housings that weight goes back up to
being<00:00:56.609> equal<00:00:57.609> so<00:00:57.789> what<00:00:57.940> is<00:00:58.030> that<00:00:58.120> caused<00:00:58.359> by<00:00:58.629> it

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
being equal so what is that caused by it

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.799 
being equal so what is that caused by it
well<00:00:58.960> if<00:00:59.370> we<00:01:00.370> look<00:01:00.579> at<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:00.969> different<00:01:01.329> housing

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
well if we look at the different housing

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.200 
well if we look at the different housing
what<00:01:01.960> we<00:01:02.079> notice<00:01:02.379> immediately<00:01:02.710> is<00:01:03.280> that<00:01:04.000> the

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
what we notice immediately is that the

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.380 
what we notice immediately is that the
buckle<00:01:04.750> on<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.650> hero<00:01:05.860> 3<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.520> lot<00:01:06.820> bigger<00:01:07.060> as

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
buckle on the hero 3 is a lot bigger as

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.960 
buckle on the hero 3 is a lot bigger as
well<00:01:08.170> as<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.470> addition<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:08.950> an<00:01:09.070> extra<00:01:09.520> button

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
well as the addition of an extra button

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.570 
well as the addition of an extra button
so<00:01:10.240> i<00:01:10.270> believe<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:11.020> buckle<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:12.220> extra

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
so i believe the buckle and the extra

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.580 
so i believe the buckle and the extra
button<00:01:12.850> or<00:01:13.030> what<00:01:13.060> our<00:01:13.300> adding<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:14.050> that<00:01:14.080> weight

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
button or what our adding to that weight

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.470 
button or what our adding to that weight
difference<00:01:14.980> if<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:15.190> want<00:01:15.340> away<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.550> cases<00:01:16.090> we

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
difference if you want away the cases we

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.850 
difference if you want away the cases we
can<00:01:16.600> go<00:01:16.660> ahead<00:01:16.780> we<00:01:16.990> can<00:01:17.110> put<00:01:17.260> just<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.620> hero<00:01:17.770> to

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
can go ahead we can put just the hero to

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.400 
can go ahead we can put just the hero to
case<00:01:18.250> on<00:01:18.460> we<00:01:19.450> can<00:01:19.570> see<00:01:19.690> that<00:01:19.780> it<00:01:19.930> weighs<00:01:20.110> in<00:01:20.290> it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
case on we can see that it weighs in it

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.220 
case on we can see that it weighs in it
right<00:01:20.530> around<00:01:20.740> 70<00:01:21.190> grams<00:01:21.720> compared<00:01:22.720> to<00:01:23.020> that

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
right around 70 grams compared to that

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.920 
right around 70 grams compared to that
of<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.900> hundred<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.850> about<00:01:28.000> 110<00:01:28.660> grams

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
of a hundred and just about 110 grams

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.990 
of a hundred and just about 110 grams
for<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:30.490> hero<00:01:30.970> 3<00:01:31.450> so<00:01:32.050> I<00:01:32.080> believe<00:01:32.260> that<00:01:33.000> it's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
for the hero 3 so I believe that it's

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.430 
for the hero 3 so I believe that it's
probably<00:01:34.270> also<00:01:34.510> what<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.840> do<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.050> lens<00:01:35.230> to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
probably also what to do the lens to

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.460 
probably also what to do the lens to
lens<00:01:35.560> on<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:35.920> hero<00:01:36.400> 3<00:01:36.790> housing<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:38.020> fair<00:01:38.350> bit

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
lens on the hero 3 housing is a fair bit

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.220 
lens on the hero 3 housing is a fair bit
bigger<00:01:38.710> than<00:01:39.010> that<00:01:39.040> on<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.580> hero<00:01:39.790> to<00:01:39.880> so<00:01:40.810> well

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
bigger than that on the hero to so well

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.260 
bigger than that on the hero to so well
the<00:01:41.320> hero<00:01:41.530> 3<00:01:41.800> may<00:01:41.950> be<00:01:42.010> lighter<00:01:42.340> when<00:01:42.970> it's<00:01:43.120> out

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
the hero 3 may be lighter when it's out

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.770 
the hero 3 may be lighter when it's out
of<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.450> case<00:01:43.660> in<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.200> case<00:01:45.150> that<00:01:46.150> weight

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
of the case in the case that weight

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.290 
of the case in the case that weight
difference<00:01:47.140> is<00:01:47.320> null<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:47.740> void<00:01:47.860> by<00:01:48.340> the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
difference is null and void by the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.280 
difference is null and void by the
weight<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.230> the<00:01:50.470> waterproof<00:01:50.950> housing<00:01:52.290> thank
