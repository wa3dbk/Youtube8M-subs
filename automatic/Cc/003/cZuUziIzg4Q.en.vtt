00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.330
 behind my back 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.250
 It is installed fence of corrugated board 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.750
 frame if you saw our previous 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.969
 video less picket nicks 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.679
 no differences are also established 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.289
 not here, but today we wanted to talk 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.260
 about the full installation cycle and the problem 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.779
 choice we are near the village of Sychev 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.210
 and thunder here is not the best clay and to me 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 to score would be very difficult but in such 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.890
 soil clogged would stand 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.590
 very solid and very long initially 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.390
 this fence was planned 800 meter high 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.700
 from a bilateral professional flooring 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.399
 but during a conversation with the customer a plan 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.079
 changed the fence grew by 20 centimeters 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.870
 and became one-sided 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.820
 and the reason is when you send 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.309
 colored decking inside his 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.039
 small as in this case area 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.620
 you immediately see its small size 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.350
 become darker in general impression not 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.930
 those that were expected are another thing if 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.760
 Decking light or directed to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.670
 plot is not colored side 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.390
 then one of depression is not 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.540
 will arise 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.390
 and so the frame is ready it consists of tables 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.340
 60 to 60 and lacquer 40 to 25 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.460
 we set would become strictly according 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.460
 level 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.700
 for this fence we made reinforced 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.619
 set gate this means that besides 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.799
 he will strengthen the main frame with additional 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.350
 profile and profiled in such a gate 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.690
 does not overlap but inside the frame 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.479
 his mouth is not only firm but still 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:37.940
 Aesthetically looks we fasten the sheets we 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.860
 we do it on self-tapping screws a little more expensive 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.200
 installation of sheets on rivets will cost 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.450
 however against rights theft wore it 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.960
 as a rule does not save save 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:52.330
 combined approach is it or riveting 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.330
 plus screws or screws plus noodles 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.440
 the last element of our 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.520
 Today's fence has become such 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.110
 finish strip which is worn on top 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.030
 sheet and does not require her to 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.459
 they just screwed it just slits 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.209
 The total cost of a similar fence 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.600
 on may 2013 made seven from 4000 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.579
 here came a set of fencing itself 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.489
 reinforced girder frame 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.290
 dismantling the old fence 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.750
 painting the frame of the gate 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.269
 the profile element of this will give the bar well 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.670
 and delivery is more than 100 kilometers from 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.920
 Moscow you can order at any time 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.640
 fence of any complexity not only from 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.620
 sheeting 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.980
 calling the number you see below
