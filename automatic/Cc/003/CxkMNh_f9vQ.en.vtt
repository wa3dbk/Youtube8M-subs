00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 good runners and welcome to the new 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.150
 video the program you are patron and today not 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.519
 let's talk about the textile or 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.230
 accessories but footwear but in 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.519
 specific to our colleagues 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.710
 training that we have bought 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.750
 recently how to keep them as 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.910
 wash them and what aspects can influence 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.340
 in the life and durability of a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.140
 we go there if we want to take 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.390
 our running shoes the best 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.359
 it's just putting them under the tap 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.580
 with cold water a brush and neutral soap 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.769
 the cold water more than anything because if 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.989
 we use hot water the same 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.030
 shoe and depreciation can be 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.920
 warping is very important that when 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.390
 we put our partners in 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.879
 training on a flat surface 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.520
 are completely flat and are not 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.230
 moving since this is what is going 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.790
 to provide maximum stability 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.550
 each footprint 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.350
 neutral soap more than anything we do not want 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.110
 use too aggressive soaps 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.090
 because they can also damage and dry the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.160
 cushioning of the shoes once 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.660
 clean are wet to dry 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.870
 slippers the best we can do is 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.760
 do hours with the newspaper put them the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.580
 pressure and the same newspaper bar about 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.290
 the water in a few hours you inside the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.540
 sneaker on the outside show a little 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.270
 wet but if we put the foot what 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.400
 We will have relatively dry I recommend 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.490
 that we never put them in the sun in 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.590
 summer or near a heating or 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.380
 Any object that emits a lot of heat 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.690
 because more the same temperatures 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.240
 too many others are going to distort our 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.130
 damping and also also deform 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.479
 the same shoe I recommend to wash 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.310
 the shoes in this way because 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.380
 many people put them in the washing machine 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.390
 without putting the running shoes on 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.490
 Washing machine not only reduces its durability 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.770
 of cushioning but also those of 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.080
 forms the spin of each washing machine 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.750
 no matter how mild the 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.340
 shoes or yes finally what 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.990
 I wanted to comment and it's a program that 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.000
 affects all runners but 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.250
 every time you are more the ones that you have this 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.829
 problem is the typical little hole that is 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.240
 in the mesh over the big toe this 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.920
 only pass the runners that have the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.290
 hobby of lifting the big toe in each 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.090
 stride they perform but it's a problem 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.770
 that can be avoided to this day 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.080
 there was no mark that there was 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.700
 solved this problem actively 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.590
 with some pre-existing material that 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.970
 avoid this problem but we can take 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.069
 our shoes to a shoemaker who 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.930
 Put a small leather plate on 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.239
 inside of the shoe before 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.849
 start using those that you will avoid by 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.650
 complete this problem as a seller of 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.390
 shoes really hurt to give this 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.580
 advice because I am selling material 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.319
 of high quality especially with all the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.030
 brands that we have in the store 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.680
 but it's the only way to really 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.269
 avoid this problem but the best 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.709
 advice that I can give you for pain is that 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.290
 they want to keep their shoes in the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.420
 best possible state is simply not 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.700
 wash keep them in a dry place and 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.739
 cool and it's also that if your 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.780
 mates 20 matias are dirty 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.780
 white trained unless 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.690
 in the afternoon or strong 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.760
 that is going to god I have a contracture in 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.650
 the twin another in the femoral biceps other 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.170
 in the quadriceps and bad in the pyramidal 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.760
 also last week I went to the doctor and 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.610
 He told me he had gonorrhea syphilis 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.970
 Hepatitis B from a flu and a 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.970
 constipated 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.950
 but that's all the rangers like 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.300
 you can always leave your opinion or 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.010
