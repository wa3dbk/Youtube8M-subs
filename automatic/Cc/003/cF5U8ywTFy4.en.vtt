00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.120
 we are here in the forest of more plants 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.550
 we are finishing the new intro for my 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.740
 videos comes with my friend touch that I 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.930
 it helps a lot with my videos and well let's go 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.520
 that in hernando record this video 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.840
 on how to decorate some pretty 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.250
 you respect and good I wanted to take this 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.020
 cute landscape so that you to me what 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.489
 know and see it was bringing the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.080
 classes and many have asked me how 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.730
 decorate your folder and how to decorate your 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.559
 backpack and well I just wanted to give these 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.940
 types of tips this decoration that I 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.250
 It seemed very nice and good I hope that 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.960
 you also in 48 as direct to the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.960
 tutorial let's go 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.210
 first idea we will start with the idea more 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.660
 easy first we must paint all the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.420
 folder of the color you want 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.640
 I painted it with acrylic 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.860
 we wait a few hours for it to dry and the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.900
 painting 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.120
 and we will try to mark the shape of a 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:20.360
 heart taking advantage of the corner of the 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.230
 folder once it was as we want 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.440
 our heart 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.780
 we will mark with plastic and we will put a 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.240
 little in the center of the heart and we're going 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.570
 to distribute very well without going over 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.180
 the brands and spray a little 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.850
 glitter or glitter we remove the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.920
 excess and with a pencil equal or with tips 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.500
 we can better shape the heart before 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.640
 that the glue dries so that 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.560
 we are perfect 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.090
 the idea actually ends here but if 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.860
 we want to refine the design a bit more 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.810
 swiss of different figures with 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.979
 plastic color that leave it drawing 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.979
 with a little relief 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.520
 and spray some glitter 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.580
 I also liked the result more 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.580
 with the little heart no more second idea 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.770
 we must write or print a word 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.930
 or phrase that we like and cut it in 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.940
 rectangle or square shape and by 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.560
 each side of the rectangle we will cut 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.430
 different papers with different 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.530
 Colors or designs thanks 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.030
 match the measure with the paper 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.709
 of the middle and so with each side once 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.110
 that we are satisfied with the design 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.640
 we must pass it to the folder you only have 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.640
 to paste the phrase in between 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.360
 and go sticking the other papers around 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.220
 and cutting what about them puts the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.630
 Glue well by the edges of the paper 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.630
 so that it does not wrinkle after 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.159
 and to cover the edges we will stick with 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.159
 Aniston quotes in this way 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.430
 and ready third idea I think it's the most 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.769
 hard 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.569
 we will cut out a cardboard heart and 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.599
 we will support it in the center of the folder 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.459
 and around we will put these nails 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.890
 buy them at the hardware store with the 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.810
 name of bedbugs without head bedbugs 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.670
 without heads so the truth that you have to 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.620
 do a little bit of strength and a little one 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.359
 ask him for even greater help please me 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.359
 help squeezing it with a nail polish 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.129
 inside you can put a book or something 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.129
 so as not to ruin the folder 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.370
 anchored in the whole only up to half 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.590
 of the bracket and obviously on the other side 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.900
 we had the little tips that we can 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.790
 use as a personal defense does not exist 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.830
 Remove or cut out a rubber rectangle 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.780
 eva but can also use cardboard or 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.140
 wood and with a bit of glue what 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.140
 key 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.060
 and with the tips that were left 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.800
 cut a heart of eva rubber and the 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.090
 Order with glue on the tips 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.550
 almost without dives 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.800
 milito so we avoid clicking now with 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.110
 wool of the color that you like your party 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.080
 who are going to see 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.090
 we have it to a clavito 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.070
 before I heard inside 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.410
 around plastic so that it lasts longer 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.510
 the design then we will begin to surround the 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.560
 folder with the wool joining the 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.560
 nails in this way 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.910
 can use only a little wool or 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.440
 fill it up well so it was like a 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.060
 pad but I do not have to stay 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.060
 asleep because he has the dishes 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.610
 when we finish we'll make a little nudity 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.610
 the back 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:51.129
 and ready the truth is my favorite design 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.379
 fourth and last idea 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:59.139
 with the same wool we will do with mudito 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:05:03.059
 circling one stage of the folder and we're going 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.059
 to start rolling in this way 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.000
 the truth is very fast and easy to 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.830
 to do something like that 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.270
 I from the edge cited free to 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.340
 put a little plastic lay 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.670
 black glitter to give a little 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.670
 brightness 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.919
 and we can take the strips for 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.210
 go through a pencil with a pen and you're done 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.490
 these are the decorations that I wanted 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.020
 share with you I would love that 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:39.560

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:41.879
 liked more and the 1 and the 2 and the 3 and 4 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.650
 were the expenses I hope you liked 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.270

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.650

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.969

 Oak trees 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.060
 Villa Lobos 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.790
