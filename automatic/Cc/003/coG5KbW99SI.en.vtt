 Dudenhoeffer 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.259
 Welcome to the experiment of the week 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.490
 when the wind blows straight into my face through, for example, a brook 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.419
 to let her run the water around her legs then I actually always look 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.750
 exactly in the direction from which the wind or the water is just coming 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.170
 almost as if I wanted to get into the elements in the stables 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.560
 The area behind me is actually much more interesting than that 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.130
 this area is responsible for »how great the forces are not 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.710
 as the body flows around and what is even more important in which 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.290
 Direction these forces act 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.510
 because normally one assumes that one by the flow above all things 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.290
 pushed back way that is also in most cases so there is 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.670
 but a case in which it is not so and we want something now 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.330
 take a closer look 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.640
 that this effect is somewhat better observed in the water than in the air 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.830
 I do the experiment with this water channel here 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.440
 The water is driven into the canal by the big water 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.570
 the infinite here on this side direct the flow through the fins 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.740
 make sure that the flow is calmed so a part nice 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.130
 the effects 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.570
 can look into it because this area will be examined there I can 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.150
 For example, set this sea country and then look like that 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.150
 looks behind the cylinder 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.990
 in the flow rate is right 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.930
 then, behind the goals, the opposite would form 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.510
 This effect is called Care Some would be named after unfair road 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.340
 German-American engineer Theodore von Karmann he as one of 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.160
 Fathers of eroticism took with money 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.520
 so that the whole thing can watch a little better 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.140
 furthermore, the water with us here in the driver used here is such a 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.160
 Fallacy like that 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.970
 Year now can also see very nice as alternately right and left 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.880
 that would detach from the cylinders 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.829
 By the way, such roads are not that rare at all 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.580
 Frequent phenomenon and occurred not only in the water but also in the air 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.669
 on 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.689
 by the lateral detachment of the vortex also lateral forces act on the 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.109
 controversial whether direct 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.030
 and then lead to when the object is movable 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.730
 that it starts to swing that's an effect you know for example 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.140
 of high voltage power lines 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.650
 in strong winds 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.929
 can start whistling 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.590
 for big words such as skyscrapers or bridges 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.459
 The forces that would occur through roads already have to be at the 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.440
 Otherwise, it can happen that the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.099
 Building so much to start spinning spiders that eventually collapse 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.299
 such a case was very spectacular in 1940 at the tekom on the Rossbrücke in 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.269
 the USA 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.340
 yes that was it for this episode until next time 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.239
 stay curious
