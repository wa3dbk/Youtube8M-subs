this<00:00:04.799> time<00:00:05.069> it's<00:00:05.370> with<00:00:05.520> Anthony<00:00:05.879> Davis

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.160 

all<00:00:09.030> right<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.210> Anthony<00:00:09.420> Davis<00:00:09.780> has<00:00:09.900> improved

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
all right so Anthony Davis has improved

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.780 
all right so Anthony Davis has improved
his<00:00:10.380> jumper<00:00:10.650> big-time<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.370> last<00:00:11.580> couple

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
his jumper big-time in the last couple

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.669 
his jumper big-time in the last couple
years<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.480> he's<00:00:12.630> got<00:00:12.780> some<00:00:12.929> great<00:00:12.960> mechanics

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
years and he's got some great mechanics

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.350 
years and he's got some great mechanics
that<00:00:13.830> can<00:00:13.950> probably<00:00:14.190> help<00:00:14.610> if<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.910> plug<00:00:15.179> them

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
that can probably help if you plug them

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.849 
that can probably help if you plug them
into<00:00:15.509> your<00:00:15.660> game<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.350> that's<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.560> point<00:00:16.740> of

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
into your game so that's the point of

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.230 
into your game so that's the point of
these<00:00:16.949> videos<00:00:17.070> we're<00:00:17.670> gonna<00:00:17.820> talk<00:00:17.970> about<00:00:18.150> as

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
these videos we're gonna talk about as

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.609 
these videos we're gonna talk about as
mechanics<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.960> can<00:00:19.080> see<00:00:19.199> if<00:00:19.260> they<00:00:19.350> can<00:00:19.470> fit

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
mechanics you can see if they can fit

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.870 
mechanics you can see if they can fit
the<00:00:19.710> your<00:00:19.920> jumper<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.460> see<00:00:20.640> if<00:00:20.730> they're

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the your jumper and see if they're

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.970 
the your jumper and see if they're
comfortable<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.630> let's<00:00:22.289> jump<00:00:22.470> right<00:00:22.590> into<00:00:22.859> it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
comfortable so let's jump right into it

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.830 
comfortable so let's jump right into it
all<00:00:23.490> right<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:23.699> first<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.000> love<00:00:24.180> Anthony<00:00:24.600> Davis

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
all right so first I love Anthony Davis

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.929 
all right so first I love Anthony Davis
a<00:00:24.869> straight<00:00:25.260> arm<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:25.710> his<00:00:25.830> release<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.460> lot<00:00:26.910> of

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
a straight arm on his release a lot of

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:27.980 
a straight arm on his release a lot of
players<00:00:27.150> don't<00:00:27.330> fully<00:00:27.599> extend<00:00:27.900> their

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
players don't fully extend their

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.120 
players don't fully extend their
shooting<00:00:28.199> arm<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.619> makes<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> very

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
shooting arm and it makes it very

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.740 
shooting arm and it makes it very
difficult<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.699> be<00:00:29.880> consistent<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:30.599> your

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
difficult to be consistent with your

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.849 
difficult to be consistent with your
jumper<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.230> check<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:31.470> as<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.679> pause<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
jumper so check out as we pause the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.229 
jumper so check out as we pause the
video<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.460> see<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.610> Ana's<00:00:32.910> released

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
video you can see that Ana's released

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.760 
video you can see that Ana's released
his<00:00:33.450> arm<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.750> fully<00:00:33.899> locked<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.440> straight

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
his arm is fully locked and straight

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.930 
his arm is fully locked and straight
guiding<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> ball<00:00:35.430> towards<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.760> basket

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
guiding the ball towards the basket

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.490 
guiding the ball towards the basket
remember<00:00:36.660> if<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.780> don't<00:00:36.870> fully<00:00:37.079> lock<00:00:37.320> your

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
remember if you don't fully lock your

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.780 
remember if you don't fully lock your
arm<00:00:37.620> or<00:00:37.680> your<00:00:37.739> jumper<00:00:38.010> every<00:00:38.399> shots<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.760> be

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
arm or your jumper every shots can be

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.430 
arm or your jumper every shots can be
slightly<00:00:39.180> inconsistent<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.079> because<00:00:40.350> of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
slightly inconsistent and because of

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.660 
slightly inconsistent and because of
that<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.739> gonna<00:00:40.829> take<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> lot<00:00:41.340> longer<00:00:41.520> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that it's gonna take a lot longer to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.400 
that it's gonna take a lot longer to
build<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> muscle<00:00:42.480> memory<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:42.989> get<00:00:43.290> your

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
build up the muscle memory so get your

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.930 
build up the muscle memory so get your
reps<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.770> work<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.160> fully<00:00:44.399> extending<00:00:44.850> your

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
reps and work on fully extending your

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
reps and work on fully extending your
arm<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.270> every<00:00:45.539> single<00:00:45.719> jump<00:00:46.020> shot<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.440> you'll

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
arm on every single jump shot and you'll

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.529 
arm on every single jump shot and you'll
see<00:00:46.710> some<00:00:46.890> good<00:00:46.980> results<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:48.149> next<00:00:48.420> let's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
see some good results and next let's

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.299 
see some good results and next let's
talk<00:00:48.660> about<00:00:48.719> Anthony's<00:00:49.320> smooth<00:00:49.649> one<00:00:50.039> motion

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
talk about Anthony's smooth one motion

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.100 
talk about Anthony's smooth one motion
jump<00:00:50.730> shot<00:00:50.969> one<00:00:51.270> motion<00:00:51.420> jumper<00:00:51.750> basically

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
jump shot one motion jumper basically

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.510 
jump shot one motion jumper basically
means<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> ball<00:00:52.620> never<00:00:52.860> stops<00:00:53.250> or

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
means that the ball never stops or

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.010 
means that the ball never stops or
pauses<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> way<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> basket<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
pauses on the way to the basket on the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.119 
pauses on the way to the basket on the
majority<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.530> best<00:00:55.739> shooters<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
majority of the best shooters in the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.069 
majority of the best shooters in the
world<00:00:56.250> all<00:00:56.489> use<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> one<00:00:57.090> motion<00:00:57.270> jump<00:00:57.629> shot<00:00:57.840> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
world all use a one motion jump shot and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.209 
world all use a one motion jump shot and
it's<00:00:58.320> incredibly<00:00:58.620> important<00:00:58.949> because<00:00:59.039> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
it's incredibly important because it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.069 
it's incredibly important because it
gives<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.430> optimized<00:00:59.879> arc<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.930> also

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
gives you optimized arc and it also

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.689 
gives you optimized arc and it also
gives<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.469> more<00:01:01.620> range<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.129> your<00:01:02.280> shot<00:01:02.520> now

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
gives you more range on your shot now

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.770 
gives you more range on your shot now
one<00:01:02.940> big<00:01:03.090> thing<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.270> makes<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> difference

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
one big thing that makes the difference

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.719 
one big thing that makes the difference
in<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.170> one<00:01:04.350> motion<00:01:04.530> versus<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> two<00:01:05.220> motion<00:01:05.519> shot

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
in a one motion versus a two motion shot

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.190 
in a one motion versus a two motion shot
is<00:01:05.909> your<00:01:06.150> set<00:01:06.390> point<00:01:06.420> now<00:01:06.810> before<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.170> all

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
is your set point now before you all

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.990 
is your set point now before you all
freak<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.280> there's<00:01:08.430> no<00:01:08.549> actual

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
freak out I know that there's no actual

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.609 
freak out I know that there's no actual
set<00:01:09.240> point<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> one<00:01:09.780> motion<00:01:10.080> shot<00:01:10.320> because

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
set point in a one motion shot because

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.020 
set point in a one motion shot because
it's<00:01:10.770> never<00:01:10.920> stopping<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.549> its<00:01:11.670> way<00:01:11.760> towards

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it's never stopping on its way towards

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.490 
it's never stopping on its way towards
the<00:01:12.090> basket<00:01:12.510> when<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.720> talk<00:01:12.930> about<00:01:13.110> set<00:01:13.290> point

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the basket when I talk about set point

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
not bashing him personally for this just

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.929 
not bashing him personally for this just
because<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> wasn't<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.430> at<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.579> workout<00:02:38.909> I

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
because I wasn't there at the workout I

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.759 
because I wasn't there at the workout I
don't<00:02:39.209> know<00:02:39.299> exactly<00:02:39.659> what<00:02:39.870> went<00:02:40.049> down<00:02:40.109> and<00:02:40.439> it

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
don't know exactly what went down and it

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.080 
don't know exactly what went down and it
seems<00:02:41.010> like<00:02:41.159> this<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.400> probably<00:02:41.700> towards<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
seems like this is probably towards the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.670 
seems like this is probably towards the
end<00:02:42.209> when<00:02:42.329> he's<00:02:42.450> pretty<00:02:42.659> tired<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.560> is

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
end when he's pretty tired but this is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.410 
end when he's pretty tired but this is
what<00:02:43.829> I<00:02:43.859> do<00:02:43.950> know<00:02:44.250> players<00:02:44.790> like<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.180> see

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
what I do know players like you see

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
clips like this and they think well this

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.619 
clips like this and they think well this
is<00:02:47.250> how<00:02:47.340> Anthony<00:02:47.639> Davis<00:02:48.000> trains<00:02:48.209> his<00:02:48.359> jumper
