00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.960

because<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.440> really<00:04:07.769> does<00:04:07.950> last<00:04:08.250> for<00:04:08.579> 12<00:04:08.760> hours

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
because it really does last for 12 hours

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.030 
because it really does last for 12 hours
I<00:04:09.269> think<00:04:09.359> it<00:04:09.629> lasts<00:04:09.780> longer<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.829> cool

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
I think it lasts longer and the cool

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.550 
I think it lasts longer and the cool
thing<00:04:11.069> about<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.459> is<00:04:11.609> when<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.000> put<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.329> on

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
thing about it is when you put it on

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.949 
thing about it is when you put it on
it's<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.650> really<00:04:13.680> creamy<00:04:14.340> consistency<00:04:15.329> it's

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
it's a really creamy consistency it's

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.650 
it's a really creamy consistency it's
just<00:04:16.289> like<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.620> normal<00:04:17.010> eyeliner<00:04:17.549> pencil<00:04:18.000> but

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
just like a normal eyeliner pencil but

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.379 
just like a normal eyeliner pencil but
it<00:04:18.930> dries<00:04:19.530> so<00:04:20.130> it's<00:04:20.310> basically<00:04:20.729> like<00:04:20.849> a<00:04:21.030> liquid

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
it dries so it's basically like a liquid

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.500 
it dries so it's basically like a liquid
liner<00:04:21.750> but<00:04:22.139> in<00:04:22.289> a<00:04:22.380> pencil<00:04:22.860> how<00:04:23.460> cool<00:04:23.789> is<00:04:23.970> that

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
liner but in a pencil how cool is that

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.600

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 
perfect thing about the glove is the

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.050 
perfect thing about the glove is the
technique<00:07:29.830> that<00:07:29.979> I<00:07:30.009> do<00:07:30.130> is<00:07:30.400> after<00:07:30.580> I<00:07:30.729> wrap<00:07:31.030> it

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
technique that I do is after I wrap it

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.870 
technique that I do is after I wrap it
around<00:07:31.240> I<00:07:31.780> will<00:07:32.169> slide<00:07:32.740> it<00:07:33.009> off<00:07:33.220> of<00:07:33.250> the<00:07:33.669> actual

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:33.880 
around I will slide it off of the actual

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.719 
around I will slide it off of the actual
barrel<00:07:34.720> with<00:07:35.110> the<00:07:35.319> glove<00:07:35.620> and<00:07:35.919> hold<00:07:36.220> it<00:07:36.430> in<00:07:36.580> my

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:36.729 
barrel with the glove and hold it in my

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:37.230 
barrel with the glove and hold it in my
hand

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 
hand

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.969 
hand
of<00:07:37.449> course<00:07:37.750> the<00:07:37.990> hand<00:07:38.199> that's<00:07:38.380> wearing<00:07:38.860> the

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:38.979 
of course the hand that's wearing the

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:41.159 
of course the hand that's wearing the
glove<00:07:39.190> and<00:07:39.550> it<00:07:40.270> will<00:07:40.419> create<00:07:40.599> a<00:07:40.720> tighter<00:07:41.080> curl

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169 
glove and it will create a tighter curl

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.740 
glove and it will create a tighter curl
and<00:07:42.130> then<00:07:42.280> your<00:07:42.490> curls<00:07:42.819> will<00:07:43.120> end<00:07:43.300> up<00:07:43.449> looking

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:43.750 
and then your curls will end up looking

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:44.850 
and then your curls will end up looking
a<00:07:43.810> little<00:07:43.930> something<00:07:44.409> like<00:07:44.530> this

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:44.860 
a little something like this

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.309 
a little something like this
I<00:07:45.159> think<00:07:45.580> I'm<00:07:45.759> digging<00:07:46.210> these<00:07:46.389> things<00:07:46.780> I<00:07:47.110> hope
