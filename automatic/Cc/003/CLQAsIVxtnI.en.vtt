milk is a white liquid secreted by all
female<00:00:14.429> mammals<00:00:14.730> used<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.870> feed<00:00:16.109> their<00:00:16.350> young

female mammals used to feed their young
so<00:00:18.240> tell<00:00:18.510> me<00:00:18.830> if<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.160> didn't<00:00:20.520> know<00:00:20.640> about<00:00:20.820> milk

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
so tell me if you didn't know about milk

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.779 
so tell me if you didn't know about milk
and<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.869> saw<00:00:22.199> how<00:00:22.529> secreting<00:00:23.160> my<00:00:23.310> liquid

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
and you saw how secreting my liquid

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.240 
and you saw how secreting my liquid
which<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.750> drink<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.670> so<00:00:26.670> why<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.390> drink

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
which you drink it so why do you drink

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.720 
which you drink it so why do you drink
here's<00:00:29.250> why<00:00:29.400> milk<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.820> unhealthy<00:00:31.730> chemical

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
here's why milk is unhealthy chemical

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.729 
here's why milk is unhealthy chemical
tests<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.300> milk<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.840> show<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.230> milk<00:00:34.530> has<00:00:34.710> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
tests of milk to show that milk has a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.150 
tests of milk to show that milk has a
very<00:00:35.070> high<00:00:35.370> level<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.880> calcium<00:00:36.770> actually<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
very high level of calcium actually the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.240 
very high level of calcium actually the
calcium<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.270> indigestible<00:00:40.079> for<00:00:40.860> humans

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
calcium in it is indigestible for humans

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.400 
calcium in it is indigestible for humans
and<00:00:41.489> bonds<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.149> other<00:00:42.360> calcium's<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.290> your

the<00:00:47.489> milk<00:00:47.850> builds<00:00:48.270> strong<00:00:48.600> bones<00:00:48.629> ads<00:00:49.320> were

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the milk builds strong bones ads were

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040 
the milk builds strong bones ads were
illegalized<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.969> false<00:00:51.270> advertising

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
illegalized for false advertising

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.520 
illegalized for false advertising
because<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.180> milk<00:00:54.180> also<00:00:54.690> has<00:00:54.960> hormones

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
because of this milk also has hormones

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.819 
because of this milk also has hormones
both<00:00:55.949> natural<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.699> man-made<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:58.199> natural
