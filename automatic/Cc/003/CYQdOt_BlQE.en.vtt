00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.160
 Hello, I think many of you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.830
 familiar with this great knife bench 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.950
 mayda damas which with dignity 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.570
 endured hardy testing but if 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.730
 you are familiar with him then you are also sure 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.980
 remember at what cost they managed it 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.410
 knife appeared very strong vertical 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.140
 backlash 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:34.260
 the castle still continues to hold but 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:37.350
 backlash is very ugly and here in 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.390
 comments under my video from hardy with 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:46.710
 adamas tests but only lazy probably 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.879
 didn't advise me to put the liner on 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.370
 anvil and rivet top with a hammer 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.149
 times it was so that's interesting dozens 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:03.080
 probably hundreds of comments with one and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:09.119
 same advice but one comment 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:13.500
 which was very different from everyone 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.960
 the rest I do not remember who put it but in 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.119
 he just offered me a man 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.670
 directly contact the scourge company and 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.850
 just ask for a spare 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.040
 liner and now despite the fact that i 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.110
 Recently, quite often talk with 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.299
 warranty service of various companies is not 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.659
 for some reason it didn't even come right away 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.900
 head and here is this idea to me very much 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.890
 liked so for a few 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.590
 days after that I personally called the company 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.380
 bench matt hit boy named 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:56.399
 Kevin Customer Service 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.240
 let's say so began to communicate with him and said 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.930
 him I have a big folding knife 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.200
 nada mas 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:09.520
 and i was performing imba toning and therefore 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.080
 we got the deformation of the liners and 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.920
 now I am very, very strong 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.500
 vertical backlash and I ask to send me 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.600
 new spare liners but mildly say a 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.420
 here we are such a request and generally my 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.790
 weight talk about batoning 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.620
 Kevin's heads are a little stupor like that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.810
 that this is clearly out of his 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.920
 such a familiar pattern 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.410
 communication with batman customers and he doesn't even 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.760
 knew that I could not tell them to burn and 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.030
 left foot us 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.040
 We 'll figure it out. I say, look. 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.920
 kevin i live in israel i have this 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.470
 the other end of the world I send you a knife 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.980
 it pay for pos versus pay for 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.970
 back forward I know 100 percent 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.070
 what is the problem 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.740
 I just need liners I even give you 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.840
 ready to pay for them if needed but I 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.850
 I don't want to stop the knife because its 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.400
 will delay at customs they will ask me 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.400
 any permit taxes and so 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.020
 further, that is, it is much more 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.610
 problematic but he basically got into 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.920
 my position I really liked it 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.440
 and said that he should consult with 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.380
 some more superior to them 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.730
 chiefs 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:30.250
 wait a couple more minutes on line I 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.220
 heard his voice again and he says no 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.080
 Alex know how we usually do not like this 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:42.970
 do but for you we will make an exception 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.790
 and send you new liners so here 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.520
 Here at this moment I was taken aback because 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.650
 in spite of the fact that I insisted in principle 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.770
 and wanted not to do so well, how would u 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.470
 I had no prerequisites to think 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.420
 what really are they 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.390
 will do exactly as I ask and here 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.020
 damn it was necessary it was cool like I am 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:10.700
 told this kevin what the fuck about it them 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:15.410
 acts learns a lot of people and here 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:19.340
 Three weeks have passed. 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:22.520
 package from the company benchmade here such 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:28.660
 here is the envelope back to 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:32.570
 declaration we see the inscription liners 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.560
 I think there is no better knife to 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:46.040
 open this parcel than this one 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:48.700
 maimed gave herself everything all very 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:58.270
 just not some 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:58.270
 letters nothing bag with liners but 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.479
 these are absolutely two new ones 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:21.780
 home liner with 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:27.460
 and now it is waiting for complete disassembly. 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.020
 replacing liners I hope that he again 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.780
 will be back in operation 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:37.919
 a hundred percent that's really cool 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.250
 really cool right in anticipation of it 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.340
 recovery 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:47.370
 this knife well see you 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.370
 after i put the new liners 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.349
 repair completed 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:58.409
 here they are old deformed liners 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:10.569
 here he is handsome knife bench war damas 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:14.979
 I still walk a little tight 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:21.069
 did not grease after assembly still when 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:24.870
 rubs at work important thing of course 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:28.589
 that the wedge doesn't hit the spender 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:35.529
 even if you press down on it and 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:36.629
 Of course there is no backlash literally 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:40.139
 some 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:44.310
 micro vertical backlash with 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:46.960
 there is no horizontal backlash at all and 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:52.870
 so this soldier 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:56.740
 again in the ranks I want to express a huge 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:07:00.580
 thanks to the guys from the company benchmade 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.680
 for something that even went to meet 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.360
 despite the obvious 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:09.180
 misuse 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:13.629
 Ms. entered the position sent liners and 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:16.229
 insanely pleased me now in my 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:23.919
 the collection had another knife which 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:29.939
 has a special meaning for me i just 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:33.340
 very much of us now just super everything 

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:35.250
 I hope you were interested, thank you for 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.520
 view bye 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.520
 bye Bye
