00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.069
 people happen in our lives 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.019
 for a reason according to the concept of 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.389
 interdependence according to which we are all 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.490
 somehow connected beyond the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.560
 time beyond space 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.210
 each of us a cause for life 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.640
 of the other but it also becomes one 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.910
 condition to let him experiment 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.980
 something and vice versa therefore exists 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.230
 a nothing weaving 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.110
 all this happens by chance 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.239
 experiences we make are the result of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.120
 same causes that we have a product 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.910
 and conditions that have manifested themselves 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.719
 the people that happen in ours 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.920
 life significantly are gods 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.309
 our teachers also the people who are 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.430
 they generate anger and resentment is generated 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.230
 in reality they serve to teach us to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.500
 example the quality of patience 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.589
 quality of tolerance and these 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.090
 quality or perfections if we want to say 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.640
 they are what we can use 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.509
 we can carry around is something that 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.040
 really goes out of space to the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.130
 out of time is something he does 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.799
 part of our soul luggage e 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.049
 so all that happens to us 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.070
 especially significant people of the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.299
 Our lives have a meaning they have 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.710
 a sense and their meaning is its own 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.479
 that of interacting interacting with us 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.950
 because through this interaction we 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.829
 we can contribute to the change of 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.329
 these people and vice versa ie there is a 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.630
 a bit more truly a concept of 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.820
 interdependence whatever happens 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.470
 whatever we do interacts with 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.920
 everything and everyone has contacts 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.130
 significant of the unions that go to the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:08.220
 beyond time multiple experiences that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.530
 the same subtle minds are repeated 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.830
 so we could call them the same 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.860
 continuous mental intertwining yes 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.650
 intertwine in the highways of the 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.379
 samsara like cars on motorways 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.720
 and these plots and the times they cause 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.640
 accidents cause hitches but 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.019
 actually even the accident the hitches 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.810
 they are teachings 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.939
 unfortunately we are not aware of 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.909
 this or at least not often there 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.220
 we realize why on the one hand not 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.989
 we reflect on the broader level and we are 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.379
 very connected to the situation 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.120
 contingent therefore we live let's say 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.159
 the illusion of the contingent situation 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.310
 as if it were really a situation 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:55.129
 real and therefore we can't see the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.840
 all so in a detached way and 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.209
 this is the fundamental motivation for 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.319
 which we do not realize 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.450
 but if we started to get in 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.700
 states of meditation to reflect on 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.650
 profound way about the various events that they are 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.599
 happened in our lives on the various 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.409
 types of people they had 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:18.560
 met then we could really 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:22.389
 learn and understand what happened 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.680
 it happened for a very specific reason and 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:27.109
 learning to recognize this reason 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.379
 we can really learn to improve 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.489
 nor does it evolve as like souls like 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.690
 people 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.410
 for this video it's all I give you 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.410
 appointment to the next
