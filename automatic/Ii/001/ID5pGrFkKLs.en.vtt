know working it like a jig kind of slow
but<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:56.869> found<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.229> these<00:01:57.380> things<00:01:57.649> didn't

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
but I found that these things didn't

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.100 
but I found that these things didn't
really<00:01:58.209> give<00:01:59.209> mine<00:01:59.330> action<00:01:59.539> I<00:01:59.780> just<00:01:59.929> kind<00:02:00.050> of

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
hung out there so then I started moving

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.550 
hung out there so then I started moving
it<00:02:03.140> with<00:02:03.319> bigger<00:02:03.860> sweeps<00:02:04.660> of<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.720> rod<00:02:06.080> sort<00:02:06.470> of

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
it with bigger sweeps of the rod sort of

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.650 
it with bigger sweeps of the rod sort of
pulling<00:02:07.069> it<00:02:07.250> six<00:02:07.580> or<00:02:07.670> eight<00:02:07.819> inches<00:02:08.149> each<00:02:08.390> time

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
pulling it six or eight inches each time

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.650 
pulling it six or eight inches each time
I<00:02:08.690> moved<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.940> seemed<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.209> work<00:02:11.300> that

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
I moved it and that seemed to work that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.210 
I moved it and that seemed to work that
once<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.170> moved<00:02:12.349> it<00:02:12.440> fast<00:02:12.650> enough<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.980> get<00:02:13.069> all

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
once I moved it fast enough to get all

caught those keepers that's when I
started<00:02:17.569> catching<00:02:17.830> some<00:02:18.830> fish<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:20.480> with

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
started catching some fish on it so with

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.630 
started catching some fish on it so with
that<00:02:20.690> in<00:02:20.840> mind<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:21.319> would<00:02:21.620> say<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:21.860> if<00:02:22.280> you

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
that in mind I would say that if you

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.270 
that in mind I would say that if you
want<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.120> creature<00:02:23.390> bait<00:02:23.630> that<00:02:24.110> say<00:02:25.099> maybe

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
want the creature bait that say maybe

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.430 
want the creature bait that say maybe
you<00:02:25.370> have<00:02:25.489> suspended<00:02:25.910> fish<00:02:26.200> something<00:02:27.200> that

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
you have suspended fish something that

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.110 
you have suspended fish something that
you're<00:02:27.650> throwing<00:02:28.430> out<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:28.790> they're<00:02:28.880> sitting

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
you're throwing out and they're sitting

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.850 
you're throwing out and they're sitting
it<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.450> know<00:02:29.540> 10<00:02:29.870> feet<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.140> 20<00:02:30.530> feet<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.680> water

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
it you know 10 feet in 20 feet of water

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.800 
it you know 10 feet in 20 feet of water
so<00:02:30.950> if<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.099> want<00:02:31.219> to<00:02:31.250> drop<00:02:31.459> through<00:02:31.730> them<00:02:31.849> this

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
so if you want to drop through them this

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.940 
so if you want to drop through them this
would<00:02:33.019> probably<00:02:33.170> be<00:02:33.379> if

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
would probably be if

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.610 
would probably be if
monel<00:02:34.280> creature<00:02:34.310> bait<00:02:34.760> for<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.090> or<00:02:35.930> if<00:02:36.349> maybe

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
monel creature bait for that or if maybe

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.890 
monel creature bait for that or if maybe
you're<00:02:36.800> flipping<00:02:37.099> deeper<00:02:37.540> water<00:02:38.540> like

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
you're flipping deeper water like

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.530 
you're flipping deeper water like
isolated<00:02:39.530> stumps<00:02:40.370> or<00:02:40.519> trees<00:02:41.060> something<00:02:41.480> if

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
isolated stumps or trees something if

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.080 
isolated stumps or trees something if
there's<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:42.530> know<00:02:42.560> maybe<00:02:43.129> five<00:02:43.760> six<00:02:44.000> seven

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
there's you know maybe five six seven

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.460 
there's you know maybe five six seven
eight<00:02:44.330> feet<00:02:44.569> of<00:02:44.599> water<00:02:44.810> something<00:02:45.140> this<00:02:45.290> thing

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
eight feet of water something this thing

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.290 
eight feet of water something this thing
can<00:02:45.590> really<00:02:45.620> drop<00:02:46.550> through<00:02:46.819> on<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.030> way<00:02:47.120> down

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
can really drop through on the way down

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.690 
can really drop through on the way down
the<00:02:47.420> bottom<00:02:47.569> I<00:02:47.870> think<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.739> would<00:02:48.920> be<00:02:49.040> another

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
the bottom I think that would be another

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.280 
the bottom I think that would be another
phenomenal<00:02:50.450> technique<00:02:50.810> for<00:02:50.959> this<00:02:51.080> thing

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
phenomenal technique for this thing

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.259 
phenomenal technique for this thing
because<00:02:51.640> when<00:02:52.640> it's<00:02:52.760> when<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.000> running

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
because when it's when it's running

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.339 
because when it's when it's running
through<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.540> water<00:02:53.720> or<00:02:53.959> even<00:02:54.200> if<00:02:54.260> you're

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
through the water or even if you're

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.110 
through the water or even if you're
swimming<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:55.040> curly<00:02:55.370> tails<00:02:55.550> have<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.790> lot

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
swimming it that curly tails have a lot

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.350 
swimming it that curly tails have a lot
of<00:02:56.390> action<00:02:57.080> but<00:02:57.519> try<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.670> slow<00:02:58.819> it<00:02:58.849> down<00:02:58.970> just

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
of action but try and slow it down just

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.710 
of action but try and slow it down just
kind<00:02:59.569> of<00:02:59.630> move<00:02:59.810> it<00:02:59.989> I<00:03:00.700> just<00:03:01.700> didn't<00:03:02.510> do<00:03:02.599> much

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
kind of move it I just didn't do much

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.199 
kind of move it I just didn't do much
for<00:03:02.989> me<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.349> mean<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.430> sort<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.819> negative

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
for me I mean that is sort of a negative

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.150 
for me I mean that is sort of a negative
but<00:03:05.510> all<00:03:05.959> you<00:03:06.110> gotta<00:03:06.260> do<00:03:06.380> is<00:03:06.410> speed<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:06.830> up<00:03:06.920> or

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
but all you gotta do is speed it up or

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.320 
but all you gotta do is speed it up or
swim<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.750> catches<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.220> lot<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.150> fish

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
swim it and it catches you a lot of fish

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.990 
swim it and it catches you a lot of fish
trust<00:03:11.660> me<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.019> it's<00:03:12.799> very<00:03:12.860> dense<00:03:13.250> just<00:03:13.880> like

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
trust me and it's very dense just like

if you want a really cool creature bait
like<00:03:44.569> I<00:03:44.600> said<00:03:44.720> something<00:03:45.079> that<00:03:45.170> may<00:03:45.620> be

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
like I said something that may be

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.379 
like I said something that may be
through<00:03:45.950> suspended<00:03:46.310> bass<00:03:46.549> or<00:03:46.880> deeper

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
through suspended bass or deeper

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.979 
through suspended bass or deeper
flipping<00:03:48.049> with<00:03:48.250> sparse<00:03:49.250> open<00:03:49.609> water<00:03:49.819> I<00:03:50.120> think

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
flipping with sparse open water I think

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.550 
flipping with sparse open water I think
it<00:03:51.079> would<00:03:51.200> be<00:03:51.230> phenomenal<00:03:53.319> thank<00:03:54.319> you<00:03:54.410> for
