00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello everybody on this video we're going to talk 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.029
 exchange and maintenance of 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.029
 exchange 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.960
 if you notice that during the exchange of 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.390
 marches on your bike 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.019
 the exchange is very hard the bank is 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.480
 tender is very hard short shaving or 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.759
 visually you detect that the cars 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.250
 are mainly 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.800
 end closing is because it is time to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.660
 change the reasons are several and there are people 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.090
 that there a bicycle with hose up there 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.910
 with high pressure machine and this ends 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.460
 water entering the system and the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.160
 cable rustles grease loses its 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.469
 efficiency and this is becoming 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.750
 holding the cable inside the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.730
 then it 's norton's time to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.829
 to maintain at least one 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.789
 preventive maintenance in some cases 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.619
 until the cable change does 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.840
 that it's all the same but it's not the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.780
 brake cables and exchange cables have 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.780
 enough difference is you note that one 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.360
 brake cable a much larger terminal 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.759
 it is thicker more rigid while the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.189
 cable is very flexible use in the 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.890
 terminal little head is not that it is 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.860
 the cable reel and for one person 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.960
 this may go unnoticed but 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.110
 when it's time to ride you see that one does not 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.540
 can be used in place of the other 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.820
 this conventional exchange cable is what 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.159
 You probably have your bike on it. 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.979
 slips inside a nylon cap that 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.780
 goes inside the invitation but there are 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.729
 models like the one that won the last 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.040
 interbairros ii that he is practically 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.890
 nylon with the small layer of 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.229
 steel in the center much lighter and weighs 5 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.420
 and that is 17 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.600
 so you notice and the evolution of 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.890
 bicycles in general not only in 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.960
 more expensive components up to a 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.600
 simple component like these you note 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.799
 great evolution 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.850
 these are the tools that we are going to 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.850
 use in this maintenance 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.660
 the first step is to put in the pinion 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.310
 to lower the spring 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:32.150
 relax now we'll take the old 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:35.780
 terminal and release the kabuki from the 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.710
 exchange using a key to the in 5 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.440
 millimeters for anyone using the 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.150
 rapid fire type access to the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.180
 exchange is well hidden it stays 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.180
 almost clogged near the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.420
 required for a locking key. 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.970
 philips slot to take this cap 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.860
 that gives access to heat exchange is so 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.990
 little earth was the ground 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.600
 So now that we've let go 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:07.070
 we release all parts and open the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.250
 access is just take the old car to 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.500
 replace with the new one in the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.950
 maintenance is very difficult to take advantage of 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.890
 cable if you try to put it back 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.720
 It's a little frayed and it gets very 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.840
 hard to achieve though you can 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.209
 try to roll and such but sure is 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.980
 put a new 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.260
 now we are going to install the 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.510
 cable it is important to remember that 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.730
 here in the top five labanca you have 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.709
 to let it go as it was in the 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.830
 smaller share for opening 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.110
 to place because normally when 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.510
 You're going to be the champion year. 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:50.959
 you lose access to the installation of this 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:53.989
 car lubrication is essential. 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.440
 normally run during 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.440
 the utilization 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.310
 in the full extent 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.509
 you can test the passage of this cable 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.630
 using here the rapid fire triggering 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:34.550
 sometimes feeling like you 're pulling 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.199
 if you have any slack because it is usually 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.419
 along the bicycle and if terminals 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.789
 may not be fully seated in 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.550
 each dowels and it is important you 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:46.050
 to do this check you do not have 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.570
 no slack if you do not think you will 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.020
 stay all right and then have it never 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.710
 things are done here with a 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.410
 pliers and not a slight stretch but 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.940
 the same fine adjustment can be made in the 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:05.880
 there on the rapid fire with some 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:10.470
 slack or stretching can be done by 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.300
 There we party to see how it is. 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.490
 happening and if you need 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.000
 make the adjustment on the indicators 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.449
 here is usually could already cut 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.610
 leaving a little time but you're 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.400
 doing it at home for the first time and 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.930
 do not know if the thing was right is not 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.060
 cutting the car while I go 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.169
 Here fit it in any place 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.720
 Ask me and I'm going to check 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:39.720
 if everything is working with every click 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.770
 here in rapid fire corresponds to change 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.840
 if you have one that is not going up 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.300
 or taking too long can be the 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.289
 cable stretching and you need it 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:54.740
 adjust here at the front of the indicators 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:58.550
 but apparently he got it right is 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:02.449
 switching to all gears here 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.310
 just got a little lingering there to fall 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:08.000
 we'll check if it's a matter of 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.560
 justice of the positioning 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.520
 conveyor or if it is the cable that is 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.830
 very stretched 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.500
 now we're going to finish cutting the 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.449
 cable leaves a small shape so that 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.870
 do not touch here in the reaction then go 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:24.020
 making noise from bothering and 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:28.039
 Let's see a cable terminal for 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:32.150
 prevent it from being damaged or 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:34.150
 jabbing simply gives a cut 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.099
 Japan 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.620
 be sure to replace the screw that 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:43.219
 cover here the cable entry 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.469
 as you have noted is a 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:47.690
 Quite simple work but if you 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:50.030
 To think it's complicated for you to travel. 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.460
 to your reliable mechanic only night 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.960
 with the bike in poor condition or 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.400
 no maintenance was worth 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.400
 when you see in the next videos
