carlson<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.870> i<00:03:49.140> was<00:03:49.590> about<00:03:49.800> it<00:03:49.980> for<00:03:50.160> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
carlson and i was about it for the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.030 
carlson and i was about it for the
foreign<00:03:50.940> players<00:03:51.210> and<00:03:51.680> you<00:03:52.680> know<00:03:52.800> there<00:03:52.950> was

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
foreign players and you know there was

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.500 
foreign players and you know there was
always<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.580> lot<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.820> good<00:03:53.940> players<00:03:54.150> out<00:03:54.450> there

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.350 
but i think the the foreign players are
definitely<00:03:56.490> a<00:03:56.520> lot<00:03:56.610> stronger<00:03:56.850> than<00:03:57.030> they<00:03:57.210> used

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360
