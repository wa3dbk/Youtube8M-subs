3<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.340> thing<00:00:53.460> i<00:00:53.579> really<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.940> about<00:00:54.090> this

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
3 the one thing i really like about this

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.939 
3 the one thing i really like about this
is<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.629> they're<00:00:54.899> actually<00:00:55.140> extending<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
is that they're actually extending the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.430 
is that they're actually extending the
width<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.850> analog<00:00:57.600> stick<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.199> thumbs

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
width of the analog stick so your thumbs

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.560 
width of the analog stick so your thumbs
won't<00:00:58.739> cross<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.340> run<00:00:59.940> into<00:01:00.149> each<00:01:00.270> other<00:01:00.390> if

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
won't cross and run into each other if

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.029 
won't cross and run into each other if
you<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.809> bigger<00:01:01.289> hands<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.739> anything<00:01:01.829> like

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
you have bigger hands or anything like

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.560 
the way down and didn't really click at
all<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.549> feel<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.850> these<00:01:27.030> are<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
all I feel like these are going to be a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.690 
all I feel like these are going to be a
lot<00:01:27.780> better<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.409> use<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:28.829> shooters<00:01:29.159> because

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
lot better to use for shooters because

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.649 
lot better to use for shooters because
they<00:01:29.850> actually<00:01:29.909> are<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
they actually are going to have a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.719 
they actually are going to have a
responsiveness<00:01:31.350> when<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.189> click<00:01:32.310> them<00:01:32.549> down

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
responsiveness when you click them down

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.580 
responsiveness when you click them down
so<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.000> very<00:01:33.210> cool<00:01:33.420> very<00:01:33.659> big<00:01:34.140> features<00:01:34.500> that
