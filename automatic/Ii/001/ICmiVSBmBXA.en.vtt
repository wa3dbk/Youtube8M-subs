very<00:00:53.910> very<00:00:53.969> nice

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.109 
obviously how to set up and pair with
Bluetooth<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> NFC<00:01:34.829> technology<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:36.000> let's

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
Bluetooth or the NFC technology so let's

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.420 
Bluetooth or the NFC technology so let's
just<00:01:36.299> move<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.600> box<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.259> side<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.189> let's

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
just move the box to one side and let's

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.819 
just move the box to one side and let's
bring<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.880> little<00:01:39.210> box<00:01:39.390> back<00:01:39.689> into<00:01:40.049> view<00:01:40.350> so

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
bring this little box back into view so

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.880 
bring this little box back into view so
in<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.490> looks<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.479> 3.5<00:01:43.409> jack

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
in here it looks like we have a 3.5 jack

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190 
in here it looks like we have a 3.5 jack
cables<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.549> obviously<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.720> connect<00:01:46.049> your

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
cables so obviously you can connect your

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.100 
cables so obviously you can connect your
mp3<00:01:46.710> player<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:47.220> phone<00:01:47.549> via<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.509> cable<00:01:48.720> rather

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
mp3 player or phone via the cable rather

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.100 
mp3 player or phone via the cable rather
than<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> wireless<00:01:49.860> methods<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.610> wish

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
than the wireless methods if you wish

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.170 
than the wireless methods if you wish
the<00:01:52.110> next<00:01:52.350> thing<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> box<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the next thing in the box is the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.020 
the next thing in the box is the
charging<00:01:55.140> cable<00:01:55.409> bada<00:01:55.740> looks<00:01:55.979> things<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
charging cable bada looks things so the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.840 
charging cable bada looks things so the
actual<00:01:57.299> speaker<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.020> charged<00:01:58.590> by<00:01:58.710> microUSB<00:01:59.670> so

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
actual speaker is charged by microUSB so

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.639 
actual speaker is charged by microUSB so
obviously<00:02:00.060> plug<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.390> into<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.600> USB<00:02:00.840> socket<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
obviously plug it into a USB socket and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.219 
obviously plug it into a USB socket and
then<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> microUSB<00:02:02.729> into<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.840> speaker

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
then the microUSB into the speaker

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.230 
then the microUSB into the speaker
itself<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.280> let's<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.700> put<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.149> one

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
itself so let's just put that to one

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.180 
itself so let's just put that to one
side<00:02:06.299> that's<00:02:06.780> all<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.110> accessories<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.770> get

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
