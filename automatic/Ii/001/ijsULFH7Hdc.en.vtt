00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
which is very cool I didn't like it at

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.900 
which is very cool I didn't like it at
first<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.600> grown<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:36.840> me<00:00:37.050> since<00:00:37.350> then<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
first but it's grown on me since then a

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.890 
first but it's grown on me since then a
figure<00:00:38.910> comes<00:00:39.240> with<00:00:39.630> a<00:00:40.520> gun<00:00:41.520> same<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.660> in

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
figure comes with a gun same one as in

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.600 
figure comes with a gun same one as in
the<00:00:43.050> mark<00:00:43.970> mark<00:00:44.970> to<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.989> different<00:00:46.260> colored

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
the mark mark to just different colored

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.210 
the mark mark to just different colored
um<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> missile<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:49.130> shoots<00:00:51.110> uh<00:00:52.110> pretty<00:00:53.010> well

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
um a missile that shoots uh pretty well

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.500 
um a missile that shoots uh pretty well
I<00:00:53.370> guess<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.290> three<00:00:55.290> armor<00:00:55.620> cards<00:00:56.510> looks

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
I guess and three armor cards looks

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.790 
I guess and three armor cards looks
pretty<00:00:57.660> dumb<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.079> he<00:00:58.230> has<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.350> missile

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
pretty dumb because he has the missile

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.819 
pretty dumb because he has the missile
on<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.489> it'd<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.610> much<00:00:59.880> better<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.360> you<00:01:00.450> didn't

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
on and it'd be much better if you didn't

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.929 
on and it'd be much better if you didn't
but<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.640> still<00:01:02.820> pretty<00:01:02.880> cool<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.329> guess<00:01:04.939> hi

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
but it's still pretty cool I guess hi

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.359 
but it's still pretty cool I guess hi
guys<00:01:06.119> staff<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.600> configure<00:01:07.070> just<00:01:08.070> saw<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.250> in

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
clear plastic over it so that looks

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.940 
clear plastic over it so that looks
really<00:01:14.130> shiny<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:15.240> armor<00:01:15.630> looks<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.740> really

very much but I noticed there's a lot of

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.200 
very much but I noticed there's a lot of
variances<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.780> some<00:01:55.140> figures<00:01:55.470> figure

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
joint in the leg and the hips so if you

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.009 
joint in the leg and the hips so if you
want<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:26.049> to<00:02:26.170> go<00:02:26.260> in<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.680> out<00:02:26.739> then<00:02:27.930> do<00:02:28.930> it

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
want to like to go in and out then do it

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.750 
want to like to go in and out then do it
like<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:30.010> if<00:02:30.099> you<00:02:30.189> wanted<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.489> move<00:02:30.610> up

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
like that but if you wanted to move up

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.399 
like that but if you wanted to move up
and<00:02:30.939> down<00:02:31.030> then<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.450> go<00:02:31.569> like<00:02:31.599> rotate<00:02:32.200> the

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
and down then you go like rotate the

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.470 
and down then you go like rotate the
ball<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:33.010> don't<00:02:33.340> know<00:02:33.430> just<00:02:33.760> like<00:02:33.939> maneuver<00:02:34.390> it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
ball I don't know just like maneuver it

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.580 
ball I don't know just like maneuver it
so<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:34.959> now<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.260> leg<00:02:35.849> can<00:02:36.849> go<00:02:37.060> up<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.109> down

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
so that now the leg can go up and down

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.030 
so that now the leg can go up and down
like<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.569> um<00:02:40.569> there's<00:02:41.530> no<00:02:41.620> real<00:02:41.859> way<00:02:41.890> to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
like that um there's no real way to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.679 
like that um there's no real way to
describe<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.670> but<00:02:42.819> once<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.120> get<00:02:43.329> when<00:02:43.540> you

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
describe it but once you get when you

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:51.319 
describe it but once you get when you
figure<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.079> out<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.720> like<00:02:46.989> that<00:02:49.950> knee<00:02:50.950> joint

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
figure it out and like that knee joint

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.199 
figure it out and like that knee joint
double<00:02:52.329> knee<00:02:52.480> articulation<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.470> very<00:02:53.799> cool<00:02:54.209> so

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
double knee articulation is very cool so

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.449 
double knee articulation is very cool so
you<00:02:55.299> can<00:02:55.690> really<00:02:55.889> bend<00:02:56.889> his<00:02:57.040> knees<00:02:57.220> all<00:02:57.430> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
you can really bend his knees all the

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.420 
you can really bend his knees all the
way<00:02:57.519> back<00:02:57.730> just<00:02:57.970> like<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> human<00:02:59.040> and<00:03:00.040> then<00:03:00.400> a

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
way back just like a human and then a

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.149 
way back just like a human and then a
ball<00:03:00.639> joint<00:03:00.849> in<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.629> ankles<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:05.590> shoulder

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
ball joint in the ankles the shoulder

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.770 
ball joint in the ankles the shoulder
pads<00:03:06.400> unlike<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.389> mark<00:03:07.599> to<00:03:08.340> figure<00:03:09.340> are<00:03:09.780> stuck

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
pads unlike the mark to figure are stuck

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.170 
pads unlike the mark to figure are stuck
on<00:03:11.010> which<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.159> very<00:03:12.370> good<00:03:12.639> they<00:03:12.909> won't<00:03:13.090> be

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
on which is very good they won't be

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.280 
on which is very good they won't be
popping<00:03:13.540> off<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:14.709> it<00:03:14.799> doesn't<00:03:15.069> really<00:03:15.159> hinder

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
popping off and it doesn't really hinder

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.080 
popping off and it doesn't really hinder
it<00:03:17.310> as<00:03:18.310> much<00:03:18.549> as<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:19.329> mark<00:03:19.540> five<00:03:19.780> because

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
it as much as the mark five because

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.849 
it as much as the mark five because
they're<00:03:22.090> soft<00:03:22.959> rubber<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.530> they're<00:03:23.680> pretty

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
they're soft rubber and they're pretty

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.330 
they're soft rubber and they're pretty
small<00:03:25.230> painting<00:03:26.230> detailing<00:03:26.829> as<00:03:26.889> I<00:03:27.040> said<00:03:27.250> is

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
small painting detailing as I said is

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.220 
small painting detailing as I said is
very<00:03:27.400> cool<00:03:28.620> looks<00:03:30.750> just<00:03:31.750> like<00:03:31.900> Iron<00:03:32.199> Man

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
very cool looks just like Iron Man

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:40.110 
very cool looks just like Iron Man
should<00:03:35.909> the<00:03:36.909> whole<00:03:37.620> torso<00:03:38.620> armor<00:03:39.159> is<00:03:39.340> like<00:03:40.090> a

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
should the whole torso armor is like a

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.550 
should the whole torso armor is like a
different<00:03:40.510> shape<00:03:40.720> now<00:03:40.930> let's<00:03:41.139> switch<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.530> a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
different shape now let's switch to a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:52.760 
different shape now let's switch to a
triangle<00:03:42.269> which<00:03:43.269> is<00:03:43.389> very<00:03:43.540> cool
