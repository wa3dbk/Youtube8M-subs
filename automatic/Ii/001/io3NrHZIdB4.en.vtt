00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.269
 People, I'm here on the border with 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.440

 truck had never seen the first 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.240
 time in a fire truck 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.180
 It is due to the necessity of the tunnel 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.519
 you can see the tunnel entrance 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.990

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.399

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.470
 I just woke up brushing the

 there the bug how this mixed size 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:21.050

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.280
 truck fire department of here 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.280

 I was talking to a friend of mine. 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.340
 né increase the truck stopped 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.730
 he said that by tunnel need 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.480
 huh 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.990
 You can either forward back has 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.990
 two options 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.780
 and something else and he also has two 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.660
 here too on the left is 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.520
 the case can both address here 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.560
 can come from there also has another steering wheel 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.810
 there on the left hand side too 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.170
 huh 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.780
 You see up there is another one. 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.600
 flyer now show you too 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.400
 one thing that I was calling my 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:14.750
 curiosity that I was seeing the 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.790
 newest trucks to d 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.860
 already since last year this year also 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.280
 I was seeing now laid a 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.459
 trucker and with envy right? 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.980
 and he said I had a question with him 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.160
 because I did not know and now it's coming 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.060
 a new but personal ramp system 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.230
 It is not a rice doha and around the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.270
 same as Brazil, right? 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.430
 here it also has a hard odor to see but 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.420
 Do you think like Brazil? 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.030
 but this is a new system 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.180
 I asked him to speak to the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:54.320
 can be found here in Brazil. 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.320
 see and show you this is the new 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.980
 system are now going out on the trucks 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.980
 younger 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.069
 Yes, it's right here in the front wheel too. 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.079
 admits with the grandmother né attacked and nuno 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.829
 Chick 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.420
 Then I asked him for himself how 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:18.669
 It worked the system he told me. 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:21.639
 which is a new system and now it is not 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:26.919
 maintaining the tire pressure is only 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:28.600
 to be able to tell you is not wanted 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.979
 keeps me the pressure left to tell the 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.380
 pressure, huh? 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.590
 at that very moment he was 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.020
 wheel is missing or quoted below the 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.780
 pressure recommended by 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.250
 manufacturer 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.440
 then it is only for this purpose 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.169
 device but is not intended to 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.240
 keep the wheel there keep the tire right 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.180
 in its proper protection is only for 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.660
 improve to measure to tell him 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.510
 he says he has a lula sensor there is a 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.630
 sensor and accuses him there on the panel, right? 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.720
 and it's not one he said that is not efficient 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.669
 it's not good, it does not like it, it stays when 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.340
 does it and when is it hot 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:13.900
 When you get hot, you talk. 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:17.560
 that the wheel is out of pressure is not 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.660
 cool and gets his ass in there 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.729
 panel and said that it is not a good system 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:27.580
 It's not enough to disturb your friend. 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:31.810
 because even the wheel is fighting in the 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.990
 Just pressure is it on it stays there 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.690
 within a device saying 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:42.639
 It's not good, it's fine, it's good. 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:44.770
 stop to be able to calibrate the tire right 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.710
 that's it difficult to quickly crowd around 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:52.990
 It's up to the rope now and we're coming down. 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:54.790
 to be able to here is the other is another scania 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.360
 ii 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.400
 a company that works with me 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.780
 the one who drives also drives 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.730
 to plan 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.370
 I started working with this one later. 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.730
 I went through a botton flight and the 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.250
 Yellow films in a lighthouse is very 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.130

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.120
 The dispatcher called me saying that 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:36.640
 I'm going to have to do national here I go 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:38.440
