00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.490
 Hello friends, bed 74 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:20.499
 today we look at the frets of the grant 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:23.019
 liftback b here immediately the music in it began 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:27.509
 I don’t know why to play the gamepad 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:31.440
 take i missed it essentially there that is 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:35.530
 just well due to the fact that the work was 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.230
 Due to the fact that there was a lot of work 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:43.150
 but there is a lot of music here and it’s all 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:46.950
 authoring maybe not so 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.550
 present light goes with us 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.340
 khaki 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.989
 oh there is all out of the cabin but the camera is high 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.989
 worth of course, in principle, not bad 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.989
 not bad 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.059
 not bad design in the cabin 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.420
 Here is such a signal, and so she has 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.420
 wheels are changing 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.640
 you know a but this chetyrka was there 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.380
 the wheels were interchangeable here 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.040
 here's a variation we'll go of course to these 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.020
 actually nothing more here 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.250
 consider the car for tinted 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.870
 flom and drove a look at what it is 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.870
 able monster 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.350
 otherwise I can not name 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.049
 because it really is a monster 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.040
 I look with you now too 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:00.869
 first time we drove 20 faces with this 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.960
 let's see what will save us yes in principle 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:12.780
 on handling it helped better than 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:20.010
 the foursome behaves such rare drag 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:22.470
 started about uncontrollable harsh of course yes 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:29.310
 so that and wrapping your mother let's 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:31.080
 differential that's really it give a sample without 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.170
 differential how is she better but she 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:39.120
 Drift starting but in my opinion it is much 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.540
 better than with differential when she 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:47.190
 there is just right in your mouth small 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.160
 fast does not go that is it it 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.160
 maximum speed is normal at all 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.900
 quiet quiet quiet quiet 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.000
 the second ring we will go on the inner 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.570
 on the second circle around the inner ring and 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.290
 will go see how it is with us 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.980
 jumps the ledge better to cut in 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.980
 ok pass 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.900
 Ltd 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.820
 mother honest bent yes it was necessary 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.520
 originally here to go here she hung 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:35.910
 rides but she is broken down already has to 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:40.290
 catch a little and flop 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:47.280
 differential does not help need to be removed here 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:47.940
 swamp legs are bad for just a little 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.550
 ride 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.550
 oh song changed love 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.720
 in general, like some here like this 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.990
 goes lada granta limber rashenic and 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.990
 already 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:21.960
 with curbs back in all thefts 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.880
 going well ok i'm shocked at all 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:28.810
 I would like to know in the morning 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.850
 start with such energetic sharpened and here 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.030
 today were to consider those fashions 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.940
 which I missed my scope not my 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.530
 employment just didn't have time for them 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:47.009
 consider oh oh yes sadness sadness and 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.009
 bolin still like him soundtrack 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.010
 accelerate let's faster 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.960
 not according to mine on the machine it is much 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:59.560
 faster rides and better e-my cow 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.560
 jambs 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:14.419
 go 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:16.030
 top with tony di doesn't tear rides anyway yes 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.940
 it seems to me if the coupling 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.460
 with the wheels twist and she was holding 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.250
 know a little way at least it would be 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:31.280
 much cool well and so for the most part 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:34.810
 account pretty well go if here 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.159
 vary between differential and 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.490
 disable it permanently include the 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:44.860
 the car will go fine at all for 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.860
 alignment include differential 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.580
 feet 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.780
 Yes, not bad, a good sharpener 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.130
 go for a drive on 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:03.610
 on the ground on the track for some smooth 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:05.650
 for those exactly and created this car and
