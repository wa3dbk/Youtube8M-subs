wealth so pleased about that

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.640 
wealth so pleased about that
particularly<00:00:23.119> for<00:00:23.180> check<00:00:23.480> because<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.810> tough

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
particularly for check because the tough

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.500 
particularly for check because the tough
game<00:00:24.890> and<00:00:25.130> they<00:00:25.190> went<00:00:25.340> down<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:25.609> 10<00:00:25.820> men<00:00:25.850> for<00:00:26.060> I

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
game and they went down to 10 men for I

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.380 
game and they went down to 10 men for I
think<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.840> whole<00:00:26.960> of<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:27.140> second<00:00:27.439> half<00:00:27.560> so

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
think the whole of the second half so

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.130 
think the whole of the second half so
probably<00:00:29.390> ought<00:00:29.480> to<00:00:29.539> be<00:00:29.630> careful<00:00:29.960> with<00:00:30.050> in

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140

because<00:01:26.719> I<00:01:26.899> mean<00:01:27.229> you'd<00:01:27.679> imagine<00:01:28.159> if<00:01:28.250> your

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
because I mean you'd imagine if your

because I mean you'd imagine if your
massive<00:01:28.579> loss<00:01:28.909> if<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.450> was<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.689> be<00:01:29.840> over<00:01:30.200> a

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
massive loss if it was to be over a

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.590 
massive loss if it was to be over a
matter<00:01:30.649> of<00:01:30.799> months<00:01:31.039> which<00:01:31.490> initially<00:01:32.090> looked

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
matter of months which initially looked

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.179 
matter of months which initially looked
his<00:01:32.810> what<00:01:32.990> later<00:01:33.170> be<00:01:33.469> well<00:01:33.890> they<00:01:33.950> could<00:01:34.100> have

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
his what later be well they could have

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.380 
his what later be well they could have
been<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.310> recurrence<00:01:34.759> of<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:34.969> injury<00:01:35.240> had

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
been a recurrence of the injury had

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.029 
been a recurrence of the injury had
before<00:01:35.749> and<00:01:35.780> that's<00:01:36.109> what<00:01:36.259> we<00:01:36.350> worried<00:01:36.649> for

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
before and that's what we worried for

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.959 
before and that's what we worried for
and<00:01:38.530> but<00:01:39.530> as<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:39.770> say<00:01:40.039> he's<00:01:40.249> trained<00:01:40.579> today<00:01:40.729> in

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
and but as I say he's trained today in

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.319 
and but as I say he's trained today in
his<00:01:41.479> fine<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:43.100> he<00:01:43.789> played<00:01:44.030> really<00:01:44.240> well

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
his fine the he played really well

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.319 
his fine the he played really well
thought<00:01:44.749> was<00:01:44.960> Swansea<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.820> we<00:01:46.820> need<00:01:47.030> him<00:01:47.179> to

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
thought was Swansea and we need him to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
quite design on paper at the moment so

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.470 
quite design on paper at the moment so
how<00:02:17.380> crucial<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.010> did<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.190> affair<00:02:18.480> well

Paul's<00:02:21.580> learning<00:02:22.120> his<00:02:22.239> trade<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.640> doing<00:02:25.480> a

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
Paul's learning his trade and doing a

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.199 
Paul's learning his trade and doing a
good<00:02:26.230> job<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.620> think<00:02:26.650> at<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.069> moment<00:02:27.130> we<00:02:27.970> have

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
good job I think at the moment we have

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.350 
good job I think at the moment we have
sadio<00:02:29.050> backing<00:02:29.530> him<00:02:29.620> up<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:30.030> two<00:02:31.030> very<00:02:31.300> young

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
sadio backing him up so two very young

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.059 
sadio backing him up so two very young
players<00:02:31.750> left<00:02:32.110> back<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.470> darrel<00:02:32.590> he's<00:02:32.830> first

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
players left back and darrel he's first

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.100 
players left back and darrel he's first
season<00:02:33.489> in<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:34.060> Premier<00:02:34.390> League<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.720> he's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
season in the Premier League and he's

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.900 
season in the Premier League and he's
adjusting<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:36.069> think<00:02:36.730> he's

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
adjusting to that I think he's

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.850 
adjusting to that I think he's
performances<00:02:37.690> have<00:02:37.870> been<00:02:37.900> up<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.680> down<00:02:38.709> a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
performances have been up and down a

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.580 
performances have been up and down a
little<00:02:39.130> bit<00:02:39.370> but<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.480> think<00:02:41.110> he's<00:02:41.290> going<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.500> get

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
little bit but I think he's going to get

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.320 
little bit but I think he's going to get
better<00:02:41.769> from<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.069> point<00:02:42.370> forward<00:02:42.610> have<00:02:43.209> you

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330

have had but of course the international
break<00:03:01.390> prevented<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.110> we've<00:03:02.620> worked<00:03:02.830> hard

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920

on the players that we've had and
they've<00:03:04.600> worked<00:03:04.630> really<00:03:04.900> well<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.410> week

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
they've worked really well this week

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.050 
they've worked really well this week
been<00:03:05.950> really<00:03:06.160> pleased<00:03:06.370> sometimes<00:03:06.819> this

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
been really pleased sometimes this

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.030 
been really pleased sometimes this
becomes<00:03:07.569> a<00:03:07.720> little<00:03:07.900> bit<00:03:08.110> there's<00:03:08.739> no<00:03:08.860> real

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
becomes a little bit there's no real

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.199 
becomes a little bit there's no real
focus<00:03:09.489> because<00:03:09.670> there's<00:03:09.850> no<00:03:09.970> game

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209

particularly<00:03:10.570> last<00:03:10.870> week's<00:03:11.140> work<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:12.370> can<00:03:12.430> get

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
particularly last week's work it can get

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.190 
particularly last week's work it can get
lost<00:03:13.030> sometimes<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:13.780> we've<00:03:13.900> worked<00:03:14.140> really

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200

lost sometimes but we've worked really
well<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:15.670> think<00:03:16.980> we're<00:03:17.980> in<00:03:18.010> pretty<00:03:18.130> good

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
well and I think we're in pretty good

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.310 
well and I think we're in pretty good
shape<00:03:18.700> as<00:03:18.910> we<00:03:19.030> can<00:03:19.209> be<00:03:19.390> in<00:03:19.930> terms<00:03:20.170> of

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
shape as we can be in terms of

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.910 
shape as we can be in terms of
