 difficult and from time to time you will see 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.920
 they are out there then when a 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.320
 thing running behind and making mess 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.780
 here you already know that it is not an act is the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.329
 My wonderful dog and I'll tell 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.770
 for you in the history of my iphone 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.570
 Why do a lot of people ask facebook? 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.270
 had promised that I would talk about 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.469
 This and the girls there on facebook too. 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.890
 some on youtube were asking 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.840
 so let's see what has changed in the iphone 4 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.760
 and 5 I had 14 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 hence I was fighting happily on the street 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.020
 some time ago from golan paulista nor 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.360
 to see it in google maps what was 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.820
 happening where it was a boat to arrive 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.860
 and I'm human and got the cell phone 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.350
 bike and went away and got nothing 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.759
 that I could do so I went 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.860
 robbed, I do not know, the guy does not 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.570
 sold and there is nothing to hide got 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.460
 in yours there and take it away 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.460
 so I got desperate cell phone 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.860
 time and it was kind of boring for us 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.079
 I used to do what is a thing of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.390
 Suddenly you do not have too bad and 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.030
 I ended up buying iphone 5 is I leave 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.280
 to buy the iphone 5 because first is 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.229
 a sheet a4 was two years old already already 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.090
 I was half-baked and a button in the middle. 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.979
 was no longer working then already 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.270
 competes with the same way only 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.460
 They expect the two to three months to 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.470
 buy and then I ended up buying at that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.720
 same moment I was robbed 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.970
 Look, I do not know the difference, but who? 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.200
 this man UN've written here in 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.170
 sign-up box 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.719
 and there it is after using iphone 4 for 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.880
 long time and now the iphone 5 is me 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.219
 I will say more or less what has changed and 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.110
 that changed was that the front camera that 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.840
 this camera from now on is that the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.440
 people use 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.269
 so boyish express this camera 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.010
 has changed and she is much better than 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:20.500
 duck of the 4s only he is thinner 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.590
 lighter and a little bigger more 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.569
 Neon longsleeve iphone 4 he has 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.030
 four quadrants part here so more 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.970
 or less the line of the day appeared effect 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.120
 in photos comparing and the only thing I 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.060
 I'll leave a blog post so I'll go 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.739
 access the blog and the only thing that changes is 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.170
 I know it's lighter. 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.370
 the front camera is different and is a 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.470
 a little faster 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.329
 just so I think if you go 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.250
 change the phone just to make a 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.099
 upgrade of the device that will drop a 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.629
 best phone does not pay unless 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.940
 let the front gang do so much 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.349
 difference for you and for what? 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.019
 Do you do it on a daily basis? 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.220
 now if you ever wanted to change even is 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.310
 a faulty thing is annoying me 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.060
 I think it's worth you to buy the 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.650
 room or 4s elcio would associate the camera 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.329
 front have made much difference if 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.100
 you have money left know you are 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.709
 a new thing a minimum but does not change 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.420
 a lot and had a time that my 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.329
 frame a problem it the problem 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.880
 here on this button on the change side of 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.950
 vibrates to top and is that this button 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.109
 got stuck and I had to send it to 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.630
 I was almost back in exchange for 14 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.579
 She knows why I do not have yes. 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.799
 I think the material on the board was 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.109
 You better know the button I feel go 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.109
 spoil and when the damage was nothing 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.639
 as well as ball 64 again but I 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.209
 I ended up staying with him and I did not have any more 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:45.430
 problems and so a tip is to trace if the 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.169
 your iphone 4 4s 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.859
 if you already have some time and he is 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:53.319
 half nerd you save all your 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.660
 backup parent stuff in icloud and there you 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.790
 restores it goes there in itunes and registers 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.139
 your cell phone from zero red to all 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.090
 applications and you will have to download 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.250
 new but he will not win 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.390
 Andante phones also the commitment 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.849
 to keep everything 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.519
 the metal settings hold everything and the 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.080
 phone will come back much faster 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.940
 that's when the computer knows when it is 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.220
 bad full of things already a game a lot 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.040
 time it gets bad is not the 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.139
 phone is bad here oo software 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.600
 give you the bugs and just as you 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.030
 restore once a year that the cell phone 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.350
 back to normal and gets much faster 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.110
 something else that I also give the hint of 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.479
 you make you always keep with ios4 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.540
 I'll leave and I bought my 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:37.090
 iphone 5 on the free market i release i 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.770
 I went there at the store to get the iphone so I go 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.050
 leave this ift contact 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.700
 I think he faces history and 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.919
 free market for those who live off the river 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.720
 from São Paulo and I'm going to leave this store 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.490
 because I ended up paying more 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.380
 why the god market free they me 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.240
 charged a percentage of the free market 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.740
 but when you go straight into the store without 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.240
 of the bid it usually makes a 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.430
 discount then if you live in são paulo 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.660
 you can even search when I 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.979
 I had a problem 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.979
 I discovered that my device is a 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.930
 version that does not have here in Brazil then 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.700
 They can not take me from Brazil. 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.010
 help at all can not change the 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.300
 phone for me I went there in the store that 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.250
 store personnel took him to the 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.110
 united states in three days they 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.000
 returned with new cell phone 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.530
 So just to tell you more 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.789
 or less the experience I had because 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.070
 I know what a purchase made in the book is 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.020
 complicated and I think I just bought 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.030
 Why was MercadoPago then Market? 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.580
 free to return the money if 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.080
 some problem and because he was able to 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.910
 shop is because you leave the store with a 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.289
 cell phone in hand also no price 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.340
 so I 'll leave the contacts to 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.860
 You, because I know a lot of people 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.539
 likes to buy such and it sure was 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.580
 much cheaper than in the store and I 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.210
 I did not have to tie the plane of a 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.650
 year 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.320
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.150
 liked the tip a kiss from ipv6 on 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.150
 Next video is
