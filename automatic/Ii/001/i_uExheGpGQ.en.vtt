00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello I will show you how 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.879
 ask a full water shift then he 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.130
 you need 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:13.530
 your car shifts no matter 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:18.539
 I chose this one a top coat a 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.850
 piece of cotton tweezers a 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.990
 pair of scissors and a glass of water 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.910
 hot then the water of the shorts 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.950
 present in a small pouch like 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:37.160
 this behind there is so we'll go out the 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.160
 waves 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.820
 so there is no protector over a 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.800
 film to protect carla presents itself 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.140
 like that so in fact he gives us a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.239
 lime but in me i'm going to show you 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.149
 our trick instead of using the lime 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.829
 so in fact there are twelve nails so of 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.280
 different size actually compared to 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.339
 your fingers 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.750
 so in fact you look so of course 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.979
 the two biggest ones and for the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.080
 shoots of my if you have inches 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.990
 smaller or poet take something else 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.700
 we look at the size and even if 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.150
 it's too big you can cut on 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.490
 on the sides so there toddlers and 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.020
 at the ends it's for the little ones 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.000
 fingers 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:29.700
 so in fact is that the shiso is going 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.229
 cut each nail a parent by 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:41.180
 size relation of course you 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:44.810
 look if it's okay or scary like that 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.810
 after that for that 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:02:00.259
 so that I take it off 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:03.909
 ok platter and so take it so you 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.909
 have your five tabs 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.920
 here is the chick yeah that's me 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.810
 should go 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.470
 so you do not take with the forceps to 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.090
 epilate like that and you soak it in 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.330
 hot water expect a little 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:28.250
 moment it's like a silva tattoo 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:32.709
 take off here is where we have a 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.610
 tongue to take the tattoo 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.069
 so it's very very very very very very hungry 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.670
 wanted to stick and you put it on 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:47.260
 your nail so how wet it is 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.260
 glide very very easily 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.220
 you can put it as you want 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:11.340
 the voltage that is not price like here 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:16.590
 maya a fold comes flatten and so with 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.510
 the cotton will absorb the water that is ashamed 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.270
 bring a little bit on it that removes it 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.270
 the water and it will stop slipping in fact 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.030
 so you see that goes beyond so in fact 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.600
 the food was made for that it was for 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.880
 to file the surplus in fact except that I 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.010
 shows you another tip with the 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.810
 top coat make you matte coast goes 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.010
 dissolve the paper in fact so you in 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.450
 just put his strange like that and that 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:54.960
 will dissolve so you will have more than 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:58.680
 to shoot it and it takes off alone 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.120
 see that's the part that was so 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.090
 in fact it has dissolved so it's more 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.230
 simple instead of beds but it goes more 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.870
 so soon after you put theux 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.080
 rating especially the nail so they 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.080
 take 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.150
 yes it stays a little on the edges but 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.150
 that with the highway dissolves 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:35.539
 Here now we start to 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:35.539
 other fingers we understand we quench 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.470
 we take off 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.580
 and we put on the nail 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.500
 we absorb the water 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:21.830
 so there there is a surplus the teeth you 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:33.620
 take your side you were just 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:35.870
 on the edge and you pull that 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.240
 took off more than put top 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.240
 coat and make all the nails
