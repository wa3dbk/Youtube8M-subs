00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
during tempest block i thought it was

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.030 
during tempest block i thought it was
great<00:03:28.330> there's<00:03:29.050> three<00:03:29.230> colors<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.740> loaded<00:03:29.920> him

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
great there's three colors I loaded him

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.800 
great there's three colors I loaded him
up<00:03:30.160> with<00:03:30.310> creature<00:03:30.520> enchantments<00:03:31.240> and<00:03:31.390> I

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
up with creature enchantments and I

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.140 
up with creature enchantments and I
didn't<00:03:32.140> end<00:03:32.230> up<00:03:32.320> doing<00:03:32.590> too<00:03:32.709> good<00:03:32.860> but<00:03:33.150> that's

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
didn't end up doing too good but that's

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.660 
didn't end up doing too good but that's
to<00:03:34.270> be<00:03:34.300> expected<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.870> guess

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.510

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.510 
Yokohama which was my second Pro Tour
the<00:05:25.650> first<00:05:25.830> time<00:05:25.950> I<00:05:26.010> was<00:05:26.100> actually<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.460> little

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
the first time I was actually a little

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.550 
the first time I was actually a little
prepared<00:05:27.090> for<00:05:27.330> so<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.110> went<00:05:28.289> to<00:05:28.440> that

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
prepared for so I went to that

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.810 
prepared for so I went to that
tournament<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:29.130> thought<00:05:29.280> I<00:05:29.340> was<00:05:29.430> going<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.640> get

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
tournament I thought I was going to get

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.520 
tournament I thought I was going to get
crushed<00:05:30.120> because<00:05:30.360> I<00:05:30.630> thought<00:05:30.870> I<00:05:30.930> wasn't<00:05:31.470> any

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
crushed because I thought I wasn't any

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.100 
crushed because I thought I wasn't any
good<00:05:31.620> but<00:05:32.010> I<00:05:32.070> ended<00:05:32.370> up<00:05:32.490> finishing<00:05:33.120> 35th<00:05:33.960> I

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
good but I ended up finishing 35th I

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.560 
good but I ended up finishing 35th I
believe<00:05:34.350> in<00:05:34.470> that<00:05:34.560> tournament<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.190> I<00:05:35.729> really

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
believe in that tournament and I really

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.790 
believe in that tournament and I really
realized<00:05:36.720> that<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.169> people<00:05:37.320> on<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.650> train

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
realized that the people on the train

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.350 
realized that the people on the train
weren't<00:05:38.580> that<00:05:38.700> much<00:05:38.789> better<00:05:38.970> than<00:05:39.120> me<00:05:39.240> and

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
weren't that much better than me and

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.020 
weren't that much better than me and
that<00:05:39.450> I<00:05:39.510> could<00:05:39.750> do<00:05:39.870> it
