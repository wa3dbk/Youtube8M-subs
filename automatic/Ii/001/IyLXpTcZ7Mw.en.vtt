gonna be talking about pretty much
everything<00:00:17.449> that<00:00:18.449> has<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:18.990> with<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
everything that has to do with the

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.960 
everything that has to do with the
balance<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:20.100> your<00:00:20.880> helicopter<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.630> calmness

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
balance of your helicopter and calmness

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.810 
balance of your helicopter and calmness
balance<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.179> battery<00:00:25.009> because<00:00:26.009> your<00:00:26.460> battery

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
balance and battery because your battery

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.810 
balance and battery because your battery
is<00:00:30.859> at<00:00:31.859> least<00:00:32.009> ostensibly<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:35.610> most

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
is at least ostensibly the the most

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.670 
is at least ostensibly the the most
dynamic<00:00:36.030> factor<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.020> has<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.440> know<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
dynamic factor that has you know the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.120 
dynamic factor that has you know the
overall<00:00:39.620> how<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.740> I<00:00:40.800> put<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.070> two<00:00:41.220> dynamic

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
overall how can I put this two dynamic

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.440 
overall how can I put this two dynamic
variants<00:00:44.130> of<00:00:44.340> higher<00:00:44.550> helicopter<00:00:45.240> is<00:00:45.300> gonna

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
variants of higher helicopter is gonna

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.400 
variants of higher helicopter is gonna
be<00:00:45.600> balanced

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
be balanced

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.710 
be balanced
sure<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.250> mean<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.700> add<00:00:47.850> modifications

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
sure you mean you can add modifications

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.290 
sure you mean you can add modifications
and<00:00:49.050> add<00:00:49.950> things<00:00:50.310> subtract<00:00:50.850> things<00:00:51.060> and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
and add things subtract things and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.170 
and add things subtract things and
that's<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.660> change<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.080> too<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:53.180> your

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
that's going to change it too but your

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.970 
that's going to change it too but your
battery<00:00:54.540> is<00:00:54.690> something<00:00:54.990> that<00:00:55.110> you're<00:00:55.230> putting

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
battery is something that you're putting

will stick into the nose cone okay but

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.070 
will stick into the nose cone okay but
now<00:04:40.900> watch<00:04:41.080> what<00:04:41.290> happens<00:04:42.570> when<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.600> go<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:43.840> lift

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
now watch what happens when I go to lift

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.630 
now watch what happens when I go to lift
it<00:04:44.200> up<00:04:44.290> this<00:04:44.440> time

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.490 

get<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.730> tail<00:04:48.910> more<00:04:49.180> in<00:04:49.270> view<00:04:49.480> there<00:04:49.690> the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
get the tail more in view there the

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.540 
get the tail more in view there the
skids<00:04:50.800> are<00:04:51.090> move<00:04:52.090> this<00:04:52.270> back<00:04:52.510> okay<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:54.220> I<00:04:54.370> pick

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
skids are move this back okay and I pick

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.860 
skids are move this back okay and I pick
it<00:04:54.670> up<00:04:54.730> you'll<00:04:54.880> see<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.300> skids<00:04:55.570> will

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
it up you'll see that the skids will

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.310 
it up you'll see that the skids will
come<00:04:56.170> off<00:04:56.350> a<00:04:56.380> little<00:04:56.680> bit<00:04:56.920> first<00:04:58.140> even<00:04:59.140> like

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
come off a little bit first even like

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.380 
come off a little bit first even like
this<00:04:59.500> but<00:05:00.430> what<00:05:00.550> you<00:05:00.670> have<00:05:00.850> to<00:05:01.000> take<00:05:01.180> into

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
this but what you have to take into

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.710 
this but what you have to take into
account<00:05:01.570> is<00:05:02.200> your<00:05:02.850> canopy<00:05:03.850> your<00:05:04.330> canopy

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
account is your canopy your canopy

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.380 
account is your canopy your canopy
weight<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:05.290> without<00:05:05.500> your<00:05:05.710> canopy<00:05:06.130> on<00:05:06.390> you're

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
weight so without your canopy on you're

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.830 
weight so without your canopy on you're
still<00:05:07.600> gonna<00:05:07.720> get<00:05:07.900> that<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.080> little<00:05:08.170> bit<00:05:09.840> okay

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
still gonna get that a little bit okay

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.350 
still gonna get that a little bit okay
so<00:05:10.900> now<00:05:11.230> let's<00:05:11.520> put<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.640> canopy<00:05:12.910> on<00:05:13.150> real

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
so now let's put the canopy on real

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:25.790 
so now let's put the canopy on real
quick<00:05:13.570> and<00:05:13.840> see<00:05:14.080> how<00:05:14.200> it<00:05:14.320> does<00:05:14.470> that<00:05:14.500> way

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.890 

okay<00:05:26.550> so<00:05:26.610> now<00:05:26.879> the<00:05:26.940> canopy's<00:05:27.479> on<00:05:27.660> and<00:05:27.810> we'll

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
okay so now the canopy's on and we'll

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.850 
okay so now the canopy's on and we'll
try<00:05:28.050> it<00:05:28.169> again<00:05:30.169> pick<00:05:31.169> it<00:05:31.289> up<00:05:31.610> by<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.639> fly<00:05:32.940> bar

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
try it again pick it up by the fly bar

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.950 
try it again pick it up by the fly bar
and<00:05:34.860> see<00:05:35.039> pretty<00:05:35.370> much<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.639> skids<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:36.509> the

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
and see pretty much the skids and the

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.860 
and see pretty much the skids and the
tail<00:05:37.229> are<00:05:37.560> coming<00:05:37.979> off<00:05:38.539> exactly<00:05:39.539> the<00:05:39.629> same

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
tail are coming off exactly the same

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.080 
tail are coming off exactly the same
time<00:05:40.199> and<00:05:40.470> that<00:05:40.590> means<00:05:40.860> that<00:05:41.129> your<00:05:41.430> helicopter

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
time and that means that your helicopter

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.070 
time and that means that your helicopter
is<00:05:42.240> balanced

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
is balanced

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.240 
is balanced
another<00:05:43.710> thing<00:05:44.039> quickly<00:05:44.340> is<00:05:44.990> that<00:05:46.039> you<00:05:47.039> can<00:05:47.159> do

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
another thing quickly is that you can do

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.510 
another thing quickly is that you can do
the<00:05:47.370> same<00:05:47.610> thing<00:05:50.240> with<00:05:51.240> your<00:05:52.520> perpendicular

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
the same thing with your perpendicular

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.210 
the same thing with your perpendicular
lateral<00:05:54.060> balance<00:05:54.240> by<00:05:54.599> just<00:05:55.099> swiveling<00:05:56.099> your

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
lateral balance by just swiveling your

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.070 
lateral balance by just swiveling your
knight<00:05:56.370> at<00:05:56.520> your<00:05:56.729> fly<00:05:57.090> bar<00:05:57.300> 90<00:05:57.629> degrees<00:05:57.960> around

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
knight at your fly bar 90 degrees around

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.680 
knight at your fly bar 90 degrees around
so<00:05:58.349> it's<00:05:58.530> going<00:05:58.680> fore-and-aft<00:05:59.310> and<00:06:00.270> doing<00:06:00.599> the

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
so it's going fore-and-aft and doing the

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.689 
so it's going fore-and-aft and doing the
same<00:06:00.930> thing<00:06:01.169> this<00:06:01.289> usually<00:06:01.770> isn't<00:06:01.919> too<00:06:02.550> much

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
same thing this usually isn't too much

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.529 
same thing this usually isn't too much
of<00:06:02.849> a<00:06:02.940> problem<00:06:03.330> but<00:06:03.479> it<00:06:03.599> can<00:06:03.900> be<00:06:05.360> sometimes<00:06:06.360> you

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
of a problem but it can be sometimes you

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.800 
of a problem but it can be sometimes you
might<00:06:07.190> have<00:06:08.190> some<00:06:08.909> hardware<00:06:09.240> mounted<00:06:09.599> on<00:06:09.690> the

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
might have some hardware mounted on the

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.830 
might have some hardware mounted on the
side<00:06:10.020> or<00:06:10.259> a<00:06:10.289> camera<00:06:10.620> or<00:06:11.069> whatever<00:06:11.310> and<00:06:11.909> it<00:06:12.630> will

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
side or a camera or whatever and it will

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.110 
side or a camera or whatever and it will
you<00:06:13.770> know<00:06:13.800> could<00:06:14.130> be<00:06:14.220> a<00:06:14.250> little<00:06:14.400> off<00:06:14.639> balance

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
you know could be a little off balance

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.120 
you know could be a little off balance
it's<00:06:15.990> too<00:06:16.169> far<00:06:16.409> off<00:06:16.560> you<00:06:16.770> might<00:06:16.889> want<00:06:17.069> to

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
it's too far off you might want to

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.540 
it's too far off you might want to
counterweight<00:06:17.639> it<00:06:17.819> on<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.599> other<00:06:18.719> side<00:06:19.050> or

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
counterweight it on the other side or

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.610 
counterweight it on the other side or
that<00:06:20.550> or<00:06:22.639> change<00:06:23.639> your<00:06:23.819> modification<00:06:24.620> but

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
that or change your modification but

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.469 
that or change your modification but
usually<00:06:25.979> it's<00:06:26.099> gonna<00:06:26.219> be<00:06:26.759> this<00:06:26.940> way<00:06:29.479> once

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
usually it's gonna be this way once

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.110 
usually it's gonna be this way once
again<00:06:30.780> I<00:06:30.810> can't<00:06:31.110> stress<00:06:31.289> enough<00:06:31.620> how<00:06:32.120> much

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
again I can't stress enough how much

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.969 
again I can't stress enough how much
this<00:06:33.599> will<00:06:33.810> make<00:06:33.990> a<00:06:34.020> difference<00:06:34.530> if<00:06:34.680> you<00:06:34.800> don't

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
this will make a difference if you don't

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.450 
this will make a difference if you don't
believe<00:06:35.280> me<00:06:36.199> just<00:06:37.199> try<00:06:37.289> it<00:06:37.530> sometime<00:06:38.009> put<00:06:38.280> your

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
believe me just try it sometime put your

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.689 
believe me just try it sometime put your
shove<00:06:38.969> your<00:06:39.090> battery<00:06:39.620> way<00:06:40.620> back<00:06:41.009> in<00:06:41.279> here<00:06:41.460> like

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
shove your battery way back in here like

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.399 
shove your battery way back in here like
they<00:06:41.880> show<00:06:42.120> on<00:06:42.300> a<00:06:42.330> lot<00:06:42.539> of<00:06:42.630> the<00:06:42.690> web<00:06:42.870> pages<00:06:43.110> I

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:43.409 
they show on a lot of the web pages I

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:45.140 
they show on a lot of the web pages I
have<00:06:43.440> no<00:06:44.039> idea<00:06:44.340> why<00:06:44.460> they<00:06:44.580> do<00:06:44.639> that<00:06:44.819> but<00:06:44.940> shove

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
have no idea why they do that but shove

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.029 
have no idea why they do that but shove
it<00:06:45.240> way<00:06:45.360> back<00:06:45.539> in<00:06:45.779> there<00:06:46.050> so<00:06:46.740> that<00:06:46.770> it's

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
it way back in there so that it's

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.180 
it way back in there so that it's
hanging<00:06:47.340> like<00:06:47.520> this<00:06:47.550> and<00:06:48.560> then<00:06:49.560> try<00:06:49.800> and<00:06:49.830> fly

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
hanging like this and then try and fly

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.469 
hanging like this and then try and fly
it<00:06:50.250> and<00:06:50.750> then<00:06:52.909> mount<00:06:53.909> your<00:06:54.090> battery<00:06:54.330> at<00:06:54.419> the

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 
it and then mount your battery at the

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.760 
it and then mount your battery at the
correct<00:06:54.779> way<00:06:54.990> mmm<00:06:55.650> that's<00:06:56.190> me<00:06:56.340> more<00:06:56.789> like<00:06:57.000> this

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
correct way mmm that's me more like this

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.140 
correct way mmm that's me more like this
so<00:06:58.770> you've<00:06:58.889> got<00:06:59.009> your<00:06:59.159> balance<00:06:59.310> right<00:06:59.580> and<00:06:59.759> try

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
so you've got your balance right and try

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.339 
so you've got your balance right and try
and<00:07:00.300> fly<00:07:00.479> it<00:07:00.539> that<00:07:00.779> way<00:07:00.960> and<00:07:01.110> you<00:07:01.199> will

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:01.349 
and fly it that way and you will

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:06.649 
and fly it that way and you will
definitely<00:07:01.590> see<00:07:01.979> the<00:07:02.250> difference<00:07:05.659> anyway

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:06.659 
definitely see the difference anyway

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.420 
definitely see the difference anyway
that's<00:07:06.840> pretty<00:07:06.900> much<00:07:07.199> it<00:07:07.500> I<00:07:07.740> just<00:07:08.069> wanted<00:07:08.279> to

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.000 
good balance and you'll have a lot
better<00:07:50.340> flying<00:07:50.640> experience<00:07:51.680> so<00:07:52.680> once<00:07:52.890> again

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.010 
better flying experience so once again
