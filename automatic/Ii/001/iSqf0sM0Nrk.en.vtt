 if I have stable or good 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.710
 because the compass is already popular 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.140
 says in the little person in that direction 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.670
 what are we going to go 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.750
 stealthily there you see the name 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.750
 what are we going to go 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.560
 every Christian there are two friends 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.069
 I hope they are not a team they do not know that 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.930

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.040

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.870
 fucking mother 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.170
 it's a team of three they're going to do to me 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.170
 shit 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.420
 why 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.030
 because life is so cruel to the pony 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.200
 because let's see let's try to kill 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.990
 one 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.850
 one that moves away 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.340
 a person who is further away than 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.620
 well the answer is in that type no 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.840
 it's just going I have to wait for it 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.240
 one gets away then there he killed him 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.190
 then I 'm going to fuck 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.990
 framing them this way little by little already 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.420
 unchecked what I'm thinking but I 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.240
 like the idea and it would be very epic for 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.630
 the video 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:13.260
 or I feel like this inscribes ideal is a 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.940
 zombie shit I said to get off 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.570

 also inside this little house 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.970

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.200
 a lot of attention and they will come for me 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.090
