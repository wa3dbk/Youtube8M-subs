 installation low amplifiers what 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.910
 be what you have to do as I have 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.530
 said many times it is very difficult 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.970
 keep a conversation on facebook or 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:22.220
 on twitter on facebook because if I leave a 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.999
 comment or whatever or I put a photo 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.730
 whatever is 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:27.739
 a question is born there then that little by little 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.419
 when to be but then if someone 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.649
 more convenient all that is very difficult 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.870
 find the conversation in which 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.090

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.360
 I put a week ago I have to turn 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.310
 to answer that photo it is very difficult in 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.500
 youtube post I do not know how many days are already

 among all the comments are there 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.960
 answer you very it is very difficult to maintain 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.970
 a conversation on facebook or in 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.190
 youtube for that and maybe I do not answer 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.410

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.990
 answer me to someone else because to a 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.409
 video cases where some people 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.490
 get in here and then leaving comment and 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.340
