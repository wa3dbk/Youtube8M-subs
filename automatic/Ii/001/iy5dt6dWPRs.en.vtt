and<00:00:04.850> our<00:00:05.850> key<00:00:06.330> is<00:00:06.450> just<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.720> keep<00:00:06.870> getting

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
and our key is just to keep getting

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.570 
and our key is just to keep getting
better<00:00:07.290> constantly<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.010> every<00:00:08.220> way<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.400> we

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
better constantly in every way that we

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.020 
better constantly in every way that we
can<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:10.070> we've<00:00:11.070> made<00:00:11.219> strides<00:00:11.490> over<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.849> last

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
can and we've made strides over the last

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.220 
can and we've made strides over the last
couple<00:00:12.240> weeks<00:00:12.540> but<00:00:12.719> more<00:00:12.900> important<00:00:13.170> than

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
couple weeks but more important than

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.390 
couple weeks but more important than
that<00:00:13.380> it's<00:00:13.530> very<00:00:13.559> important<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.040> make<00:00:14.160> strides

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
that it's very important to make strides

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.620 
that it's very important to make strides
from<00:00:14.639> game<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.059> game<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:17.060> we<00:00:18.060> close<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.449> game

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
from game to game and we close the game

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.050 
from game to game and we close the game
well<00:00:19.100> obviously<00:00:20.100> they<00:00:20.490> made<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> comeback

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
well obviously they made a comeback

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.759 
well obviously they made a comeback
there<00:00:21.270> at<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> very<00:00:21.689> end<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.410> were<00:00:22.529> able

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
there at the very end but we were able

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.890 
there at the very end but we were able
to<00:00:22.800> still<00:00:23.130> withstand<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.689> think<00:00:24.750> one

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
to still withstand that and I think one

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.269 
to still withstand that and I think one
of<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.050> keys<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> game<00:00:25.650> was<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.949> started

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
of the keys to the game was it started

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.400 
of the keys to the game was it started
out<00:00:26.400> twenty<00:00:26.730> four<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.970> four<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.449> believe<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
out twenty four to four I believe in the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.009 
out twenty four to four I believe in the
first<00:00:28.590> half<00:00:28.890> our<00:00:29.490> second<00:00:29.880> half<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.840> think

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
first half our second half and I think

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.569 
first half our second half and I think
we<00:00:31.080> closed<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.560> twenty<00:00:31.830> five<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.130> ten<00:00:32.340> run

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
we closed with a twenty five to ten run

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.680 
we closed with a twenty five to ten run
which<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:32.880> really<00:00:33.090> important<00:00:33.480> that's<00:00:33.600> a

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
which was really important that's a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.330 
which was really important that's a
great<00:00:33.870> sign<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.230> maturity<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.770> us<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.070> could<00:00:35.219> be

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
great sign of maturity for us I could be

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.540 
great sign of maturity for us I could be
a<00:00:35.370> little<00:00:35.579> off<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> numbers<00:00:36.320> but<00:00:37.550> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
a little off on the numbers but you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.810 
a little off on the numbers but you
can't<00:00:38.790> guard<00:00:39.149> them<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:39.719> way<00:00:40.399> they<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> lot

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
encouraging and again the key is that

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179 
encouraging and again the key is that
you<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.510> keep<00:01:12.689> improving<00:01:13.260> with<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
we've had it takes a while for that

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.850 
we've had it takes a while for that
maturity<00:01:18.210> process<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.960> really<00:01:19.110> kick<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.590> where

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
maturity process to really kick in where

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.200 
maturity process to really kick in where
especially<00:01:20.369> when<00:01:20.640> they're<00:01:20.759> away<00:01:20.880> from<00:01:20.909> your

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
especially when they're away from your

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.359 
especially when they're away from your
bench<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.590> usually<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
bench it's it's it's usually not the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.609 
bench it's it's it's usually not the
offensive<00:01:23.939> end<00:01:24.060> where<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.290> trouble

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
offensive end where you have trouble

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.200 
offensive end where you have trouble
closing<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> defensive<00:01:26.700> end<00:01:26.850> where

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
closing it it's the defensive end where

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.550 
closing it it's the defensive end where
they<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.630> where<00:01:27.840> they<00:01:27.960> where<00:01:28.259> they<00:01:28.350> can't

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
they have to where they where they can't

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.649 
they have to where they where they can't
rely<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:28.890> their<00:01:29.880> teammates<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
rely on their teammates that are on the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.270 
rely on their teammates that are on the
bench<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.020> your<00:01:31.140> coaches<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:32.040> have<00:01:32.189> to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
bench of your coaches and they have to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.420 
bench of your coaches and they have to
really<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.790> rely<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.119> each<00:01:33.360> other<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.430> and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
really just rely on each other and and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.520 
really just rely on each other and and
that<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.329> huge<00:01:36.600> huge<00:01:36.930> thing<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.439> know

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that that's a huge huge thing you know

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.749 
that that's a huge huge thing you know
whether<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.829> home<00:01:37.950> or<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.220> road<00:01:38.430> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
whether it's home or on the road and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.399 
whether it's home or on the road and
that's<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.180> sign<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.570> growth<00:01:39.780> when<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.259> do

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that's a sign of growth when you can do

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.560 
that's a sign of growth when you can do
that<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.640> thought<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.970> did<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> thought<00:01:42.450> we

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that and I thought we did I thought we

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.330 
that and I thought we did I thought we
switch<00:01:42.780> defense<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.350> pretty<00:01:43.560> effectively<00:01:43.979> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
switch defense is pretty effectively and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.609 
switch defense is pretty effectively and
I<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.020> communicate<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
I do do that you have to communicate and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.859 
I do do that you have to communicate and

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
shots is going to be right maybe it's

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.900 
shots is going to be right maybe it's
not<00:04:52.410> number<00:04:52.650> one<00:04:52.830> okay<00:04:53.250> taking<00:04:53.670> care<00:04:53.790> of<00:04:53.820> the

it's<00:04:56.460> going<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.670> be<00:04:56.820> up<00:04:56.970> there<00:04:57.180> but<00:04:57.570> I<00:04:57.600> think

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
it's going to be up there but I think

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.600 
it's going to be up there but I think

through<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.340> post<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.940> at<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.360> same<00:05:12.540> time

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
through the post and at the same time

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.150 
through the post and at the same time
you've<00:05:12.870> got<00:05:13.020> to<00:05:13.050> still<00:05:13.350> be<00:05:13.470> able<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:13.740> do<00:05:13.950> that<00:05:14.130> I

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
you've got to still be able to do that I

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.830 
you've got to still be able to do that I
think<00:05:14.490> when<00:05:14.670> you<00:05:14.760> have<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:15.180> lot<00:05:15.420> of<00:05:15.450> different

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
think when you have a lot of different

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.720 
think when you have a lot of different
guys<00:05:15.990> that<00:05:16.260> can<00:05:16.410> make<00:05:16.440> plays<00:05:16.740> it<00:05:17.190> becomes<00:05:17.580> a

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
guys that can make plays it becomes a

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.230 
guys that can make plays it becomes a
situation<00:05:17.970> of<00:05:19.550> taking<00:05:20.550> what<00:05:20.670> the<00:05:20.760> defense<00:05:20.790> has

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
situation of taking what the defense has

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.400 
situation of taking what the defense has
given<00:05:21.390> you<00:05:21.660> so<00:05:22.430> I<00:05:24.170> thought<00:05:25.170> with<00:05:25.380> the

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
given you so I thought with the

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.530 
given you so I thought with the
exception<00:05:25.860> of<00:05:25.920> a<00:05:26.010> couple<00:05:26.040> shots<00:05:26.550> we<00:05:27.510> took

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
exception of a couple shots we took

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.180 
exception of a couple shots we took
really<00:05:27.870> good<00:05:27.990> threes<00:05:28.440> they<00:05:28.680> just<00:05:28.860> didn't<00:05:29.070> go

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
really good threes they just didn't go

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.100 
really good threes they just didn't go
at<00:05:29.370> times<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:30.000> I'm<00:05:30.510> sure<00:05:30.540> I'll<00:05:30.780> be<00:05:30.840> able<00:05:31.050> to

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
at times and I'm sure I'll be able to

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.990 
at times and I'm sure I'll be able to
find<00:05:31.350> more<00:05:31.590> things<00:05:32.280> that<00:05:32.790> we<00:05:32.970> can

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
find more things that we can

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.810 
find more things that we can
constructively<00:05:33.720> fix<00:05:34.470> you<00:05:34.980> know<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.280> get

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
constructively fix you know and get

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.910 
constructively fix you know and get
better<00:05:35.940> at<00:05:36.180> before<00:05:36.510> our<00:05:36.600> next<00:05:36.750> one<00:05:36.990> but<00:05:37.800> when

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
better at before our next one but when

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
and he's gonna continue to prove he's

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.120 
and he's gonna continue to prove he's
gonna<00:06:31.570> be<00:06:31.720> driving<00:06:32.080> the<00:06:32.139> ball<00:06:32.290> before<00:06:32.919> long

you'll see him on the perimeter driving
it<00:06:34.750> even<00:06:34.960> more<00:06:35.110> but<00:06:35.380> he's<00:06:35.500> making<00:06:35.680> those

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
it even more but he's making those

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.879 
it even more but he's making those
strides<00:06:36.250> and<00:06:37.020> we<00:06:38.020> need<00:06:38.169> him<00:06:38.290> to<00:06:38.410> continue<00:06:38.680> to

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
strides and we need him to continue to

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.560 
strides and we need him to continue to
get<00:06:39.010> his<00:06:39.130> rebound<00:06:39.490> numbers<00:06:39.850> up<00:06:40.030> and<00:06:40.150> today<00:06:40.389> was

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
get his rebound numbers up and today was

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.530 
get his rebound numbers up and today was
a<00:06:40.600> very<00:06:40.870> good<00:06:41.080> start<00:06:41.940> for<00:06:42.940> that<00:06:43.060> especially

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
a very good start for that especially

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.659 
a very good start for that especially
with<00:06:43.630> what<00:06:43.780> he<00:06:43.870> did<00:06:43.990> in<00:06:44.139> the<00:06:44.230> second<00:06:44.590> half<00:06:44.740> so

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669 
with what he did in the second half so

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:47.370 
with what he did in the second half so
and<00:06:45.940> I<00:06:46.030> thought<00:06:46.210> again<00:06:46.389> Emmett<00:06:46.810> you<00:06:47.110> know<00:06:47.230> did
