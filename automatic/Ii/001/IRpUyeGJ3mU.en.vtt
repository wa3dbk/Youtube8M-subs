00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.930
 in my workshop every day we hear the 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.790
 Same comments from customers ponle 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.040
 of the green that is better mine with the 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.540
 rose did not notice that it overheats if not 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.550
 you have the blue do not fill it 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.619
 we look like a paint store and 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.300
 DIY but we do not talk about 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.939
 engine coolants although not what 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.949
 it seems that there is behind this myth that 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.859
 we must demand a good coolant 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.380
 let's find the answers in the 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.450
 science in the laboratory we have 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.790
 come to the olives factory to know 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.700
 first hand that is a coolant 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.590
 its components and its properties and 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.719
 answer those questions that make us 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.719
 our customers and we have a hard time answering 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.230
 first of all that is the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000
 coolant, look, I'm going to 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.280
 explain making a liter for you 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.990
 of live product so that it does not 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.280
 doubts remain due to its high capacity 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.020
 heat transfer 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.510
 the primary component of the refrigerant 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.280
 is of course the water do not forget that your 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.530
 main function is to decrease the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.900
 temperature of the engine or is 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.570
 Here we are all very well as 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.350
 mixed with the water must be present 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.670
 the ethylene glycol mono and exactly what 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.390
 It is what makes the monkey who all 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.940
 mono ethylene glycol stress as you know 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.740
 the water stays liquid between 0 and 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.509
 100 degrees monkey function 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.440
 Ethylene glycol mixed with water is 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.930
 expand that range 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.860
 That is why manufacturers ask for mixtures 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.010
 fifty% 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.140
 effectively mixed to 50% we lower the 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.510
 Freezing point and fundamental 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.150
 we raise the boiling point by 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.000
 over 145 degrees inside a 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.310
 closed circuit pressure that's all 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.260
 that's how easy it is to mix water and 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.850
 mono ethylene glycol is currently 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.370
 add new organic additives 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.920
 technology and unlimited duration and those 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.560
 additives that make these additives 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.430
 protect against corrosion 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.200
 especially aluminum alloys 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.070
 and magnesium used in manufacturing 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.050
 of cylinder heads radiator pumps that I've 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.510
 opened a few radiators and pumps 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.460
 well corroded I have also seen some 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.700
 piston shirt sewn to shotgun 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.260
 if that is called cavitation and it's 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.150
 due to the inclusion of bubbles 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.910
 generated as a result of the high 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.110
 temperatures pressure vibrations at 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.180
 which the liquid is subjected 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.520
 refrigerant and that we avoid 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.220
 adding defoamers and that handful of 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.470
 sand like whitish that comes out in more 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.330
 of a radiator or a pump those are the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.540
 salts of water mainly calcium 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.760
 chlorine and magnesium 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.129
 in the ipes as a prestigious manufacturer 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.319
 we use demineralized water in very 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.299
 low hardness and anti limestone additives and 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.859
 stabilizers that prevent training 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.530
 of mineral deposits 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.689
 from what I see the coolant is 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.959
 transparent as water if in fact 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:59.060
 so then is the subject of the color that yes 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.069
 the pink the yellow 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.540
 all that is a good myth although 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.220
 some dyes help the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.870
 leak location 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.549
 the manufacturers adopted a code of 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.290
 colors to facilitate the correct 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.750
 choice of refrigerant for each 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.030
 make and model of vehicle in summary 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.799
 that quality is not measured by color 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.209
 Clearly the quality is 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.909
 consequence of the correct formulation 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.129
 of the level of additives the selection of 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.780
 water control in the process 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.120
 production these are the factors that 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.519
 They distinguish our products and this is 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.590
 our guarantee thank you very much for your 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.970
 illustrated information of nothing here 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.080
 we are always at your disposal 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:41.840
 Well, I still keep the green 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.840
 the green olives clear
