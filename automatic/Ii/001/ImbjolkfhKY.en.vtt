00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
it on your Super Nintendo the only

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.290 
it on your Super Nintendo the only
drawback<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.600> is<00:00:36.860> that<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.980> actually<00:00:38.160> has<00:00:39.090> an

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
drawback is is that it actually has an

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.350 
drawback is is that it actually has an
AV<00:00:39.629> out<00:00:39.840> meaning<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.309> doesn't<00:00:41.610> output<00:00:42.000> video

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
AV out meaning it doesn't output video

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.229 
AV out meaning it doesn't output video
or<00:00:42.690> sound<00:00:43.140> through<00:00:44.129> your<00:00:44.250> Super<00:00:44.550> Nintendo<00:00:44.640> so

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
or sound through your Super Nintendo so

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.510 
or sound through your Super Nintendo so
you<00:00:45.329> actually<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.050> hook<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.520> with

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
you actually have to hook it up with

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.860 
you actually have to hook it up with
this<00:00:48.440> three<00:00:49.440> point<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.399> 3.5<00:00:51.120> millimeter

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
this three point then 3.5 millimeter

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.360 
this three point then 3.5 millimeter
cable<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:53.899> stereo<00:00:54.899> AV<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:58.190> something<00:00:59.190> that's

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
cable to stereo AV and something that's

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.689 
cable to stereo AV and something that's
actually<00:00:59.699> pretty<00:00:59.850> cool<00:00:59.969> about<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:01.699> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
actually pretty cool about this is it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.260 
actually pretty cool about this is it
actually<00:01:02.730> has<00:01:04.460> region<00:01:05.460> switches<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.939> there<00:01:06.119> so

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
actually has region switches on there so

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.679 
actually has region switches on there so
you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.510> play<00:01:06.689> Japanese<00:01:07.229> games<00:01:07.619> or<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.689> do

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:55.570 
actually really good compared to some of
the<00:02:46.970> other<00:02:47.150> Sega<00:02:47.989> clones<00:02:48.349> out<00:02:48.560> there<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:54.580> the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
the other Sega clones out there and the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.630 
the other Sega clones out there and the
video<00:02:55.790> is<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.360> little<00:02:56.810> little<00:02:57.769> grainy<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.370> I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
video is a little little grainy and I

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.970 
video is a little little grainy and I
think<00:02:58.970> that's<00:02:59.150> just<00:02:59.390> due<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.569> the<00:02:59.860> quality<00:03:00.860> of

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
think that's just due to the quality of

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.670 
think that's just due to the quality of
the<00:03:01.100> cheap<00:03:01.310> cable<00:03:01.790> used<00:03:02.390> for<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.750> video<00:03:03.019> I'm

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
the cheap cable used for the video I'm

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.880 
the cheap cable used for the video I'm
sure<00:03:03.890> if<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.130> found<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:05.060> stereo<00:03:05.780> AV<00:03:06.730> 2<00:03:08.260> 3.5<00:03:09.260> ml

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
sure if you found a stereo AV 2 3.5 ml

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.449 
sure if you found a stereo AV 2 3.5 ml
of<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.069> millimeter<00:03:11.470> connection<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:13.220> video

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
of a millimeter connection the video

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.050 
of a millimeter connection the video
would<00:03:13.610> come<00:03:13.790> through<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.030> little<00:03:14.180> bit<00:03:14.360> better

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
would come through a little bit better

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.039 
would come through a little bit better
but<00:03:17.060> as<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.330> see<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.630> looks<00:03:17.840> like<00:03:17.930> it's

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
but as you see it looks like it's

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.319 
but as you see it looks like it's
playing<00:03:18.650> at<00:03:18.830> full<00:03:19.010> speed<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:22.370> do<00:03:22.790> believe<00:03:23.209> it's

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
playing at full speed I do believe it's

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.630 
playing at full speed I do believe it's
using<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.660> super<00:03:23.989> Nintendos<00:03:24.410> processor<00:03:25.160> but

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
using the super Nintendos processor but

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.740 
using the super Nintendos processor but
it<00:03:25.730> has<00:03:25.910> its<00:03:26.420> own

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
it has its own

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.590 
it has its own
soundchip<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.710> graphics<00:03:28.190> chip<00:03:28.490> or<00:03:28.790> I'm<00:03:29.450> not

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
soundchip and graphics chip or I'm not

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.250 
soundchip and graphics chip or I'm not
exactly<00:03:29.900> sure<00:03:30.230> how<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.500> works<00:03:30.620> but<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:33.200> works

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
exactly sure how it works but it works

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.530 
exactly sure how it works but it works
pretty<00:03:33.620> well<00:03:33.740> so<00:03:36.970> something<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.240> wanted

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
pretty well so something that I wanted

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.080 
pretty well so something that I wanted
to<00:03:38.600> try<00:03:38.960> out<00:03:39.250> which<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.520> was<00:03:40.730> actually

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
to try out which I was actually

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.910 
to try out which I was actually
surprised<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:41.990> it<00:03:42.440> worked<00:03:43.030> was<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.920> jokingly

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
surprised that it worked was I jokingly

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.350 
surprised that it worked was I jokingly
put<00:03:46.490> on<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:49.040> power<00:03:49.250> base<00:03:49.520> converter<00:03:49.550> I'm<00:03:50.210> like

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
put on the power base converter I'm like

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.870 
put on the power base converter I'm like
haha<00:03:50.810> this<00:03:51.170> isn't<00:03:51.470> gonna<00:03:51.560> work<00:03:51.650> but<00:03:52.220> check

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
this out and it looks very silly but it

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.699 
this out and it looks very silly but it
gets<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.790> job<00:03:59.000> done<00:03:59.060> if<00:03:59.840> you<00:04:00.050> ever<00:04:00.260> wanted<00:04:00.650> to
