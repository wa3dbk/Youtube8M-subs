00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
horsepower according to the game not

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.030 
horsepower according to the game not
sure<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.079> that's<00:00:43.140> accurate<00:00:43.350> or<00:00:43.649> not<00:00:43.680> but

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
sure if that's accurate or not but

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.279 
sure if that's accurate or not but
you're<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.700> what<00:00:44.850> gran<00:00:45.059> turismo<00:00:45.420> go<00:00:45.660> now

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
you're going on what gran turismo go now

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.860 
you're going on what gran turismo go now
as<00:00:46.620> far<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.520> new<00:00:47.670> c7<00:00:47.910> goes<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.539> should<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
as far as the new c7 goes it should be a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.690 
as far as the new c7 goes it should be a
little<00:00:49.110> bit<00:00:49.289> narrower<00:00:49.649> I'm<00:00:50.039> pretty<00:00:50.489> sure<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
little bit narrower I'm pretty sure the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.220 
little bit narrower I'm pretty sure the
designers<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.270> agreed<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> previous

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
designers have agreed that the previous

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.619 
designers have agreed that the previous
Corvettes<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:53.489> been<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> little<00:00:53.820> too<00:00:54.000> wide<00:00:54.329> in

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
Corvettes have been a little too wide in

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.840 
Corvettes have been a little too wide in
the<00:00:54.660> back<00:00:54.899> side<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:56.010> hopefully<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.640> gonna<00:00:56.730> be

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the back side so hopefully it's gonna be

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
the back side so hopefully it's gonna be
a<00:00:56.879> little<00:00:57.030> bit<00:00:57.210> narrower<00:00:57.629> which<00:00:57.870> should<00:00:58.079> make

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
a little bit narrower which should make

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.610 
a little bit narrower which should make
a<00:00:58.260> little<00:00:58.530> more<00:00:58.620> agile<00:00:59.129> uh<00:00:59.840> might<00:01:00.840> feature<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
a little more agile uh might feature a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.350 
a little more agile uh might feature a
split<00:01:02.190> rear<00:01:02.609> window<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.140> old<00:01:04.320> stingrays

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
split rear window like the old stingrays

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.719 
split rear window like the old stingrays
the<00:01:06.360> stingrays<00:01:06.960> could<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> modern<00:01:08.250> remake

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the stingrays could get a modern remake

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.719 
the stingrays could get a modern remake
of<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.270> Stingray<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:10.020> would<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.200> sweet<00:01:10.729> it

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
interior is improve the overall feel of

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.139 
interior is improve the overall feel of
the<00:01:49.259> car<00:01:49.290> when<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.770> get<00:01:49.890> inside<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the car when you get inside is going to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.480 
the car when you get inside is going to
be<00:01:51.270> premium<00:01:51.780> now<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.530> dynamic<00:01:53.009> should<00:01:53.220> stay

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
be premium now that dynamic should stay

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.859 
be premium now that dynamic should stay
pretty<00:01:53.790> much<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.149> same<00:01:54.329> still<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.810> to

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
pretty much the same still going to

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.899 
pretty much the same still going to
drive<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> Corvette<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:56.640> probably

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
drive in a Corvette it's probably

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.730 
drive in a Corvette it's probably
definitely<00:01:57.329> gonna<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.689> improved<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.500> far<00:01:58.530> as

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
definitely gonna be improved as far as

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.560 
definitely gonna be improved as far as
the<00:01:58.860> handling<00:01:59.310> go

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
the handling go

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.450 
the handling go
and<00:01:59.810> all<00:02:00.230> that<00:02:00.440> but<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.710> should<00:02:00.920> still<00:02:00.950> feel

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
and all that but it should still feel

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.800 
and all that but it should still feel
like<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.610> Corvette<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.210> now<00:02:02.360> we're<00:02:02.570> on<00:02:02.690> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
to turn at the same time you definitely

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.360
