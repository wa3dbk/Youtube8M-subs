 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.950
 I wait for everyone because the page 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.640
 web video leimer has finished metal gear 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.920
 solid close in just 10 minutes 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.620
 you have the proof in the source a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.980
 description where they explain how 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:24.090
 to be able to obtain it and in the end then a 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:29.160
 video showing this fails this already 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.320
 it's the last straw you know it's good as 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.140
 they are punctuating metal gear solid with 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.230
 signs in on different web pages by 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.160

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.490
 games bit 55 of 100 I put square 6 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.060
 the gaming vol 7.5 as you can see there 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.570
 so scores of all kinds some what 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.640
 they score badly or all the points well 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.710
 You know that it has been rumored that 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.420
 what games can end between 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.180
 approximately for a normal user 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.750
 of 30 minutes and 2 hours depends on how 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.920
 let's do it and then this is because 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.830
 web page 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.110
 it seems that by removing kinematics 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.670
 and everything has gone to host in just 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.000
 ten minutes has completed a game that 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.960
 It's worth 30 euros because you want it 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.840
 say 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.900
 you have to take it as a prologue as a 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.409
 I do not know if to call it what to call it 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.789
 you know it's a prologue but 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:55.780
 30 euros for this I think it's a 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:59.679
 bit excessive anyway not 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.439
 we know the opinion if you know that this 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.120
 possible for fans of the saga 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.250
 take away that 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.170
 and without flavor so that they go taking the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.560
 Gustillo before the game that 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.400
 it is rumored that it will be extended to 2015 and 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.020
 that is not more and nothing else as always 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.850
 informing you already know like and favorites and 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.180
 see you in the next until the 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.180
 next
