00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.220
 have a look 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.740
 Number combination on yours 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.750
 could give a smartphone and then 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.420
 you can experience the heavenly fall 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.720
 you may already know that from the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.250
 or from the ps3 or xbox 360 version 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.990
 however, this is also possible here 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.990
 do not stop with the key combination 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.590
 but with a specific one 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.689
 Number combination is in the reason too 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.220
 moves in and leaves you then 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.579
 catapulted into the air and then 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.739
 falling down simulates so to speak 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.290

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.219
 Just push it upwards 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.920

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.630
 Now if he steers him down 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.610
 press or drag down then 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.200
 stay in the air a little longer 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.759
 pressed in front then float or 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.170
 crashed down in a dive 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.050
 Of course you can also go to the right and 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.160
 steer left and you can see 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.540
 not that if parachute have but 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.680
 we have a parachute so we 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.640
 then right now of course ex 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.070
 then press the parachute 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.080
 opened and then we sail in all 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.910
 Rest down must be solid ground again 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.080

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.320

 that I also have a parachute 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.769
