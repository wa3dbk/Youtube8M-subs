00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.570 
frequently in conjunction with apple TV
where<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.510> website<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.409> your

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
television so the result is that you go

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.039 
television so the result is that you go
from<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.140> two<00:01:13.200> inch<00:01:14.000> display<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:16.130> iphone<00:01:18.049> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
a 55 inch display on your television so

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.460

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
so much that i do it very very

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.160 
so much that i do it very very
frequently<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.790> bad<00:01:29.970> part<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.840> that

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
frequently the bad part is that that

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.530 
frequently the bad part is that that
makes<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.070> phone<00:01:32.369> heat<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.590> big<00:01:34.590> time

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.560 
makes the phone heat up big time
particularly<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.229> charge<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.009> phone

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
particularly if you charge the phone

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.960 
particularly if you charge the phone
while<00:01:39.570> you're<00:01:39.780> streaming<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.500> video<00:01:40.970> which

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
while you're streaming the video which

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.999 
while you're streaming the video which
you<00:01:42.119> often<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.750> do<00:01:43.020> because<00:01:43.259> streaming

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
you often have to do because streaming

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.899 
you often have to do because streaming
the<00:01:44.130> video<00:01:44.570> drains<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.930> battery<00:01:46.909> it's

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the video drains the battery it's

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.210 
the video drains the battery it's
thundering<00:01:48.360> outside

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
thundering outside

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.970 
thundering outside
perhaps<00:01:51.220> you<00:01:51.400> can<00:01:51.550> hear<00:01:51.760> that

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
was to take the iphone and heat it up

devices and in fact as I just said heat
is<00:03:11.050> what<00:03:11.230> caused<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.800> problem<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.280> begin<00:03:12.370> with

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
is what caused the problem to begin with

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.900 
is what caused the problem to begin with
but<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.200> articles<00:03:14.620> went<00:03:14.830> on<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.100> say<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.370> the

but the articles went on to say that the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.900 
but the articles went on to say that the
heat<00:03:16.239> which<00:03:17.050> had<00:03:17.820> melted<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:19.239> tiny<00:03:19.720> tiny

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
heat which had melted the tiny tiny

and the board that that could be

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.220 
and the board that that could be
reheated<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:30.150> very<00:03:31.150> likely<00:03:31.510> would<00:03:31.989> make

reheated and very likely would make
another<00:03:32.620> connection<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.520> fix<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.510> problem

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
another connection and fix the problem

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.729 
another connection and fix the problem
well<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.180> sounded<00:03:37.570> ridiculous<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:38.380> me<00:03:38.530> but

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
well that sounded ridiculous to me but

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.949 
well that sounded ridiculous to me but
the<00:03:38.860> phone<00:03:39.100> was<00:03:40.739> useless<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:42.130> me<00:03:42.700> without<00:03:43.660> the

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
the phone was useless to me without the

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.440 
the phone was useless to me without the
Wi-Fi<00:03:44.410> pretty<00:03:44.800> much<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.000> thought<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.270> have

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
Wi-Fi pretty much so I thought I have

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.850 
Wi-Fi pretty much so I thought I have
everything<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:46.930> have<00:03:47.050> everything<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.590> gain<00:03:47.620> and

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
everything I have everything to gain and

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.850 
everything I have everything to gain and
nothing<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.400> lose<00:03:49.050> but<00:03:50.050> I<00:03:50.110> didn't<00:03:50.440> have<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.560> hair

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
nothing to lose but I didn't have a hair

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.280 
nothing to lose but I didn't have a hair
dryer<00:03:51.390> well<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.420> wasn't<00:03:52.750> going<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.900> go<00:03:53.020> out<00:03:53.170> and

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
dryer well I wasn't going to go out and

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.310 
dryer well I wasn't going to go out and

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
buy a hair dryer just for that so what I

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.580 
buy a hair dryer just for that so what I
did<00:03:56.470> was<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:58.060> take<00:03:58.270> the<00:03:58.570> iPhone<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.380> iPhone

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
so hot that it had actually melted a

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.070 
so hot that it had actually melted a
tiny<00:04:37.560> part<00:04:38.190> of<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.490> dashboard<00:04:39.180> have<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:39.930> ever

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
tiny part of the dashboard have you ever

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.970 
tiny part of the dashboard have you ever
seen<00:04:40.350> when<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:41.210> plastic<00:04:42.210> gets<00:04:42.990> really<00:04:43.620> hot<00:04:43.800> it

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
seen when a plastic gets really hot it

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.520 
seen when a plastic gets really hot it
kind<00:04:44.190> of<00:04:44.280> strings<00:04:44.730> out<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.930> looks<00:04:46.110> almost<00:04:46.290> like

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
kind of strings out it looks almost like

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.160 
kind of strings out it looks almost like
a<00:04:46.650> hair<00:04:47.040> fiber<00:04:48.140> so<00:04:49.140> it<00:04:49.970> practically<00:04:51.050> well<00:04:52.050> it

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
a hair fiber so it practically well it

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.670 
a hair fiber so it practically well it
did<00:04:52.550> slightly<00:04:53.550> melt<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.270> dashboard<00:04:54.930> so<00:04:55.650> I

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
did slightly melt the dashboard so I

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.410 
did slightly melt the dashboard so I

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
to come on due to the heat so I thought

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.740 
to come on due to the heat so I thought
oh<00:05:45.180> my<00:05:45.450> god<00:05:45.780> I'm<00:05:46.050> really<00:05:46.500> screwed<00:05:47.280> up<00:05:47.460> now<00:05:47.760> but

as I said I had everything to gain to
nothing<00:05:50.430> to<00:05:50.520> lose<00:05:50.730> so<00:05:50.760> I<00:05:50.970> wasn't<00:05:51.360> particularly

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
nothing to lose so I wasn't particularly

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.220 
nothing to lose so I wasn't particularly
upset<00:05:52.860> about<00:05:52.980> it<00:05:53.280> so<00:05:53.820> I<00:05:53.880> left<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.150> phone<00:05:54.360> there

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230

is the surprising part of the story it

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.820 
is the surprising part of the story it

that's<00:06:34.150> my<00:06:34.360> theory<00:06:34.810> that<00:06:35.139> might<00:06:35.979> have<00:06:36.190> nothing

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
that's my theory that might have nothing

that's my theory that might have nothing
to<00:06:36.550> do<00:06:36.759> with<00:06:36.789> why<00:06:37.629> it<00:06:37.690> fixed<00:06:38.319> it<00:06:38.409> but<00:06:38.860> it<00:06:39.009> did

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
to do with why it fixed it but it did

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.689 
to do with why it fixed it but it did
fix<00:06:39.580> it<00:06:39.789> so<00:06:40.659> if<00:06:40.810> any<00:06:40.990> of<00:06:41.050> you<00:06:41.139> guys<00:06:42.099> out<00:06:42.400> there
