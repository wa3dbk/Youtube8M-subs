we're<00:00:08.340> basically<00:00:08.700> at<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.150> point<00:00:09.360> now<00:00:09.420> where

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
we're basically at the point now where

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.150 
we're basically at the point now where
we<00:00:09.719> need<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.080> implement<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.530> village<00:00:10.800> system

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
it's going to be fairly straightforward

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.379 
it's going to be fairly straightforward
but<00:00:13.580> what<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.730> have<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.179> create

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
but what you have is you create

basically a village Idol and from that
you<00:00:18.930> can<00:00:19.140> which<00:00:19.710> creates<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.490> little<00:00:21.000> claim

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
you can which creates a little claim

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
criminal what you do is you have a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.860 
criminal what you do is you have a
subset<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.730> skills<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.480> need<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.719> learn

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
subset of skills that you need to learn

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.920 
subset of skills that you need to learn
that<00:01:01.219> are<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.520> ranging<00:01:03.030> or<00:01:03.180> tracking<00:01:03.660> skills

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that are like ranging or tracking skills

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.370 
that are like ranging or tracking skills
that<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.530> use<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.189> find<00:01:06.049> criminal<00:01:07.049> clues

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that you can use to find criminal clues

that you can use to find criminal clues
that<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.710> been<00:01:07.830> left<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.220> map<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.850> use

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that have been left on the map and use

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.679 
that have been left on the map and use
them<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.110> track<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.770> player<00:01:10.979> who<00:01:11.159> left<00:01:11.400> them

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
them to track the player who left them

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.289 
them to track the player who left them
so<00:01:13.130> basically<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.030> find

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
so basically what you do when you find

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.940 
so basically what you do when you find
that<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.630> crime<00:01:15.930> has<00:01:16.110> been<00:01:16.140> committed<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.770> that

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that a crime has been committed is that

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.609 
that a crime has been committed is that
you<00:01:17.070> call<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.490> your<00:01:17.670> town<00:01:17.880> ranger<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.659> he<00:01:19.170> goes

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you call in your town ranger and he goes

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.740 
you call in your town ranger and he goes
and<00:01:19.860> has<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> look<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.670> sense<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.540> I've

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and has a look at the sense that I've

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.109 
and has a look at the sense that I've
been<00:01:21.869> left<00:01:22.140> picks<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.100> couple<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.460> them<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
been left picks a couple of them up and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.420 
been left picks a couple of them up and
then<00:01:24.270> uses<00:01:24.810> those<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> track<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.890> perpetrator

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
then uses those to track the perpetrator

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.819 
then uses those to track the perpetrator
and<00:01:26.780> then<00:01:27.780> once<00:01:28.080> you've<00:01:28.259> located<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
and then once you've located the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.890 
and then once you've located the
perpetrator<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> game<00:01:29.880> world<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.299> find<00:01:30.720> out

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
perpetrator in the game world I find out

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.170 
perpetrator in the game world I find out
where<00:01:31.079> he<00:01:31.229> lives<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:32.189> rest<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.060> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
where he lives the rest is really up to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.840 
where he lives the rest is really up to
you<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.869> normal<00:01:34.380> way<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.950> enforcing<00:01:35.490> crime

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
you the normal way of enforcing crime

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.550 
you the normal way of enforcing crime
and<00:01:36.060> obviously<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.630> built<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.229> game<00:01:37.409> before

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and obviously we built a game before

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.140 
and obviously we built a game before
with<00:01:37.860> similar<00:01:38.159> mechanics<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.790> Haven<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
with similar mechanics like Haven and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.300 
with similar mechanics like Haven and
hearth<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.409> way<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.710> players<00:01:40.979> usually

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
hearth and the way that players usually

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.219 
hearth and the way that players usually
enforce<00:01:41.820> justice<00:01:41.880> there's<00:01:42.479> by<00:01:42.750> killing<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
enforce justice there's by killing the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.649 
enforce justice there's by killing the
player<00:01:43.439> committed<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> crime<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> that's

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
player committed the crime and that's

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.999 
player committed the crime and that's
really<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> only<00:01:46.680> thing<00:01:46.829> that

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
really like that's the only thing that

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.950 
really like that's the only thing that
kind<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.369> settles<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.030> finality<00:01:48.479> because

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
kind of settles it with finality because

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.690 
kind of settles it with finality because
like<00:01:49.110> death<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.500> extremely<00:01:49.979> harsh<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.520> when

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
like death is extremely harsh like when

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.980
