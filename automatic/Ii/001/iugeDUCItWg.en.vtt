when<00:00:08.360> it<00:00:08.450> comes<00:00:08.600> to<00:00:08.720> basement<00:00:09.019> renovations

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
when it comes to basement renovations

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.470 
when it comes to basement renovations
and<00:00:10.809> method<00:00:11.809> of<00:00:11.930> framing<00:00:12.320> that<00:00:12.500> I<00:00:12.530> like<00:00:12.799> to<00:00:12.980> use

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
and method of framing that I like to use

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.840 
and method of framing that I like to use
is<00:00:14.480> starting<00:00:14.990> from<00:00:15.139> the<00:00:15.260> bottom<00:00:15.590> up<00:00:15.830> and<00:00:16.100> so

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
is starting from the bottom up and so

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.930 
is starting from the bottom up and so
what<00:00:17.000> we're<00:00:17.119> going<00:00:17.210> to<00:00:17.270> do<00:00:17.480> is<00:00:17.869> install<00:00:18.380> the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
what we're going to do is install the

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.460 
what we're going to do is install the
bottom<00:00:19.940> track<00:00:20.350> which<00:00:21.350> essentially<00:00:21.770> is<00:00:21.949> the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
bottom track which essentially is the

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.770 
bottom track which essentially is the
10-foot<00:00:24.470> length<00:00:24.800> of<00:00:25.300> steel<00:00:26.300> that<00:00:26.510> we'll<00:00:26.690> be

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:26.780 
10-foot length of steel that we'll be

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.080 
10-foot length of steel that we'll be
cutting<00:00:26.990> down<00:00:27.080> to<00:00:27.410> size<00:00:27.620> for<00:00:28.520> the<00:00:28.670> length<00:00:28.880> of

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
cutting down to size for the length of

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.409 
cutting down to size for the length of
the<00:00:29.150> bottom<00:00:29.300> of<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.539> wall<00:00:29.810> if<00:00:30.560> it's<00:00:31.430> less<00:00:32.390> than

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
the bottom of the wall if it's less than

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.119 
the bottom of the wall if it's less than
10<00:00:32.750> feet<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.340> that<00:00:34.340> is<00:00:34.840> where<00:00:35.840> our<00:00:36.440> stud<00:00:36.860> wall

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
10 feet and that is where our stud wall

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.459 
10 feet and that is where our stud wall
or<00:00:37.430> our<00:00:37.969> wall<00:00:38.329> studs<00:00:38.800> will<00:00:39.800> snap<00:00:40.159> into<00:00:40.370> place

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
or our wall studs will snap into place

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.770 
or our wall studs will snap into place
it's<00:00:42.469> essentially<00:00:42.829> a<00:00:43.339> building<00:00:44.239> system<00:00:44.629> that

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
it's essentially a building system that

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.630 
it's essentially a building system that
is<00:00:44.899> almost<00:00:45.050> similar<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.589> Lego<00:00:45.920> things<00:00:46.370> just

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
is almost similar to Lego things just

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.889 
is almost similar to Lego things just
work<00:00:46.819> together<00:00:47.030> really<00:00:47.449> well

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
work together really well

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.469 
work together really well
and<00:00:48.550> so<00:00:49.550> that<00:00:49.850> that's<00:00:49.999> one<00:00:50.210> of<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.359> benefits

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
and so that that's one of the benefits

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.509 
and so that that's one of the benefits
of<00:00:50.780> using<00:00:50.929> steel<00:00:51.350> it's<00:00:52.069> what<00:00:52.219> we're<00:00:52.370> going<00:00:52.489> to

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
of using steel it's what we're going to

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.459 
of using steel it's what we're going to
do<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:53.269> we've<00:00:53.449> got<00:00:53.479> a<00:00:53.569> handy<00:00:53.929> little<00:00:54.079> helper

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
do is we've got a handy little helper

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.559 
do is we've got a handy little helper
there<00:00:54.649> that<00:00:55.460> I'm<00:00:55.579> going<00:00:55.729> to<00:00:55.789> put<00:00:55.940> my<00:00:56.149> tape

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:56.569 
there that I'm going to put my tape

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:59.379 
there that I'm going to put my tape
measure<00:00:56.899> up<00:00:57.699> and<00:00:58.699> we're<00:00:59.059> going<00:00:59.179> to<00:00:59.210> measure

00:00:59.379 --> 00:00:59.389 
measure up and we're going to measure

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.989 
measure up and we're going to measure
work<00:00:59.870> or<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.710> length<00:01:00.889> of<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.429> first<00:01:01.579> piece<00:01:01.729> of

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
work or the length of the first piece of

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.780 
work or the length of the first piece of
we're<00:01:02.089> going<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.269> install<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.070> we're<00:01:04.070> 85

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
we're going to install and we're 85

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.310 
we're going to install and we're 85
acres<00:01:05.690> and<00:01:06.290> 1/8<00:01:07.420> so<00:01:08.420> now<00:01:08.540> we<00:01:08.600> need<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.930> cut<00:01:09.140> our

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
acres and 1/8 so now we need to cut our

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.029 
acres and 1/8 so now we need to cut our
track<00:01:09.620> 85<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:10.760> 1/8<00:01:11.229> okay<00:01:12.229> we're<00:01:12.649> going<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:12.799> cut

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
track 85 and 1/8 okay we're going to cut

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.940 
track 85 and 1/8 okay we're going to cut
our<00:01:13.130> first<00:01:13.310> piece<00:01:13.549> of<00:01:13.729> track<00:01:13.969> and<00:01:14.740> like<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.860> had

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
our first piece of track and like I had

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.880 
our first piece of track and like I had
mentioned<00:01:16.070> before<00:01:16.579> your<00:01:17.450> track<00:01:17.810> they<00:01:18.560> come<00:01:18.770> in

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
mentioned before your track they come in

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.080 
mentioned before your track they come in
10-foot<00:01:19.280> lengths<00:01:19.670> which<00:01:20.329> is<00:01:20.479> 120<00:01:21.289> inches<00:01:22.090> so

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
10-foot lengths which is 120 inches so

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.029 
10-foot lengths which is 120 inches so
what<00:01:23.180> we're<00:01:23.299> going<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.450> do<00:01:23.659> here<00:01:23.930> is<00:01:24.619> I<00:01:24.829> like<00:01:25.009> to

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
what we're going to do here is I like to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.349 
what we're going to do here is I like to
measure<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.579> full<00:01:25.909> length<00:01:26.240> of<00:01:26.649> whatever

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
measure the full length of whatever

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.840 
measure the full length of whatever
track<00:01:29.359> or<00:01:29.780> stud<00:01:30.409> or<00:01:30.710> piece<00:01:31.340> of<00:01:31.369> wood<00:01:31.700> or

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
track or stud or piece of wood or

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.520 
track or stud or piece of wood or
whatever<00:01:32.060> we're<00:01:32.359> going<00:01:32.509> to<00:01:32.570> measure<00:01:32.689> rather

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
whatever we're going to measure rather

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.679 
whatever we're going to measure rather
than<00:01:33.740> backtracking<00:01:34.280> measurements<00:01:34.880> for

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
than backtracking measurements for

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.529 
than backtracking measurements for
example<00:01:35.719> we<00:01:36.259> are<00:01:36.289> 85<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.219> 1/8<00:01:37.520> inch<00:01:37.789> we<00:01:38.390> could

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
example we are 85 and 1/8 inch we could

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.130 
example we are 85 and 1/8 inch we could
backtrack<00:01:38.750> off<00:01:39.259> of<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.250> 120<00:01:40.880> which<00:01:41.630> gives<00:01:41.990> us

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
backtrack off of the 120 which gives us

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.179 
backtrack off of the 120 which gives us
approximately<00:01:43.509> just<00:01:44.509> under<00:01:44.659> 35<00:01:45.140> inches<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.159> we

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
approximately just under 35 inches so we

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.880 
approximately just under 35 inches so we
could<00:01:46.460> either<00:01:46.850> measure<00:01:47.210> back<00:01:47.509> that<00:01:48.289> amount<00:01:48.710> or

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
could either measure back that amount or

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.090 
could either measure back that amount or
the<00:01:49.880> measurable<00:01:50.479> amount<00:01:50.749> which<00:01:51.469> I<00:01:51.649> like<00:01:51.859> to<00:01:51.979> do

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
the measurable amount which I like to do

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.709 
the measurable amount which I like to do
that<00:01:52.729> just<00:01:53.060> increases<00:01:53.359> accuracy<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:56.119> click

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
that just increases accuracy so I click

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.739 
that just increases accuracy so I click
my<00:01:57.020> tape<00:01:57.890> on<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.850> edge<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:01.640> part<00:02:02.210> of<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.450> stud

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749 
my tape on the edge and part of the stud

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:07.090 
my tape on the edge and part of the stud
or<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.799> track<00:02:04.039> and<00:02:04.429> I<00:02:05.359> pull<00:02:05.859> my<00:02:06.859> tape<00:02:07.069> measure

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
or the track and I pull my tape measure

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.180 
or the track and I pull my tape measure
along<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:10.759> now<00:02:10.910> then<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.180> find<00:02:11.590> with<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.710> 85<00:02:13.130> and

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
along so now then I find with the 85 and

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:24.260 
along so now then I find with the 85 and
1/8<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:17.120> mark<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.800> with<00:02:18.800> my<00:02:18.950> thumb

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.660 

keep<00:02:25.270> your<00:02:25.420> thumb<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.990> place<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:27.130> what<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:27.880> do

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
keep your thumb in place and what I do

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.810 
keep your thumb in place and what I do
is<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.790> but<00:02:32.730> my<00:02:33.730> snips<00:02:34.120> up<00:02:34.330> against<00:02:34.630> my<00:02:34.810> thumb

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
is I but my snips up against my thumb

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.440 
is I but my snips up against my thumb

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
measurement hook it on the edge at the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.720 
measurement hook it on the edge at the
end<00:03:25.330> of<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.630> track<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.140> say<00:03:27.130> let's<00:03:27.340> cut<00:03:27.550> off

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
three inches so I'm marking with my

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.590 
three inches so I'm marking with my
thumb<00:03:33.310> we're<00:03:33.760> three<00:03:34.030> inches<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:36.600> then

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
thumb we're three inches and then

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.800 
thumb we're three inches and then
rotating<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:38.740> that<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.010> can<00:03:39.190> see<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.550> I<00:03:42.810> put

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
rotating it so that I can see it I put

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.620 
rotating it so that I can see it I put
my<00:03:43.960> snips<00:03:44.650> up<00:03:44.920> against<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:46.740> cut<00:03:47.740> and<00:03:48.630> then

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
my snips up against it and cut and then

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.410 
my snips up against it and cut and then
cut<00:03:49.900> through<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.740> other<00:03:50.890> side<00:03:52.860> bend<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:54.070> back

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
cut through the other side bend it back

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.480 
cut through the other side bend it back
now<00:03:55.420> remember<00:03:55.840> everything<00:03:56.770> is<00:03:56.890> sharp<00:03:57.220> when

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
now remember everything is sharp when

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.280 
now remember everything is sharp when
you're<00:03:57.640> cutting<00:03:58.030> metal<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.870> have<00:03:59.080> sharp

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
you're cutting metal you have sharp

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.720 
you're cutting metal you have sharp
edges<00:03:59.440> so<00:03:59.680> just<00:04:00.130> work<00:04:00.490> carefully<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:03.370> you<00:04:03.550> cut

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
edges so just work carefully and you cut

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.030 
edges so just work carefully and you cut
through<00:04:05.700> just<00:04:06.700> like<00:04:06.760> that
