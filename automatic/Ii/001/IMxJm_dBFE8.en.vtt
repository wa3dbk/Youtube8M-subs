00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.609
 Since the 1960s they have been using a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.130
 close to ibirapuera in the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.370
 South zone of SÃ£o Paulo have already been 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.490
 more than 200 but today it is few 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.590
 the practitioners of ferromodelismo the hobby 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.930
 appreciated all over the world 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.539
 ah but the passion for miniature trains 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.539
 is responsible for keeping the tradition alive 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.090
 For half a century, they have been in love with 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.730
 three fans of miniatures and iron 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.250
 modernism are in this space 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.309
 for many years the makeshift site and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.489
 almost had to leave it today 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.649
 with a little more than 60 members the group 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.020
 with the support of the city 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.629
 keep alive the tradition that has everything 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.430
 I want you to build the guy who collects 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.430
 of the guy who runs the guy who likes 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.660
 diorama only has one is quite free that the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.329
 people that come here just to see you 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.550
 He's a partner who comes here just to talk alone. 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.559
 Speaking of which of three my great 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.910
 tanning and miniature even then 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.270
 contrary to some partners who enjoy the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.159
 same train so I understand - train of 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.130
 more truth of the model 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.619
 and it is exactly this passion that generations 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.439
 to come here 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.460
 still a teenager in the 70's and is the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.229
 active senior partner discover 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 we do rail research on the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.610
 history of the railroad 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.090
 paulo collapsed in the region already the golden 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.810
 Worked on the railway there, that's it. 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.729
 blood 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.759
 It seems like a kid's play but for 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.829
 they this is taken seriously they are 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.520
 locomotives landscapes wagons all in one 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:46.350
 very small scale 87 times smaller than 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.380
 than normal size and is not anything cheap 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.869
 the prices are of big people with pieces 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.030
 domestic and imported structures 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.009
 models and thumbnails may 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.719
 the 20 thousand reais 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.119
 but some people prefer to build their 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.030
 itself as this replica of the defunct 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.130
 sorocabana railway line paulista o 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.950
 work goes beyond assembling the idea 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.200
 is to build scenarios and environments and 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:18.130
 historical periods with locomotives 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.230
 wagons and the famous peculiar noises 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.019
 of trains 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.090
 Do you have this part of the decoration you 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.640
 have the structural part of the model you 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.959
 has the electronics part that has the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.330
 part of joinery 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.390
 so the hobby that spans many 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.580
 This is what I think is cool in the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.250
 ferromodelismo is you transform life 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.489
 real world a micro world actually 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.489
 movement
