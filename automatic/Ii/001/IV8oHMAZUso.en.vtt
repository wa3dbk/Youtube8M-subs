00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
jazz ride pattern on the ride cymbal

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
jazz ride pattern on the ride cymbal
high<00:00:46.410> hats<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.770> -<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:48.210> just

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
high hats on - and for that that just

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.729 
high hats on - and for that that just
these<00:00:48.629> two<00:00:48.870> instruments<00:00:49.289> now<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
these two instruments now going to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.770 
these two instruments now going to
become<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.129> core<00:00:50.370> unit<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.600> bass

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
become the core unit because the bass

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.729 
become the core unit because the bass
and<00:00:51.960> snare<00:00:52.079> obviously<00:00:52.559> playing

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and snare obviously playing

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.010 
and snare obviously playing
independently<00:00:53.430> together<00:00:53.789> now<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.780> now<00:00:54.960> that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
independently together now so now that

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.510 
independently together now so now that
we're<00:00:55.260> playing<00:00:55.440> independence<00:00:56.100> patterns<00:00:56.399> with

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
we're playing independence patterns with

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.459 
we're playing independence patterns with
both<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.850> snare<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> bass<00:00:57.510> drum<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.020> core

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
both a snare and the bass drum the core

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.689 
both a snare and the bass drum the core
unit<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:58.980> we're<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> play<00:00:59.489> those

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
unit that we're going to play those

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.729 
unit that we're going to play those
figures<00:01:00.059> underneath<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.899> only<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.620> be

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
figures underneath is only going to be

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.070 
figures underneath is only going to be
the<00:01:01.890> ride<00:01:02.100> cymbal<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.910> hi-hat<00:01:03.090> now<00:01:03.420> okay

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the ride cymbal and the hi-hat now okay

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.179 
the ride cymbal and the hi-hat now okay
so<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> bass<00:01:04.470> drum<00:01:04.650> obviously<00:01:05.010> you're<00:01:05.129> not

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so the bass drum obviously you're not

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.730 
so the bass drum obviously you're not
going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.519> feathering<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.090> all<00:01:06.299> four<00:01:06.630> beats

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
going to be feathering on all four beats

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.980 
going to be feathering on all four beats
so<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> first<00:01:08.070> pattern<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.490> learn<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.939> just

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
so the first pattern to learn is just

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:23.450 
so the first pattern to learn is just
one<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.380> two<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.189> three<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:22.350> three<00:01:22.890> swung

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
one and two and three so three swung

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.340 
one and two and three so three swung
eighth<00:01:23.670> notes<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:24.060> snare<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:24.810> once<00:01:25.080> one

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
eighth notes on snare and then once one

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.140 
eighth notes on snare and then once one
eighth<00:01:25.500> note<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> bass<00:01:26.070> drum<00:01:26.100> nice<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
eighth note on the bass drum nice and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.560

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
slow

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.539 
slow
under<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> ride<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.350> hi-hat<00:01:28.920> pattern<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.400> get

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
under the ride and hi-hat pattern we get

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
of snare notes in a row we get one and

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:23.270 
of snare notes in a row we get one and
two<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.430> three<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:22.500> one<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.830> can<00:03:22.980> go<00:03:23.130> all

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
two and three that one you can go all

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.680 
two and three that one you can go all
day<00:03:23.310> long<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.790> can<00:03:23.910> just<00:03:24.030> repeat<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.390> over

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
day long you can just repeat that over
