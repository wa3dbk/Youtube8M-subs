all<00:00:02.490> right<00:00:02.700> in<00:00:02.939> this<00:00:03.240> one<00:00:03.419> video<00:00:03.840> we're<00:00:04.230> going

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
all right in this one video we're going

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.829 
all right in this one video we're going
to<00:00:04.410> talk<00:00:04.620> about<00:00:04.700> another<00:00:05.700> type<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.000> improper

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
to talk about another type of improper

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.040 
to talk about another type of improper
integral<00:00:07.790> and<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:08.970> one<00:00:09.150> these<00:00:09.540> can<00:00:09.870> be<00:00:10.019> a

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
integral and this one these can be a

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.259 
integral and this one these can be a
little<00:00:10.349> deceiving<00:00:10.800> because<00:00:11.490> there's<00:00:12.120> no

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
little deceiving because there's no

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.240 
little deceiving because there's no
bells<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.870> whistles<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.500> don't<00:00:13.679> see<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
bells and whistles you don't see the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.890 
bells and whistles you don't see the
negative<00:00:14.730> infinity<00:00:15.000> or<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.630> positive

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
negative infinity or the positive

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.930 
negative infinity or the positive
infinity<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.400> limits<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.820> integration

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
infinity and the limits of integration

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.660 
infinity and the limits of integration
which<00:00:18.600> usually<00:00:18.949> gives<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.100> away<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.520> you're

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
which usually gives it away that you're

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.050 
which usually gives it away that you're
dealing<00:00:20.939> with<00:00:20.970> an<00:00:21.150> improper<00:00:21.660> integral

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
dealing with an improper integral

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.250 
dealing with an improper integral
usually<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> beginning<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.750> calculus

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
usually at the beginning of a calculus

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.140 
usually at the beginning of a calculus
course<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.769> don't<00:00:25.980> run<00:00:26.220> into<00:00:26.550> any<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.820> them

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
course you don't run into any of them

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.670 
course you don't run into any of them
and<00:00:27.390> then<00:00:27.480> they<00:00:27.630> magically<00:00:28.140> kind<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.500> throw

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
and then they magically kind of throw

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.859 
and then they magically kind of throw
them<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.039> at<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.640> then<00:00:29.820> from<00:00:30.630> there<00:00:30.840> on

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
them in at you and then from there on

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.990 
them in at you and then from there on
you<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.470> be<00:00:31.590> careful<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.250> ask<00:00:32.489> yourself

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
you have to be careful and ask yourself

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.270 
you have to be careful and ask yourself
is<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.630> fact<00:00:33.809> an<00:00:33.989> improper<00:00:34.559> integral<00:00:34.590> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
is this in fact an improper integral and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.080 
is this in fact an improper integral and
the<00:00:36.059> thing<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.420> notice<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.410> are<00:00:38.250> you

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the thing to notice really is are you

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.290 
the thing to notice really is are you
integrating<00:00:39.420> over<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.200> discontinuity<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.940> if

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
integrating over a discontinuity and if

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.940 
integrating over a discontinuity and if
you<00:00:42.390> think<00:00:42.570> about<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.899> graph<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.320> 1<00:00:43.530> over<00:00:43.770> x

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
you think about the graph of 1 over x

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.970 
you think about the graph of 1 over x
squared<00:00:44.210> well<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.480> terms<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> domain<00:00:46.620> if

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
squared well in terms of the domain if

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.920 
squared well in terms of the domain if
you<00:00:47.250> plug<00:00:47.520> 0<00:00:47.940> into<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.360> you're<00:00:48.629> going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> be

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
you plug 0 into this you're going to be

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.979 
you plug 0 into this you're going to be
dividing<00:00:49.260> by<00:00:49.469> 0<00:00:49.590> which<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.219> bad<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:51.840> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
dividing by 0 which is bad so there is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.959 
dividing by 0 which is bad so there is
an<00:00:52.230> infinite<00:00:52.800> discontinuity<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.820> this

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
an infinite discontinuity in this

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.220 
an infinite discontinuity in this
problem<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.989> graph

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
problem and if you think about the graph

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.920 
problem and if you think about the graph
of<00:00:58.500> 1<00:00:58.680> over<00:00:58.890> x<00:00:59.100> squared<00:01:01.250> looks<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.930> so

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
of 1 over x squared looks like this so

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.090 
of 1 over x squared looks like this so
what<00:01:04.080> we're<00:01:04.229> trying<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.830> integrate

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
what we're trying to do is integrate

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
what we're trying to do is integrate
from<00:01:05.460> 1<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.909> 0<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.630> we're<00:01:06.750> trying<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> calculate

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
from 1 to 0 so we're trying to calculate

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.710 
from 1 to 0 so we're trying to calculate
the<00:01:07.680> area<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> left<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> y-axis<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the area to the left of the y-axis and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.570 
the area to the left of the y-axis and
again<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.320> see<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.590> spiking<00:01:14.010> off<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
again you can see it's spiking off to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.410 
again you can see it's spiking off to
infinity<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:17.430> idea<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.240> much

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
infinity here the idea is pretty much

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.109 
infinity here the idea is pretty much
the<00:01:18.659> same<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> other<00:01:19.470> examples<00:01:20.189> what

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the same as in the other examples what

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.640 
the same as in the other examples what
we're<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.930> we're<00:01:22.290> still<00:01:22.439> going

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
we're going to do is we're still going

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.090 
we're going to do is we're still going
to<00:01:22.710> turn<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> into<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.369> limit<00:01:24.090> problem<00:01:24.950> see<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.040> I

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
to turn it into a limit problem see if I

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.499 
to turn it into a limit problem see if I
can<00:01:26.250> find<00:01:26.400> my<00:01:26.610> pin<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:29.390> what<00:01:30.390> we're

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
can find my pin here and what we're

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.149 
can find my pin here and what we're
going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.689> do<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.079> instead<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.470> integrating

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
going to do is instead of integrating

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.429 
going to do is instead of integrating
from<00:01:32.280> 1<00:01:32.369> excuse<00:01:33.000> me<00:01:33.150> negative<00:01:33.329> 1<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:34.020> 0

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
from 1 excuse me negative 1 to 0

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.800 
from 1 excuse me negative 1 to 0
we'll<00:01:35.280> go<00:01:35.430> from<00:01:35.610> negative<00:01:35.880> 1<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.329> some<00:01:36.630> at

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
we'll go from negative 1 to some at

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.270 
we'll go from negative 1 to some at
other<00:01:37.110> value<00:01:37.619> we'll<00:01:37.829> call<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> again<00:01:38.369> T<00:01:38.729> and

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
other value we'll call it again T and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.319 
other value we'll call it again T and
what<00:01:41.280> we're<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.970> we're<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.210> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.999 
what we're going to do is we're going to
let<00:01:42.509> T<00:01:43.040> move<00:01:44.040> over<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> right<00:01:45.500> so<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.829> this

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
let T move over to the right so in this

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
let T move over to the right so in this
case<00:01:47.310> we're<00:01:47.640> integrating<00:01:48.210> from<00:01:48.240> negative<00:01:48.450> 1

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
case we're integrating from negative 1

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.670 
case we're integrating from negative 1
to<00:01:49.409> 0<00:01:51.320> let's<00:01:52.320> make<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.500> negative<00:01:52.770> 1<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.310> T<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
to 0 let's make it negative 1 to T and

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.389 
to 0 let's make it negative 1 to T and
in<00:01:56.090> this<00:01:57.090> case<00:01:57.390> T<00:01:57.810> needs<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.380> approaching<00:01:58.979> 0

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
in this case T needs to be approaching 0

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.010 
in this case T needs to be approaching 0
but<00:02:00.270> from<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> left<00:02:00.960> side<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.719> wherever<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
but from the left side so wherever the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.050 
but from the left side so wherever the
discontinuity<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.070> that's<00:02:05.670> where<00:02:05.909> you're

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
discontinuity is that's where you're

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.730 
discontinuity is that's where you're
going<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.210> plug<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.689> T<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
going to plug in T just like in the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.859 
going to plug in T just like in the
other<00:02:07.860> examples<00:02:08.520> wherever<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.090> infinity<00:02:09.629> was

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
other examples wherever the infinity was

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.570 
other examples wherever the infinity was
that's<00:02:10.259> where<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.530> plugged<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.099> T

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
that's where you plugged in the T

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.630 
that's where you plugged in the T
and<00:02:12.530> again<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.680> basically<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.310> turn<00:02:14.520> it

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and again you basically just turn it

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.610 
and again you basically just turn it
into<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.910> limit<00:02:15.360> problem<00:02:15.840> along<00:02:16.380> with<00:02:16.590> a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
into a limit problem along with a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.060 
into a limit problem along with a
definite<00:02:17.160> integral<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.450> X<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.230> 1<00:02:19.680> over<00:02:19.710> x

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
definite integral so X to the 1 over x

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.650 
definite integral so X to the 1 over x
squared<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.700> same<00:02:20.880> as<00:02:21.060> X<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> negative

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
squared is the same as X to the negative

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.580 
squared is the same as X to the negative
second<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:24.570> if<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.810> calculate<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
second so if I calculate the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.690 
second so if I calculate the
antiderivative

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
antiderivative

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.270 
antiderivative
I'll<00:02:26.850> get<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.330> limit<00:02:27.710> again<00:02:28.710> T<00:02:29.130> is

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
I'll get the limit again T is

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.420 
I'll get the limit again T is
approaching<00:02:29.820> 0<00:02:30.210> from<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.080> left<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
approaching 0 from the left the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.430 
approaching 0 from the left the
antiderivative<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.480> X<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.050> negative

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
antiderivative of X to the negative

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.690 
antiderivative of X to the negative
second<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:34.980> negative<00:02:35.490> 1<00:02:35.760> over<00:02:35.970> X<00:02:37.700> from

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
second is negative 1 over X from

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.290 
second is negative 1 over X from
negative<00:02:39.060> 1<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.330> T<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:40.250> plug<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.430> my<00:02:41.610> limits<00:02:42.030> of

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
negative 1 to T I plug in my limits of

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.190 
negative 1 to T I plug in my limits of
integration<00:02:46.730> I'll<00:02:47.730> get<00:02:48.030> negative<00:02:48.240> 1<00:02:48.720> over<00:02:48.990> t

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
integration I'll get negative 1 over t

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.720 
integration I'll get negative 1 over t
minus<00:02:51.560> negative<00:02:52.560> 1<00:02:53.100> over<00:02:53.280> negative<00:02:53.550> 1<00:02:53.970> and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
minus negative 1 over negative 1 and

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.170 
minus negative 1 over negative 1 and
this<00:02:56.730> simplifies<00:02:57.330> down<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:58.140> limit<00:02:58.530> as<00:02:59.180> T

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
this simplifies down to the limit as T

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.060 
this simplifies down to the limit as T
approaches<00:03:00.810> 0<00:03:00.990> from<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.710> left<00:03:03.980> we're<00:03:04.980> going

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
approaches 0 from the left we're going

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.550 
approaches 0 from the left we're going
to<00:03:05.160> get<00:03:05.310> negative<00:03:05.790> 1<00:03:06.000> over<00:03:06.030> T<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:07.380> two

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
to get negative 1 over T the two

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.170 
to get negative 1 over T the two
negatives<00:03:07.950> will<00:03:08.100> make<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.340> positive<00:03:08.550> so<00:03:09.150> I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
negatives will make it positive so I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.990 
negatives will make it positive so I
have<00:03:09.300> minus<00:03:09.720> 1<00:03:10.190> but<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.310> problem<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:11.880> this

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
have minus 1 but the problem in this

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.830 
have minus 1 but the problem in this
case<00:03:12.060> if<00:03:12.630> T<00:03:13.140> approaches<00:03:13.710> 0<00:03:13.740> from<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.340> left<00:03:14.840> so

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
case if T approaches 0 from the left so

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.080 
case if T approaches 0 from the left so
in<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.860> part<00:03:17.220> I'm<00:03:17.400> plugging<00:03:17.850> in<00:03:18.180> very<00:03:18.989> small

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
in this part I'm plugging in very small

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.990 
in this part I'm plugging in very small
negative<00:03:21.090> numbers<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.280> think<00:03:23.280> about<00:03:23.520> like<00:03:23.730> 1

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
negative numbers and think about like 1

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.680 
negative numbers and think about like 1
over<00:03:24.030> point<00:03:24.630> 1<00:03:24.900> 1<00:03:25.560> over<00:03:25.800> point<00:03:26.100> 0<00:03:26.520> 1<00:03:26.820> 1<00:03:27.420> over

over point 1 1 over point 0 1 1 over

over point 1 1 over point 0 1 1 over
point<00:03:27.959> 0<00:03:28.350> 0<00:03:28.440> 1<00:03:29.070> those<00:03:29.820> numbers<00:03:30.209> are<00:03:30.360> going<00:03:30.870> to

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
point 0 0 1 those numbers are going to

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.100 
point 0 0 1 those numbers are going to
get<00:03:31.140> bigger<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.620> bigger<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.250> bigger<00:03:32.720> well<00:03:33.720> ok

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
get bigger and bigger and bigger well ok

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.780 
get bigger and bigger and bigger well ok
well<00:03:34.350> I'm<00:03:34.470> not<00:03:34.500> using<00:03:34.890> those<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:35.520> I've<00:03:35.610> got<00:03:35.760> a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
well I'm not using those but I've got a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.180 
well I'm not using those but I've got a
negative<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.540> since<00:03:37.230> it's<00:03:37.380> approaching<00:03:37.830> 0

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
negative and since it's approaching 0

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.460 
negative and since it's approaching 0
from<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.580> left<00:03:38.850> I'm<00:03:39.090> using<00:03:39.300> small<00:03:40.080> negative

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
from the left I'm using small negative

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.770 
from the left I'm using small negative
numbers<00:03:41.130> which<00:03:41.820> you're<00:03:41.940> going<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.090> cancel<00:03:42.390> out

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
numbers which you're going to cancel out

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.600 
numbers which you're going to cancel out
with<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.320> negative<00:03:43.350> that's<00:03:43.980> already<00:03:44.250> there

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
with the negative that's already there

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.600 
with the negative that's already there
and<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.720> will<00:03:45.840> give<00:03:45.989> me<00:03:46.140> infinity<00:03:46.890> minus<00:03:47.310> 1

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
and that will give me infinity minus 1

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.190 
and that will give me infinity minus 1
or<00:03:48.600> infinity<00:03:49.530> as<00:03:49.680> my<00:03:49.860> answer<00:03:50.780> so<00:03:51.780> notice<00:03:52.080> we

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
or infinity as my answer so notice we

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.960 
or infinity as my answer so notice we
did<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.380> pretty<00:03:52.650> similar<00:03:52.920> example<00:03:53.520> in<00:03:53.610> another

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
did a pretty similar example in another

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.630 
did a pretty similar example in another
video<00:03:54.300> we<00:03:54.570> looked<00:03:54.780> at<00:03:54.930> 1<00:03:55.350> over<00:03:55.500> x<00:03:55.860> squared<00:03:56.070> from

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
video we looked at 1 over x squared from

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.580 
video we looked at 1 over x squared from
1<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.090> infinity<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.810> we<00:03:57.840> got<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.080> finite<00:03:58.560> number

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
1 to infinity and we got a finite number

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.490 
1 to infinity and we got a finite number
in<00:03:59.130> this<00:04:00.030> case<00:04:00.300> we're<00:04:00.570> doing<00:04:00.660> from<00:04:00.930> negative<00:04:01.260> 1

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
in this case we're doing from negative 1

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.150 
in this case we're doing from negative 1
to<00:04:01.530> 0<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.310> turns<00:04:02.520> out<00:04:02.700> somehow<00:04:03.120> this<00:04:03.420> area

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
to 0 and it turns out somehow this area

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.130 
to 0 and it turns out somehow this area
just<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.340> left<00:04:05.610> of<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.910> y-axis<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.810> just<00:04:07.050> a

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
just to the left of the y-axis is just a

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.920 
just to the left of the y-axis is just a
bit<00:04:07.350> too<00:04:07.620> big<00:04:07.800> and<00:04:08.190> when<00:04:08.940> we<00:04:09.060> integrate<00:04:09.330> it<00:04:09.570> we

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
bit too big and when we integrate it we

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.280 
bit too big and when we integrate it we
get<00:04:10.110> infinity<00:04:10.739> out<00:04:11.600> so<00:04:12.600> again<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:12.989> is<00:04:13.170> the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
get infinity out so again this is the

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.750 
get infinity out so again this is the
basic<00:04:13.410> trick<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:14.040> have<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.250> look<00:04:14.430> for<00:04:14.640> on

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
basic trick you have to look for on

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.250 
basic trick you have to look for on
these<00:04:14.910> problems<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.540> have<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.780> think<00:04:15.989> where

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
these problems you have to think where

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.520 
these problems you have to think where
are<00:04:16.440> there<00:04:16.620> infinite<00:04:17.090> discontinuities<00:04:18.090> and

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
are there infinite discontinuities and

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.450 
are there infinite discontinuities and
that's<00:04:19.530> where<00:04:19.830> you're<00:04:20.010> going<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.220> end<00:04:20.340> up

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.460 
that's where you're going to end up

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.640 
that's where you're going to end up
plugging<00:04:20.820> in<00:04:21.090> your<00:04:21.120> T's<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.930> evaluating<00:04:22.620> your

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
plugging in your T's and evaluating your

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.760 
plugging in your T's and evaluating your
limits

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
limits

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.409 
limits
so<00:04:24.770> we'll<00:04:25.039> do<00:04:25.160> another<00:04:25.190> example<00:04:25.759> in<00:04:26.240> another

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
so we'll do another example in another

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.360 
so we'll do another example in another
video<00:04:26.840> where<00:04:27.319> just<00:04:27.710> like<00:04:27.830> when<00:04:28.039> you<00:04:28.099> have<00:04:28.250> the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
video where just like when you have the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.020 
video where just like when you have the
negative<00:04:28.789> infinity<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.330> positive<00:04:29.629> infinity

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
negative infinity to positive infinity

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.159 
negative infinity to positive infinity
you<00:04:32.030> have<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.270> break<00:04:32.479> it<00:04:32.539> up<00:04:32.780> into<00:04:32.960> two

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
you have to break it up into two

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.430 
you have to break it up into two
separate<00:04:33.560> integrals<00:04:33.710> if<00:04:34.840> your<00:04:35.840> infinite

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
separate integrals if your infinite

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.499 
separate integrals if your infinite
discontinuity<00:04:37.250> should<00:04:37.430> happen<00:04:37.729> to<00:04:37.849> occur<00:04:37.970> in

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
discontinuity should happen to occur in

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.930 
discontinuity should happen to occur in
the<00:04:38.780> middle<00:04:39.169> of<00:04:39.379> your<00:04:39.470> interval<00:04:39.919> instead<00:04:40.819> of

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
the middle of your interval instead of

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.790 
the middle of your interval instead of
just<00:04:41.120> having<00:04:41.330> one<00:04:41.870> integral<00:04:42.440> that<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:42.590> have

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
just having one integral that you have

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.760 
just having one integral that you have
to<00:04:42.889> evaluate<00:04:43.270> you'll<00:04:44.270> end<00:04:44.449> up<00:04:44.539> having<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.139> so

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
to evaluate you'll end up having to so

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.230 
to evaluate you'll end up having to so
take<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.370> look<00:04:46.580> for<00:04:46.669> another<00:04:46.849> one<00:04:47.030> of<00:04:47.150> those

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
take a look for another one of those

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.059 
take a look for another one of those
videos<00:04:47.659> it<00:04:48.020> should<00:04:48.199> be<00:04:48.319> pretty<00:04:48.530> close<00:04:48.800> by<00:04:49.009> to

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
videos it should be pretty close by to

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.690 
videos it should be pretty close by to
the<00:04:49.340> link<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:49.639> you<00:04:49.849> selected<00:04:50.210> for<00:04:50.389> this<00:04:50.509> one
