joining us I'm Joe Silveira so our piece

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.209 
joining us I'm Joe Silveira so our piece
is<00:00:09.780> pickled<00:00:10.139> for<00:00:10.349> five<00:00:10.530> or<00:00:10.679> ten<00:00:10.800> minutes<00:00:11.070> to

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
is pickled for five or ten minutes to

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.009 
is pickled for five or ten minutes to
take<00:00:11.370> off<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.700> flux<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.330> oxide<00:00:12.750> from

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
take off the flux and the oxide from

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.140 
take off the flux and the oxide from
soldering<00:00:13.469> so<00:00:14.009> we're<00:00:14.190> gonna<00:00:14.280> fish<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:15.000> out

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
soldering so we're gonna fish it out

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.620 
soldering so we're gonna fish it out
with<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.540> copper<00:00:15.870> tongs<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:18.119> we're<00:00:18.539> gonna

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
with the copper tongs so we're gonna

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.200 
with the copper tongs so we're gonna
make<00:00:18.840> our<00:00:18.990> border<00:00:19.320> income<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.460> dividers

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
make our border income the dividers

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.920 
make our border income the dividers
again<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.650> don't<00:00:22.830> want<00:00:22.949> anything<00:00:23.189> too<00:00:23.580> big

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
again so I don't want anything too big

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.210 
again so I don't want anything too big
so<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.350> nibble<00:00:25.680> out<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> little<00:00:26.039> bit

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
so you can just nibble out a little bit

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:38.360 
so you can just nibble out a little bit
at<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> time<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> shears<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:38.100> now<00:00:38.219> we're

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
at a time with the shears so now we're

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.100 
at a time with the shears so now we're
ready<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.610> stamp<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.719> I'm<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.079> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
ready to stamp it so I'm just going to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.410 
ready to stamp it so I'm just going to
use<00:00:40.290> some<00:00:40.530> very<00:00:40.559> simple<00:00:41.100> stamps<00:00:41.760> these<00:00:42.000> are

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
use some very simple stamps these are

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.299 
use some very simple stamps these are
nail<00:00:43.170> sets<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:44.010> get<00:00:44.129> at<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
nail sets that you can get at the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:01:02.850 
nail sets that you can get at the
hardware<00:00:44.489> store

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.290 

so<00:01:03.860> we're<00:01:03.950> gonna<00:01:04.070> add<00:01:04.250> jump<00:01:04.610> rings<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:05.180> the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
so we're gonna add jump rings to the

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.200 
so we're gonna add jump rings to the
back<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:05.840> we<00:01:05.930> can't<00:01:06.170> attach<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:07.040> bail<00:01:07.520> so

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
back so that we can't attach a bail so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.370 
back so that we can't attach a bail so
now<00:01:08.330> I'm<00:01:08.390> holding<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.810> with<00:01:08.990> chain<00:01:09.350> nose

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
now I'm holding it with chain nose

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.880 
now I'm holding it with chain nose
pliers<00:01:09.860> in<00:01:10.190> one<00:01:10.460> hand<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:12.140> I'm<00:01:12.530> gonna<00:01:12.619> hold

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
pliers in one hand and I'm gonna hold

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.280 
pliers in one hand and I'm gonna hold
with<00:01:13.310> bent<00:01:14.000> nose<00:01:14.270> in<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.840> other<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:16.990> I<00:01:17.990> will

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
with bent nose in the other and I will

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.510 
with bent nose in the other and I will
open<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.540> then<00:01:20.540> walk<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.590> ends<00:01:21.979> in<00:01:22.100> a

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
open it and then walk the ends in a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.430 
open it and then walk the ends in a
little<00:01:22.820> bit<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:23.660> that<00:01:23.690> they're<00:01:23.990> overlapping

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
little bit so that they're overlapping

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.730 
little bit so that they're overlapping
slightly<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:25.690> then<00:01:26.690> go<00:01:26.900> ahead<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.080> snap<00:01:27.530> it

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
slightly and then go ahead and snap it

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.490 
slightly and then go ahead and snap it
together<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:28.369> little<00:01:29.240> bit<00:01:29.360> of<00:01:29.450> tension<00:01:29.660> so<00:01:30.320> that

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
together a little bit of tension so that

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.350 
together a little bit of tension so that
it's<00:01:30.680> tightly<00:01:30.950> closed<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.550> has<00:01:31.789> to<00:01:31.970> be<00:01:32.090> closed

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
it's tightly closed it has to be closed

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.210 
it's tightly closed it has to be closed
so<00:01:32.539> that<00:01:32.720> there<00:01:32.899> is<00:01:32.990> no<00:01:33.229> gap<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.770> light<00:01:33.979> between

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
so that there is no gap of light between

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.300 
so that there is no gap of light between
the<00:01:34.520> ends<00:01:34.820> for<00:01:35.000> it<00:01:35.119> to<00:01:35.240> solder<00:01:35.479> well<00:01:35.750> so<00:01:36.740> that

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
the ends for it to solder well so that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.090 
the ends for it to solder well so that
is<00:01:37.490> all<00:01:37.729> set<00:01:38.030> there<00:01:38.800> now<00:01:39.800> we're<00:01:39.920> going<00:01:40.039> to

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
is all set there now we're going to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.680 
is all set there now we're going to
solder<00:01:40.340> this<00:01:40.640> shut<00:01:40.910> with<00:01:42.039> medium<00:01:43.180> solder<00:01:44.180> and

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
solder this shut with medium solder and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.540 
solder this shut with medium solder and
then<00:01:45.560> we're<00:01:45.680> going<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:45.830> add<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.039> little<00:01:46.310> bit<00:01:46.430> of

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
then we're going to add a little bit of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.359 
then we're going to add a little bit of
ez<00:01:46.880> on<00:01:47.180> top<00:01:47.660> to<00:01:48.470> make<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.770> connection<00:01:49.220> between

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
ez on top to make the connection between

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.300 
ez on top to make the connection between
our<00:01:49.970> bezel<00:01:50.690> setting<00:01:51.410> and<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.710> jump<00:01:51.950> ring<00:01:52.100> and

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
our bezel setting and the jump ring and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.889 
our bezel setting and the jump ring and
the<00:01:52.670> reason<00:01:52.940> you<00:01:53.060> play<00:01:53.270> with<00:01:53.450> these<00:01:53.570> different

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
the reason you play with these different

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.719 
the reason you play with these different
temperatures<00:01:54.289> of<00:01:54.500> solder<00:01:54.740> is<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:55.310> that<00:01:55.490> you

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
temperatures of solder is is so that you

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.490 
temperatures of solder is is so that you
don't<00:01:55.759> damage<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.660> fabrication<00:01:57.320> you've

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
don't damage the fabrication you've

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.740 
don't damage the fabrication you've
already<00:01:57.649> done<00:01:57.979> when<00:01:58.550> it<00:01:58.700> balls<00:01:58.940> up<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.450> will

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
already done when it balls up I will

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.359 
already done when it balls up I will
scoop<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.259> up<00:02:02.020> like<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.259> and<00:02:04.159> we'll<00:02:04.280> come

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
scoop it up like that and we'll come

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.760 
scoop it up like that and we'll come
over<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.820> jump<00:02:05.030> ring

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.850 

and<00:02:07.890> lightly<00:02:08.550> warm<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.090> up<00:02:09.420> let<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.869> flux<00:02:10.170> go

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
and lightly warm it up let the flux go

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.089 
and lightly warm it up let the flux go
clear<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.989> as<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.200> clears<00:02:13.530> I'll<00:02:13.739> set<00:02:13.950> this

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
clear and as it clears I'll set this

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.970 
clear and as it clears I'll set this
down<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.420> join<00:02:16.050> line

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.040 

just<00:02:19.520> kind<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.760> fuss<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.270> over<00:02:20.450> till<00:02:20.660> it's<00:02:20.690> on

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
just kind of fuss it over till it's on

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.980 
just kind of fuss it over till it's on
the<00:02:21.350> line

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.860 

and<00:02:26.500> let<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.950> flow<00:02:27.160> in<00:02:27.400> like<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.850> now<00:02:28.750> we're

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
and let it flow in like that now we're

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.250 
and let it flow in like that now we're
gonna<00:02:28.960> pick<00:02:29.200> up<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.800> EZ<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:31.960> one<00:02:32.110> we're

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
gonna pick up the EZ and this one we're

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.590 
gonna pick up the EZ and this one we're
just<00:02:32.290> gonna<00:02:32.500> stick<00:02:32.830> up<00:02:32.950> on<00:02:33.190> top<00:02:33.580> we're<00:02:34.480> not

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
just gonna stick up on top we're not

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.510 
just gonna stick up on top we're not
gonna<00:02:34.720> flow<00:02:34.990> it<00:02:35.140> all<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.380> way<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:38.400> its<00:02:39.400> gonna

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
gonna flow it all the way in its gonna

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.640 
gonna flow it all the way in its gonna
set<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:39.970> on<00:02:40.030> like<00:02:40.270> that<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.510> little<00:02:40.750> bit<00:02:40.870> so<00:02:41.500> it's

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
set it on like that a little bit so it's

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.930 
set it on like that a little bit so it's
got<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.800> little<00:02:42.010> bit<00:02:42.100> of<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.250> lump<00:02:42.460> you<00:02:42.670> can<00:02:42.820> even

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
got a little bit of a lump you can even

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.580 
got a little bit of a lump you can even
add<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.150> second<00:02:43.690> piece<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.110> it's<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.320> little<00:02:44.410> bit

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
add a second piece so it's a little bit

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.710 
add a second piece so it's a little bit
lumpy<00:02:44.710> ER<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.370> way<00:02:45.580> when<00:02:46.150> we<00:02:46.270> solder<00:02:46.540> it

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
lumpy ER and that way when we solder it

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.450 
lumpy ER and that way when we solder it
to<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.050> setting<00:02:47.470> there'll<00:02:47.680> be<00:02:47.710> a<00:02:47.800> really<00:02:48.280> nice

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
to the setting there'll be a really nice

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.920 
to the setting there'll be a really nice
obvious<00:02:49.500> drop<00:02:50.940> there<00:02:51.940> like<00:02:52.300> that<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:52.540> it's

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
obvious drop there like that so it's

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.470 
obvious drop there like that so it's
stuck<00:02:53.200> on<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:54.220> now<00:02:54.400> we're<00:02:54.580> going<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.820> put<00:02:55.360> some

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
stuck on so now we're going to put some

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.900 
stuck on so now we're going to put some
flux<00:02:55.720> on<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.900> setting<00:02:56.410> itself<00:02:56.710> you<00:02:57.700> have<00:02:57.730> to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
flux on the setting itself you have to

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.220 
flux on the setting itself you have to
flux<00:02:58.180> all<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.900> parts<00:02:59.230> just<00:02:59.650> like<00:03:00.010> before

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
flux all the parts just like before

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.460 
flux all the parts just like before
anything<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.320> leave<00:03:02.440> exposed<00:03:03.030> will<00:03:04.030> get

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
anything you leave exposed will get

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.780 
anything you leave exposed will get
really<00:03:05.470> dark<00:03:05.650> with<00:03:05.890> fire<00:03:06.100> scale<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.670> you'll

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
really dark with fire scale and you'll

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.460 
really dark with fire scale and you'll
have<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.000> do<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.120> lot<00:03:07.390> of<00:03:07.540> polishing<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.170> that

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
have to do a lot of polishing and that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.460 
have to do a lot of polishing and that
means<00:03:08.680> removing<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.490> lot<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.820> silver<00:03:10.300> I<00:03:10.510> want<00:03:11.380> to

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
means removing a lot of silver I want to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.650 
means removing a lot of silver I want to
see<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.710> nice<00:03:11.950> white<00:03:12.460> coat<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:13.000> flux<00:03:13.360> like

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
see that nice white coat of flux like

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.340 
see that nice white coat of flux like
that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.190 

what<00:03:17.350> we're<00:03:17.470> watching<00:03:17.860> for<00:03:18.100> is<00:03:18.370> for

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
what we're watching for is for

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.620 
what we're watching for is for
the<00:03:20.709> metal<00:03:21.099> here<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:21.700> sheet<00:03:21.910> metal<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.330> drop

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
the metal here the sheet metal to drop

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.780 
the metal here the sheet metal to drop
to<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.900> jump<00:03:23.200> ring<00:03:23.380> now<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.280> mistake<00:03:24.760> people

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
to the jump ring now the mistake people

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.400 
to the jump ring now the mistake people
make<00:03:25.090> as<00:03:25.330> they<00:03:25.420> go<00:03:25.540> right<00:03:25.720> for<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.989> jump<00:03:26.200> ring

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
make as they go right for the jump ring

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.780 
make as they go right for the jump ring
and<00:03:26.620> we<00:03:26.709> just<00:03:26.890> heat<00:03:27.040> there<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.550> solder

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
and we just heat there and the solder

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.100 
and we just heat there and the solder
close<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.270> jump<00:03:28.510> ring<00:03:28.630> you<00:03:28.690> know<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.870> looks

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
close to the jump ring you know it looks

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.780 
close to the jump ring you know it looks
like<00:03:29.170> it's<00:03:29.410> solder<00:03:29.590> but<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.250> didn't<00:03:30.520> because

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
like it's solder but it didn't because

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.490 
like it's solder but it didn't because
all<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.300> rest<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.599> this<00:03:31.720> metal<00:03:31.989> here<00:03:32.170> didn't

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
all the rest of this metal here didn't

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.350 
all the rest of this metal here didn't
heat<00:03:32.620> up<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.430> big<00:03:33.610> trick<00:03:33.819> is<00:03:33.970> actually<00:03:34.270> to

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
heat up so the big trick is actually to

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.990 
heat up so the big trick is actually to
heat<00:03:34.510> up<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.810> biggest<00:03:35.170> part<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.590> metal

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
heat up the biggest part of the metal

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.309 
heat up the biggest part of the metal
let's<00:03:37.000> go<00:03:37.150> ahead<00:03:37.270> and<00:03:37.450> put<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.900> little<00:03:38.140> bit<00:03:38.230> of

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
let's go ahead and put a little bit of

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.680 
let's go ahead and put a little bit of
flux<00:03:38.590> inside<00:03:38.950> here

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.210 

and<00:03:43.200> when<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.410> setting<00:03:43.740> gets<00:03:43.890> hot<00:03:44.040> enough

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
and when the setting gets hot enough

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.390 
and when the setting gets hot enough
it'll<00:03:44.550> draw<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:44.970> solder<00:03:45.710> from<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:46.950> jump<00:03:47.220> ring

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
it'll draw the solder from the jump ring

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.820 
it'll draw the solder from the jump ring
to<00:03:47.580> itself<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.060> you'll<00:03:48.180> see<00:03:48.360> it<00:03:48.450> drop<00:03:48.830> there

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
to itself and you'll see it drop there

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.350 
to itself and you'll see it drop there
it<00:03:49.920> goes

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
it goes

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.670 
it goes
then<00:03:51.360> finish<00:03:51.720> off<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:51.990> little<00:03:52.200> bit<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.440> heat<00:03:52.560> on

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
then finish off a little bit of heat on

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.270 
then finish off a little bit of heat on
the<00:03:52.800> jump<00:03:53.010> ring<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.750> you're<00:03:55.050> good<00:03:55.230> now<00:03:56.130> this

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
the jump ring and you're good now this

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.910 
the jump ring and you're good now this
will<00:03:56.430> go<00:03:56.520> on<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.730> pickle<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.150> clean<00:03:57.620> after<00:03:58.620> it

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
will go on the pickle to clean after it

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.280 
will go on the pickle to clean after it
goes<00:03:59.010> in<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.280> water<00:04:02.750> for<00:04:03.750> another<00:04:03.960> five

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
goes in the water for another five

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.270 
goes in the water for another five
minutes<00:04:06.230> so<00:04:07.230> after<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.800> little<00:04:08.010> bit<00:04:08.190> of

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
minutes so after a little bit of

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.610 
minutes so after a little bit of
polishing<00:04:08.580> we're<00:04:08.850> ready<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.300> set<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.380> stone

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
polishing we're ready to set the stone

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.060 
polishing we're ready to set the stone
so<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:11.730> want<00:04:12.240> to<00:04:12.300> do<00:04:12.390> all<00:04:12.630> or<00:04:13.230> most<00:04:13.770> of<00:04:13.920> your

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
so you want to do all or most of your

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.410 
so you want to do all or most of your
polishing<00:04:14.370> before<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:14.790> get<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.030> this<00:04:15.150> point

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
polishing before you get to this point

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.510 
polishing before you get to this point
just<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.930> don't<00:04:16.110> risk<00:04:16.830> damaging<00:04:17.459> the

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
just so you don't risk damaging the

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.330 
just so you don't risk damaging the
stone<00:04:17.850> as<00:04:18.120> much<00:04:18.660> as<00:04:18.810> possible<00:04:18.989> after<00:04:19.920> it's<00:04:20.070> set

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
stone as much as possible after it's set

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.970 
stone as much as possible after it's set
so<00:04:20.910> we're<00:04:21.030> gonna<00:04:21.150> use<00:04:21.239> our<00:04:22.080> tools<00:04:22.650> here<00:04:22.950> to

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
so we're gonna use our tools here to

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.130 
so we're gonna use our tools here to
bring<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:23.610> down<00:04:23.790> against<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.570> stone<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:25.050> you

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
bring it down against the stone so you

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.030 
bring it down against the stone so you
can<00:04:25.230> see<00:04:25.410> it's<00:04:25.530> crimped<00:04:26.370> in<00:04:27.380> so<00:04:28.380> you<00:04:28.470> want<00:04:28.680> to

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
can see it's crimped in so you want to

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.720 
can see it's crimped in so you want to
always<00:04:29.070> crimp<00:04:29.700> in<00:04:29.880> opposites<00:04:30.920> because<00:04:31.920> if<00:04:32.550> you

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
always crimp in opposites because if you

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.280 
always crimp in opposites because if you
just<00:04:32.880> go<00:04:33.030> around<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.720> stone<00:04:33.930> like<00:04:34.110> this

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
just go around the stone like this

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.830 
just go around the stone like this
you'll<00:04:34.440> end<00:04:34.500> up<00:04:34.650> with<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.830> big<00:04:35.040> wrinkle<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:36.390> this

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
you'll end up with a big wrinkle so this

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.630 
you'll end up with a big wrinkle so this
way<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.050> ease<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.710> metal<00:04:37.950> down<00:04:38.160> around<00:04:38.490> the

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
way you ease the metal down around the

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.060 
way you ease the metal down around the
stone<00:04:38.850> evenly<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:39.780> you'll<00:04:40.590> get<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:40.860> nice

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
stone evenly and you'll get a nice

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.400 
stone evenly and you'll get a nice
smooth<00:04:41.340> bezel<00:04:41.760> around<00:04:41.910> it<00:04:42.240> now<00:04:42.390> you<00:04:43.260> might

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
smooth bezel around it now you might

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.900 
smooth bezel around it now you might
notice<00:04:43.560> as<00:04:43.860> you're<00:04:44.010> pushing<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.430> bezel<00:04:44.730> down

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
notice as you're pushing the bezel down

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.600 
notice as you're pushing the bezel down
that<00:04:45.210> as<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:45.870> push<00:04:46.050> one<00:04:46.290> part<00:04:46.590> down<00:04:46.770> another

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
that as you push one part down another

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.790 
that as you push one part down another
part<00:04:47.880> pushes<00:04:48.270> up<00:04:48.420> and<00:04:48.600> that's<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.870> metal<00:04:49.140> sort

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
part pushes up and that's the metal sort

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.950 
part pushes up and that's the metal sort
of<00:04:49.860> relaxing<00:04:50.430> its<00:04:50.550> way<00:04:50.700> down<00:04:51.030> against<00:04:51.840> the

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
of relaxing its way down against the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.730 
of relaxing its way down against the
stone<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:54.510> you're<00:04:54.660> going<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:54.840> burnish<00:04:55.440> the

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
stone and you're going to burnish the
