00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
I hope we can see them again in the sine

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.610 
I hope we can see them again in the sine

pretty interesting this is just
basically<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.840> little<00:03:07.110> tool<00:03:07.350> area<00:03:07.710> I<00:03:08.220> really

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
basically a little tool area I really

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.130 
basically a little tool area I really
don't<00:03:09.240> know<00:03:09.300> what<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.750> right<00:03:09.960> there

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
working on something to do with

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.330 
working on something to do with
chemistry<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.720> was<00:03:22.470> thinking<00:03:22.770> me<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.070> ACE

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
chemistry I was thinking me to the ACE

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.070 
chemistry I was thinking me to the ACE
chemical<00:03:23.730> plants<00:03:24.390> could<00:03:24.540> be<00:03:24.630> something<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.960> do

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
chemical plants could be something to do

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.900 
chemical plants could be something to do
with<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.380> know<00:03:25.530> oh<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.920> push<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.460> guy<00:03:26.640> into

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
the red hood I pushed this Red Hood gang

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.430 
the red hood I pushed this Red Hood gang
member<00:03:29.700> into<00:03:30.090> this<00:03:30.210> acid<00:03:30.630> pit<00:03:30.810> what<00:03:31.020> did<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.260> do

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
member into this acid pit what did it do

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.050 
member into this acid pit what did it do
to<00:03:31.470> him<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.010> maybe<00:03:32.490> he's<00:03:32.670> trying<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.940> like

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
to him and maybe he's trying to like

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.970 
to him and maybe he's trying to like
work<00:03:33.270> out<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.450> formula<00:03:33.870> that's<00:03:34.230> just<00:03:34.740> my<00:03:34.950> guess

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
work out a formula that's just my guess

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.800 
work out a formula that's just my guess
I'm<00:03:35.520> one<00:03:35.640> here<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.180> construction<00:03:36.600> and

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
I'm one here is in the construction and

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.630 
I'm one here is in the construction and
below<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:39.120> anyway<00:03:39.510> if<00:03:39.810> we<00:03:40.050> go<00:03:40.260> down<00:03:40.290> here<00:03:40.640> we

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
below so anyway if we go down here we

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.180 
below so anyway if we go down here we
gotta<00:03:41.820> see<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.630> basically<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.650> ending

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
gotta see this is basically the ending

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.390 
gotta see this is basically the ending
of<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.370> Batcave<00:03:44.850> wheel<00:03:45.590> right<00:03:46.590> here<00:03:46.620> some<00:03:47.220> old

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
of the Batcave wheel right here some old

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.270 
of the Batcave wheel right here some old
rusty<00:03:47.820> tools<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:49.260> go<00:03:49.470> up<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:49.890> Bruce<00:03:50.130> Wayne

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
rusty tools to go up to the Bruce Wayne

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.790 
rusty tools to go up to the Bruce Wayne
mansion<00:03:51.210> you<00:03:51.840> had<00:03:51.990> to<00:03:52.140> go<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.350> this<00:03:52.440> elevator
