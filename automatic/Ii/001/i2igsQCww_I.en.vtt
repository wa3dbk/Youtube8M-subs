00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.110 

I<00:01:02.630> think

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:20.460 

because<00:01:06.690> that<00:01:06.870> angle<00:01:07.290> slightly

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:42.180 

I<00:01:20.560> don't<00:01:21.130> know

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:58.470 

you<00:01:42.700> can<00:01:42.880> move<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:43.300> circle

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.650 

glazed<00:01:59.480> actually<00:02:00.050> tilt<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:01.400> blade<00:02:01.850> sophomore

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
glazed actually tilt the blade sophomore

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.270 
glazed actually tilt the blade sophomore
it<00:02:02.960> goes<00:02:03.140> up<00:02:03.440> we<00:02:03.650> go<00:02:03.800> down

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it goes up we go down

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.180 
it goes up we go down
Circle<00:02:06.170> Circle<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.650> just<00:02:07.830> like<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.100> was

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
Circle Circle like that just like it was

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.950 
Circle Circle like that just like it was
like<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.429> softer<00:02:08.970> softer<00:02:09.959> goes<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.259> way

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
like a softer softer goes this way

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:52.770 
like a softer softer goes this way
Oh

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:30.040 

turn<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:53.900> around

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.170 

you

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:57.619 

I

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.150 

it<00:03:58.629> turns<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.080> blades<00:04:01.739> here<00:04:02.739> I'll<00:04:02.890> show<00:04:02.920> you

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
it turns the blades here I'll show you

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:13.670 
it turns the blades here I'll show you
what<00:04:06.959> okay<00:04:10.830> what<00:04:11.830> when<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.370> goes<00:04:12.519> up<00:04:12.819> and<00:04:13.120> down

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
what okay what when it goes up and down

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.400 
what okay what when it goes up and down
so<00:04:14.680> see<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.610> blades<00:04:15.930> see<00:04:16.930> how<00:04:17.049> those<00:04:17.229> turn

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
so see the blades see how those turn

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.280 
so see the blades see how those turn
like<00:04:17.650> that<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:17.859> turn<00:04:18.160> up<00:04:18.400> like<00:04:19.329> that<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.930> then

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
like that I turn up like that and then

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.230 
like that I turn up like that and then
when<00:04:20.320> it's<00:04:20.620> upside<00:04:20.829> down<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.549> can<00:04:21.790> make<00:04:21.940> them<00:04:22.120> go

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
when it's upside down I can make them go

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.320 
when it's upside down I can make them go
down<00:04:22.470> like<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:23.530> see<00:04:24.340> how<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.550> turns<00:04:24.729> it<00:04:25.000> right

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
down like that see how it turns it right

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.050 
down like that see how it turns it right
so<00:04:25.630> they're<00:04:25.870> upside<00:04:26.320> down<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:27.310> only<00:04:27.550> spins

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
so they're upside down and it only spins

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.930 
so they're upside down and it only spins
the<00:04:28.389> same<00:04:28.660> way<00:04:28.990> at<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:29.350> same<00:04:29.590> speed<00:04:30.070> so<00:04:30.790> when

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
the same way at the same speed so when

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.430 
the same way at the same speed so when
they're<00:04:31.090> down<00:04:31.240> like<00:04:31.600> that<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:32.110> can<00:04:32.260> hold

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
they're down like that it can hold

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.350 
they're down like that it can hold
itself<00:04:32.830> upside<00:04:33.340> down<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.820> this<00:04:33.940> shaped<00:04:34.210> like

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
itself upside down is this shaped like

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.050 
itself upside down is this shaped like
an<00:04:34.479> airplane<00:04:34.750> wing<00:04:35.220> semester<00:04:36.220> aerofoil<00:04:36.700> yeah

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
an airplane wing semester aerofoil yeah

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.710 
an airplane wing semester aerofoil yeah
so<00:04:37.900> that's<00:04:38.410> up<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.070> down<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.669> to<00:04:40.180> make<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.510> go

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
so that's up and down and to make it go

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.890 
so that's up and down and to make it go
forward<00:04:41.050> put<00:04:42.039> it<00:04:42.160> up<00:04:42.370> like<00:04:42.700> that<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:43.570> lean

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
forward put it up like that and you lean

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.040 
forward put it up like that and you lean
it<00:04:44.110> forward<00:04:44.289> like<00:04:44.950> this<00:04:44.979> it<00:04:45.820> goes<00:04:46.150> forward<00:04:46.570> so

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
it forward like this it goes forward so

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.510 
it forward like this it goes forward so
how<00:04:47.139> do<00:04:47.200> you<00:04:47.320> lean<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:47.650> how<00:04:47.919> does<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.190> how<00:04:48.460> do

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
how do you lean it how does it how do

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.270 
how do you lean it how does it how do
you<00:04:48.610> make<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:48.910> so<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.110> make<00:04:50.289> it<00:04:50.470> lean<00:04:50.860> left

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
you make it so so to make it lean left

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.000 
you make it so so to make it lean left
and<00:04:51.550> right<00:04:51.760> you<00:04:52.120> just<00:04:52.870> stick<00:04:53.380> on<00:04:53.530> this<00:04:53.770> side

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
and right you just stick on this side

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.600 
and right you just stick on this side
and<00:04:54.280> see<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.180> plate<00:04:55.620> this<00:04:56.620> here<00:04:56.979> do<00:04:57.340> that

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
and see the plate this here do that

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.400 
and see the plate this here do that
thing<00:04:57.639> Lucas<00:04:58.150> watch<00:04:58.600> this<00:04:58.780> move<00:04:59.050> that's

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
thing Lucas watch this move that's

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.230 
thing Lucas watch this move that's
called<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.830> swash<00:05:00.160> plate<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:00.820> it<00:05:00.970> moves

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
called the swash plate and it moves

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.390 
called the swash plate and it moves
that's<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.229> rice<00:05:02.440> that<00:05:02.800> turns<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.250> whole

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
that's to the rice that turns the whole

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.020 
that's to the rice that turns the whole
that's<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.180> spinning<00:05:04.510> disk<00:05:04.900> right<00:05:06.030> you

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
that's to the spinning disk right you

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.000 
that's to the spinning disk right you
can't<00:05:07.450> make<00:05:07.750> it<00:05:07.990> fly<00:05:08.500> upside<00:05:09.099> jump<00:05:09.630> backward

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
can't make it fly upside jump backward

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.180 
can't make it fly upside jump backward
forward<00:05:12.010> backwards<00:05:12.700> and<00:05:13.270> then<00:05:13.360> this<00:05:13.720> thing

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
forward backwards and then this thing

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.390 
forward backwards and then this thing
see<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.370> tail<00:05:15.550> blades<00:05:15.910> yeah<00:05:17.190> see<00:05:18.190> how<00:05:18.280> those

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
see the tail blades yeah see how those

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.060 
see the tail blades yeah see how those
turn<00:05:18.960> that<00:05:19.960> makes<00:05:20.169> a<00:05:20.289> real<00:05:20.470> one<00:05:20.650> maybe<00:05:21.039> a

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
turn that makes a real one maybe a

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.070 
turn that makes a real one maybe a
helicopter<00:05:21.639> Sam<00:05:21.910> way<00:05:22.120> he<00:05:22.570> goes<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:22.900> same

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
helicopter Sam way he goes the same

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.110 
helicopter Sam way he goes the same
speed<00:05:23.530> but<00:05:23.860> it<00:05:23.950> just<00:05:24.099> pushes<00:05:24.340> more<00:05:24.639> air<00:05:24.849> if<00:05:25.030> you

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
speed but it just pushes more air if you

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.140 
speed but it just pushes more air if you
turn<00:05:25.360> it<00:05:25.510> its<00:05:25.750> belt<00:05:26.110> driven<00:05:26.470> so<00:05:27.130> it<00:05:27.460> goes<00:05:27.820> at

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
turn it its belt driven so it goes at

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.200 
turn it its belt driven so it goes at
the<00:05:28.360> proper<00:05:28.810> speed<00:05:29.139> related<00:05:29.889> to<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.970> main

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
the proper speed related to the main

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.900 
the proper speed related to the main
head<00:05:31.510> what's<00:05:32.320> great<00:05:32.620> about<00:05:32.650> this<00:05:33.280> turn<00:05:33.610> by

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
head what's great about this turn by

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.300 
head what's great about this turn by
this<00:05:34.120> thing<00:05:34.360> yeah<00:05:34.630> the<00:05:35.080> big<00:05:35.410> router<00:05:35.860> turn

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
this thing yeah the big router turn

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.580 
this thing yeah the big router turn
let's<00:05:36.550> Mambo<00:05:36.910> so<00:05:37.539> they're<00:05:37.780> ahead<00:05:38.050> of<00:05:38.229> their

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
let's Mambo so they're ahead of their

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.190 
let's Mambo so they're ahead of their
interlock<00:05:38.950> to<00:05:39.160> another<00:05:39.370> about<00:05:39.970> real<00:05:42.300> yep<00:05:43.300> and

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
interlock to another about real yep and

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.850 
interlock to another about real yep and
this<00:05:44.349> thing<00:05:44.530> just<00:05:44.710> go<00:05:45.010> flat<00:05:45.370> yeah<00:05:45.940> and<00:05:46.300> then

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
this thing just go flat yeah and then

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.670 
this thing just go flat yeah and then
since<00:05:47.860> since<00:05:48.520> it's<00:05:48.729> so<00:05:48.970> small<00:05:49.389> all<00:05:50.110> radio

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
since since it's so small all radio

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.960 
since since it's so small all radio
control<00:05:51.099> helicopters<00:05:51.849> have<00:05:53.400> this<00:05:54.400> which<00:05:54.760> is

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
control helicopters have this which is

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.500 
control helicopters have this which is
an<00:05:55.150> angular<00:05:55.720> velocity<00:05:56.410> control<00:05:56.680> system

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
an angular velocity control system

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.740 
an angular velocity control system
uh-huh<00:05:58.510> we<00:05:59.050> called<00:05:59.349> it<00:05:59.530> gyro

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
uh-huh we called it gyro

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.470 
uh-huh we called it gyro
okay<00:06:01.230> it's<00:06:01.770> really<00:06:02.160> not<00:06:02.310> a<00:06:02.370> gyro<00:06:02.820> it<00:06:03.090> doesn't

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
okay it's really not a gyro it doesn't

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.320 
okay it's really not a gyro it doesn't
have<00:06:03.630> any<00:06:03.840> spinning<00:06:04.700> gyroscopic<00:06:05.700> parts<00:06:06.060> in<00:06:06.240> it

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
have any spinning gyroscopic parts in it

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.710 
have any spinning gyroscopic parts in it
anymore<00:06:06.660> it's<00:06:07.380> electronic<00:06:07.890> but<00:06:08.550> it<00:06:09.090> senses

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
anymore it's electronic but it senses

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.770 
anymore it's electronic but it senses
the<00:06:09.990> change<00:06:10.710> its<00:06:11.010> senses<00:06:11.540> changes<00:06:12.540> in<00:06:12.690> the

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
the change its senses changes in the

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.820 
the change its senses changes in the
tail<00:06:13.110> see<00:06:14.270> see<00:06:15.270> if<00:06:15.420> I<00:06:15.540> spin<00:06:16.140> the<00:06:16.170> helicopter

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
tail see see if I spin the helicopter

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.550 
tail see see if I spin the helicopter
one<00:06:16.980> way<00:06:17.190> it<00:06:17.850> tries<00:06:18.150> to<00:06:18.180> counteract<00:06:18.900> that<00:06:18.990> do

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
one way it tries to counteract that do

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.440 
one way it tries to counteract that do
that<00:06:19.620> if<00:06:19.920> I<00:06:20.040> go<00:06:20.220> back<00:06:20.250> the<00:06:20.700> other<00:06:20.730> way<00:06:20.940> that's

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
that if I go back the other way that's

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.260 
that if I go back the other way that's
the<00:06:21.600> only<00:06:21.840> way<00:06:21.960> it<00:06:22.380> turns<00:06:22.710> the<00:06:22.890> thing<00:06:23.100> so<00:06:23.760> so<00:06:24.120> is

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
the only way it turns the thing so so is

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.270 
the only way it turns the thing so so is
there<00:06:24.420> a<00:06:24.450> part<00:06:24.810> that<00:06:24.960> moves<00:06:25.230> like<00:06:25.770> an<00:06:25.950> appeal

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
there a part that moves like an appeal

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.140 
there a part that moves like an appeal
when<00:06:26.460> this<00:06:26.550> flexes<00:06:27.030> or<00:06:27.150> something<00:06:27.890> yeah<00:06:29.150> does

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
when this flexes or something yeah does

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.960 
when this flexes or something yeah does
it<00:06:30.300> have<00:06:30.450> blood<00:06:30.720> on<00:06:30.870> it<00:06:31.110> has<00:06:31.530> tiny

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
it have blood on it has tiny

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.540 
it have blood on it has tiny
accelerometers<00:06:33.770> this<00:06:34.770> little<00:06:35.040> computer<00:06:35.190> can

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
accelerometers this little computer can

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.640 
accelerometers this little computer can
feel<00:06:35.850> if<00:06:36.390> it's<00:06:36.630> pushed<00:06:37.020> one<00:06:37.230> way<00:06:37.410> or<00:06:37.470> the<00:06:37.560> other

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
feel if it's pushed one way or the other

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.420 
feel if it's pushed one way or the other
in<00:06:37.980> it<00:06:38.100> it<00:06:38.430> works<00:06:38.700> that<00:06:38.940> fast<00:06:38.970> and<00:06:39.720> it<00:06:39.810> has<00:06:40.020> the

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
in it it works that fast and it has the

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:49.100 
in it it works that fast and it has the
little<00:06:41.430> servo<00:06:42.950> yeah<00:06:43.950> I<00:06:43.980> know<00:06:44.250> that<00:06:47.870> and<00:06:48.870> when

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
little servo yeah I know that and when

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.390 
little servo yeah I know that and when
it's<00:06:49.260> on<00:06:49.410> the<00:06:49.530> ground<00:06:49.560> it<00:06:50.010> doesn't<00:06:50.340> know

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
it's on the ground it doesn't know

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.760 
it's on the ground it doesn't know
what's<00:06:50.580> going<00:06:51.020> doesn't<00:06:52.020> understand<00:06:52.470> did<00:06:52.650> you

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
what's going doesn't understand did you

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.070 
what's going doesn't understand did you
see<00:06:52.950> it<00:06:53.040> you<00:06:53.490> see<00:06:53.640> a<00:06:53.850> movie<00:06:54.210> about<00:06:54.360> rider<00:06:54.720> put

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
see it you see a movie about rider put

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.909 
see it you see a movie about rider put
the<00:06:55.320> tail<00:06:55.590> and<00:06:56.390> it's<00:06:57.390> not<00:06:57.600> moving<00:06:57.990> so<00:06:58.470> it<00:06:58.710> gets

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
the tail and it's not moving so it gets

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.470 
the tail and it's not moving so it gets
stuff<00:07:00.110> get<00:07:01.110> stuck<00:07:01.440> at<00:07:01.590> other<00:07:01.980> end<00:07:02.250> so<00:07:02.910> so<00:07:03.270> how

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
stuff get stuck at other end so so how

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.450 
stuff get stuck at other end so so how
does<00:07:03.540> this<00:07:03.710> so<00:07:04.710> how<00:07:04.860> does<00:07:04.919> this<00:07:05.130> thing<00:07:05.190> move

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
does this so how does this thing move

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:20.150 
does this so how does this thing move
this<00:07:05.640> is<00:07:05.880> this<00:07:06.090> a<00:07:08.990> director<00:07:09.990> to<00:07:10.110> the<00:07:10.200> other

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.050 

one<00:07:21.000> motor<00:07:21.240> that<00:07:21.480> goes<00:07:21.630> it<00:07:21.990> reverses<00:07:23.060> just

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
one motor that goes it reverses just

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.340 
one motor that goes it reverses just
like<00:07:24.180> those<00:07:24.330> motors<00:07:24.660> that<00:07:24.780> we<00:07:24.870> play<00:07:25.080> with<00:07:25.230> at

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.350 
like those motors that we play with at

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.030 
like those motors that we play with at
home<00:07:25.470> bears<00:07:25.860> very<00:07:26.250> fast<00:07:27.170> 60<00:07:28.170> degrees<00:07:28.530> in<00:07:28.560> point

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.040 
home bears very fast 60 degrees in point

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.370 
home bears very fast 60 degrees in point
oh<00:07:29.190> eight<00:07:29.220> seconds<00:07:29.820> and<00:07:30.450> then<00:07:30.660> and<00:07:30.990> this<00:07:31.170> is

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 
oh eight seconds and then and this is

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.080 
oh eight seconds and then and this is
just<00:07:31.530> a<00:07:31.680> little<00:07:31.920> piston<00:07:32.400> adjust<00:07:32.700> it<00:07:32.880> just

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.090 
just a little piston adjust it just

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.030 
just a little piston adjust it just
slides<00:07:33.540> in<00:07:33.720> there<00:07:33.900> up<00:07:34.140> and<00:07:34.350> down<00:07:34.470> okay<00:07:34.830> there's

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.040 
slides in there up and down okay there's

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.460 
slides in there up and down okay there's
the<00:07:35.250> pitch<00:07:35.490> same<00:07:36.330> way<00:07:36.570> that<00:07:36.780> the<00:07:36.960> blades<00:07:37.230> up

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.470 
the pitch same way that the blades up

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.650 
the pitch same way that the blades up
here<00:07:37.680> change<00:07:37.950> wait<00:07:38.730> so<00:07:38.970> is<00:07:39.030> their<00:07:39.210> motor<00:07:39.450> in

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.660 
here change wait so is their motor in

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.780 
here change wait so is their motor in
here<00:07:39.930> is<00:07:40.200> that<00:07:40.380> no<00:07:41.130> it's<00:07:41.400> felt<00:07:41.700> its<00:07:41.910> belt

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:43.790 
here is that no it's felt its belt

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.860 
here is that no it's felt its belt
decision<00:07:44.790> there's<00:07:45.180> your<00:07:45.360> belt<00:07:45.600> that<00:07:45.810> goes

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:45.870 
decision there's your belt that goes

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.370 
decision there's your belt that goes
through<00:07:46.440> the<00:07:46.590> boob<00:07:46.800> comes<00:07:47.790> out<00:07:48.090> back<00:07:48.420> here<00:07:48.690> so

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 
through the boob comes out back here so

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.290 
through the boob comes out back here so
there's<00:07:49.590> the<00:07:49.740> gripper<00:07:49.950> here<00:07:50.910> and<00:07:51.120> there's

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 
there's the gripper here and there's

00:07:51.300 --> 00:08:08.150 
there's the gripper here and there's
here<00:07:51.720> up<00:07:51.900> front<00:08:03.920> a<00:08:04.920> little<00:08:04.950> ones<00:08:05.610> away
