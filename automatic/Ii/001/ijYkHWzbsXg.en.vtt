00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
guys next time is one more thing the

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.050 
guys next time is one more thing the
back<00:06:20.700> here<00:06:20.940> you<00:06:21.690> can<00:06:21.810> lip<00:06:21.990> this<00:06:22.140> through<00:06:22.440> and

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
back here you can lip this through and

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.210 
back here you can lip this through and
actually<00:06:24.060> just<00:06:24.840> comes<00:06:25.050> off<00:06:25.200> so<00:06:25.860> you<00:06:25.920> can

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
actually just comes off so you can

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.190 
actually just comes off so you can
actually<00:06:26.340> lose<00:06:26.580> it<00:06:26.760> pretty<00:06:26.910> easy<00:06:27.060> but<00:06:27.330> I<00:06:27.600> don't

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
actually lose it pretty easy but I don't

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.850 
actually lose it pretty easy but I don't
think<00:06:28.320> so<00:06:29.180> but<00:06:30.180> basically<00:06:30.600> you<00:06:31.470> could<00:06:31.620> store

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
think so but basically you could store

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.080 
think so but basically you could store
your<00:06:32.100> USB<00:06:33.530> right<00:06:34.530> there<00:06:34.770> for<00:06:35.610> if<00:06:35.940> you're

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
your USB right there for if you're

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.510 
your USB right there for if you're
traveling<00:06:36.480> around<00:06:36.690> um<00:06:37.110> and<00:06:37.680> then<00:06:38.400> your

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
traveling around um and then your

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.870 
traveling around um and then your
battery's<00:06:38.910> going<00:06:39.150> here<00:06:39.480> obviously<00:06:39.890> so<00:06:40.890> that's

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
battery's going here obviously so that's

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.820 
battery's going here obviously so that's
pretty<00:06:42.270> convenient<00:06:42.690> I<00:06:42.990> would<00:06:43.140> think<00:06:44.390> yeah

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
pretty convenient I would think yeah

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.930 
pretty convenient I would think yeah
that's<00:06:46.830> pretty<00:06:47.100> much<00:06:47.220> it<00:06:47.340> that's<00:06:47.640> all<00:06:47.700> I<00:06:47.790> want

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
that's pretty much it that's all I want

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.530 
that's pretty much it that's all I want
to<00:06:48.000> show<00:06:48.120> you<00:06:48.210> guys<00:06:48.270> right<00:06:49.080> thanks
