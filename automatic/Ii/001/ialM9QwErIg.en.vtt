it is in shade LW 400 in trying it I
wore<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.760> guess<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.359> was<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.719> Vegas<00:01:00.840> when<00:01:01.140> I

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
wore it I guess I was in Vegas when I

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.049 
wore it I guess I was in Vegas when I
bought<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.039> hotter<00:01:02.730> than

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
bought this and so it was hotter than

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.210 
bought this and so it was hotter than
the<00:01:03.390> Dickens<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.350> over<00:01:04.860> 100<00:01:04.979> degrees

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the Dickens there like over 100 degrees

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.390 
the Dickens there like over 100 degrees
just<00:01:05.810> burning<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.650> stayed<00:01:07.920> all<00:01:08.130> day<00:01:08.159> I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
just burning up and it stayed all day I

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.070 
just burning up and it stayed all day I
didn't<00:01:08.790> touch<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.119> thing<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:09.510> once<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.049> I

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
didn't touch this thing up once so I

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.990 
didn't touch this thing up once so I
kind<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.860> put<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> heat<00:01:11.460> test<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
kind of put to the heat test to the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.670 
kind of put to the heat test to the
staying<00:01:12.270> test<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.439> works

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
staying test and it really really works

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.830 
staying test and it really really works
their<00:01:14.490> word<00:01:14.610> wasn't<00:01:15.119> any<00:01:15.240> patchiness<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
their word wasn't any patchiness it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.210 
their word wasn't any patchiness it
didn't<00:01:16.049> melt<00:01:16.140> off<00:01:16.350> some<00:01:16.530> places<00:01:16.770> as<00:01:17.009> opposed

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
didn't melt off some places as opposed

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.770 
didn't melt off some places as opposed
to<00:01:17.340> others<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.880> really<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.330> good<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.689> my

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
to others so it really is good for my

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.679 
to others so it really is good for my
combination<00:01:19.380> skin<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.330> it's<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> really

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
combination skin and it's just a really

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.560 
combination skin and it's just a really
nice<00:01:21.869> consistency<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.619> probably<00:01:23.520> medium<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
nice consistency it's probably medium to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.940 
nice consistency it's probably medium to
fuller<00:01:24.780> coverage<00:01:24.990> which<00:01:25.350> i<00:01:25.470> also<00:01:25.650> like

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
fuller coverage which i also like

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.440 
fuller coverage which i also like

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
it up for you so you can see so i got

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.249 
it up for you so you can see so i got
this<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.270> i<00:01:48.450> knew<00:01:48.659> i<00:01:48.689> had<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> Z<00:01:49.110> palette

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
this because i knew i had a Z palette

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.440 
this because i knew i had a Z palette
but<00:01:49.500> didn't<00:01:49.770> know<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.280> would<00:01:50.460> stick<00:01:51.299> in

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
but didn't know if it would stick in

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.490 
but didn't know if it would stick in
there<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.810> had<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> put<00:01:52.110> magnets<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
there if I had to put magnets on the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.960 
there if I had to put magnets on the
back<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.950> thought<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.280> would<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
back so I thought this would just be the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.760 
back so I thought this would just be the
easiest<00:01:54.299> thing<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.869> got<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.590> five

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
easiest thing so I got this and five

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.679 
easiest thing so I got this and five
shadows<00:01:56.219> come<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.790> find<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.060> how<00:01:57.210> ever<00:01:57.450> they

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
shadows come and find out how ever they

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.230 
shadows come and find out how ever they
fit<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.320> stick<00:01:58.619> really<00:01:58.950> nicely<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.670> Z

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
fit they stick really nicely in Z

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.170 
fit they stick really nicely in Z
pallets<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.659> fact<00:02:00.899> even<00:02:01.500> better<00:02:01.829> than<00:02:02.180> shadows

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
pallets in fact even better than shadows

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.760 
pallets in fact even better than shadows
that<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.360> put<00:02:03.570> magnets<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.320> then<00:02:04.409> stuck<00:02:04.619> in

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
that I put magnets on and then stuck in

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.100 
that I put magnets on and then stuck in
there<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.250> i<00:02:05.490> think<00:02:05.850> i'm<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.570> either<00:02:06.810> end

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
there so i think i'm going to either end

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.930 
there so i think i'm going to either end
up<00:02:07.200> returning<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.649> or<00:02:07.890> i<00:02:08.220> guess<00:02:08.759> maybe

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
up returning this or i guess maybe

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.119 
up returning this or i guess maybe
saving<00:02:09.300> feature<00:02:09.629> shadows<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.379> i<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:11.009> don't

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
saving feature shadows but i just don't

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.680 
saving feature shadows but i just don't
know<00:02:11.220> i<00:02:11.280> don't

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
know i don't

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.840

because<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.360> was<00:02:38.480> traveling<00:02:38.870> with<00:02:38.960> mine<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.140> mean

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
because I was traveling with mine I mean

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.440 
because I was traveling with mine I mean
I<00:02:39.440> got<00:02:39.710> them<00:02:39.950> when<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.430> was<00:02:40.730> at<00:02:40.910> home<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:41.420> I

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
I got them when I was at home and so I

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.270 
I got them when I was at home and so I
brought<00:02:41.660> them<00:02:41.780> back<00:02:41.960> and<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.620> felt<00:02:42.740> like<00:02:42.890> they'd

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
brought them back and I felt like they'd

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.070 
brought them back and I felt like they'd
be<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.460> little<00:02:43.640> safer<00:02:43.970> than<00:02:44.240> traveling<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.840> say

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
be a little safer than traveling in say

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.960 
be a little safer than traveling in say
a<00:02:45.110> pallet<00:02:45.680> or<00:02:45.830> really<00:02:46.520> in<00:02:46.640> any<00:02:46.760> other

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
a pallet or really in any other

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.610 
a pallet or really in any other
packaging<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:47.540> other<00:02:47.750> brands<00:02:48.200> put<00:02:48.410> their

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
packaging that other brands put their

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.380 
packaging that other brands put their
shadows<00:02:49.070> in<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.400> really<00:02:49.760> like<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:49.940> just<00:02:50.270> to

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
shadows in so I really like that just to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.330 
shadows in so I really like that just to
start<00:02:50.600> off<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:51.050> other<00:02:51.710> thing<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:51.980> loved<00:02:52.250> about

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
this was the price for six dollars you

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.350 
this was the price for six dollars you
get<00:02:53.990> 2.5<00:02:54.560> grams<00:02:55.100> of<00:02:55.460> products<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.150> is<00:02:56.330> a

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
get 2.5 grams of products and that is a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.320 
get 2.5 grams of products and that is a
lot<00:02:56.780> like<00:02:57.170> this<00:02:57.320> is<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:58.550> is<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.760> chunky

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
lot like this is a this is a chunky

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.020

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
they're comparable to make a feat which

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.940 
they're comparable to make a feat which
I've<00:03:05.360> never<00:03:05.390> tried<00:03:05.810> but<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.530> colors<00:03:06.920> look

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
I've never tried but the colors look

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.070 
I've never tried but the colors look
very<00:03:07.490> similar<00:03:07.790> I'd<00:03:08.030> actually<00:03:08.270> chose<00:03:08.600> colors<00:03:08.960> i

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
very similar I'd actually chose colors i

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.420 
very similar I'd actually chose colors i
thought<00:03:09.290> were<00:03:09.410> dupes<00:03:09.620> for<00:03:09.710> those<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.160> the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
thought were dupes for those and the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.190 
thought were dupes for those and the
quality<00:03:10.640> seems<00:03:11.000> very<00:03:11.150> nice<00:03:11.360> especially<00:03:11.990> for

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
quality seems very nice especially for

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.420 
quality seems very nice especially for
the<00:03:12.260> colors<00:03:12.560> like<00:03:12.710> they<00:03:12.830> know<00:03:12.950> how<00:03:13.070> to<00:03:13.100> do<00:03:13.310> not

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
the colors like they know how to do not

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.550 
the colors like they know how to do not
only<00:03:13.670> color<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.150> matte<00:03:14.390> colors<00:03:14.810> well<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:15.410> so

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
only color but matte colors well and so

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.199 
only color but matte colors well and so
that's<00:03:15.739> why<00:03:15.980> i<00:03:16.010> thought<00:03:16.340> i<00:03:16.580> would<00:03:17.000> try<00:03:17.120> these

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
that's why i thought i would try these

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.400 
that's why i thought i would try these
at<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.660> because<00:03:17.930> they're<00:03:18.080> just<00:03:18.260> very

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
at is because they're just very

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.110 
at is because they're just very
reasonable<00:03:18.980> compared<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.430> other<00:03:19.610> brands<00:03:20.000> on

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
reasonable compared to other brands on

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.880 
reasonable compared to other brands on
the<00:03:20.150> market<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.350> yelled<00:03:21.560> away<00:03:21.709> for

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
the market so and yelled away for

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.780 
the market so and yelled away for
shipping<00:03:22.070> because<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.370> would<00:03:22.580> have<00:03:22.670> done

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
shipping because I would have done

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.010 
shipping because I would have done
makeup<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.239> shadows<00:03:23.600> because<00:03:23.690> they<00:03:23.840> are<00:03:23.989> very

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
makeup the shadows because they are very

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.260 
makeup the shadows because they are very
reasonable<00:03:24.500> very<00:03:25.220> appealing<00:03:25.489> but<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.180> just

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
reasonable very appealing but I just

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.850 
reasonable very appealing but I just
don't<00:03:26.420> wanna<00:03:26.540> have<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.690> pay<00:03:26.900> for<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.350> wait<00:03:27.560> for

don't wanna have to pay for and wait for

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.280 
don't wanna have to pay for and wait for

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
inner corner and I could not for the

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.490 
inner corner and I could not for the
life<00:04:50.640> of<00:04:50.970> me<00:04:51.030> remember<00:04:51.240> one<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.870> color<00:04:52.080> or<00:04:52.320> two

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
life of me remember one the color or two

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.650 
life of me remember one the color or two
whether<00:04:53.100> it<00:04:53.220> was<00:04:53.250> even<00:04:53.520> an<00:04:53.610> AMC<00:04:53.880> shine<00:04:54.270> or<00:04:54.570> a

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
whether it was even an AMC shine or a

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.360 
whether it was even an AMC shine or a
matte<00:04:54.900> I<00:04:55.140> just<00:04:55.620> couldn't<00:04:55.830> remember<00:04:56.010> so<00:04:56.340> I

matte I just couldn't remember so I

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.100 
matte I just couldn't remember so I
thought<00:04:56.610> this<00:04:57.090> is<00:04:57.150> probably<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.570> safest<00:04:57.750> bet

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
thought this is probably the safest bet

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.930 
thought this is probably the safest bet
because<00:04:58.290> i<00:04:58.440> have<00:04:58.680> a<00:04:58.710> very<00:04:59.010> light<00:04:59.310> color<00:04:59.580> here<00:04:59.910> a

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
because i have a very light color here a

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.430 
because i have a very light color here a
dark<00:05:00.240> color<00:05:00.480> here<00:05:00.720> i<00:05:00.750> can<00:05:00.990> just<00:05:01.110> play<00:05:01.350> with

them<00:05:01.650> all<00:05:01.800> until<00:05:01.980> I<00:05:02.130> get<00:05:02.280> something<00:05:02.490> I<00:05:02.670> like

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880
