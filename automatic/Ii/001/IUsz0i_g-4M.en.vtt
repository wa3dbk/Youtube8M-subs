annoying<00:00:50.700> issue<00:00:54.079> I'll<00:00:55.079> be<00:00:55.320> using<00:00:55.469> this

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
annoying issue I'll be using this

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.080 
annoying issue I'll be using this
program<00:00:56.329> called<00:00:57.329> Nvidia<00:00:57.840> inspector<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.879> go

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
program called Nvidia inspector so go

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.160 
program called Nvidia inspector so go
ahead<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.329> download<00:01:00.840> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
ahead and download it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.229 
ahead and download it
I'll<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.399> leaving<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.760> link<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I'll be leaving a link in the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:41.850 
I'll be leaving a link in the
description<00:01:03.359> below

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.200 

so<00:01:42.860> here<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.220> can<00:01:43.370> change<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.820> frame<00:01:44.150> rate

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
so here you can change the frame rate

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.950 
so here you can change the frame rate
limiter<00:01:45.020> into<00:01:45.790> 60fps<00:01:46.790> I'll<00:01:47.060> be<00:01:47.210> using<00:01:47.330> 60

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
limiter into 60fps I'll be using 60

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.890 
limiter into 60fps I'll be using 60
years<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:49.010> works<00:01:49.370> for<00:01:50.060> me<00:01:50.240> but<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:50.510> can<00:01:50.690> use

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
years that works for me but you can use

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.300 
years that works for me but you can use
58<00:01:51.500> if<00:01:51.710> it's<00:01:52.160> better<00:01:53.920> change<00:01:54.920> triple

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
58 if it's better change triple

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.030 
58 if it's better change triple
buffering<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.940> on<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:56.530> vertical<00:01:57.530> seem<00:01:57.800> to

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
buffering to on and vertical seem to

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:06.790 
buffering to on and vertical seem to
force<00:01:58.490> on<00:02:04.780> now<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.840> just<00:02:06.080> have<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.320> exit<00:02:06.680> this

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
force on now you just have to exit this

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.979 
force on now you just have to exit this
program<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.430> try<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.820> game<00:02:08.119> leave<00:02:08.959> a
