00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:07.830
 test for the exhaust pipe of 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.450
 ventral position of the pulsar 200 ms 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.000
 This is a channel used to test 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.000
 the ability of the bike to wade through water 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.720
 said channel has been filled up to a 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.399
 Depth of 41 centimeters 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.280
 approximately to the knee with the 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:31.940
 intention to replicate a flooded area 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.660
 test 1 ride the motorcycle through the 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.940
 water in this test the motorcycle slips to 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.070
 through the canal full of water to the 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.650
 knees at a speed of 15 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.660
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:50.030
 test 2 idle on the water the pilot 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.740
 goes through water to the knees of 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.020
 has the motorbike leaving the engine at 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.420
 idle for a while and reassemble 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.890
 without any problem 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.990
 Test 3 stop and start in the water the 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.840
 pilot leaves the bike in the water and turns off 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.450
 the engine after a few minutes the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.450
 engine restarts and the march resumes 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.799
 Test 4 standing in the water for 30 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.799
 minutes 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.180
 the pilot leaves the motorcycle in the water and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.180
 turn off the engine 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.890
 the motorcycle remains in water until the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.890
 knees for about 30 minutes 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.540
 then it restarts easily as it 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.690
 can see in all the tests the pulsar 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.210
 200 ms for easily through the water 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.840
 without stopping working under any 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.170
 condition 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.570
 press it to 200 ms is a new bike 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.520
 generation with advanced design 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.259
 technology like the exhaust pipe of 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.509
 ventral position from the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.299
 Exhaust pipe characteristics up 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.940
 his exhausted type technology everything has been 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:13.220
 carefully designed and tested to 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.220
 ensure superior performance
