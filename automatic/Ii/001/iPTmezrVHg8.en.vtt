00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.330
 7 deep-sea bottom fishing wherever it is 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:29.390

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:38.850
 one and two left of the cassette 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.370
 obviously I made the plug for 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.830
 the connection of the electric reel one 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.780
 taking fly we will see in the 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.489
 detail you can buy 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.570
 quietly mail briko also 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:01.110
 the merlin hero is composed of three parts 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.350
 let's see in detail what these are 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:08.820
 share we show what I have 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.780
 put in then the box opens 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.780
 laterally so 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:23.570
 this one above is wanted and had one 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:27.050
 Also this house before a small side 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.080
 then we take off this great one 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.990
 below where of course we have placed the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.390
 battery in these boxes we have 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:45.400
 place the leads that we need here 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.400
 here we take away the boxes 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.600
 as you can see before the battery there is a 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.009
 shelf I created 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.420
 to take advantage of all the remaining space 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:02.200
 with a plexiglass panel and gods 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:04.369
 supports below which is removed of course 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.950
 of the clamps that there were examples 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:12.920
 services removes this lid and we are 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.280
 in direct contact with the battery 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.400
 I put two nice clamps on it and I didn't 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.410
 usual pliers to make them know 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.230
 contact with the battery the wire and not 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:32.770
 make contacts then promised a 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:36.100
 fuse between the positive 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.410
 here's all this additional child that 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.180
 see in a data that the extends it a 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.850
 meter and a half more extractable if we are 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.090
 on a friend's boat and it's not there 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.090
 space 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.590
 we have the possibility to lengthen the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.960
 thread then we have the middle piece 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.120
 is placed can also be used as 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.710
 seat once it has been on the boat 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.600
 friends you can feel calmly 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.040
 over it 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:12.760
 obviously not with the pd but with the ass 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.510
 this opens here I used it 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.660
 for small parts you at your leisure 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:26.380

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.670
 Space-saving boxes are very comfortable 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.000

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.790

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.709

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.709
 unbreakable over 500 meters 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.760
 and this the intermediate piece we see it 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:06.330
 let's see the first piece then 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:09.489
 the first piece is composed of two 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.810
 upper compartments than obviously a lot 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.580

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:26.310
 runway terminal only for failure 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.600
 then we open 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:39.610
 and inside are our terminals 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.970
 above as you can see there is another car 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.350
