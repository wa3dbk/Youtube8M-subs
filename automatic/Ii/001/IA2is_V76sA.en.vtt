 [Applause] 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.210
 This is another personal channel video. 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.770
 Survival in piraquara I am 20 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.330
 Today I'm going to start a sequence of videos. 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:47.800
 who will talk a little about my 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:55.990
 colleagues in my collection see what good it is 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:01:04.839
 different from the rest of him is if he stays 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:08.280
 so it is an opening weapon and 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.280
 closing it is very practical 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:20.829
 the aperture is fully mechanical then the 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:22.329
 The situation of his fault is only to be caught 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:48.030
 some place but there is a problem 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:48.030
 he will never have a mechanic 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:13.270
 a spring that has inside it a 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:16.180
 time and it's special because I bought it 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.880
 a little tougher than the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:27.000
 because most of them do not 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:29.040
 has the quality is so good as well 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.740
 housed when closed inside this 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.540
 disease that they have tested the alamos here 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.840
 the blade is housed when closed 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:49.350
 within these two was open 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:51.330
 the two rooms make up the larger cable 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.870
 even with much more 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.990
 existence of this clip to be placed 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.820
 in the belt advantage of it is that when you 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.920
 ends up putting on the belt 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.790
 only that upper part is close 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:12.000
 to a small part that looks like the 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:18.420
 pants in the normal way of the others 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:23.040
 cars and I ended up customizing it 's a year 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:27.110
 the piano keys and a piece that had 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.110
 hair looks very handsome 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:37.220
 it is composed of the acid at s 8 the same 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.220
 From ivete to 47 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.660
 [Music] 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.789
 the frame acts as a lever and exits 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.129
 of the open belt 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.779
 So I ended up helping so much. 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.549
 Lock did a prototype that is not over 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:53.799
 not working very well 

00:04:51.549 --> 00:05:12.039
 the finger 

00:04:53.799 --> 00:05:34.360
 so hours and was open the smaller more 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:39.969
 practice in practice by a failure 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.619
 mechanics on facebook 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:43.449
