 I told the fast-shop person who did not 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.720
 I was going to open there and I ran the risk of 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.640
 fault on the part of the phone I do not 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.860
 I live right in motorola 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.780
 because when they open they check 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.630
 Do you have any problems, wait for another 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.909
