both double knife techniques the section

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.900 
both double knife techniques the section
places<00:00:16.190> the<00:00:16.309> emphasis<00:00:16.550> on<00:00:17.529> the<00:00:18.910> capital

places the emphasis on the capital
technique<00:00:20.510> the<00:00:20.660> clipping<00:00:21.050> life<00:00:21.200> technique

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
technique the clipping life technique

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.280 
technique the clipping life technique
now<00:00:21.680> some<00:00:22.010> of<00:00:22.279> the<00:00:23.150> people<00:00:23.510> they<00:00:23.750> perform<00:00:24.140> it

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
now some of the people they perform it

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.010 
now some of the people they perform it
like<00:00:24.439> this<00:00:24.730> in<00:00:25.730> front<00:00:26.119> of<00:00:26.270> the<00:00:26.390> face<00:00:28.750> yet<00:00:29.750> every

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
like this in front of the face yet every

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.800 
like this in front of the face yet every
language<00:00:30.230> has<00:00:30.439> its<00:00:30.650> own<00:00:31.630> interpretation<00:00:32.630> and

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
language has its own interpretation and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.840 
language has its own interpretation and
explanation<00:00:33.880> so<00:00:34.880> in<00:00:35.810> my<00:00:36.739> in<00:00:37.040> my<00:00:37.070> humble

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
explanation so in my in my humble

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.290 
explanation so in my in my humble
opinion<00:00:38.680> this<00:00:39.680> is<00:00:39.890> not<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.190> best<00:00:40.340> way<00:00:40.609> to<00:00:40.879> do

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
opinion this is not the best way to do

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.619 
opinion this is not the best way to do
it<00:00:41.420> that<00:00:41.449> after<00:00:42.520> I've<00:00:43.520> also<00:00:43.730> also<00:00:44.180> important

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
it that after I've also also important

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.250 
it that after I've also also important
to<00:00:44.750> note<00:00:44.930> on<00:00:45.109> the<00:00:45.230> side<00:00:45.469> note<00:00:45.680> that<00:00:46.430> this<00:00:47.260> kept

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
to note on the side note that this kept

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.080 
to note on the side note that this kept
all<00:00:48.519> taking<00:00:49.519> actually<00:00:50.449> device<00:00:50.840> against<00:00:51.230> a

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
all taking actually device against a

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.569 
all taking actually device against a
pole<00:00:53.090> of<00:00:53.269> this<00:00:53.449> length<00:00:53.769> so<00:00:54.769> not<00:00:55.010> against<00:00:55.460> a

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
pole of this length so not against a

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.110 
pole of this length so not against a
very<00:00:56.030> very<00:00:56.590> long<00:00:57.760> weapon<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:59.000> very<00:00:59.210> long<00:00:59.480> pole

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
very very long weapon the very long pole

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.640 
very very long weapon the very long pole
for<00:01:02.120> death<00:01:02.589> weapon<00:01:03.589> we<00:01:04.280> needed<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.879> eight

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
for death weapon we needed the eight

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.399 
for death weapon we needed the eight
section<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:07.810> sub-zero<00:01:08.890> so<00:01:10.750> when<00:01:11.750> they

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
section the sub-zero so when they

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.480 
section the sub-zero so when they
perform<00:01:12.829> it<00:01:12.920> like<00:01:13.070> this

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
perform it like this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.850 
perform it like this
will<00:01:13.759> be<00:01:13.909> very<00:01:14.119> hard<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.600> stop<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.710> incoming

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
will be very hard to stop the incoming

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.980 
will be very hard to stop the incoming
thrust<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.970> in<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.090> application<00:01:20.659> they<00:01:20.780> most

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
thrust so in the application they most

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.660 
thrust so in the application they most
into<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.500> side<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:21.950> why<00:01:22.100> do<00:01:22.159> it<00:01:22.430> in<00:01:22.579> the

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
into to the side so why do it in the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.850 
into to the side so why do it in the
form<00:01:22.880> like<00:01:22.939> this<00:01:23.210> right<00:01:24.369> so<00:01:25.369> it<00:01:25.549> should<00:01:25.820> be<00:01:26.860> to

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
form like this right so it should be to

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.010 
form like this right so it should be to
the<00:01:28.009> side<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.140> then<00:01:30.460> going<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:31.549> little<00:01:31.790> bit

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
the side and then going a little bit

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.310 
the side and then going a little bit
gets<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.950> weapon<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:35.060> when<00:01:35.270> when<00:01:35.780> he<00:01:35.810> comes<00:01:36.140> in

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
gets the weapon so when when he comes in

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.560 
gets the weapon so when when he comes in
with<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.770> slide<00:01:37.870> and<00:01:38.870> kitchen<00:01:39.350> values<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:41.390> now

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
with a slide and kitchen values and now

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.990 
with a slide and kitchen values and now
I<00:01:41.900> use<00:01:42.530> I<00:01:43.600> put<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.750> pressure<00:01:45.080> on<00:01:45.430> so<00:01:46.430> I<00:01:46.460> feel

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
I use I put the pressure on so I feel

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.250 
I use I put the pressure on so I feel
when<00:01:47.780> he<00:01:48.560> retreats<00:01:49.130> his<00:01:49.340> weapon<00:01:49.790> i<00:01:49.970> slided<00:01:50.870> him

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
when he retreats his weapon i slided him

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.680 
when he retreats his weapon i slided him
my<00:01:52.040> first<00:01:52.870> one<00:01:53.870> goes<00:01:54.260> to<00:01:54.410> his<00:01:54.530> hand<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.480> I<00:01:56.480> cut

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
my first one goes to his hand and I cut

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.940 
my first one goes to his hand and I cut
the<00:01:56.840> him<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.740> second<00:01:58.130> one<00:01:58.280> goes<00:01:59.090> in<00:01:59.300> his<00:01:59.390> neck

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
the him the second one goes in his neck

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.990 
the him the second one goes in his neck
and<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.160> chop<00:02:01.460> down<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.600> cut<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:04.580> then<00:02:04.880> I

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
and so I chop down and cut and then I

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.920 
and so I chop down and cut and then I
can<00:02:05.210> switch<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.110> blades<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:08.479> cut<00:02:10.510> worse<00:02:11.510> for

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
can switch the blades and cut worse for

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.000 
can switch the blades and cut worse for
walk<00:02:12.140> with<00:02:12.620> whatever<00:02:12.800> happen<00:02:13.510> actually<00:02:15.010> you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
walk with whatever happen actually you

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.120 
walk with whatever happen actually you
should<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.790> should<00:02:16.820> drain<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.830> very<00:02:18.830> lightly

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
should you should drain it very lightly

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.600 
should you should drain it very lightly
and<00:02:19.580> in<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.560> function<00:02:21.560> wages<00:02:21.920> we<00:02:22.070> should<00:02:22.340> really

and in a function wages we should really

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.390 
and in a function wages we should really
