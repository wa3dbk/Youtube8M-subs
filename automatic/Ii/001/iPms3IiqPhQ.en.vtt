whatever but there are more intelligent
ways<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.030> selections<00:00:45.450> than<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.079> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
ways to do selections than that you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.270 
ways to do selections than that you
might<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.559> seen<00:00:46.649> me<00:00:46.770> doing<00:00:46.980> them<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> little

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
might have seen me doing them a little

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.729 
might have seen me doing them a little
bit<00:00:47.370> already<00:00:47.960> one<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.079> them<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> most

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
bit already one of them and the most

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.369 
bit already one of them and the most
straightforward<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.430> what<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.199> light<00:00:52.199> wave

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
straightforward is what the light wave

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.560 
straightforward is what the light wave
has<00:00:52.590> basically<00:00:53.520> designated<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> entire

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
has basically designated the entire

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.510 
has basically designated the entire
right<00:00:54.840> mouse<00:00:55.020> button<00:00:55.350> simply<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.070> process

right mouse button simply to the process

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.450 
right mouse button simply to the process
of<00:00:56.579> doing<00:00:56.699> selections<00:00:57.329> by<00:00:57.840> holding<00:00:58.710> down<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
of doing selections by holding down the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.819 
of doing selections by holding down the
right<00:00:59.760> mouse<00:00:59.820> button<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.930> start<00:01:01.620> drawing

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
right mouse button you start drawing

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.000 
right mouse button you start drawing
this<00:01:02.100> lasso<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.879> will<00:01:03.059> select<00:01:03.830> whatever<00:01:04.830> is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
this lasso that will select whatever is

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.390 
this lasso that will select whatever is
in<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.960> don't<00:01:07.439> connect<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.189> eds

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
in it and if you don't connect the eds

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.730 
in it and if you don't connect the eds
the<00:01:09.210> ends<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.630> they<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.229> connect<00:01:10.500> across

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the ends of it they will connect across

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.420 
the ends of it they will connect across
right<00:01:12.439> right<00:01:13.439> now<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.710> polygon<00:01:14.100> mode<00:01:14.250> so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
right right now in polygon mode so

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.039 
right right now in polygon mode so
obvious<00:01:14.640> I'm<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.850> selecting<00:01:14.939> volume<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
obvious I'm just selecting volume if I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.010 
obvious I'm just selecting volume if I
was<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.259> points<00:01:16.500> mode<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.920> would<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.520> selecting

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
was in points mode I would be selecting

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.380 
was in points mode I would be selecting
points<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.770> right<00:01:20.490> click<00:01:20.729> will<00:01:21.060> let<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.270> do

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
points but right click will let you do

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.359 
points but right click will let you do
that<00:01:21.509> kind<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.689> thing<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.100> gets<00:01:23.220> even

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
that kind of thing but it gets even

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.260 
that kind of thing but it gets even
better<00:01:24.650> it's<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.950> smooth<00:01:28.729> if<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.880> select

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
better it's going to smooth if I select

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.740 
better it's going to smooth if I select
two<00:01:30.799> adjacent<00:01:31.799> polygons<00:01:32.450> what<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:33.659> have

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
two adjacent polygons what I will have

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.940 
two adjacent polygons what I will have
done<00:01:33.930> there<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:35.000> selected<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:37.290> beginning<00:01:37.770> of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
done there is selected the beginning of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.510 
done there is selected the beginning of
a<00:01:38.250> direction<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.299> know<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.340> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
a direction you know this one going that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.730 
a direction you know this one going that
direction<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:42.479> instance<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.619> hit

direction for instance and if I just hit
the<00:01:43.860> right<00:01:44.070> arrow<00:01:44.369> key<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.840> selects<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> ring

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the right arrow key it selects the ring

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.870 
the right arrow key it selects the ring
that's<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.820> selection<00:01:48.270> its<00:01:49.110> select<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.100> loop

looper that can it's gonna stop here

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.830 
looper that can it's gonna stop here
because<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.829> one<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:07.979> those<00:02:08.099> globe

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
because this is one of those globe

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.050 
because this is one of those globe
spheres<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.050> know<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:11.039> going<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.310> it

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
spheres you know and it's going to it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.830 
spheres you know and it's going to it
can't<00:02:12.360> go<00:02:12.599> past<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.080> point<00:02:13.290> because<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.650> does

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
can't go past that point because it does

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.030 
can't go past that point because it does
know<00:02:13.959> exactly<00:02:14.290> where<00:02:14.470> mine's<00:02:14.650> been<00:02:14.769> going

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
know exactly where mine's been going

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.420 
know exactly where mine's been going
after<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:16.120> as<00:02:16.330> long<00:02:16.480> as<00:02:16.510> there's<00:02:16.750> quads

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
after that but as long as there's quads

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.509 
after that but as long as there's quads
and<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.819> said<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.620> it'll<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:21.220> know<00:02:21.310> give<00:02:21.459> me

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
and I said that it'll you know give me

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.809 
and I said that it'll you know give me
then<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.970> won't<00:02:22.090> work<00:02:22.209> like<00:02:22.599> this<00:02:23.819> because

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
then it won't work like this because

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.240 
then it won't work like this because
it's<00:02:24.970> not<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.569> know<00:02:25.660> setting<00:02:26.470> an

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
it's not you know setting an

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.130 
it's not you know setting an
edge-to-edge<00:02:27.550> direction<00:02:28.480> for<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.840> selection

I could hit T dragging this guy over
here<00:03:09.579> go<00:03:09.879> back<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.150> create<00:03:10.510> make<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.780> new<00:03:10.930> ball

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
here go back to create make a new ball

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.800 
here go back to create make a new ball
and<00:03:11.410> enter<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.370> know<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.760> have<00:03:12.910> two<00:03:13.030> balls<00:03:13.180> these

are this continuous objects they are

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.780 
are this continuous objects they are
both<00:03:17.260> in<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.680> city<00:03:17.889> if<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:18.040> save<00:03:18.310> this<00:03:18.489> as<00:03:18.670> an

both in the city if I save this as an
object<00:03:18.910> they<00:03:19.239> both<00:03:19.450> be<00:03:19.870> in<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.260> same<00:03:20.440> object

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.069 
object they both be in the same object
but<00:03:20.920> they're<00:03:21.190> not<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.880> know<00:03:21.989> touching<00:03:22.989> each

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
but they're not you know touching each

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.520 
but they're not you know touching each
other<00:03:23.230> they're<00:03:23.410> not<00:03:23.440> contiguous<00:03:23.859> however<00:03:25.530> at

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
other they're not contiguous however at

other they're not contiguous however at
the<00:03:26.680> end<00:03:26.769> of<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:26.889> day<00:03:27.010> they<00:03:27.340> are<00:03:27.370> still<00:03:27.910> both

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
the end of the day they are still both

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.690 
the end of the day they are still both
objects<00:03:28.930> in<00:03:29.079> a<00:03:29.200> Lightwave<00:03:29.530> world<00:03:29.829> so<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.370> could

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
objects in a Lightwave world so I could

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.390 
objects in a Lightwave world so I could
do<00:03:30.790> things<00:03:31.000> like<00:03:31.120> this<00:03:31.450> let's<00:03:32.139> say<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.889> want<00:03:33.340> to

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
do things like this let's say I want to

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.920 
do things like this let's say I want to
get<00:03:33.459> in<00:03:33.579> there<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:33.910> connect<00:03:34.359> these<00:03:34.569> two

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
get in there and connect these two

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.050 
get in there and connect these two
polygons<00:03:35.920> right<00:03:37.019> when<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.190> select<00:03:39.190> a<00:03:39.400> polygon

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
polygons right when I select a polygon

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.330 
polygons right when I select a polygon
or<00:03:40.450> two<00:03:40.840> polygons<00:03:41.290> or<00:03:41.440> any<00:03:41.620> group<00:03:41.829> of<00:03:41.920> polygons

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
or two polygons or any group of polygons

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.699 
or two polygons or any group of polygons
and<00:03:42.549> then<00:03:42.910> hit<00:03:43.090> shift<00:03:43.359> a<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.989> zooms<00:03:44.319> to<00:03:44.560> just

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
and then hit shift a it zooms to just

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.229 
and then hit shift a it zooms to just
those<00:03:44.829> two<00:03:45.040> like<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.459> Viking<00:03:45.790> or<00:03:45.849> select<00:03:46.120> that

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
those two like a Viking or select that

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.750 
those two like a Viking or select that
guy<00:03:46.389> in<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.540> gun<00:03:46.840> shift<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.769> just<00:03:48.400> drags<00:03:48.579> me

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
guy in that gun shift a just drags me

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.229 
guy in that gun shift a just drags me
into<00:03:48.880> whether<00:03:49.150> front<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.109> center<00:03:51.000> say<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.060> want

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
into whether front and center say I want

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.729 
into whether front and center say I want
to<00:03:52.299> you<00:03:52.569> know<00:03:52.660> connect<00:03:52.989> a<00:03:53.049> couple<00:03:53.139> these<00:03:53.319> faces

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
to you know connect a couple these faces

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
know in the right area and I'm gonna

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.020 
know in the right area and I'm gonna
just<00:03:59.230> gonna<00:03:59.319> delete<00:03:59.590> them<00:03:59.919> just<00:04:00.849> straight

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
just gonna delete them just straight

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.530 
just gonna delete them just straight
delete<00:04:01.329> them<00:04:01.540> what<00:04:02.470> I<00:04:02.500> can<00:04:02.680> do<00:04:02.769> now<00:04:02.919> is<00:04:03.540> select

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
delete them what I can do now is select

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.659 
delete them what I can do now is select
the<00:04:04.840> points<00:04:05.200> at<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.590> top<00:04:05.799> here<00:04:06.040> like<00:04:06.280> this<00:04:06.430> one

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
the points at the top here like this one

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.229 
the points at the top here like this one
in<00:04:07.060> this<00:04:07.239> one<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:08.769> then<00:04:08.980> this<00:04:09.609> one<00:04:09.669> in<00:04:10.090> this

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
in this one and then this one in this

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.819 
in this one and then this one in this
one<00:04:10.450> they<00:04:10.720> peek<00:04:11.109> like<00:04:11.349> I<00:04:11.440> told<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:11.709> about

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
one they peek like I told you about

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.409 
one they peek like I told you about
though<00:04:12.069> just<00:04:12.489> making<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:12.940> polygon<00:04:13.269> of<00:04:13.359> the

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
though just making the polygon of the

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.120 
though just making the polygon of the
points<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.959> I<00:04:14.410> can<00:04:14.530> actually<00:04:14.769> connect<00:04:15.010> them

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
points and I can actually connect them

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:22.530 
points and I can actually connect them
and<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:17.620> one

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.520 

that<00:04:23.260> one<00:04:23.470> P<00:04:23.830> now<00:04:24.730> there's<00:04:24.910> a<00:04:24.940> polygon<00:04:25.240> there

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
that one P now there's a polygon there

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.720 
that one P now there's a polygon there
but<00:04:26.530> it's<00:04:26.650> facing<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.040> wrong<00:04:27.160> way<00:04:27.220> remember<00:04:27.580> I

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
but it's facing the wrong way remember I

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.310 
but it's facing the wrong way remember I
told<00:04:27.850> you<00:04:27.970> they<00:04:28.090> only<00:04:28.210> go<00:04:28.330> one<00:04:28.480> way<00:04:28.510> hit

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
told you they only go one way hit

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.420 
told you they only go one way hit
spacebar<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.740> couple<00:04:29.920> of<00:04:29.980> times<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.220> get<00:04:30.280> into

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
spacebar a couple of times to get into

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.640 
spacebar a couple of times to get into
polygon<00:04:30.730> mode<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:31.990> can<00:04:32.050> see<00:04:32.140> that<00:04:32.380> there

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
polygon mode and you can see that there

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.230 
polygon mode and you can see that there
is<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.770> polygon<00:04:33.160> it's<00:04:33.430> already<00:04:33.700> selected<00:04:33.910> it's

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
is a polygon it's already selected it's

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.820 
is a polygon it's already selected it's
just<00:04:34.360> facing<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:34.720> runway<00:04:34.990> hit<00:04:35.230> have<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.650> flip

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
just facing the runway hit have to flip

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.730 
just facing the runway hit have to flip
it<00:04:35.980> and<00:04:36.390> I<00:04:37.390> can<00:04:37.540> actually<00:04:37.870> build<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.650> know

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
it and I can actually build you know

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.110 
it and I can actually build you know
this<00:04:38.890> connective<00:04:39.280> tissue<00:04:39.430> between<00:04:39.610> them<00:04:39.970> in

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
this connective tissue between them in

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.260 
this connective tissue between them in
that<00:04:40.270> way<00:04:40.440> let<00:04:41.440> me<00:04:41.470> knock<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:41.770> out<00:04:41.890> real<00:04:42.100> quick

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
that way let me knock it out real quick

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.680 
that way let me knock it out real quick
and<00:04:43.270> I'll<00:04:43.360> show<00:04:43.510> you<00:04:43.540> one<00:04:43.750> other<00:04:43.840> cool<00:04:44.110> thing

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
and I'll show you one other cool thing

00:04:45.690 --> 00:05:00.660 
and I'll show you one other cool thing
mode<00:04:57.420> yeah<00:04:58.420> another<00:04:59.260> connector<00:05:00.010> and<00:05:00.160> if<00:05:00.430> I<00:05:00.520> hit

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
mode yeah another connector and if I hit

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.770 
mode yeah another connector and if I hit
tab<00:05:00.730> it<00:05:01.270> will<00:05:02.020> turn<00:05:02.650> ArchiCAD<00:05:03.010> user<00:05:03.750> it<00:05:04.750> will

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
tab it will turn ArchiCAD user it will

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.560 
tab it will turn ArchiCAD user it will
actually<00:05:05.380> you<00:05:06.190> know<00:05:06.250> what's<00:05:07.150> happening<00:05:07.510> with

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
actually you know what's happening with

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.470 
actually you know what's happening with
the<00:05:07.630> sub<00:05:07.870> D<00:05:08.050> is<00:05:09.060> intelligent<00:05:10.060> it's<00:05:10.180> actually

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
the sub D is intelligent it's actually

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.970 
the sub D is intelligent it's actually
smoothing<00:05:10.840> it<00:05:10.930> out<00:05:10.990> between<00:05:11.260> them<00:05:11.470> which<00:05:11.860> is

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
smoothing it out between them which is

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.590 
smoothing it out between them which is
pretty<00:05:12.070> cool<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.700> if<00:05:13.090> you<00:05:13.210> were<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.390> start

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
pretty cool and if you were to start

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.870 
pretty cool and if you were to start
dragging<00:05:14.140> polygons<00:05:14.740> around<00:05:14.890> in<00:05:15.250> sub<00:05:15.520> D<00:05:15.670> mode

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
dragging polygons around in sub D mode

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.230 
dragging polygons around in sub D mode
know<00:05:16.870> right<00:05:17.050> now<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:18.460> change<00:05:18.730> is<00:05:18.880> also<00:05:19.000> going

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
know right now the change is also going

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.930 
know right now the change is also going
to<00:05:19.300> be<00:05:19.360> in<00:05:19.720> sub<00:05:20.290> D<00:05:20.440> mode<00:05:20.650> now<00:05:21.190> of<00:05:21.280> course<00:05:21.430> if<00:05:21.820> I

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
to be in sub D mode now of course if I

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.940 
to be in sub D mode now of course if I
go<00:05:22.030> out<00:05:22.150> of<00:05:22.300> sub<00:05:22.420> D<00:05:22.570> it<00:05:23.440> just<00:05:23.680> looks<00:05:23.830> like<00:05:23.860> that

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
go out of sub D it just looks like that

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.120 
go out of sub D it just looks like that
but<00:05:24.760> just<00:05:25.630> coolness<00:05:26.050> and<00:05:26.260> stuff<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:26.710> might

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
but just coolness and stuff you might

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.090 
but just coolness and stuff you might
have<00:05:28.170> gotten<00:05:29.170> to<00:05:29.320> anyway<00:05:29.590> but<00:05:29.770> it's<00:05:29.980> not

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
have gotten to anyway but it's not

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.800 
have gotten to anyway but it's not
assure<00:05:30.340> you<00:05:30.460> but<00:05:30.790> that's<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.330> selection

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
assure you but that's the selection

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.300 
assure you but that's the selection
that's<00:05:32.080> that's<00:05:32.350> how<00:05:32.470> selection<00:05:32.860> stuff<00:05:33.070> works

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
that's that's how selection stuff works

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.310 
that's that's how selection stuff works
now<00:05:33.760> I<00:05:34.030> said<00:05:34.690> I<00:05:34.720> was<00:05:34.840> gonna<00:05:34.960> tell<00:05:35.140> you<00:05:35.170> about

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
now I said I was gonna tell you about

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.530 
now I said I was gonna tell you about
dealing<00:05:36.190> with<00:05:36.280> multiple<00:05:36.520> objects<00:05:37.180> at<00:05:37.330> once

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
dealing with multiple objects at once

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.540 
dealing with multiple objects at once
this<00:05:37.960> is<00:05:38.140> one<00:05:38.320> thing<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.740> can<00:05:38.890> you<00:05:39.070> know<00:05:39.160> have

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
this is one thing you can you know have

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.980 
this is one thing you can you know have
as<00:05:39.700> many<00:05:39.820> things<00:05:40.060> floating<00:05:40.390> around<00:05:40.540> in<00:05:40.810> one

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
as many things floating around in one

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.900 
as many things floating around in one
layer<00:05:41.530> as<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:41.800> want<00:05:42.100> but<00:05:42.250> there<00:05:42.370> are<00:05:42.520> multiple

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
layer as you want but there are multiple

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:43.710 
layer as you want but there are multiple
layers<00:05:43.030> in<00:05:43.330> light-weight

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
layers in light-weight

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.410 
layers in light-weight
it's<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:45.250> effects<00:05:45.610> in<00:05:45.730> my<00:05:45.790> least<00:05:46.030> favorite

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
it's the effects in my least favorite

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.910 
it's the effects in my least favorite
part<00:05:46.600> about<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:46.960> way<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.200> user<00:05:47.500> interface<00:05:47.800> is

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
part about the way the user interface is

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.770
