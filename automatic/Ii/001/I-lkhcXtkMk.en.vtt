install it so what we're gonna do first

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.610 
install it so what we're gonna do first
with<00:00:38.309> disable<00:00:38.910> antivirus<00:00:39.350> why<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.410> we

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
with disable antivirus why are we

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.850 
with disable antivirus why are we
disabling<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> antivirus<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> lot<00:00:42.329> of

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
disabling the antivirus is a lot of

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.619 
disabling the antivirus is a lot of
Bitcoin<00:00:43.860> mining<00:00:44.370> software<00:00:44.610> pretty<00:00:45.360> much<00:00:45.450> all

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
Bitcoin mining software pretty much all

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.119 
Bitcoin mining software pretty much all
Bitcoin<00:00:46.020> mining<00:00:46.320> software<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.710> comes<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
Bitcoin mining software it comes up as a

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.139 
Bitcoin mining software it comes up as a
virus<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> reason<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
virus so and the reason for that is a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.750 
virus so and the reason for that is a
lot<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.570> botnets<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.440> virus<00:00:52.710> makers<00:00:53.039> embed

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
lot of botnets and virus makers embed

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.029 
lot of botnets and virus makers embed
that<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.090> their<00:00:54.210> software<00:00:54.660> but<00:00:55.410> because<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
that in their software but because you

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.479 
that in their software but because you
know<00:00:56.070> your<00:00:56.489> your<00:00:57.199> altcoin<00:00:58.199> mining<00:00:58.620> or<00:00:59.129> mining

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
know your your altcoin mining or mining

for memory coins we're gonna need to

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.950 
for memory coins we're gonna need to

disable that if you're ever testing

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.299 
disable that if you're ever testing
software<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.439> you're<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.799> sure<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.420 
should see a zero balance this is I've
already<00:01:50.840> mined<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> software<00:01:52.530> half<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
already mined with a software half a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.630 
already mined with a software half a
coin<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:53.970> that's<00:01:54.149> what<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> we're

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
coin so that's what that is so we're

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760 
coin so that's what that is so we're

same steps that we just did here but
instead<00:04:35.950> you're<00:04:36.910> just<00:04:37.120> choosing<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.720> different

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
instead you're just choosing a different

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.300 
instead you're just choosing a different
wallet<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:39.060> choose<00:04:40.060> that<00:04:40.240> different<00:04:40.600> coin

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
wallet and choose that different coin

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.800 
wallet and choose that different coin
the<00:04:42.310> last<00:04:42.610> thing<00:04:42.850> we<00:04:42.940> want<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.150> do<00:04:43.330> which<00:04:43.660> is
