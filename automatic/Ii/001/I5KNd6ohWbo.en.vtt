00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.690 
to be more active than what we saw
yesterday<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.960> i<00:01:08.229> would<00:01:08.350> estimate<00:01:08.439> as<00:01:09.399> far<00:01:09.579> as

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
yesterday and i would estimate as far as

yesterday and i would estimate as far as
any<00:01:09.820> movement<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.540> it<00:01:10.630> moved<00:01:10.810> north<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.920> the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
any movement and it moved north is the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.149 
any movement and it moved north is the
lower<00:01:13.360> of<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.690> two<00:01:13.870> breakouts<00:01:14.590> it<00:01:14.800> was<00:01:14.950> about

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
lower of the two breakouts it was about

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.990 
lower of the two breakouts it was about
200<00:01:15.670> yards<00:01:16.260> since<00:01:17.260> yesterday<00:01:17.800> morning<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.880> we

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
200 yards since yesterday morning so we

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.030 
200 yards since yesterday morning so we
are<00:01:19.120> seeing<00:01:19.390> some<00:01:19.600> activity<00:01:19.750> upslope<00:01:20.470> that<00:01:20.890> is

those breakouts behave and if they

those breakouts behave and if they
appear<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:42.490> maybe<00:01:44.490> take<00:01:45.490> one<00:01:45.909> of<00:01:46.030> those<00:01:46.090> paths

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
appear to maybe take one of those paths

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.210 
appear to maybe take one of those paths
and<00:01:46.780> where<00:01:46.960> that<00:01:47.140> path<00:01:47.320> might<00:01:47.619> be<00:01:47.740> coming<00:01:48.070> down

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
and where that path might be coming down

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.700 
and where that path might be coming down
too<00:01:48.510> we<00:01:49.510> also<00:01:49.630> saw<00:01:49.900> a<00:01:49.930> breakout<00:01:50.350> on<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
too we also saw a breakout on the

too we also saw a breakout on the

now as far as any activity with respect

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.340 
now as far as any activity with respect
to<00:01:59.710> the<00:02:00.280> downslope<00:02:00.790> communities<00:02:01.510> we're

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
to the downslope communities we're

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.060 
to the downslope communities we're
looking<00:02:02.650> at<00:02:02.799> about<00:02:03.659> 1.5<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.960> 2<00:02:05.140> miles<00:02:05.409> above

looking at about 1.5 to 2 miles above

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.589 
looking at about 1.5 to 2 miles above
the<00:02:08.220> marketplace<00:02:09.220> area<00:02:09.429> where<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.179> breakouts

the marketplace area where the breakouts

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.839 
the marketplace area where the breakouts
add<00:02:10.869> so<00:02:11.230> we're<00:02:11.769> going<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:11.950> be<00:02:12.069> sitting<00:02:12.670> down

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
add so we're going to be sitting down

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.970 
add so we're going to be sitting down
and<00:02:13.030> discussing<00:02:13.120> with<00:02:13.750> dr.<00:02:14.499> Jim<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.799> Steve

they usually start these you know it may
become<00:04:08.180> another<00:04:08.540> branch<00:04:08.870> on<00:04:09.139> to<00:04:09.230> this<00:04:09.350> flow

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
become another branch on to this flow

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.460 
become another branch on to this flow
fed<00:04:09.950> by<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.160> same<00:04:10.489> tube<00:04:10.819> that<00:04:11.120> seems<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.600> logo

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
fed by the same tube that seems the logo

enjoyed<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.829> marketplace<00:04:13.299> yeah<00:04:14.299> there's

enjoyed the marketplace yeah there's

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.090 
enjoyed the marketplace yeah there's
still<00:04:14.720> breakouts<00:04:15.200> happening<00:04:15.650> downslope

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
still breakouts happening downslope

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.129

closer<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.760> front<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.209> piers<00:04:17.450> that's

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
closer to the front and the piers that's

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.870 
closer to the front and the piers that's
correct<00:04:18.350> it's<00:04:18.859> possible<00:04:19.280> that<00:04:19.430> both<00:04:19.549> branches

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
correct it's possible that both branches

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.650 
correct it's possible that both branches
could<00:04:20.239> remain<00:04:20.720> active<00:04:21.109> at<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:21.229> same<00:04:21.320> time
