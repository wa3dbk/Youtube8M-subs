00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
be able to get away from them even if

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.010 
be able to get away from them even if
your<00:02:04.950> poke<00:02:05.159> check<00:02:05.460> would<00:02:06.000> hit<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.509> puck<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
your poke check would hit the puck and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.540 
your poke check would hit the puck and
actually<00:02:07.380> go<00:02:07.560> through<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.129> our<00:02:08.250> players

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
stick it didn't married the Pope was

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.530 
stick it didn't married the Pope was
still<00:02:11.039> gonna<00:02:11.220> stand<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.730> guy<00:02:11.910> stick<00:02:12.330> it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
still gonna stand that guy stick it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.300 
still gonna stand that guy stick it
didn't<00:02:12.840> matter

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
didn't matter

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.430 
didn't matter
but<00:02:13.580> in<00:02:13.640> this<00:02:13.760> game<00:02:13.910> if<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.690> poke<00:02:14.959> check<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
but in this game if you poke check the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.870 
but in this game if you poke check the
puck<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.830> your<00:02:15.950> stick<00:02:16.190> touches<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.700> puck

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
puck and your stick touches the puck

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.449 
puck and your stick touches the puck
you're<00:02:17.450> set<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:18.170> puck<00:02:18.410> will<00:02:18.590> add<00:02:18.739> remove<00:02:19.190> and

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
you're set the puck will add remove and

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.100 
you're set the puck will add remove and
that's<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:19.940> really<00:02:20.209> big<00:02:20.390> improvement<00:02:20.989> that

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
that's a really big improvement that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.110 
that's a really big improvement that
will<00:02:21.230> make<00:02:21.380> this<00:02:21.530> game<00:02:21.770> way<00:02:22.280> more<00:02:22.790> better<00:02:22.970> than

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
will make this game way more better than

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.930 
will make this game way more better than
NHL<00:02:23.599> 12<00:02:23.870> ok<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.770> next<00:02:24.800> thing<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.370> like<00:02:25.640> that

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
NHL 12 ok the next thing I like that

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.780 
NHL 12 ok the next thing I like that
really<00:02:26.360> wasn't<00:02:26.810> needed<00:02:27.319> in<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:27.770> game<00:02:28.040> it's<00:02:28.340> a

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
really wasn't needed in this game it's a

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.120 
really wasn't needed in this game it's a
new<00:02:28.940> replay<00:02:29.540> feature<00:02:29.930> they<00:02:30.200> have<00:02:30.410> it's<00:02:30.890> called

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
new replay feature they have it's called

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.370 
new replay feature they have it's called
like<00:02:31.310> replay<00:02:31.910> live<00:02:32.209> or<00:02:32.420> something<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:32.959> what

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
like replay live or something and what

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.280 
like replay live or something and what
it<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:34.180> let's<00:02:35.180> say<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.510> goalie<00:02:35.750> covers<00:02:36.140> up

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
it is is let's say the goalie covers up

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.290 
it is is let's say the goalie covers up
the<00:02:36.319> puck<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.860> there's<00:02:37.519> a<00:02:37.580> whistle<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.150> then

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
the puck and there's a whistle and then

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.210 
the puck and there's a whistle and then
the<00:02:38.630> camera<00:02:39.080> will<00:02:39.260> show<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.650> goalie<00:02:39.890> doing

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
the camera will show the goalie doing

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.440 
the camera will show the goalie doing
something<00:02:40.519> like<00:02:40.610> drinking<00:02:40.970> his<00:02:41.060> water<00:02:41.209> bottle

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
something like drinking his water bottle

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.790 
something like drinking his water bottle
or<00:02:41.599> something<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.050> if<00:02:42.410> you're<00:02:42.590> in<00:02:42.709> the

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
the main thing I dislike about this game

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.820 
the main thing I dislike about this game
is<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:05.120> passing<00:05:05.690> I<00:05:05.870> really<00:05:06.350> wish<00:05:06.470> they<00:05:06.680> would

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
is the passing I really wish they would

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.550 
is the passing I really wish they would
just<00:05:06.860> love<00:05:07.190> to<00:05:07.250> passing<00:05:07.790> how<00:05:07.910> it<00:05:08.030> was<00:05:08.210> um<00:05:08.570> maybe

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
just love to passing how it was um maybe

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.870 
just love to passing how it was um maybe
I'm<00:05:09.770> just<00:05:09.890> not<00:05:10.010> used<00:05:10.130> to<00:05:10.430> it<00:05:10.520> for<00:05:10.700> some<00:05:10.850> reason

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
I'm just not used to it for some reason

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.880 
I'm just not used to it for some reason
maybe<00:05:11.270> it<00:05:11.480> is<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.690> same<00:05:11.990> but<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.680> me<00:05:12.770> the

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
maybe it is the same but to me the

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.320 
maybe it is the same but to me the
passing<00:05:13.340> in<00:05:13.400> this<00:05:13.550> game<00:05:13.760> seems<00:05:14.000> way<00:05:14.300> more

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
passing in this game seems way more

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.240 
passing in this game seems way more
difficult<00:05:14.750> but<00:05:15.500> maybe<00:05:15.710> it's<00:05:15.890> something<00:05:16.070> I

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
difficult but maybe it's something I

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.700 
difficult but maybe it's something I
just<00:05:16.460> got<00:05:16.610> you<00:05:16.760> used<00:05:16.970> to<00:05:17.150> like<00:05:17.630> I<00:05:17.780> think<00:05:18.110> after

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
just got you used to like I think after

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.200 
just got you used to like I think after
a<00:05:18.740> while<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:19.010> will<00:05:19.280> get<00:05:19.640> used<00:05:19.790> to<00:05:19.880> when<00:05:20.000> it<00:05:20.090> won't

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
a while I will get used to when it won't

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.030 
a while I will get used to when it won't
be<00:05:20.330> a<00:05:20.360> problem<00:05:20.720> but<00:05:21.260> for<00:05:21.560> as<00:05:21.650> of<00:05:21.830> right<00:05:22.010> now

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
be a problem but for as of right now

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.220 
be a problem but for as of right now
it's<00:05:22.550> like<00:05:22.730> I<00:05:22.820> suck<00:05:23.180> at<00:05:23.360> passing<00:05:23.540> I<00:05:23.900> have<00:05:24.020> no

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
it's like I suck at passing I have no

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.550 
it's like I suck at passing I have no
idea<00:05:24.560> why<00:05:24.740> maybe<00:05:25.340> it's<00:05:25.550> just<00:05:25.670> me<00:05:26.030> but<00:05:26.240> um<00:05:26.720> I

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
hope they hope it's like just maybe it's

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.230 
hope they hope it's like just maybe it's
just<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:31.010> demo<00:05:31.250> or<00:05:31.520> maybe<00:05:31.700> it's<00:05:31.880> just<00:05:31.940> me<00:05:32.210> I
