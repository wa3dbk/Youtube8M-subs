00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 back to the winning route how do you 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.549
 you feel with your dad your family that 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.519
 presents a great victory again 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.370
 you know what ugly stories but I'm not 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.639
 as I think my dad deserved a 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.410
 more solid combat more impressive but 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.180
 as I told you before the vice 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.890
 hehe my dad was really needed at 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.230
 many emotions at the time the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.210
 come back he would commit the corner to see him from 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.760
 alm the water of the explanations were 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.949
 emotions found but I did what 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.870
 that he wanted me so he would do me 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.630
 in front of trying the ler opel with 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.980
 seriously he read it every time he tried to 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.230
 to give what was closing well and not 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.329
 I could give it but but nothing I think my 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.070
 experience was what helped me the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.079
 poquita I have in these eight years I 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.579
 helped to come out afloat and here we are to 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.890
 see winning defeat this is going back to 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.570
 dock forgive me the instructions of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.940
 my dad to what he wants a week 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.399
 with my family and take to school 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.680
 come back again for gym and come back 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.309
 to just fit me more to dock with 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.989
 Daddy 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.570
 and we go back to the way he 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 he wants that month and we are a little bit 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.080
 complicated and it was a full year that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.060
 I did what I gave what I did 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.470
 it felt like it inside the ring and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.930
 now I tried to follow instructions 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.370
 from a person who knows what he does and I 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.440
 Complicated a bit but also 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.270
 I came out afloat with 12 or reading leia and the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.369
 straight I think that I'm happy 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.040
 but I'm not happy with the fight 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.380
 I wanted to give my forceful dad is 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.229
 among other 116 wants to be champion to 126 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.210
 world champion and maybe the opponents 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.710
 the future speakers were watching 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.050
 tonight you think this fight is a 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.810
 meter what is daddy that for me 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.720
 for me for me it can be a 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.100
 meter but for me that again to the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.740
 way to dock my work 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.899
 Dad and I will see him as a meter 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.550
 that they lower it as measured I only know 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.979
 who makes mistakes is something a little bit 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.479
 out of timing with my dad and what 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.009
 I do is go back and nassim docked for me 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.289
 more is another that fit back to 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.330
 concentrate my mind on daddy's voice and 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.610
 whoever comes, I am ready, I 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.869
 in front of the best of 122 pounds 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.300
 I did him good for him though faith and 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.190
 read as my panas say in the hamlet 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.289
 I took out the bells many of them 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.480
 to give him the key other boxers 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.980
 so he will defeat them and here I come back 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.850
 do the same thing to which I attach the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.730
 weight 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.290
 I'm still looking for rivals with more names and 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.810
 until I get to the world title I 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.750
 I'm sure with memos with angel 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.459
 Heredia in my physical condition to 100% 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.430
 and with my parents in an excellent team and 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.560
 and we can be champion in a second 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.660
 weight and there we go that 's what I'm 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.310
 pending to the city of presidents not 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.959
 the fanaticada because the fans know 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.910
 what a handsome dad that I like 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.670
 I fight what I want to convince my 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.580
 commercial dad to my dad that that was what 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.070
 what I needed 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.020
 I go up was what they gave me in the day 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.900
 positive between the quadrilateral try to 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.120
 surprise them to tell him not so much 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.100
 with my voice but with the work in 'the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.870
 quadrilateral that he was that energy that 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.330
 that extra that I'm missing the square 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.890
 I came out in boxing was strong but they were 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.470
 adam and veteranía I think with a little 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.210
 time I have analysis and after closing 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.400
 a second for the social mafia was it 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.230
 it makes it much easier to hit him and nothing 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.970
 this is part of having plan there is plan b 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.410
 Sometimes things do not go as they are 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.300
 but how important they lifted me the 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.090
 hand and we go on the route again out there 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.990
 let's see where we settle and we'll see 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.580
 what the champion that more than the 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.740
 opportunity as I have always said 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.630
 daddy has not negotiated daddy a dad 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.160
 who works for their daughters and if they 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.840
 They want to despise me and want 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.190
