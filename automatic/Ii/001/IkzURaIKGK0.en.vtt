from<00:00:36.300> now<00:00:36.360> with<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.440> mind<00:00:37.649> I've<00:00:37.920> still

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
from now with this in mind I've still

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.069 
from now with this in mind I've still
hacked<00:00:38.489> away<00:00:38.640> nearly<00:00:39.090> 80<00:00:39.329> hours<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> game
