 good to all welcome another day of 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.190
 more scope because in this kind of 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.629
 bring an interview that I have been made 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.340
 from the techno channel write your 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.870
 technology channel a youtube channel 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.030
 where you assured you are going to be able to find 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.710
 contained with banners like that with what 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.109
 will let go with the acquisition let's 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.580
 for the questions so I'm going to go 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.439
 responding to everything that he is 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.760
 asking in an interview to 500 that 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.769
 It is more spontaneous as possible to more 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.390
 natural and sure that you liked 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.359
 we also add that we have 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.619
 our own section of questions and 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.869
 answers that long ago that no 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.309
 I do but it's very soon going to come back like this 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.780
 that if you have any questions what 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.430
 you want me to respond soon leave them 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.300
 down here in the comments 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.300
 so good more 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.190
 you have on YouTube since he has already made two 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.230
 years if you have not done them already they buy 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.390
 your four if you have no idea you can 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.739
 he played many problems with sending 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.940
 those phones with which they took longer 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.040
 of the account does not want to have started 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.220
 before but good at the end I started like in 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.379
 April 2013 things you should do now 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.960
 then two years we upload video technology 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.150
 yes there are videos that many have put 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.800
 in private a lot not many but yes that 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.600
 there may be some that will upload before 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.729
 what I do with my friends I recorded them and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.320
 I put it on YouTube because you can 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.810
 take out anything you do not say 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 you watch it on your channel as video of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.380
 technology android videos stuff 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.180
 windows I do not know more or less what it looks like 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.290
 and always try then once in a while 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.940
 when I can when I have the opportunity 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.740
 to record something because it is different 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.930
 not that it's simply technology, 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.100
 yes health blogs and other things go out for 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.229
 what do we try to do a little bit 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.960
 different the first thing you look at in a 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.759
 smartphone for sure I think that 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.500
 it would be the updates in the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.789
 authorization is that phones update 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.979
 in the new android version for me that 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.420
 is fundamental either officially or 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.850
 I installing them will no longer be 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.490
 installing other rom or the other but 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.770
 put prices 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.570
 always that I at least what I 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.299
 I'm going to buy a 700 euro phone 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.500
 over 600 500 people barbarism me 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.970
 it seems that there must be more telephones 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.950
 cheap and that's why I at least 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.330
 that try to bet on young TV be 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.250
 cheap and that especially that 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.110
 update and have had for example the 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.659
 one plus one 229 euros 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.619
 android 5.1 have now and the month 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.349
 42300 agreements which cost me 200 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.030
 300 euros only android 5.1 to date 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.770
 today and leave the phone two years ago 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.540
 years and peak 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.880
 They are good choices, not like phones 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.070
 that just a perfect operating system 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.750
 if not because they lack will 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.700
 that question if you ask me because 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.440
 test had to say the operational theme 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.110
 perfect because it is clear that you should not 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.340
 know to me personally for the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.470
 mobile because I like it more I walk and I 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.030
 it seemed in a more free thing I like 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.650
 because you can catch real you know I 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.570
 I can touch something I can 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.430
 install another I can load it can 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.380
 break the phone but as it gives me 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.000
 I'm bored, I need to do something 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.260
 with an iphone it's like all the same me 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.940
 I think an iphone bores you an iphone 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.290
 it's always the same good surely 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.790
 oratories once a year that you 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.800
 change the icons change something else 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.140
 but for a phone that you're going to 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.510
 have the hand of characters like me that 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.980
 we like to change things, I think 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.370
 Android is definitely the operating system 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.960
 more suitable for us now that 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.060
 smartphone you have and which one you would like 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.860
 have said before one one plus one of 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.600
 the one plus brand and which one would you like 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.800
 have but is that seldom in raised 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.150
 that question that I would like to phone 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.860
 have because mostly because it's 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.030
 happy with mine if it was not for 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.370
 the blood sausage raised me more 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.900
 question but at the moment it's not love 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.630
 would change for a htc a g4 htc m 94 then 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.580
 at least it would be those 2 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.580
 not likely the s 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.140
 these applications are essential 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.580
 for you right now is another question that 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.050
 you tell me I do not have any 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.350
 essential application outside 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.120
 whatsapp twitter and little more the truth and 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.800
 applications applications what is 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.660
 has the truth what are the ones that I 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.390
 I have on my desk the networks 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.890
 basically social and google keep a 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.930
 application for the note then good 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.940
 administration of the pages of 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.010
 facebook, it's also not good 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.960
 that's how it would be social network the siam 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.090
 camps can is an application to be 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.400
 interesting camps cannes for your power 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.050
 scan has in your report scan it 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.960
 and then you get it very good resolution 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.310
 more study life an application that 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.690
 it works like an agenda you can not 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.370
 point when you have exams contain 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.900
 the classes this is an application that is 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.610
 so interesting I'm going to put those two and 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.430
 we move on to the next question for you 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.530
 what would be the best smartphone of 2015 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.790
 Right now, none of them approve 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.380
 can you say that neither does the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.630
 attention is to say I do not need either 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.360
 say I need to prove that yes I want to 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.740
 fly that 4 this new one that came out yesterday no 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.480
 I know the truth that I do not have that need 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.310
 I do not know but none 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.980
 and for painting I've seen it from models 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.760
 earlier I would say that or the 9 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.960
 the g4 or the s6 it is obvious to think of one of 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.360
 those 3 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.060
 I do not know the truth I would have to approve it 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.160
 but I have none that is without doubt 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.680
 They call me thank you for the 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.880
 truth is that it is not the price that they have 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.539
 the high ranges 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.330
 they seem expensive 600 700 euros 800 euros 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:55.139
 900 as they approached me from dear carce 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.810
 of that 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.919
 that there are other options 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.020
 that is another problem that people do not 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.120
 you know the phone for this price and 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.190
 that yes they can that they can buy and 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.060
 anyway many people who samsung 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.370
 samsung because because I see it is fatal 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.550
 fuck the mobile but I do not know samsung 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.430
 as it is a technical support because it does not 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.870
 I know people that there are many people who do not 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.419
 dares to buy online 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.759
 buying new brands is clear is not 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.530
 better the bad known than the good by 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.419
 know 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.789
 what was your first smartphone with 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.440
 no doubt a sony that I do not remember what 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.970
 It was also a sony of all 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.069
 the others have to have so many 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.330
 imagine and nothing was a brick like what 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.280
 I called in a little thing 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.500
 so with a little screen like that 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.510
 buttons 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.890
 has some other games with the 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.510
 keyboards but little more 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.640
 brawn are and I do not know how much a sony 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.760
 ericsson that brand can think sony 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.070
 xperia no then sony ericsson conclusion 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.560
 You work with cameras, microphone programs 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.310
 times a camera mood we are recording 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.670
 with the canon powershot 7x we have a 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.760
 mic which is a c 1 and voucher of the 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:10.210
 mark of the mount sound marks us if it has 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.070
 the cookie name seems to me that I do not 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.340
 they put a microphone here but do not put it 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:18.850
 and with a 13 inch pro macbook 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.310
 year 2011 because here we would have to 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.930
 subscribe to your channel on YouTube 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.790
 video filters held until I 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.810
 that's the main thing this has been seen 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.240
 video endured up here 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.370
 subscribe there is something that calls you the 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.720
 attention that can not be denied, do not be 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.880
 the bottom or whether they will be given how well 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.430
 my camera the microphone that records me 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.330
 also the sound or me with my channel if 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.490
 I had not seen it before 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.440
 I do not know subscribe, it got here 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.210
 for something I think it's worth it 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.960
 give the button that if you do not have 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.330
 at present 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.889
 right now I'm with live is has been 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.870
 the first serious netbook 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:53.349
 probably where I am because 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.819
 I was before in things as there are 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:57.580
 start times with them in 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:59.400
 September of this year we have 2014 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:03.340
 this year last year practically 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.189
 September 2014 and students with rpm 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.080
 a fucking company the truth that is 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:09.550
 stopped fatal the innova support none 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.560
 but already when one has 200 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.270
 subscribers and it catches your attention that 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.279
 I owe it to a netbook I want to get in there 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.110
 I know what they pay they do not get what 

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:18.610
 first you see I do not know the contract and 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.580
 basically only in bent 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.520
 because we're not going to win so, well, that's 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.830
 it was what happened then I was with the 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.509
 gpm network I got myself out 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.729
 I did not leave, they threw me a long 

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:32.110
 story and then I was until 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:33.370
 enter with divided position is a 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.080
 partner and I had with apps on and I 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.090
 quiet that I was worth for myself 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.439
 so nothing was being that occasion 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.639
 the interview I think he does not ask me 

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:42.400
 they have done fast not eight minutes 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:43.719
 It started flying by, so I think 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.650
 that is already said everything if you have a 

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:46.210
 new question next image 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.249
 aggravating the comments can leave it 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.990
 so I say goodbye to take a look 

00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:52.659
 to the technology partner channel and 

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.280
 what good people did he give and what also 

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:56.500
 upload a content tutorials 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.790
 droid things happened and sure we 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.440
 you will see better than me with the bridges 

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.120
 so nothing I say goodbye if it has 

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.680
 liked the video has served to leave me a 

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.330
 like subscribed for many more videos 

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.740
 like this and you already know that in the channel 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:09.360
 pro I loaded reviews and that we will see in 

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.360
