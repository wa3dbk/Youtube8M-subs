this<00:04:17.690> actually<00:04:18.080> gives<00:04:18.140> stay<00:04:18.380> alive<00:04:18.590> in<00:04:18.799> store

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
this actually gives stay alive in store

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.580 
this actually gives stay alive in store
spirits<00:04:19.400> can<00:04:19.549> also<00:04:19.700> go<00:04:19.910> down<00:04:20.289> thinkin<00:04:21.289> smooshy

spirits can also go down thinkin smooshy
does<00:04:21.770> go<00:04:21.919> down<00:04:21.950> but<00:04:22.220> he<00:04:22.310> does<00:04:22.460> have<00:04:22.550> an<00:04:22.640> agent

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
does go down but he does have an agent

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
does go down but he does have an agent
so<00:04:22.970> he's<00:04:23.090> actually<00:04:23.270> going<00:04:23.539> to<00:04:23.630> come<00:04:23.780> back

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900

so he's actually going to come back
alive<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.380> this<00:04:24.470> is<00:04:24.620> definitely<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.130> end

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
awfully made a copy of his buddy centaur

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.650 
awfully made a copy of his buddy centaur
and<00:04:38.949> it's<00:04:39.520> just<00:04:39.729> sending<00:04:40.000> him<00:04:40.120> about<00:04:40.360> and

what's<00:04:41.650> really<00:04:41.860> good<00:04:41.979> about<00:04:42.009> making<00:04:42.280> a

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
what's really good about making a

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.450 
what's really good about making a
morphling<00:04:43.050> morph<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.319> someone<00:04:45.130> who<00:04:45.190> has<00:04:45.340> a

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
morphling morph of someone who has a

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.249 
morphling morph of someone who has a
radiance<00:04:45.940> is<00:04:46.150> that<00:04:46.389> you<00:04:46.930> know<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.169> little

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
radiance is that you know the little

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.559 
radiance is that you know the little
sparkles<00:04:47.380> grace<00:04:48.009> they<00:04:48.550> will<00:04:48.789> follow<00:04:49.060> even

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
sparkles grace they will follow even

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.150 
sparkles grace they will follow even
this<00:04:49.720> image<00:04:50.110> even<00:04:50.410> though<00:04:50.560> it's<00:04:50.710> not<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.949> real

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
this image even though it's not the real

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.550 
this image even though it's not the real
guy<00:04:51.400> they<00:04:52.300> will<00:04:52.479> follow<00:04:52.720> this<00:04:52.990> image<00:04:53.319> to<00:04:53.530> the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
guy they will follow this image to the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.240 
guy they will follow this image to the
ends<00:04:53.830> of<00:04:53.889> the<00:04:53.949> earth<00:04:54.039> so<00:04:54.479> see<00:04:55.479> how<00:04:55.509> I<00:04:56.250> guess

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
ends of the earth so see how I guess

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.650 
ends of the earth so see how I guess
they're<00:04:57.430> sparkling<00:04:57.819> because<00:04:58.120> of<00:04:58.210> him<00:04:58.330> anyway

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
they're sparkling because of him anyway

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.850 
they're sparkling because of him anyway
but<00:05:00.690> it's<00:05:01.690> anyway<00:05:02.110> it's<00:05:02.259> very<00:05:02.320> good<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.740> make

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
but it's anyway it's very good to make

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.170 
but it's anyway it's very good to make
them<00:05:03.070> as<00:05:03.250> orff<00:05:05.430> basically<00:05:06.430> replicate<00:05:06.880> someone

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
them as orff basically replicate someone

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.909 
them as orff basically replicate someone
with<00:05:07.389> a<00:05:07.570> radiance<00:05:07.930> they're<00:05:08.710> going<00:05:08.830> to

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
with a radiance they're going to

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.010 
with a radiance they're going to
actually<00:05:09.310> also<00:05:09.610> take<00:05:09.849> out<00:05:09.970> top<00:05:10.150> eric<00:05:10.419> so<00:05:10.539> what

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
actually also take out top eric so what

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.089 
actually also take out top eric so what
happens<00:05:11.289> when<00:05:11.349> you<00:05:11.440> take<00:05:11.530> out<00:05:11.650> parents<00:05:11.889> that

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
happens when you take out parents that

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.249 
happens when you take out parents that
the<00:05:12.190> creeps<00:05:12.430> get<00:05:12.610> very<00:05:12.789> strong<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:14.020> creeps

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
the creeps get very strong the creeps

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.409 
the creeps get very strong the creeps
being<00:05:14.500> these<00:05:14.680> guys<00:05:14.919> who<00:05:15.639> are<00:05:15.729> fighting<00:05:16.240> a

battle in the middle of the countryside

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.740 
battle in the middle of the countryside
when<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.550> base<00:05:18.729> is<00:05:18.759> actually<00:05:19.240> under<00:05:19.330> attack

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
when the base is actually under attack

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.180 
when the base is actually under attack
don't<00:05:20.349> you<00:05:20.500> think<00:05:20.620> that's<00:05:20.740> silly<00:05:20.979> do<00:05:21.130> you

rape and I think hand is getting away do

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.680 
rape and I think hand is getting away do
you<00:06:38.800> think<00:06:39.010> he's<00:06:39.100> a<00:06:39.130> coward<00:06:39.430> no<00:06:40.180> I<00:06:40.210> think<00:06:40.570> he's

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
you think he's a coward no I think he's

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.720 
you think he's a coward no I think he's
smart<00:06:40.810> you<00:06:41.410> think<00:06:41.620> he's<00:06:41.770> smart<00:06:42.160> Meyer<00:06:42.490> he

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
smart you think he's smart Meyer he

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.640 
smart you think he's smart Meyer he
doesn't<00:06:42.970> want<00:06:43.090> to<00:06:43.120> get<00:06:43.210> hurt<00:06:43.360> well<00:06:44.320> I<00:06:44.350> think

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
doesn't want to get hurt well I think

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.390 
doesn't want to get hurt well I think
he's<00:06:44.950> a<00:06:44.980> coward<00:06:45.240> so<00:06:46.240> at<00:06:47.140> that<00:06:47.260> point<00:06:47.400> everyone

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 
he's a coward so at that point everyone

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.680 
he's a coward so at that point everyone
leaves<00:06:48.610> the<00:06:48.760> game<00:06:48.940> and<00:06:49.120> I<00:06:49.150> think<00:06:49.360> there<00:06:49.540> might

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
leaves the game and I think there might

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.590 
leaves the game and I think there might
have<00:06:49.750> been<00:06:49.870> very<00:06:50.140> mad<00:06:50.350> at<00:06:50.500> a<00:06:50.590> coward<00:06:50.950> friend

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
have been very mad at a coward friend

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.570 
have been very mad at a coward friend
but<00:06:52.600> they<00:06:53.560> might<00:06:53.740> have<00:06:53.890> been<00:06:54.010> as<00:06:54.160> you<00:06:54.340> said

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
but they might have been as you said

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.510 
but they might have been as you said
just<00:06:55.320> maybe<00:06:56.320> he<00:06:56.620> was<00:06:56.800> actually<00:06:57.010> doing<00:06:57.340> the

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
just maybe he was actually doing the

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.640 
just maybe he was actually doing the
right<00:06:57.640> thing<00:06:57.880> in<00:06:58.000> running<00:06:58.240> away<00:06:58.390> but<00:06:59.380> that

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
right thing in running away but that

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.610 
right thing in running away but that
