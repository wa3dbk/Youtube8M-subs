00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.130
 and games on lenovo a60 and the first will be r t 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.059
 and x san andreas and so do not know why but 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:16.170
 that's what a model of 90 is; a model with 60 g t 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.779
 x it slows down extremely terribly I do not know 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.000
 why are the settings now standard 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.580
 the game virtually impossible 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.510
 play an hour try setting in the most 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.429
 lower the bottom and see what will be the game 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.809
 display and so the brightness with what's 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:39.890
 brightness this resolution is high maximum 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:44.309
 low off here off 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.910
 special effects now let's see what we have with 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.030
 mini baby will be well here on the very 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.879
 minimum minimum you can play all 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.230
 extremely square but the game works for us 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.820
 no reason it is connected does not seem that 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.430
 Something is wrong with optimization 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.890
 somehow strange in general everything but see in 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.229
 ready and you can safely 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.830
 swear at somme him therefore go 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.189
 to the next game and the next game is real 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.290
 racing 3 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.710
 well here we are the game itself and nothing yet 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.659
 hints us that there will be brakes 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.060
 worth while nothing hints and there 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.860
 Look at the charts now, I donâ€™t know 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.720
 at the minimum at the maximum do not forget to 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.100
 comments to rate I was looking for 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.710
 she forcibly minimum because everyones 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.140
 reflections are visible and there is no special 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.049
 brakes 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.600
 that's why shook passed since then it's trouble 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.460
 and the other games here as you can see at all 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.820
 ok i would even say very well 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.189
 it's an hour we're here to make dust 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.320
 noticed brakes on principle can be 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.970
 and noticed maybe i'm coaxed so how 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.670
 do you think were the brakes in time, 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.790
 hatches if you write about it and not 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.619
 forget to rate each game 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.320
 fire as she goes according to you on 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.670
 this smartphone is short in my 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.250
 opinion real racing 3 is wonderful 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.310
 because I do not see any problems all 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.630
 smoothly everything is clear everything is fast so 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:21.530
 move on to the next game and the next one 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:25.160
 the game tanks well, here we are in battle and go like this 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.840
 it means tanks have 23 fps, but 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.880
 somehow strange that for what I 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.519
 still the game is downloaded in short tanks 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:39.980
 go fine but why not 33 fps yet 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:42.140
 and 3231 well, apparently down languid 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.330
 just now it 's the battle itself 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.700
 champions swinging 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.410
 maybe because of this somehow I do not see 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.980
 some particular problem is that how 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.670
 tanks work tanks work well 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:02.590
 Now I will take my old ass 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:05.720
 I will customize it 3235 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.700
 33 short normal tanks 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.609
 work without any problems log 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.910
 Now we will quickly play fast 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.910
 the battle is just these very heroes download 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.799
 so we already started to capture the base we 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.420
 Lead now appears the enemy and 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.040
 our leadership is over want not such 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.260
 the tower is a big opinion what a big tower 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.350
 I carry for the same tank or not the same 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.549
 there t-150 no opinions t-150 and how it 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:41.299
 will and on like my tank on another ha 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:46.239
 ha sod I see you now like this 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:49.569
 that's all fine, I almost 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.569
 repaired gun 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.300
 i don't care and now sucks anyway 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.360
 there they can still shoot me 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.500
 won go to the next game 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:07.090
 well, the last game for today is a battle 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.400
 marvel champions hours crystal 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:15.160
 quickly take and go to somebody 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:17.140
 on throw in krator connected some 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.959
 so there is me a daily crystal 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.680
 often look yes I have daily here 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.540
 give the hero sometimes given away a long time ago 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.940
 principle okay the topic is short in 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:34.680
 fight so but here we are in battle and as you can see 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.960
 the game is not in principle the most minimal 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.120
 graphic settings in short no 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.670
 on me and pretty ok 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.820
 what work do you understand whom nobody's storm is not 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.070
 gomori crater covers short 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.660
 I do not know why they are shot down like this 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.950
 all other games are running 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:57.280
 principle is quite quite normal 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.390
 what shorter fatalities like this 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.270
