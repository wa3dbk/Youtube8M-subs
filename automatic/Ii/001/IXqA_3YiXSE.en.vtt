00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
injury you're going to have to take a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.880 
injury you're going to have to take a
specific<00:02:20.270> approach<00:02:20.960> so<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.230> can't<00:02:21.530> break<00:02:21.740> it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
specific approach so I can't break it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.910 
specific approach so I can't break it
all<00:02:22.040> down<00:02:22.070> into<00:02:22.670> one<00:02:22.940> process<00:02:23.540> but<00:02:24.200> if<00:02:24.410> you

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
all down into one process but if you

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.950 
all down into one process but if you
pick<00:02:25.100> up<00:02:25.250> an<00:02:25.370> injury<00:02:25.520> don't<00:02:26.240> neglect<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.720> don't

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
pick up an injury don't neglect it don't

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.170 
pick up an injury don't neglect it don't
just<00:02:27.260> lay<00:02:28.070> off<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.430> for<00:02:28.460> a<00:02:28.640> couple<00:02:28.790> days<00:02:29.120> and

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
just lay off it for a couple days and

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.300 
just lay off it for a couple days and
then<00:02:29.420> come<00:02:29.660> back<00:02:29.690> because<00:02:30.110> most<00:02:30.650> likely<00:02:31.100> it's

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
then come back because most likely it's

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.370 
then come back because most likely it's
going<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:32.060> happen<00:02:32.240> again<00:02:32.690> if<00:02:32.840> it's<00:02:32.960> a<00:02:33.050> serious

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380
