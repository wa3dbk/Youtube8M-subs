00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:20.070
 I start with 2 or so even halima 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.020
 nails and my cuticle regrowth February 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.939
 but the square-shaped nails that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.310
 is the most advantageous form I 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.260
 not find my fingers and this attention 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.119
 in and marveaux waves to finish too 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.650
 to go back and forth opposing that 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.520
 can come and fries and so try 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.860
 from him but always in the same direction 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.840
 these are the scores I like this very 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.640
 beautiful is my culture is the stage that we 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.840
 forget but that really gives a look 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.840
 cleaner to the 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.260
 it is then apply a hardener to 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.260
 nails called the mast not there 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.820
 is then applied mabanda varnish to 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.860
 nails who are trying to sephora and who 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.690
 unfortunately is content but I 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.460
 believe common sense that if you ever have 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.460
 a base to propose a party levis 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.090
 in Quebec a size comes next 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.130
 applied my favorite nail polish of autumn 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.630
 who is the receptionist at two and if 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.190
 I always start the application my 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.330
 varnished by the middle of the nail i 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.290
 really think that's the way he 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.290
 knew easy for me 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.560
 also be careful not to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.930
 apply your nail polish until 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.400
 cuticles or up to your skin it's this 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.730
 feature without luxury really took by a 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.210
 good polish clean and neat and i'm good 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.210
 to go 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.880
 2 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.799
 I know 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.570
 even if the varnish is already very opaque 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.900
 jaffe always a second layer of 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.119
 varnish 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.729
 I think that could prolong the duration 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.720
 Fernie of life is as it comes to 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.440
 eat all the little faults that 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.440
 would like to have 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.470
 last but not least 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.790
 is the most important in my opinion it's 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.790
 the application of a topo 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.870
 and that's the end result I hope that 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.819
 same excerpt from having helped us and 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.120
 we see each other next video 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.120
 you lie
