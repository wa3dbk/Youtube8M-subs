this<00:01:46.659> in<00:01:47.049> a<00:01:47.109> way<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.259> suppose<00:01:47.380> is<00:01:47.649> just<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:48.039> start

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
this in a way I suppose is just a start

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.349 
this in a way I suppose is just a start
for<00:01:48.549> you<00:01:48.670> hopefully<00:01:49.030> you're<00:01:49.179> going<00:01:49.299> to

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
for you hopefully you're going to

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.120 
for you hopefully you're going to
capitalize<00:01:49.869> and<00:01:50.140> like<00:01:50.319> to<00:01:50.469> think<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:50.799> it's

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
capitalize and like to think so it's

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.849 
capitalize and like to think so it's
hard<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.460> tell<00:01:51.670> but<00:01:51.939> yeah<00:01:52.179> obviously<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:52.859> large

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
hard to tell but yeah obviously a large

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.230 
hard to tell but yeah obviously a large
say<00:01:54.100> this<00:01:54.249> is<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.399> lowest<00:01:54.819> were<00:01:54.909> ever<00:01:55.090> going

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
say this is the lowest were ever going
