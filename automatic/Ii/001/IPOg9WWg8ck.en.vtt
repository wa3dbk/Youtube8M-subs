and<00:00:46.379> when<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.649> was<00:00:46.829> talking<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.670> person

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
and when I was talking to this a person

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.950 
and when I was talking to this a person
who<00:00:48.420> had<00:00:48.539> asked<00:00:48.809> me<00:00:48.930> about<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:50.480> was<00:00:51.480> trying

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
who had asked me about it I was trying

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.150 
who had asked me about it I was trying
to<00:00:52.110> figure<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.410> how<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.739> would<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.980> different

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
to figure out how it would be different

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.490 
to figure out how it would be different
to<00:00:53.489> around<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.750> main<00:00:55.050> point<00:00:55.410> of

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
to around and it the main point of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.439 
to around and it the main point of
difference<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.309> has<00:00:56.340> two<00:00:56.850> angles<00:00:57.300> you're

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
difference is it has two angles you're

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
difference is it has two angles you're
working<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:57.930> rather<00:00:58.170> than<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.370> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
working with rather than one so on a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.660 
working with rather than one so on a
circle<00:00:59.879> paper<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.359> working<00:01:00.750> with<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> one

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
circle paper just working with the one

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.210 
circle paper just working with the one
round<00:01:02.690> angle<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.260> square<00:01:04.710> you're<00:01:04.860> working

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
round angle the square you're working

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.980 
round angle the square you're working
with<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> two<00:01:05.850> angles<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.510> you've<00:01:06.659> got<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
with the two angles so you've got the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.480 
with the two angles so you've got the
two<00:01:07.290> sides<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:09.360> two<00:01:09.600> quarters<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.490> beside

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
two sides the two quarters and beside

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.850 
two sides the two quarters and beside

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
you can see I've come to the corner so

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.940 
you can see I've come to the corner so
this<00:01:24.450> point<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.869> lower<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.350> point<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.740> higher

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
this point is lower this point is higher

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.440 
this point is lower this point is higher
than<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.369> corners<00:01:26.790> lower<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.240> one's

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
than this corners lower this one's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.719 
than this corners lower this one's
higher<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.110> remember<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.500> baked<00:01:28.979> two<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.549> each

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
