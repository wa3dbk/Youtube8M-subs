any other items that you want to connect
to<00:00:26.070> your<00:00:26.550> clock<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.900> just<00:00:28.019> gonna<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.230> building

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
to your clock so just gonna be building

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.250 
to your clock so just gonna be building
this<00:00:28.590> next<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.070> my<00:00:29.300> unfinished<00:00:30.300> citadel<00:00:31.230> of

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
this next to my unfinished citadel of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.860 
this next to my unfinished citadel of
the<00:00:31.380> Time<00:00:31.769> Lords<00:00:32.120> if<00:00:33.120> you're<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> fan<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.719> Doctor

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the Time Lords if you're a fan of Doctor

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.340 
the Time Lords if you're a fan of Doctor
Who<00:00:34.110> you'll<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:36.350> building

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
Who you'll know what this this building

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.639 
Who you'll know what this this building
is<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.620> anyway<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.750> want<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:40.440> start

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
is but anyway so you want to just start

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.490 
is but anyway so you want to just start
off<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:40.860> putting<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:42.090> repeat<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
off with putting a repeat of that and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.740 
off with putting a repeat of that and
perhaps<00:00:44.180> another<00:00:45.180> Wally<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:45.960> now<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.649> can

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
perhaps another Wally here now you can

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.439 
perhaps another Wally here now you can
extend<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.989> duration<00:00:49.260> per<00:00:49.920> say<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.449> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
extend the duration per say of the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.660 
extend the duration per say of the
redstone<00:00:51.930> repeater<00:00:52.320> circuit<00:00:52.800> by<00:00:53.010> adding<00:00:53.340> more

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
redstone repeater circuit by adding more

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.850 
redstone repeater circuit by adding more
repeaters<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.660> whatnot<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.710> we're<00:00:55.829> just

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
repeaters and whatnot but we're just

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.920 
repeaters and whatnot but we're just
gonna<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.129> adding<00:00:56.370> let's<00:00:57.059> say<00:00:57.210> four<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.840> this

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
gonna be adding let's say four to this

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.709 
gonna be adding let's say four to this
one<00:00:58.730> actually<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.789> know<00:00:59.910> one<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.539> remove

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
one actually you know one just remove

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.590 
one actually you know one just remove
that<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:04.100> yeah<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.180> want<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> put<00:01:06.479> them

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
that one yeah but you want to put them

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.149 
that one yeah but you want to put them
in<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> direction<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.320> which<00:01:07.890> way<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
in the direction of which way the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.850 
in the direction of which way the
current<00:01:08.520> will<00:01:08.909> flow<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:10.369> we<00:01:11.369> put<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:12.650> piece<00:01:13.650> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
current will flow so we put a piece of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.830 
current will flow so we put a piece of
redstone<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> very<00:01:15.270> simple

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
redstone here this is a very simple

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.270 
redstone here this is a very simple
let's<00:01:16.049> turn<00:01:16.170> repeater<00:01:16.439> clock<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:17.070> will<00:01:17.189> also

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
let's turn repeater clock this will also

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.990 
let's turn repeater clock this will also
be<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> very<00:01:17.670> fast<00:01:18.150> clock<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:20.009> illuminate

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
be a very fast clock so if we illuminate

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.749 
be a very fast clock so if we illuminate
all<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.450> them<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.549> want<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
all of them like so and then we want to

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.630 
all of them like so and then we want to
do<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.200> basically<00:01:25.200> hit<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.710> away<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.159> quickly

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
do is basically hit it away and quickly

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.499 
do is basically hit it away and quickly
replace<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.360> some<00:01:27.689> redstone<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.380> this

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
replace it with some redstone like this

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.800 
replace it with some redstone like this
hang<00:01:30.509> on

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.719 

as<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.200> we've<00:01:34.560> now<00:01:34.590> got<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.250> little

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
as you can see we've now got a little

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.480 
as you can see we've now got a little
redstone<00:01:36.270> repeater<00:01:36.869> clock<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.310> can

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
redstone repeater clock so you can

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.370 
redstone repeater clock so you can
attach<00:01:38.729> your<00:01:38.909> various<00:01:39.240> items<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.110> such

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
attach your various items to this such

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.280 
attach your various items to this such
as<00:01:40.790> Pistons<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.060> we're<00:01:42.150> going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.299> add<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> stick

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
as Pistons so we're going to add a stick

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.190 
as Pistons so we're going to add a stick
this<00:01:43.439> mahir

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
this mahir

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.680 
this mahir
[Music]

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
[Music]

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.060 
[Music]
so<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:47.750> can<00:01:47.870> add<00:01:47.960> items<00:01:48.470> such<00:01:48.680> as<00:01:48.710> sticky

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
so you can add items such as sticky

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.860 
so you can add items such as sticky
pistons<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.730> can<00:01:49.850> add<00:01:49.940> more<00:01:50.090> repeaters<00:01:50.540> or

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
pistons you can add more repeaters or

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.600 
pistons you can add more repeaters or
some<00:01:51.050> sort<00:01:51.260> of<00:01:51.290> light<00:01:51.980> show<00:01:52.280> apps<00:01:52.790> oops<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:57.610> was

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
some sort of light show apps oops I was

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.800 
some sort of light show apps oops I was
not<00:01:58.730> really<00:01:58.820> working<00:01:58.970> very<00:01:59.180> well<00:01:59.330> because<00:01:59.660> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
not really working very well because the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.350 
not really working very well because the
SEC<00:02:00.110> is<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:00.470> fast<00:02:00.740> but<00:02:01.580> if<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:01.970> were<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.180> slow

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
SEC is so fast but if you were to slow

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.310 
SEC is so fast but if you were to slow
down<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.750> circuit<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.470> we'd<00:02:03.620> see<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.890> hoop

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
down the circuit and we'd see the hoop

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.889 
down the circuit and we'd see the hoop
per<00:02:06.320> hole<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.710> floor<00:02:06.950> we<00:02:07.460> would<00:02:07.580> see<00:02:07.790> the

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
per hole the floor we would see the

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.400 
per hole the floor we would see the
lights<00:02:08.899> illuminate<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:10.010> sequence<00:02:10.820> so<00:02:11.720> I'll

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
lights illuminate in sequence so I'll

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.020 
lights illuminate in sequence so I'll
show<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.650> how<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.800> create<00:02:13.100> an<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.460> slower

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
show you how to create an a slower

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.420 
show you how to create an a slower
circuit<00:02:14.450> in<00:02:14.660> let's<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:15.500> let's<00:02:15.980> just<00:02:16.040> get<00:02:16.370> rid

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
circuit in let's just let's just get rid

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.800 
circuit in let's just let's just get rid
of<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:16.610> one<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:20.030> let's<00:02:20.930> put<00:02:21.200> one<00:02:22.190> there<00:02:22.810> and

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
of this one so let's put one there and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.270 
of this one so let's put one there and
three<00:02:24.340> four<00:02:26.170> let's<00:02:27.170> see<00:02:27.410> yeah<00:02:27.980> let's<00:02:28.160> make

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
three four let's see yeah let's make

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:43.550 
three four let's see yeah let's make
this<00:02:28.430> one<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:29.140> 16<00:02:30.520> repeater<00:02:31.520> circuit

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.190 

it's<00:02:43.980> into<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.250> corners<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.870> it's<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.960> same

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it's into the corners and it's the same

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.360 
it's into the corners and it's the same
procedure<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:48.180> make<00:02:48.450> them<00:02:48.600> all<00:02:48.690> illuminate

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
procedure so make them all illuminate

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.830 
procedure so make them all illuminate
click<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.490> away<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.210> can<00:02:51.360> actually

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
click it away and you can actually

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.280 
click it away and you can actually
decide<00:02:53.090> what<00:02:54.090> timing<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.930> want<00:02:55.080> in<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
decide what timing you want in the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.990 
decide what timing you want in the
circuit<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:55.800> can<00:02:55.920> see<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.580> much<00:02:56.790> slower

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
circuit so you can see it's much slower

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.780 
circuit so you can see it's much slower
than<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.360> smaller<00:02:57.810> one<00:02:57.990> we<00:02:58.110> created<00:02:58.230> before

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
than the smaller one we created before

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.990 
than the smaller one we created before
so<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.910> could<00:03:00.030> add<00:03:00.200> perhaps<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.830> piston<00:03:02.610> again

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.760 

as<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.120> can<00:03:06.209> see<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.810> very<00:03:06.840> slow<00:03:07.350> circuit

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
as you can see it's a very slow circuit

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.160 
as you can see it's a very slow circuit
so<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.790> course<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.090> can<00:03:09.240> make<00:03:09.360> these<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:09.870> as

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
so of course you can make these with as

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.840 
so of course you can make these with as
many<00:03:10.350> repeaters<00:03:10.860> as<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.040> want<00:03:11.190> really<00:03:11.459> if<00:03:11.700> you

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
many repeaters as you want really if you

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.790 
many repeaters as you want really if you
want<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.150> really<00:03:12.420> slow<00:03:12.930> circuit<00:03:13.470> or<00:03:13.620> as<00:03:13.709> many

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
want to really slow circuit or as many

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.180 
want to really slow circuit or as many
few<00:03:14.430> as<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.330> would<00:03:15.450> want<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.410> much<00:03:16.860> faster

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
few as you would want for a much faster

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.640 
few as you would want for a much faster
circuit<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:18.750> this<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.080> another<00:03:19.260> minecraft

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
circuit so this is another minecraft

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.850 
circuit so this is another minecraft
