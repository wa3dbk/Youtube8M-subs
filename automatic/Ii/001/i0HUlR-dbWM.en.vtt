00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.550
Welcome back to the Gentleman's Gazette!

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:11.460
Today's video is the ultimate guide to Polo
Shirts.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.630
Next up is the fit of Polo Shirts.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.200
As I mentioned before it's really important
that your polo is not too tight or too big.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.750
Now what that means specifically?

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.230
your sleeve should come down about half your
biceps, you don't want it down here otherwise,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.819
it looks vintage.You don't want it super short
otherwise it looks too female, about a halfway

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:33.819
down.

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:38.839
You want to be able to put in like two fingers
comfortably.

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.370
It's fine if it's closed but it shouldn't
be super tight.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.100
Most Polo Shirt brands today offer different
fits.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.659
Now they're things like classic fit, custom
fit, trim fit, slim fit and this doesn't really

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.820
help you to distinguish between different
brands cos every brand is going to define

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.820
it differently.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.089
In General, classic fit is good for you if
you're not in the best shape.

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.280
If you have some love handles and usually
the arm holes are cut a little deeper, sleeves

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.049
are cut a little fuller for your biceps and
you have a little more room and drape across

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.020
your body.It's also called classic because
it was the original cut, it was a little bit

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.020
wider.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.439
Today, it will be a little more contemporary,
you want it slightly slimmer.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:33.520
So next up is, slim fit.Slim fit means smaller
arm hole, everything fits a little tighter

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.960
and neater, really good if you're in shape
because the flex material adjusts to your

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.100
body and you can wear it and cut a very good
figure.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.270
Custom fit is perfect for men who are like
in between the classic fit and the slim fit

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.290
so you still get a slightly smaller armhole,
you still get a trimmer fit but it's not overly

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.290
slim.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.310
So if you're not a big guy, if you're not
in super shape with a 6 pack, this kind of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.509
custom fit is the way to go.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:12.120
next up, we have polo shirt materials and
which one you should go for.
