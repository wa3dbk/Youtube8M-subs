00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.530
 welcome everyone once again to the channel 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.120
 of paint gaming I am frames and here I am 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.459
 once again with the mister place very 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.379
 good to play good frames in this 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.929
 occasion to tell you something that I think 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.999
 that is going to be quite important and that 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.850
 for us it is especially 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:23.470
 important and we want to comment oslo and 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:27.960
 how it looks like and see what you think 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.960
 It's worth playing tell us a little bit 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.490
 the quick way is not that either 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.050
 of course it's saying a lot we're going to have 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.140
 we have live streaming on youtube 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.390
 worth the maximum panel theme and so on and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.250
 let's make use of it then to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.770
 starting today to go programming 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.489
 but doing some tests and others there 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.809
 various 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.360
 by the way you think the thing 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.680
 it works well and well we will start then 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.840
 test mode so to speak this 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.239
 late with some games some 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.680
 written we will see in principle 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.740
 he thought that it retransmits since I have the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.690
 capturing and the computer and others 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.090
 and the embargoes that we can not count on 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.800
 Well, I think a little more than that is 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.280
 a very important opportunity for 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.050
 everyone who sees us usually 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.910
 good 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.800
 watch videos of screen if things of these 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.480
 for also so you can see a 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.980
 little bit more closely because players 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.240
 as alonso as stacks a goblin to play 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.830
 which are the people who are participating 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.360
 in him 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.820
 in the four x 360 with that 0 for the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.680
 other and good then that is a 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.110
 way to have all the suvs more 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.570
 close to tell us what you think of 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.610
 that you see how the thing is going and that you are 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.440
 a little bit closer to all of us 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.910
 I believe that otherwise nothing more 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.590
 play is what is important 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.020
 for us and we are going to try 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.640
 extract the most the most of very 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.920
 important in the first team I think 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.500
 In Spain, we are going to be able to do this 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.540
 on youtube and good about everything 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.580
 important to note not as not as 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.380
 unit but as a stress team 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.990
 we mark as a team we are the first 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.340
 team that can do it and nothing comes 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.440
 in making good use of them 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.899
 we have feedback that such was 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.220
 working what can we do if something goes 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.320
 bad and so on 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.210
 For my part, just play, I think what 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.550
 what we had come to say is said 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.250
 if you have something else to say that they are 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.200
 pending half hour today we will be 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.870
 giving you cane on youtube in live 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.090
 Well , you guys , you know, there 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.220
 You find in the direct paint 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.900
 gaming good luck for all one 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.430
 greeting for those who do not know by the way 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.630
 up next to uploaded videos appears 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.670
 the tab and it's live voucher 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.830
 then it would be to play live and 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.090
 the bulletin will appear anyway 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.010
 when we are going to start retransmitting and 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.200
 also for its value in the extreme f and 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.200
 we'll see each other until the next
