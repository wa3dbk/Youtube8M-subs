you ever worry if you're a parent is as
big<00:01:55.619> craze<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.250> know<00:01:56.399> kids<00:01:56.909> are<00:01:57.000> spending<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
big craze you know kids are spending a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.580 
big craze you know kids are spending a
lot<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.390> time<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:57.750> what<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:57.990> actually<00:01:58.140> doing

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
lot of time but what they actually doing

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.499 
lot of time but what they actually doing
so<00:01:58.799> seeing<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.460> laid<00:01:59.579> out<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.880> book<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.240> think

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
so seeing it laid out in a book I think

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.990 
so seeing it laid out in a book I think
is<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> more<00:02:00.899> traditional<00:02:01.229> way<00:02:01.649> for<00:02:02.520> parents<00:02:02.909> to

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
is a more traditional way for parents to

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.910 
is a more traditional way for parents to
get<00:02:03.090> information<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.960> go<00:02:04.049> food<00:02:04.619> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
get information so there you go food and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.280 
get information so there you go food and
shelter<00:02:05.130> stone<00:02:05.850> tools<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.750> weapons<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.200> as

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
shelter stone tools and weapons and as

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.869 
shelter stone tools and weapons and as
you<00:02:07.439> progress<00:02:07.649> through<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.160> book<00:02:08.369> you

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
you progress through the book you

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.010 
you progress through the book you
getting<00:02:09.119> more<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.360> more<00:02:09.450> details<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.989> think

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
getting more and more details I think

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.350 
getting more and more details I think
even<00:02:10.470> someone<00:02:11.129> who's<00:02:11.400> would<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.209> quite
