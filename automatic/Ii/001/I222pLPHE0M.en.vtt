00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.770
 everyone 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.380
 coaching staff and players of the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.180
 national team gave their opinions 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.820
 about the outcome of the match against 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.770
 new zealand that ended with a tie 2 to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.970
 two 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.250
 against a strong selection with the 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.450
 world and the truth that says nothing and it 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.120
 saw the work that we have been doing 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.340
 physical work and it was seen that a 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.260
 selection that did not tire a selection 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.810
 who wanted to give more and always his neighborhood 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.390
 of the scoreboard and say goodbye to far power 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.120
 that's what it's about , we had a 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.950
 selection that comes from a world that does not 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.010
 has lost a game that has some 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.070
 base of the players then it was a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.500
 very good match and where they are taken 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.450
 good conclusions and good 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.829
 think about improving performance 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.290
 for the next game 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.030
 rubÃ©n israel highlighted the positive of the 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.370
 game together while the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.760
 footballers presented their points of 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.760
 view 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.020
 of 4 weeks and see physicists this is 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.120
 our first football job of 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.370
 requirement we did our association 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.220
 with a lot of rhythm with a lot of dynamics 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.290
 very physical and we control by 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.750
 moments the game very much 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.300
 positive we kept the position or the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.670
 our style and game we convert 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.860
 the goals were always ahead in the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.840
 franklin on a scoreboard and run 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.610
 many young boys who did their 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.700
 first weapons in a larger selection 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.970
 Soldier was pleased me the truth 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.000
 I was paralyzed with the thorn 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.460
 out there with a couple of precisions when 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.400
 provisions that maybe 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.310
 they cut the community for the second 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.100
 time but good we know that we come from 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.290
 kill them physical crisis and we're 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.290
 beginning to release ours 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.799
 and that's also why I want to see in all 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.289
 the elements you have and what time you 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.240
 program in the majority that knows me 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.979
 also he knows that sometimes do not stop me 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.670
 a lot but I try to get it wrong 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.590
 arch with an order that does not agree well 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.720
 but if you have to continue but if happy 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.039
 for the result that can go in 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.050
 any court go to prove and do 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:19.470
 our game if what we want to do to 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:21.480
 costa rica and good thanks to god I could 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.840
 finish it in the match physically I 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.430
 I felt good that these parties only me 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.549
 they will help a lot to stop the rhythm and 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.230
 then congratulate the group for the 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.560
 effort even though it was the first 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.420
 party and good if it's a good match and 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.810
 you have to get it out of analysis not then 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.010
 everyone is now aware what 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.230
 He changed and what needs to improve 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.030
 then these parties are for that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.299
 to get the most out of 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.170
