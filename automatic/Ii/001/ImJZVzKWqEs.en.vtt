00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 several friends sometimes have to do 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.650
 things that scare us once 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.109
 you have done something that scares me if 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.700
 for example about 8 years ago I said a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.139
 day I will tell a story lie three 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.670
 months to say today I will not count a 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.070
 good and I went out one day to tell a story and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.630
 I said I 'm going to be cool and I was shaking 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.039
 hands terribly I fear the degree 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.330
 about implemente I was left voiceless that 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.730
 night I did not sleep I had small problems 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.320
 stomachs go face over and I do not 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.029

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.529
 and he called me saying many many years 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.060
 that I could become a waiter that I did not 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.550

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.050

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.690
 in life about five years later a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.370

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.239
 vouchers but I do not have to serve a table 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.640
 nahuelhuaique from there as having 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.989
 waiter you you you you and you have to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.520
 rank those tables that is a range the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.739
 tables that you have to deal with that what 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.840

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.699
 they give you fear to do them well it was not 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.769
 Sometimes you have to do things that you 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.060
 are scary to screw it today is that if you 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.920
 I ask to go out and say no 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.390
 if indeed I must say that not 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.220

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.200
 they send to take by ass wants to leave with 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.880

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.850
 seven months they did me again in 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.080
