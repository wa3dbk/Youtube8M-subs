every<00:00:14.230> science<00:00:14.590> fiction<00:00:14.920> geeks<00:00:15.190> dream<00:00:15.460> right

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.700 

we<00:00:20.830> have<00:00:21.160> a<00:00:21.460> humanoid<00:00:22.119> 6<00:00:22.660> foot<00:00:22.930> tall<00:00:23.170> robot

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
we have a humanoid 6 foot tall robot

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.460 
we have a humanoid 6 foot tall robot
walking<00:00:24.220> around

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.070 

we're<00:00:29.310> working<00:00:29.910> under<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> grant<00:00:30.720> from<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
we're working under a grant from the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.410 
we're working under a grant from the
Navy<00:00:31.259> the<00:00:31.590> robot<00:00:32.040> we've<00:00:32.189> developed<00:00:32.460> for<00:00:33.239> this

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
Navy the robot we've developed for this

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.810 
Navy the robot we've developed for this
project<00:00:33.629> sapphire<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.730> most

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
project sapphire is one of the most

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.020 
project sapphire is one of the most
advanced<00:00:36.120> robots<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> world<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:38.030> we're

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
advanced robots in the world and we're

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.700 
advanced robots in the world and we're
very<00:00:39.059> excited<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.899> doing<00:00:40.110> stuff<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.620> no

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
very excited to be doing stuff that no

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.410 
very excited to be doing stuff that no
one<00:00:40.739> else<00:00:40.920> has<00:00:41.100> done<00:00:41.129> with<00:00:41.489> robots<00:00:41.970> so<00:00:42.239> we're

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
one else has done with robots so we're

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.970 
one else has done with robots so we're
taking<00:00:42.720> the<00:00:42.809> robot<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.500> laboratory

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
taking the robot out of the laboratory

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.229 
taking the robot out of the laboratory
and<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.430> putting<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.970> real

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and actually putting it on a real

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.319 
and actually putting it on a real
environment<00:00:45.809> such<00:00:46.019> as<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.440> USS<00:00:46.890> chef<00:00:50.329> reason

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
environment such as the USS chef reason

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.160 
environment such as the USS chef reason
why<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.540> use<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.400> yesterday<00:00:54.440> we<00:00:55.440> uh<00:00:57.170> there's

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
why we use this yesterday we uh there's

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.540 
why we use this yesterday we uh there's
all<00:00:58.409> sorts<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.800> challenges<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.430> are

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
all sorts of challenges that are

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.039 
all sorts of challenges that are
involved<00:00:59.760> when<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.089> take<00:01:00.300> robots<00:01:00.689> out<00:01:00.869> of<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
involved when you take robots out of a

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:04.729 
involved when you take robots out of a
laboratory<00:01:01.699> there's<00:01:02.699> smoke<00:01:02.939> there's<00:01:03.479> heat<00:01:03.780> we

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
laboratory there's smoke there's heat we

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.060 
laboratory there's smoke there's heat we
are<00:01:04.890> by<00:01:05.040> no<00:01:05.100> means<00:01:05.339> done<00:01:06.260> there<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.860> much

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
are by no means done there is so much

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.010 
are by no means done there is so much
more<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:09.270> make<00:01:09.420> these<00:01:09.630> something

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
more to do to make these something

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.600 
more to do to make these something
practical<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> Navy<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.430> going

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
practical that the Navy is really going

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.469 
practical that the Navy is really going
to<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.909> able<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.330> use<00:01:14.060> don't<00:01:15.060> think<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.360> going

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
to be able to use don't think it's going

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.140 
to be able to use don't think it's going
to<00:01:15.570> replace<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:17.060> it's<00:01:18.060> going<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.390> assist<00:01:18.900> you

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
to replace you it's going to assist you

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.190 
to replace you it's going to assist you
every<00:01:21.150> sailors<00:01:21.509> trained<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> firefighter

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
every sailors trained as a firefighter

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.960 
every sailors trained as a firefighter
but<00:01:22.740> that's<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.100> their<00:01:23.310> expertise<00:01:23.759> that's

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
but that's not their expertise that's

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.530 
but that's not their expertise that's
not<00:01:24.180> what<00:01:24.299> they're<00:01:24.420> doing<00:01:24.659> every<00:01:24.840> day<00:01:26.479> so<00:01:27.479> if

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
not what they're doing every day so if

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.700 
not what they're doing every day so if
you<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:27.810> about<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> support<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> Navy

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you think about the support the Navy

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.140 
you think about the support the Navy
provided<00:01:29.220> for<00:01:29.369> example<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> haiti

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
provided for example in the haiti

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.450 
provided for example in the haiti
earthquake<00:01:30.380> well<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.560> robot<00:01:31.950> you'll<00:01:32.340> be

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
earthquake well this robot you'll be

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.890 
earthquake well this robot you'll be
able<00:01:32.550> to<00:01:32.730> send<00:01:32.940> it<00:01:33.060> into<00:01:33.210> dangerous

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
able to send it into dangerous

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.260 
able to send it into dangerous
situations<00:01:34.170> without<00:01:35.159> having<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.820> send<00:01:36.060> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
situations without having to send a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:47.040 
situations without having to send a
sailor<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.990> their<00:01:37.170> first

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.660 

what<00:01:47.650> we're<00:01:47.770> seeing<00:01:47.950> here<00:01:48.100> is<00:01:48.280> something

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
what we're seeing here is something

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.010 
what we're seeing here is something
that's<00:01:48.760> never<00:01:49.060> been<00:01:49.240> done<00:01:49.450> before

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.760 

we<00:01:53.770> are<00:01:53.920> extinguishing<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.700> fire<00:01:54.729> with<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.770> robot

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
we are extinguishing a fire with a robot

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:07.830 
we are extinguishing a fire with a robot
that<00:01:57.039> is<00:01:57.100> dressed<00:01:57.640> in<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.939> tracksuit

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.330 

so<00:02:08.840> we<00:02:09.110> hope<00:02:09.290> we<00:02:09.500> can<00:02:09.680> keep<00:02:09.830> pushing<00:02:10.250> the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
so we hope we can keep pushing the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.370 
so we hope we can keep pushing the
technology<00:02:10.910> with<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.060> help<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.450> onr<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.200> stay

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
technology with the help of onr and stay

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.120 
technology with the help of onr and stay
at<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.590> forefront<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:13.190> robotics<00:02:13.730> research
