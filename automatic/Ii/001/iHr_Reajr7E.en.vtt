 d 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.910
 Hello, how is the weather report? 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.860
 from the national meteorological service 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.500
 and the weather conditions for 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.209
 this weekend are the following 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.560
 we will have the front issue number 45 that 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.180
 it stays along the north of 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.640
 however national territory in the 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.110
 24 hour forecast will be moving away to 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.029
 the south eastern part also a channel 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.800
 low pressure and therefore good 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.840
 reinforce the rains in entities of the 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.279
 center and east of the country also 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.869
 effects will be reinforced by the 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.370
 moisture input from the 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.320
 peaceful ocean as we see in the 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.510
 24-hour forecast is internal 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.000
 low pressure channel and it moves away what 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.970
 is the front system number 45 in the 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.400
 prognosis at 48 hours and finally 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.320
 fails to maintain the important effects 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.750
 front issue number 45 however it 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.060
 reactivates the surada in the gulf of mexico 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.650
 and this keeps warm temperatures in 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.020
 much of the national sector due to 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.000
 the incoming hot air coming 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.170
 from the gulf of mexico let's go with the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.780
 temperatures where we will have the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.760
 following conditions 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.369
 for the northwest part of the country the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.780
 minimum temperature 0 100 between 14 to 18 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.390
 degrees that's the maximum probably 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.670
 reach 34 degrees that yes this 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.470
 varying the region we will have increase 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.520
 of cloudiness towards the afternoon due to the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.960
 moisture input from the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.670
 peaceful ocean 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.750
 for the northeastern part of territory 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.240
 national conditions are the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.610
 following the minimum temperature between 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.110
 13 and 19 degrees Celsius in portions of 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.390
 coast to be able to reach 23 degrees 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.820
 celsius and the maximum on the coast could 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.310
 reach 34 degrees celsius rainfall 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.900
 isolated due to the presence of what 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.940
 is the low pressure channel in 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.280
 interaction with the remnants of the theme 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.140
 front number 45 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.670
 for the western central part the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.970
 conditions are the following the minimum 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.250
 between 12 to 15 and 17 degrees celsius the 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.570
 maximum can reach 28 29 degrees 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.580
 celsius also rains isolated 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.790
 associated with what is the entry of 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.470
 moisture from the Pacific Ocean 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.409
 for the southern part very conditions 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.659
 similar the minimum between 17 to 19 degrees 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.700
 and a maximum could reach in position 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.790
 of mountain at 22 to 23 degrees celsius 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.679
 in coast portion from 32 to 34 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.660
 degrees Celsius and we have increase of 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.850
 cloudiness with some rain isolated on 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.470
 the southern central part of the territory 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.810
 national due to moisture entry 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.630
 from the Pacific Ocean to the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.160
 southeast part the conditions will be of 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.800
 the following way the temperature 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.290
 minimum between 23 to 24 degrees that's the 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.880
 maximum could reach 31 to 36 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.890
 degrees that's also varying the region 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.080
 and we will have increased cloudiness in 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.209
 the course of the afternoon due to the 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.640
 presence of the low pressure channel that 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.230
 will be showing just about that 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.390
 region for the Yucatan Peninsula something 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.400
 very similar the minimum temperature of 23 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.830
 at 24 degrees is probably the maximum 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.480
 reach 37 degrees 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.030
 Celsius sky cleared during the 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.400
 morning increase in cloudiness towards 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.180
 late for that region if potential for 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.159
 rains 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.719
 for the federal district the conditions 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.670
 The following are the minimum reported 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.189
 of 14 degrees celsius the maximum could 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.560
 reach 26 degrees celsius for the 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.560
 day sunday the minimum temperature of 15 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.120
 and the maximum will be 27 something very 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.819
 similar for what is Monday the 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.500
 minimum 16 and the maximum of 27 degrees 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.750
 celsius in terms of sky conditions 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.430
 Partly cloudy sky during the 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.379
 morning and cloudiness increase towards 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.139
 late-night and we probably have 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.719
 some storm the electric led isolated 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.950
 in what is south of the federal district 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.629
 that was report from the service 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.189
 national meteorological my name is 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.709
 pamela garcÃ­a remember that we through 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:33.250
 of twitter in the conagua with low climate 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.250
 Thank you 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.010
 with water
