00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
sets up like plastic but it makes it

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.680 
sets up like plastic but it makes it
really<00:06:49.230> hard<00:06:49.350> to<00:06:49.620> find<00:06:50.040> man<00:06:50.460> when<00:06:51.270> the<00:06:51.390> starry

your show calls it something that it's
not<00:06:54.320> dick<00:06:55.400> so<00:06:56.630> there<00:06:57.630> it<00:06:57.750> is<00:06:57.870> it's<00:06:58.320> really<00:06:58.410> fine

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340

the<00:07:00.060> finishing<00:07:00.600> putty<00:07:00.890> makes<00:07:01.890> it<00:07:02.040> easy<00:07:02.220> to

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
the finishing putty makes it easy to

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.600 
the finishing putty makes it easy to
sand<00:07:02.670> blah<00:07:03.480> blah<00:07:03.630> blah<00:07:03.660> so<00:07:04.470> that<00:07:05.280> takes<00:07:05.460> care

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 
sand blah blah blah so that takes care

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.240 
sand blah blah blah so that takes care
of<00:07:05.790> those<00:07:06.000> voids<00:07:06.210> no<00:07:06.750> primer<00:07:07.050> needed<00:07:07.500> all

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
of those voids no primer needed all

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.750 
of those voids no primer needed all
probably<00:07:08.640> puts<00:07:08.880> them<00:07:09.030> on<00:07:09.500> maybe<00:07:10.580> you<00:07:11.580> never

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:11.760 
probably puts them on maybe you never

fiberglass on project pass backs deal as

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.870 
fiberglass on project pass backs deal as
this<00:07:31.050> so<00:07:31.350> Joy's<00:07:32.330> weld<00:07:33.330> was<00:07:33.630> a<00:07:33.660> little<00:07:34.020> beef<00:07:34.350> and

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 
this so Joy's weld was a little beef and

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.750 
this so Joy's weld was a little beef and
helps<00:07:35.880> keep<00:07:36.090> the<00:07:36.270> rust<00:07:36.510> out<00:07:36.840> man<00:07:37.730> fiberglass<00:07:38.730> a

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:38.760 
helps keep the rust out man fiberglass a

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.060 
helps keep the rust out man fiberglass a
little<00:07:39.240> bit<00:07:39.360> more<00:07:39.570> permanent<00:07:40.260> than<00:07:40.290> bondo<00:07:40.950> and

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.070 
little bit more permanent than bondo and

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.920 
little bit more permanent than bondo and
it'll<00:07:41.250> be<00:07:41.370> easy<00:07:41.550> to<00:07:41.670> sand<00:07:42.060> it<00:07:42.210> down<00:07:42.270> and<00:07:42.660> shape

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:42.930 
it'll be easy to sand it down and shape

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.850 
it'll be easy to sand it down and shape
it<00:07:43.110> and<00:07:43.290> then<00:07:43.490> use<00:07:44.490> some<00:07:44.880> of<00:07:45.060> that<00:07:45.090> uh<00:07:45.860> ultimate
