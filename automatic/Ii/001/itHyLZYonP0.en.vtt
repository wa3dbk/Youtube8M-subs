00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.310
 You have already checked out the merciless Soviet 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:18.990
 posters stop my name is kadriya 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.730
 i will tell you how it will come out 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.750
 occurred in the music world for 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.359
 last time 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.760
 but first let me have one question 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.590
 today listened will render you scholastic on 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.520
 song of your sweet song 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.370
 and from the original night be but almost 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.320
 I understand in the song of the earth until the fig write 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.110
 cameras which is almost exactly 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.270
 repeats the original song 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.219
 do you really want to be in time 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.309
 what that is you can't go to 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.800
 karaoke club and beating health there for me 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.239
 so the edge should be different from the original 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.520
 even along the girl's style of manner 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.449
 the performer takes another song 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.520
 and write and about your form is not that 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.140
 for example zebrahead did a cover on 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.140
 gwen stefani sweet escape song 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:30.470
 quail that quail or vanessa 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:33.860
 paradis made a frame or somehow it took a star 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:42.009
 transfer for bogside or how had that 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:44.780
 the song itself or what I get now 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.890
 for lovers of life hacking lips broth muzzle 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.360
 would be saved by the bitterness 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.229
 if you really like creativity 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.540
 usually fell stupid listen nike 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.290
 Felicitas Germany and civil metal 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.110
 pore or 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.510
 alternatively metal and anyone 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.180
 having a huge concert experience double a 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.940
 also a bunch of paper characters and so on but 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.220
 these stupid really seems to be those 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.400
 that they have both women on the grill 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.310
 then it becomes unclear here these 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.069
 positioned as a metalcore she here 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.290
 these here did the carpet in panglos pop 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.290
 ok i like a normal draw diode 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.269
 news group showed their first single with 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.730
 upcoming album jones which 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.040
 called Tsarikova as it turned out this 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.260
 the album is the same as in my previous ones 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.780
 two was inspired by the events that 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.280
 happening now in the world i mean 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.379
 events related to the war 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.739
 global warming and so on 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.959
 you are probably interested in my opinion well my 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.629
 opinion as such a devoted fan 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.819
 groups of news me this song is not that 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.500
 enjoyed at the same time i can't 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.530
 say she doesn't give me anything 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.220
 liked this such a typical song 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.900
 written in the style of news 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.480
 british indie band franz ferdinand and 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.090
 american poproke duo sports announced 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.040

 video primer coming album which 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.609
 demonstrates the domino principle details 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.620

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.629
 however, it became known that the producer 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.090
 this release will come out jong he was the one 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.989
 who previously worked slack martin and 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.760
 modest mouse 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.129
 and in June they are already going on tour 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.319
 java game do some bands think 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.299
 that they are so hopelessly unpopular 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.919
 that decides to unite with others 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:41.370
 hopeless fashionable veterans 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:44.159
 impatiently ngu 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.650
 the index which comes out March 31 avid 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:53.060
 so to speak the corpse on the ladies of the collective this 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.060
 album like it was bravely chicken 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.260
 true he was two weeks ago from 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.449
 American group Braiko given slider 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.580
 Sans who also understand what the hell 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.540
 style plays though in the place where I donâ€™t 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:38.500
 I read three words already 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:41.740
 post-hardcore hut now resentment 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.440
 soft dredging future sound 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.250
 based inks ordinary electron 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.590
 tempo 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.870
 often sounds about different soundtracks 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.360
 movies as background music 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.270
 for example bukletik one of the albums 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.370
 brian eno was written music embird 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.840
 designed to achieve peace of mind 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:05.000
 and space to think and therefore 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.190
 even me with my sick fantasy is difficult 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.229
 imagine how one group can 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.440
 unite so two different 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:15.260
 genre it doesn't matter they probably 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.740
 brilliant musicians so here is project 3 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:22.400
 bottom I usually pass by such news 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.430
 but there is such a cool spoon and expensive power 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.690
 no title and such a shitty song 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.700
 and quickly eskimo callboy March 20 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.220
 comes out a new bolt which is called 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.440
 most likely I even did 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:41.200
 small video review for this album 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.200
 because it is one of those few
