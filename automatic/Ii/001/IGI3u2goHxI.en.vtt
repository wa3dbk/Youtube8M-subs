I<00:05:21.740> don't<00:05:21.980> really<00:05:22.160> know

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
I don't really know

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.940 
I don't really know
it's<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.540> SC<00:05:24.260> 500<00:05:25.100> vo<00:05:25.790> or<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.540> exact<00:05:27.470> model

it's the SC 500 vo or the exact model

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.140 
it's the SC 500 vo or the exact model
and<00:05:28.390> then<00:05:29.390> for<00:05:30.200> your<00:05:30.320> motor<00:05:30.560> setup<00:05:31.030> you<00:05:32.030> have

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
and then for your motor setup you have

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.070 
and then for your motor setup you have
the<00:05:32.330> Reedy<00:05:32.650> 3,300<00:05:33.650> kv<00:05:34.130> motor<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:36.280> for<00:05:37.280> your

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
the Reedy 3,300 kv motor and for your

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.780 
the Reedy 3,300 kv motor and for your
shocks<00:05:39.100> you<00:05:40.100> have<00:05:41.560> black<00:05:42.560> Springs<00:05:43.070> which

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
shocks you have black Springs which

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.640 
shocks you have black Springs which
isn't<00:05:44.030> even<00:05:44.420> a<00:05:44.510> part<00:05:44.750> of<00:05:44.870> the<00:05:44.930> spring<00:05:45.260> tuning

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
isn't even a part of the spring tuning

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.420 
isn't even a part of the spring tuning
kit<00:05:45.830> it's<00:05:45.980> so<00:05:46.130> soft<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:47.800> 30-weight<00:05:48.800> shot<00:05:49.100> coil

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
kit it's so soft and 30-weight shot coil

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.000 
kit it's so soft and 30-weight shot coil
again<00:05:49.960> which<00:05:50.960> are<00:05:51.110> you<00:05:51.230> really<00:05:51.410> soft<00:05:51.740> so<00:05:51.860> we're

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
again which are you really soft so we're

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.310 
again which are you really soft so we're
going<00:05:52.100> to<00:05:52.190> go<00:05:52.310> up<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:53.000> spring<00:05:53.360> rates<00:05:53.660> and<00:05:53.930> the

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
going to go up to spring rates and the

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.400 
going to go up to spring rates and the
rear<00:05:54.530> and<00:05:54.830> brown<00:05:55.550> is<00:05:55.910> on<00:05:56.150> the<00:05:56.480> front<00:05:56.960> to<00:05:57.260> make

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
rear and brown is on the front to make

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:05.380 
rear and brown is on the front to make
it<00:05:58.780> and<00:05:59.780> then<00:06:01.180> the<00:06:02.180> rear<00:06:02.420> tires<00:06:02.750> are<00:06:04.390> pretty

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
it and then the rear tires are pretty

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.630 
it and then the rear tires are pretty
much<00:06:05.830> jump<00:06:06.830> they're<00:06:07.040> not<00:06:07.190> going<00:06:07.400> to<00:06:07.490> work

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
much jump they're not going to work

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.000 
much jump they're not going to work
really<00:06:08.210> anywhere<00:06:08.720> I<00:06:08.960> mean<00:06:09.470> they<00:06:09.620> may<00:06:09.770> work

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
really anywhere I mean they may work

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.010 
really anywhere I mean they may work
somewhere<00:06:10.940> but<00:06:12.280> from<00:06:13.280> where<00:06:13.490> our<00:06:13.880> track<00:06:14.750> if

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
somewhere but from where our track if

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.650 
somewhere but from where our track if
they're<00:06:15.230> not<00:06:15.380> going<00:06:15.590> to<00:06:15.680> work<00:06:15.830> there<00:06:16.010> like<00:06:16.040> a

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
they're not going to work there like a

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.010 
they're not going to work there like a
mock-up<00:06:17.660> of<00:06:18.080> the<00:06:18.760> proline<00:06:19.760> pole<00:06:20.360> shots<00:06:20.720> and

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
mock-up of the proline pole shots and

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.050 
mock-up of the proline pole shots and
they<00:06:21.950> just<00:06:22.190> don't<00:06:23.120> work<00:06:23.420> the<00:06:24.550> tire<00:06:25.550> compound

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
they just don't work the tire compound

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.060 
they just don't work the tire compound
and<00:06:26.660> falling<00:06:27.140> it's<00:06:27.470> alright<00:06:27.830> it's<00:06:28.010> pretty

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
and falling it's alright it's pretty

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.910 
and falling it's alright it's pretty
soft<00:06:28.490> and<00:06:28.700> then<00:06:29.450> the<00:06:29.570> Front's<00:06:29.990> are<00:06:30.110> probably

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
soft and then the Front's are probably

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.330 
soft and then the Front's are probably
soft<00:06:31.340> or<00:06:31.700> medium<00:06:32.830> so<00:06:33.830> that<00:06:33.980> does<00:06:34.640> it<00:06:34.670> for<00:06:35.060> the

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
soft or medium so that does it for the

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.310 
soft or medium so that does it for the
unboxing<00:06:37.330> of<00:06:37.860> next<00:06:38.860> be<00:06:39.010> 4.2<00:06:39.910> I<00:06:40.150> hope<00:06:41.020> you<00:06:41.199> guys

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
unboxing of next be 4.2 I hope you guys

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.080 
unboxing of next be 4.2 I hope you guys
liked<00:06:42.070> it<00:06:42.220> that<00:06:42.520> was<00:06:42.639> kind<00:06:42.880> of<00:06:42.940> our<00:06:43.060> first

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
liked it that was kind of our first

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.650 
liked it that was kind of our first
unboxing<00:06:43.570> we<00:06:44.199> took<00:06:44.410> in<00:06:44.699> real<00:06:45.699> detail<00:06:46.360> about

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
unboxing we took in real detail about

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.689 
unboxing we took in real detail about
all<00:06:46.900> the<00:06:47.110> specs<00:06:47.850> these<00:06:48.850> buggies<00:06:49.389> are<00:06:49.540> great

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 
all the specs these buggies are great

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:54.240 
all the specs these buggies are great
I'd<00:06:51.699> recommend<00:06:52.330> them<00:06:52.419> for<00:06:52.620> other<00:06:53.620> people<00:06:54.130> to

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
I'd recommend them for other people to

buy yeah so we can fix them here's

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.800 
buy yeah so we can fix them here's
antenna<00:07:02.860> Gotha<00:07:03.340> that's<00:07:03.910> just<00:07:04.090> something<00:07:04.449> not

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
antenna Gotha that's just something not

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.530 
antenna Gotha that's just something not
gonna<00:07:05.260> affect<00:07:05.919> performance<00:07:06.190> anything<00:07:06.910> but

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
gonna affect performance anything but

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.200 
gonna affect performance anything but
mine<00:07:07.870> came<00:07:08.290> and<00:07:08.620> it<00:07:08.889> wasn't<00:07:09.070> even<00:07:09.400> up<00:07:09.550> so<00:07:10.479> I<00:07:11.070> but

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210 
mine came and it wasn't even up so I but

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.879 
mine came and it wasn't even up so I but
that's<00:07:13.210> pretty<00:07:13.389> much<00:07:13.510> it

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:14.889 
that's pretty much it

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:18.120 
that's pretty much it
