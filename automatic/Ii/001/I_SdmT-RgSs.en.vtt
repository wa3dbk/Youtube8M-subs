00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:14.049
 the new gay age 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:16.869
 good pity, I said people beauty zé bita 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.420
 tank in the new area bringing another 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.670
 commented video produced this time 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.530
 good guys a really fast video 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.670
 but it is to clear the question and also 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.680
 answer what many people ask me 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.579
 to talk about 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.649
 z your playstation 4 gets very hot in 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.649
 some difference between places 14 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.829
 bought in europe with the mexican version 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.530
 with an expensive American version, I'll do it 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.219
 is what exactly to speak 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.670
 respect to this matter is already 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.670
 let's say so sorry for every 10 people me 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.559
 ask me, do you know that? 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.870
 respect to this matter if the playstation 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.049
 4 that much if I have any 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.420
 tip to give this video well then 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:10.240
 to talk about exactly where 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:14.440
 is the complex that was clear dead and 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.140
 a playstation 4 ac and good it is 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.350
 connected neither as you can see and what 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.810
 a lot of people are talking about yours 14 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.850
 very warms the USA and its the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.250
 very hot guy 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.320
 I will not be the one for you normally. 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.170
 logical that they want it a little because 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.260
 I got it all electronic guy heats up 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.640
 I want every electronic type you notice 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.350
 that your cell phone 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.880
 it will warm up if you use it 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.970
 very much your your router hands from here 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.970
 It will also warm up if you let 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.160
 always connected, kind of obvious, knows everything 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.150
 electronic warm up for that. 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.340
 inevitable 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.760
 It's taking nintendo wii from nintendo 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.820
 extinct nor does it mention cafuné unb 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.690
 the now in the case of the next frame he 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.340
 it will heat up 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.800
 It's obvious that it goes but I always try 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.080
 avoid the most of them it is still 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.530
 very expensive because many people who 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.900
 have this 14 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.930
 who always complains to my 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.400
 playstation 4 warms up more than anything 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.290
 expensive fifth more qq iron ii than iron 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.550
 in the hot sun is connected to the left 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.069
 more than anything 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.800
 but the guy has to have the notion of 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:34.100
 he wants to be able to right console 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.890
 the guy and many times I've seen people I 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.040
 I already saw on YouTube that whenever ever 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.280
 complained of the console getting too hot 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.250
 but points the person leaves the console 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.160
 leaning against the wall comes a ringing 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.530
 books on top of the island place another 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.290
 human video game console 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.390
 There she talks to me like you do not 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.690
 You'll want it warm up, it's obvious. 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.330
 because what does the console does not 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.450
 so much heat is precisely the output of 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.230
 air on it's and the playstation air series 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.950
 4 is exactly in this part right here is 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.930
 on the back of it then the user 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.329
 You have to leave freely here by 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.549
 right back and lots of people 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.640
 put the game stick to the agreement 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.310
 capping all and the day is expensive 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.829
 I cover it, it will not heat up there, I'll 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.390
 I tell you the guy who was even the console. 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:35.600
 so my tip is always leave an area 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.450
 back here from the island of free clean well 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.950
 for cleaning is also a keyword 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.260
 for example 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.890
 here you see I think there's a lot 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.079
 of yarn netinho is a lot of yarn but 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.250
 that if I left it all scattered 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.890
 on here 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.790
 Like it if I left it all together 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.959
 here behind 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.690
 it is obvious that the area would be smaller to proar 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.840
 leave the console freely then what 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.090
 I always try to do is let it be 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.280
 carol a little something that's what 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.530
 there is no face defect that is precisely 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.600
 the team to hold the movies here 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.930
 understood precisely to have an area 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.859
 even greater to put the console to serve the 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.769
 your console is up in front of the type 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.569
 here is a console and here it is on the type table 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:29.270
 and is even a little ahead of the table 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:32.360
 more open space is air hereinbefore Pro 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.900
 able to move freely without any 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.370
 business of this kind without anything being 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.750
 disturbing 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.229
 something else that I find very interesting 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.569
 and we'll always have an expensive flannel one 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.180
 flanelinha that a cloth anything 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:49.970
 that is because hand 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.970
 one of the great things that staff 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.060
 There you go, it's just the dirt, man. 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.699
 always try to keep the console in the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.349
 clean possible knowing that the output 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:05.150
 of air he always tries to put the 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:08.509
 put in the time always tries to leave the 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.389
 console is as dust-free as possible 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:15.080
 let's say the wires you see here oo 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:17.539
 son of hdmi he goes out next door 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.729
 is not that cluster here behind the 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.620
 and see that he leaves it already. 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.139
 since precisely to leave this 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.560
 area as free as possible 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:30.440
 there you talk z there is a cooler one 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.270
 cooler that you put here in the 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.279
 back of the console 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.830
 I do not know if you have already seen who you want 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:40.490
 Let's find out where I am from Nikko if 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.949
 I can not be wrong, it's his brand or 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.139
 how do you fit back here and he 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.620
 has several several done this several 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.870
 curves even if they take in I 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.969
 I can not tell if it's good or bad if 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.279
 works or does not work because 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:58.219
 I do not have can not talk 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:06:00.680
 so man I do not think it's necessary is 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:03.949
 Kind's good and I will not say it would be 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.500
 bad or would be nice because I do not 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.960
 I have and who knows forward until 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.909
 against 11 but I can not speak if 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.129
 works or does not work because I do not 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:15.680
 I 'm not going to guarantee anything for 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:18.740
 You guys I was not sure so good. 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.190
 Who the hell is this guy he kept 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.680
 always leave the console clean with nothing 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.490
 around because there are expensive people who 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.069
 puts the console inside a type of a 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:34.430
 space of a square so with the air 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:35.529
 it gets crowded and brings no 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.169
 circulation 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:40.359
 knows then wallet always take care of your 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.429
 console that you can be sure will not 

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:44.859
 be the region you bought it not 

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:47.229
 will be the Canadian version 

00:06:44.859 --> 00:06:48.969
 American version will not be 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:51.879
 This will make your console and yes 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:54.609
 You who can power as he has 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:56.709
 understand what to say so morning is the 

00:06:54.609 --> 00:07:00.939
 My tip I spent here some of them 

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:03.639
 not as good as that I do not think 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:05.649
 There's a lot more to talk about, it's not obvious. 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.869
 each one puts the giant upon 

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:10.839
 console in put people who had a 

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:13.539
 son and book puts puts a lot of 

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:15.999
 shit on the console and then talk 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:18.369
 who does not want it to heat up, and also 

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:19.659
 want to do with the console but good was 

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:22.089
 that's exactly what I wanted to say to you 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:24.279

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:26.079
