 boxing you see the title puts a boxing 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.090
 will put 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.690
 the finished ones that do not get up 50 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.000
 minutes and all that but I'm a bit a 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.570
 little fine good a new helmets that 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.360
 are some subsonic x this something that are 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.699
 here you have it 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.860
 it has brought a couple of little things this 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.379
 between them the truth is that I was already 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.820
 missing since I had some cases do not have 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.810
 models are not even extras with 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.510
 pretty bad that the ear was were 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.990
 and when I threw at the best one hour 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.990
 followed 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.790
 in the package 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.520
 bitter person and I do not know what 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.200
 by psuv they are and this is not 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.880
 compatible with pc with play 3 xbox if 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.369
 You see it 's a bit written when 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.060
 the light with the house and all that and the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.610
 Wonder camera had died 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.799
 are compatible with all three with 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.570
 platforms I suppose that maybe 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.770
 should compatible complicated 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.159
 Juan but he has not tried them 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.539
 has the microphone is not removable is 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.409
 this can be moved a little more but 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.109
 good ok we have 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.620
 it's pretty soft to the headset for 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.250
 burn every year 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.670
 has noise cancellation that has not 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.020
 tried but not so much 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.440
 this is the sound driver that is 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.960
 to lower the volume and so on how it goes 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:02.460
 and has almost 4 meters of cable 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.380
 the four because that's how the tower was and 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.760
 that behind him is the table all the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.149
 I turn the table and connect the 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.700
 look a bit of 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.010
 I want an instruction manual because 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.540
 it comes as how beings are going to be 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.200
 noises they are making now 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.160
 porlamar 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.050
 building 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.290
 well to instructions what is each 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.190
 thing like commenting on the different 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.100
 platforms either the xbox or hdmi with 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.530
 component cable the play and all that 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.340
 and of course there is the pc 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.459
 here 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.330
 this week disocial here comes the 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.300
 package then we have 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.700
 we opened the headphones with microphone 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.220
 basic that comes from just a simple 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.660
 jack input and others and a half that only 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.080
 that carry all the mobile computers 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.080
 and else 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.329
 the volume controller and it also comes 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:04.680
 that is, we can connect to 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:07.610
 through this here and we have here the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.190
 choir we have a lot of cable 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.710
 and we have here the volume control of 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.900
 chat the game that the computer only 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.290
 Functional games and chat nobels 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.290
 if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.020
 the microphone driver to enter 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.030
 and turn off here manifold 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.670
 of growth also in three and a half 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.560
 because here we connect the microphone to the 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.410
 xbox equal when the xbox 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.880
 and on the other side of the cable we already have a 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.610
 usb input to connect it to the 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.160
 computer acosol and a jack input 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.989
 three and a half times an exit already in three and 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.300
 medium so hard and I think it's entrance 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.239
 we have is the television to listen 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.600
 the game when we are connected to 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:55.480
 we connect the person 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.480
 then he shows us 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:06.460
 the channel the sound buyer with the 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.460
 I send the little one a small 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:15.670
 and finally we have the adapter that 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.670
 connects us the average usb chelsea 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.080
 that is, it is used for our 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.000
 televisions and others I do not need this 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.860
 luckily I already have I would find 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.270
 we can be and it does not bother me much 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.949
 so 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.389
 first station a horn now you're going to 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.139
