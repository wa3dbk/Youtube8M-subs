00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.470
 and therefore a warm welcome too 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.500
 a small round with a lot more 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.740
 eleven pieces and eleven holes that both 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.039
 that's exactly what we have 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.590
 still in our magic factory like 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.430
 you can see 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.350
 21 12 and 21 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.300
 besides, we only have 6800 gold 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.980
 that means we can do exactly six times 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.330
 you might even want to visit 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.640
 draw out a little money seven more 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.640
 can say we can do exactly 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.809
 seven times press and claus will now 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.250
 do something and if we do 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.200
 take because I'm with my gold like that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.200
 good as to zero 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.489
 no, that's too easy 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.899
 that means we have to find something 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.539
 we do not have much time there 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.539
 somehow even after challenge just that 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.380
 you could do it 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.479
 but with walk- through James's Palace 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:16.049
 are multi remove us there I am 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:18.330
 always a bit careful journalist 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.150
 we take two pages to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.650
 top left and top right with james 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.180
 palace with cool directly behind 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.799
 the giants will probably first 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.150
 times on the mat first send the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.250
 Giant go that the here also the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.140
 archery theme is not all 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.750
 two years later 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.490
 now they should actually go there 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.930
 and now I will gladly do the rest 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.810
 at the giant send afterwards from the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.750
 pages on both sides tomorrow 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.450
 I need the jazz fans 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.380
 Do not walk now and only 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.630
 announce sea 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.280
 now soon classify the guys here and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.140
 the remaining reactors are now running 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.079
 hopefully including pure 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.030
 The Giants have all jumped in 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.280
 Felt balls are debating 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.680
 Still working but the vehicles 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.969
 come now also practiced a dance 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.540
 We still have the look left to say 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.920
 we little here in the corner 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.420
 so that the whole army gets busy 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.080
 over there were at the start 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.080
 We also have the big ones 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.370
 Do it right on the radar if even more 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.840
 two respect that means we can only 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.470
 actually sit down here right now 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.480
 hit perfectly 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.580
 that does not work often but sometimes 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.910
 works that are a bobbahn alive yes 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.590
 there are alive 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.970
 the schnetzeln yes right 53 percent 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.780
 Vienna is still alive at the top were king 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.170
 died 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.300
 the quantity still raises where they then 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.990
 Access in the middle instead of only there 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.910
 and we still speak one German 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.260
 I would say we left here 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.580
 the middle goes faster and how safe 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.060
 you get because doors are always 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.930
 four more over here alive 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.430
 beautiful on far, I know very well 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.160
 is not that good but that smells 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.100
 So in it you look like hardcore again 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.090
 guisan gold camp around you go 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.040
 do not you think you commanded 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.970
 with her fists level 7 one 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.440
 not to forget giant 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.730
 you can also see the optics here 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.020
 the only thing I changed a lot 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.310
 she still has these golden ones 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.540
 cuffs in the first picture 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.890
 I thought it was kind of ugly but im 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.540
 However, the end effect is pretty good 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.940
 and so hit next one 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.090
 I now reach into relief camps but 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:35.370
 to archers kings and mark 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:37.080
 and without a wonderfully good booty bonus 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.200
 we even had a decent load 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.459
 I say consciously acceptable and yes now 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.260
 there's a second round of the second 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.680
 round we use now as you see 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.220
 can 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.380
 24 these twelve meters 8 witches again 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.390
 our kings of this type displays and 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.910
 the same fun from the front as I would 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.320
 say again from the top around the whole 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.500
 we can vary a bit from 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.440
 grab below 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.270
 maybe in time 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.390
 that looks pretty good burglar 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.780
 afterwards and the witches in the middle 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.010
 All look ahead on the skeletal remains 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.330
 rally are still a few times I have 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.930
 afterwards the times with these but out 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.290
 get out of Berlin and now that we look 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.550
 the jazz fans maybe 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:26.370
 sit down here at the corner and 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.710
 Hilfswerk on top of that I think I would 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.840
 I like to believe this right now 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.540
 everything is beautiful and my skeletonis are jumping 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.970
 they are all still alive 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.730
 but we need not need any help 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.780
 we are here now and maybe in 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.630
 hang over it 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.160
 I think that maybe whole village in 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.420
 the spot is a joke if you can 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.730
 the children are still igniting the giants 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.860
 because of losing a lot of work 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.270
 not really his life explosion 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.800
 was a king is still alive 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.080
 else alive below slides 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.590
 nothing up here are skeletons and 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.730
 Witches have been traveling dead 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.350
 for the most part it will be a further 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.270
 worse , it just happens when it gets 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.150
 even more ignited 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.410
 james bell if we where the skeletons 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.640
 are all my skeletons and form are 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.100
 that rather little and tree does not jump 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.880
 it will then say okay take care 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.350
 around the city hall and now a gamble 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.610
 here in the corner so we the 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.870
 area damage here relatively fast we 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.960
 can get 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:32.600
 do not bring the magician tour into the 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:36.140
 in the middle do not hop the marker tower 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.480
 God forbid what are you doing right now 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.590
 66 percent yes still too many 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.880
 archer tim and cannons and 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.410
 hesslers but live that creates mine 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.410
 queen are alive with the pioneers 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.670
 not though the witches are the 1000 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.080
 Focus out now against the witches or 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:53.700
 The team's last witch is dying now 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.260
 Ministers remained 66 percent so it is 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.460
 what the Valkyrie made next to 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.450
 the witches are not so good now 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.670
 get it again is a rad 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.660
 been rented in wonderland 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.960
 maybe I'll do it with it 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.420
 these troops combination attackers that 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.680
 problem is in my opinion lizard man 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.540
 my heroes are extremely low and 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.980
 my world also on the account and 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.970
 so rather against radis new 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.870
 try to tristan and straight with 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.490
 Such names really recommend 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.600
 With giants you can be really good with 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.510
 witches that is maybe explain 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.020
 Advance troop combination if you want 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.500
 not so high golems but has none 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.710
 case 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.380
 troopers might possibly blab if 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.660
 you guess the 9th 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.820
 You could think that over 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.110
 I graf halt halt frequently so dear 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.370
 rad that my head is not on the 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.160
 Bloody finally got me used to it 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.570
 otherwise always comes on the load and then 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.990
 I always seeking for so long so it makes 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.370
 more sense 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.770
 finally let thumbs thumb 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.570
 above that would be happy and otherwise 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.110
 I would like to give you a nice one 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:53.360
 weekend day after day or evening 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:57.790
 apocalypse is doing well until the next one 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.790
 hashtag apocalypse
