interesting back to it yeah look here
this<00:00:40.539> this<00:00:40.929> this<00:00:41.170> this<00:00:41.230> is<00:00:41.649> where<00:00:41.859> the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:42.729 
this this this this is where the

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.809 
this this this this is where the
connectors<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:44.019> sim<00:00:44.229> card<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.429> 3g

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:45.819 
connectors and the sim card for the 3g

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:48.180 
connectors and the sim card for the 3g
would<00:00:46.030> go<00:00:46.239> and<00:00:46.659> it's<00:00:46.809> sealed<00:00:47.079> away<00:00:47.199> in<00:00:47.890> a

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
would go and it's sealed away in a

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.619 
would go and it's sealed away in a
separate<00:00:48.519> unit<00:00:48.819> that<00:00:48.940> actually<00:00:48.969> makes<00:00:49.420> it

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
separate unit that actually makes it

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.009 
separate unit that actually makes it
extremely<00:00:50.409> easy<00:00:51.129> to<00:00:51.760> hold<00:00:52.329> it's<00:00:52.719> actually<00:00:52.809> the

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
extremely easy to hold it's actually the

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.619 
extremely easy to hold it's actually the
easiest<00:00:53.409> do<00:00:54.190> android<00:00:54.819> device<00:00:55.059> I've<00:00:55.269> ever<00:00:55.389> held

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
easiest do android device I've ever held

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.270 
easiest do android device I've ever held
in<00:00:55.719> my<00:00:55.780> hands<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.499> I<00:00:56.710> think<00:00:56.889> this<00:00:56.979> is<00:00:57.129> really

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
in my hands and I think this is really

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.500 
in my hands and I think this is really
interesting<00:00:57.519> and<00:00:57.850> look<00:00:57.999> at<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.120> image<00:00:58.329> behind

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
interesting and look at the image behind

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.090 
interesting and look at the image behind
and<00:00:59.289> that's<00:00:59.469> exactly<00:00:59.589> where<00:01:00.039> they're<00:01:00.249> aiming

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and that's exactly where they're aiming

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.730 
and that's exactly where they're aiming
this<00:01:03.100> could<00:01:03.489> make<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.909> really<00:01:04.330> good

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:04.740 
this could make a really good

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.240 
this could make a really good
exploration<00:01:05.740> device<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:06.100> course<00:01:06.310> gps<00:01:08.039> gps<00:01:09.039> is

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
exploration device of course gps gps is

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.609 
exploration device of course gps gps is
included<00:01:09.700> on<00:01:09.789> this<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:11.140> checking<00:01:11.469> on<00:01:11.590> the

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
included on this just checking on the

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.370 
included on this just checking on the
GPS

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
GPS

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.170 
GPS
so<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.189> will<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.399> product<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.850> will<00:01:15.000> have

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
so this will be a product that will have

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.630 
so this will be a product that will have
GPS<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.469> got<00:01:16.590> angry<00:01:16.890> birds<00:01:17.070> showing<00:01:17.430> here

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
GPS now we got angry birds showing here

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.050 
GPS now we got angry birds showing here
but<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.270> course<00:01:18.619> navigation<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:20.340> Google<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
but of course navigation on Google and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.859 
but of course navigation on Google and
long<00:01:21.750> battery<00:01:21.990> life<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.350> really<00:01:22.740> key<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.970> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
long battery life is really key for this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.569 
long battery life is really key for this
sort<00:01:25.079> of<00:01:25.140> stuff<00:01:25.289> with<00:01:25.649> three<00:01:25.890> jagged<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.399> this

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
sort of stuff with three jagged see this

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:27.919 
sort of stuff with three jagged see this
being<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.850> really<00:01:27.060> nice<00:01:27.179> solution<00:01:27.479> for

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
being a really nice solution for

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:29.929 
being a really nice solution for
adventurous<00:01:28.860> people<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
adventurous people like that in the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.569 
adventurous people like that in the
background<00:01:30.119> there<00:01:30.960> some<00:01:31.770> more<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> specs

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
background there some more on the specs

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.080

capacitive multi-touch tested that could
actually<00:01:51.869> show<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:53.490> here<00:01:53.789> if<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.119> do

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
actually show that that here if we do

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.800 
actually show that that here if we do
Angry<00:01:55.409> Birds<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.179> that<00:01:57.179> angry<00:01:57.780> birds

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810
