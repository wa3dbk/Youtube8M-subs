00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
Washington it was like super pigmented

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.710 
Washington it was like super pigmented
really<00:00:23.189> bright<00:00:23.460> blue<00:00:23.820> like<00:00:24.119> along<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> lower

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
really bright blue like along the lower

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.870 
really bright blue like along the lower
lash<00:00:24.990> line<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.920> was<00:00:26.010> like<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> dark<00:00:26.519> smoky

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
lash line and it was like a dark smoky

black<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> lid<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.199> kind<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.590> thought

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
black on the lid but I kind of thought

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.320 
black on the lid but I kind of thought
it<00:00:28.859> would<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.099> pretty<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.730> kind<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.119> add

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
it would be pretty and kind of like add

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.910 
it would be pretty and kind of like add
a<00:00:30.359> little<00:00:30.630> bit<00:00:30.720> more<00:00:30.869> color<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.740> said

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
a little bit more color so like I said

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.799 
a little bit more color so like I said
this<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.250> loosely<00:00:32.820> based<00:00:32.940> off<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.329> her<00:00:33.600> look

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
this is loosely based off of her look

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.270 
this is loosely based off of her look
