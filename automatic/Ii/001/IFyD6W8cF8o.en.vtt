lot different um you can see like it

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.030 
lot different um you can see like it
doesn't<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.840> slide<00:01:13.260> out<00:01:13.500> or<00:01:13.799> anything

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
like that the texture is a lot thicker

like that the texture is a lot thicker
in<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.320> older<00:01:16.680> formula<00:01:17.100> versus<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> new<00:01:18.000> one

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180

in the older formula versus the new one
you<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.450> how<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.689> taking<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.080> little<00:01:19.200> bit<00:01:19.350> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
time for it to drop back down it still

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.910 
time for it to drop back down it still
looks<00:01:21.420> kind<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.470> looks<00:01:22.619> kind<00:01:22.799> like

it's kind of snotty looking kinda looks
like<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.680> that's<00:01:52.860> probably<00:01:53.070> where<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.430> lot

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
like this so that's probably where a lot

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.310 
like this so that's probably where a lot
of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.820> texture<00:01:54.149> comes<00:01:54.390> from<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.960> also

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
of the texture comes from and also

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.679 
of the texture comes from and also
glycerin<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.009> very<00:01:56.189> sticky<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
glycerin is very sticky so the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.999 
glycerin is very sticky so the
ingredients<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> curling<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.710> at<00:01:58.860> play

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
are identical to the old formula but I

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.080 
are identical to the old formula but I
don't<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:01.950> why<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.159> consistency<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:02.939> so

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
don't know why the consistency is so

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.700 
don't know why the consistency is so

hair<00:04:37.349> and<00:04:37.430> soft<00:04:38.430> when<00:04:38.789> I<00:04:38.819> use<00:04:38.970> on<00:04:39.120> dry<00:04:39.360> hair<00:04:39.660> the

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
hair and soft when I use on dry hair the

hair and soft when I use on dry hair the
summer<00:04:40.349> time<00:04:40.560> is<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.740> lot<00:04:40.889> different<00:04:41.250> because

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
summer time is a lot different because

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.339 
summer time is a lot different because
the<00:04:41.910> humectants<00:04:42.210> start<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.810> react<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.080> the

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
the humectants start to react to the

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.020 
the humectants start to react to the
humidity<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.009> things<00:04:44.220> like<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:44.550> and<00:04:44.789> my

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
humidity and things like that and my

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.980 
humidity and things like that and my
hair<00:04:45.240> remains<00:04:45.509> soft

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
hair remains soft

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.469

regardless<00:04:46.860> wet<00:04:47.250> or<00:04:47.400> dry<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.819> stickiness<00:04:48.300> is

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
regardless wet or dry the stickiness is

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.120 
regardless wet or dry the stickiness is
still<00:04:48.690> apparent<00:04:49.139> during<00:04:49.319> the<00:04:49.500> summer<00:04:49.680> time<00:04:49.919> in

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
still apparent during the summer time in

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.650 
still apparent during the summer time in
the<00:04:50.160> warmer<00:04:50.430> weather<00:04:50.550> so<00:04:51.120> you<00:04:51.180> don't<00:04:51.539> really

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
the warmer weather so you don't really

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.270 
the warmer weather so you don't really
get<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:51.870> break<00:04:52.050> from<00:04:52.169> that<00:04:52.410> I've<00:04:52.770> seen<00:04:52.949> reviews

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
get a break from that I've seen reviews

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.409 
get a break from that I've seen reviews
where<00:04:53.490> people<00:04:53.520> were<00:04:53.819> saying<00:04:54.000> that<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.270> takes

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
where people were saying that it takes

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.140 
where people were saying that it takes
their<00:04:54.630> hair<00:04:54.810> longer<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.620> dry<00:04:55.860> when<00:04:56.849> they<00:04:56.970> have

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
their hair longer to dry when they have

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.189 
their hair longer to dry when they have
this<00:04:57.270> product<00:04:57.509> in<00:04:57.690> their<00:04:57.840> hair<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.020> that's

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
this product in their hair and that's

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.379 
this product in their hair and that's
just<00:04:58.410> probably<00:04:58.650> depending<00:04:59.580> on<00:04:59.789> you<00:05:00.180> know<00:05:00.210> the

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
just probably depending on you know the

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.670 
just probably depending on you know the
temperature<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:00.990> they're<00:05:01.320> using<00:05:01.620> the

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
temperature that they're using the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.100 
temperature that they're using the
products<00:05:02.039> in<00:05:02.130> so<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:02.880> know<00:05:03.150> if<00:05:03.419> it's<00:05:03.840> really

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
products in so you know if it's really

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.400 
products in so you know if it's really
warm

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
warm

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.570

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
it may take your hair a little bit

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.999 
it may take your hair a little bit
longer<00:05:05.910> to<00:05:06.389> dry<00:05:06.570> because<00:05:06.750> it's<00:05:07.229> sucking<00:05:07.740> in

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
longer to dry because it's sucking in

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.920 
longer to dry because it's sucking in
the<00:05:08.039> moisture<00:05:08.460> from<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.729> air<00:05:08.759> but<00:05:09.479> wintertime
