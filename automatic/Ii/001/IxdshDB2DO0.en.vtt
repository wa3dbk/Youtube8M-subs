00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that the vendor that we normally go

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.850

dramatically<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:36.060> not<00:00:36.930> very

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
dramatically and it's just not very

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.230 
dramatically and it's just not very
cost-effective<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.340> us<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.060> and<00:00:39.090> get

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.240 
cost-effective for us to go and get

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.210 
cost-effective for us to go and get
boxes<00:00:39.630> through<00:00:39.870> him<00:00:40.050> anymore<00:00:40.350> or<00:00:40.740> cases<00:00:41.130> or

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
anything like that and so normally we go

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.080 
anything like that and so normally we go
to<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.440> place<00:00:43.620> like<00:00:43.710> Frankenstein's<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.970> that

this set as well maybe I can get one of

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.290 
this set as well maybe I can get one of
them<00:03:19.240> No<00:03:21.370> okay<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.400> think<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:22.880> another<00:03:23.060> card

interceptor tomato wow it was no hard oh

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.580 
interceptor tomato wow it was no hard oh
it<00:03:44.330> looks<00:03:44.690> like<00:03:44.840> that's<00:03:44.990> pretty<00:03:45.320> much<00:03:45.530> it

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.800 
pretty much it okay so um here are the
two<00:03:49.670> holographic<00:03:50.210> cards<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:50.510> we<00:03:50.570> were<00:03:50.660> able

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
two holographic cards that we were able

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.900 
two holographic cards that we were able
to<00:03:50.990> pool<00:03:51.260> hopefully<00:03:52.040> we<00:03:52.160> should<00:03:52.340> have<00:03:52.520> some

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
to pool hopefully we should have some

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.970 
to pool hopefully we should have some
more<00:03:53.240> pack<00:03:53.930> openings<00:03:54.350> of<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.530> new<00:03:54.710> set

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
more pack openings of the new set

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.830 
more pack openings of the new set
judgment<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.490> light<00:03:55.670> pretty<00:03:56.300> soon<00:03:56.390> up<00:03:56.690> here

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
judgment the light pretty soon up here

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.470 
judgment the light pretty soon up here
on<00:03:56.930> my<00:03:57.050> channel<00:03:57.370> whether<00:03:58.370> they<00:03:58.550> be<00:03:58.610> more<00:03:59.120> packs

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
on my channel whether they be more packs

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.540 
on my channel whether they be more packs
from<00:03:59.690> Target<00:04:00.170> or<00:04:00.200> maybe<00:04:00.920> we<00:04:01.070> can<00:04:01.190> make<00:04:01.310> it<00:04:01.460> down

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
from Target or maybe we can make it down

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.280 
from Target or maybe we can make it down
to<00:04:01.730> friggin<00:04:02.030> sense<00:04:02.240> somehow<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.900> pick<00:04:03.080> up<00:04:03.200> a

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
to friggin sense somehow and pick up a

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.280 
to friggin sense somehow and pick up a
box<00:04:03.470> or<00:04:03.710> two<00:04:03.970> hopefully<00:04:04.970> pretty<00:04:05.900> soon<00:04:06.020> you'll

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
box or two hopefully pretty soon you'll

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.870 
box or two hopefully pretty soon you'll
see<00:04:06.440> some<00:04:06.590> was<00:04:06.740> at<00:04:06.890> anyhow<00:04:07.190> remember<00:04:07.730> to<00:04:07.820> let

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
see some was at anyhow remember to let

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
us know how you think we did out of our

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.110 
us know how you think we did out of our
six<00:04:09.650> packs<00:04:09.950> with<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.280> two<00:04:10.400> holographic<00:04:10.910> pools

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
six packs with the two holographic pools

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.030 
six packs with the two holographic pools
not<00:04:11.330> too<00:04:11.480> bad<00:04:11.630> if<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:11.870> ask<00:04:11.900> me<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.860> guess
