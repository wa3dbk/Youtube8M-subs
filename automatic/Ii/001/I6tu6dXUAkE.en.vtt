00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.070
 hello everyone is boston and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.780
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.750
 little video where I'm going to show you 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.119
 a few hidden faces 10 watts is so 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.480
 it's gone then we'll already go in 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.310
 the settings do not disturb and we can 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.630
 see that to cut the sound there are two 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.099
 options either in section one cuts the sound if 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.070
 the iphone is locked us in 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.559
 couple are always so for the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.980
 ringtones messages and so on 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.040
 so if we couple are so always 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.629
 as I mowed the moon and black months 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.910
 and if we only do if the iphone is 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.530
 locked the line become gray so 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.640
 I do not know if you see you see 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.010
 well sorry on the video but try if 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.670
 you have an ios device is they 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.890
 try to smile and 7 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.810
 after that while we're there so 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.150
 this little trick is walking in music 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.790
 ap on the app store and in settings so 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.920
 we make a small slip of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.520
 the left to the right and we come back 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.720
 to the previous menu so very convenient if 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.810
 we do not want to press each time 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.390
 so one and that is very very good 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.210
 when one is in the end funds 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.869
 settings of his iphone ipad or 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.750
 ipod touch 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.350
 so it's really fast so 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.259
 now we will go in plan and we 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.210
 can see that this is a novelty of which 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.950
 15.7 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.200
 we see here we have a glimpse of the earth 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.689
 whole with small dots 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.540
 bright so sealed the big cities 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.329
 and light and in the background we 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.469
 was going the stars so it's really 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.710
 hyper hyper beautiful so after we'll go 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.579
 long in safari or there are plenty 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.190
 hints then already wanted to move 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.369
 a tab for whatever reason you 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.730
 stay tuned so on the desired tab 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.670
 move and so you place them so 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.980
 it's simple enough to know too 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.980
 to know if we had in navigation 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.409
 private or normal I put myself in 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.500
 private browsing in private browsing 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:31.180
 we can see that the bars are black and 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.180
 in normal navigation 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.510
 the bars at the top and at the bottom are white 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.540
 so very very well for to find out if 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.690
 we are in private or normal navigation 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:48.379
 so after that so you saw it I did 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.209
 so a little video to turn it off 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.810
 messages and or research 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.450
 spotlight 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.150
 so if you do not know how so 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.019
 have this raise to display the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.810
 spotlight search 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.170
 just make a slip of 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.829
 finger 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.450
 two duets to the edge is so there you 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.500
 have your search there 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.909
 rothstein so that's more like 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.650
 under water and that's all there was a 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:19.849
 page dedicated to this function so in 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:24.530
 weather now weather so so wef 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:29.810
 take lyon as an example if so you 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.669
 click on the normal temperature and 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.980
 you have information that trustee 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:36.739
 so the humidity the risk of rain the 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.060
 wind and feel and if you want 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.030
 to have an overview 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.680
 so of all cities programmed late 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.620
 that you have programmed so in weather 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:50.060
 makes you a little pinch and so there 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:53.030
 you have all the cities that you 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.829
 have programmed so in weather too 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.569
 so in ios is you surely have it 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:01.489
 noticed but there is plenty of news 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.680
 ringing tones so there is one by 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.890
 defect that can be heard in the ad 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.750
 iphone 5 is 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.350
 and so the classics we had on 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:17.209
 ios 6 so with marimba which was so 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:19.250
 on default on 26 so here I am 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.799
 so go back so opening so no 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.160
 echoes echo what I like 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.840
 this ringtone so after in the management 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.930
 will open an application that qiu who 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:36.880
 is in landscape landscape mode the 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.740
 multitasking also goes into landscape mode 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.419
 so the multitask saÃ¯da fits 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.480
 next if you are in landscape mode or 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:49.160
 portrait so after we will get back into 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:51.650
 fashion so portrait we can see that that 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.480
 multitasking portrait format too so 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:59.690
 same so for the I 'm going to lose 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:03.220
 of a not finally brief you saw when 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:07.130
 we put when there is an application in 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:10.520
 landscape so there is everything that goes into 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.850
 landscape so really very very very 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:20.750
 helpful now let's go in the 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:22.280
 messages so then to see to what 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.270
 time you sent a message or to 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.520
 what time did you receive a message 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.350
 so just do a slip 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.410
 to the left and so you have the time 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:34.900
 conversations if you stay leaning 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:37.310
 so on the message is you do 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.990
 more is 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:45.050
 and you can delete so your 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:48.530
 messages that's very healthy to delete 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.050
 the messages so now in 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.169
 music 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.720
 so note down a music just 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:00.310
 so click on the title 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.530
 and there you can rate the music 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.600
 very very very practical 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.250
 so here it was so box phone for 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.440
 a little video of the hidden faces 10 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.440
 watts so that's it to more or less
