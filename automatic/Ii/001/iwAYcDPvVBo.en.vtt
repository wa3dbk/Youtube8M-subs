pretty sure yeah I think it was like she
spent<00:01:45.200> time<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.679> jail<00:01:45.860> had<00:01:46.069> the<00:01:46.190> kid<00:01:46.429> and<00:01:46.640> it

spent time in jail had the kid and it

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.529 
spent time in jail had the kid and it

was interesting where's your take on

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:51.999 
was interesting where's your take on
this<00:01:50.690> and<00:01:50.929> what<00:01:51.080> should<00:01:51.319> we<00:01:51.410> tell<00:01:51.619> these<00:01:51.800> men

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
this and what should we tell these men

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.070 
this and what should we tell these men
other<00:01:52.970> than<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.360> fact<00:01:53.569> that<00:01:53.660> they<00:01:53.869> are

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
other than the fact that they are

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.660 
other than the fact that they are
dumbasses<00:01:54.530> all<00:01:54.800> right<00:01:54.920> well<00:01:55.069> here's<00:01:55.340> here's

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
dumbasses all right well here's here's

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.210 
dumbasses all right well here's here's
the<00:01:55.940> thing<00:01:56.179> one<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.560> women<00:01:57.830> are<00:01:57.950> not<00:01:58.009> getting

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
the thing one the women are not getting

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.940 
the thing one the women are not getting
away<00:01:58.459> with<00:01:58.580> this<00:01:58.849> scot-free<00:01:59.509> um<00:01:59.780> you<00:02:00.709> know<00:02:00.800> you

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
away with this scot-free um you know you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.620 
away with this scot-free um you know you
have<00:02:01.069> to<00:02:01.190> think<00:02:01.429> of<00:02:01.550> things<00:02:02.030> in<00:02:02.270> turn<00:02:02.450> they're

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
have to think of things in turn they're

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.240 
have to think of things in turn they're
getting<00:02:02.869> fired<00:02:03.170> they're<00:02:03.560> losing<00:02:03.770> their<00:02:03.950> jobs

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
getting fired they're losing their jobs

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.400 
getting fired they're losing their jobs
and<00:02:04.550> I<00:02:04.640> think<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.270> difference<00:02:05.690> between<00:02:05.869> jail

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
and I think the difference between jail

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.719 
and I think the difference between jail
time<00:02:06.649> is<00:02:07.009> one<00:02:07.280> of<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.640> age<00:02:07.789> of<00:02:08.030> consent<00:02:09.190> now<00:02:10.190> of

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
time is one of the age of consent now of

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.720 
time is one of the age of consent now of
course<00:02:10.940> there's<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.420> huge<00:02:12.730> sociological

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
course there's a huge sociological

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.070 
course there's a huge sociological
backlash<00:02:14.300> and

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
backlash and

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.550 
backlash and
if<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.710> guy<00:02:15.890> does<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.430> young<00:02:17.120> girl<00:02:17.150> but<00:02:18.140> if

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
if a guy does it to a young girl but if

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.040 
if a guy does it to a young girl but if
I'm<00:02:18.770> not<00:02:18.920> mistaken<00:02:19.370> Oh<00:02:19.820> Siamese<00:02:20.690> women<00:02:20.990> are

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.950 
I'm not mistaken Oh Siamese women are
just<00:02:21.260> like<00:02:21.410> nailing<00:02:22.010> their<00:02:22.130> sixteen-year-old

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960

you know because if sixteen is age of
consent<00:02:29.330> they<00:02:30.050> haven't<00:02:30.290> broken<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.590> law<00:02:30.770> they

should<00:02:32.510> all<00:02:33.020> right<00:02:33.140> but<00:02:33.410> what<00:02:34.270> you're<00:02:35.270> not

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
should all right but what you're not

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.610 
should all right but what you're not
something<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.840> picket<00:02:36.200> but<00:02:36.320> your<00:02:36.470> overall

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
something that picket but your overall

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
something that picket but your overall
point<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.370> there's<00:02:38.270> two<00:02:38.510> things<00:02:38.720> as<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:40.370> one

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
point is there's two things as the one

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.020 
point is there's two things as the one
the<00:02:44.290> why<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.350> there<00:02:45.620> it's<00:02:46.490> such<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.730> desperate

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
the why is there it's such a desperate

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.330 
the why is there it's such a desperate
or<00:02:47.450> disparaged<00:02:48.080> or<00:02:48.260> different<00:02:48.710> reaction

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
or disparaged or different reaction

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.440 
or disparaged or different reaction
between<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.610> men<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:49.820> women<00:02:50.150> when<00:02:50.270> they<00:02:50.390> do

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
between the men and women when they do

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.510 
between the men and women when they do
this<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.900> our<00:02:51.530> men<00:02:51.770> so<00:02:52.010> stupid<00:02:52.370> that<00:02:52.490> they

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
this and our men so stupid that they

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.770

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.000 
understand what's happening here
there<00:02:55.790> are<00:02:55.880> two<00:02:56.000> sets<00:02:56.270> of<00:02:56.390> laws<00:02:56.570> there's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
there are two sets of laws there's

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.080 
there are two sets of laws there's
natural<00:02:58.010> law<00:02:58.190> which<00:02:58.460> is<00:02:58.580> based<00:02:58.760> in<00:02:58.910> reality

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
natural law which is based in reality

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.810 
natural law which is based in reality
and<00:02:59.720> then<00:03:00.350> there<00:03:00.590> is<00:03:00.830> like<00:03:00.860> an<00:03:01.160> ideal<00:03:01.490> law

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
and then there is like an ideal law

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.580 
and then there is like an ideal law
which<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.210> based<00:03:02.450> in<00:03:02.660> political<00:03:03.410> correctness

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
which is based in political correctness

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.640 
which is based in political correctness
and<00:03:04.160> politics<00:03:04.520> and<00:03:04.610> idealism<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.650> natural

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
and politics and idealism and natural

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.360 
and politics and idealism and natural
law<00:03:07.190> will<00:03:07.460> always<00:03:07.970> trump<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.890> politically

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
law will always trump the politically

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.060 
law will always trump the politically
correct<00:03:10.610> law<00:03:11.440> because<00:03:12.440> that's<00:03:12.560> visceral

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
correct law because that's visceral

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.290 
correct law because that's visceral
that's<00:03:13.190> what<00:03:13.310> we've<00:03:13.430> been<00:03:13.550> programmed<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:14.090> do
