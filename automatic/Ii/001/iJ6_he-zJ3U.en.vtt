the<00:02:07.469> trailer<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.039> portraying<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> think

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the trailer is portraying but I think

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.330 
the trailer is portraying but I think
looking<00:02:09.629> at<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.289> scenes<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.920> dialogue

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
don't think he's going to be as

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.790 
don't think he's going to be as
prominent<00:02:15.210> throughout<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.569> entire<00:02:16.020> movie<00:02:16.050> I

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
prominent throughout the entire movie I

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.070 
prominent throughout the entire movie I
think<00:02:17.220> our<00:02:17.340> main<00:02:17.490> focus<00:02:17.819> will<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.270> be<00:02:18.390> will

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
think our main focus will just be will

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.530 
think our main focus will just be will
be<00:02:19.110> electro<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.830> we'll<00:02:20.520> get<00:02:20.730> maybe<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:21.390> a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
fight and a half of rhino I think he's

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.000

think it's on par to every other

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.459 
think it's on par to every other
superhero<00:05:12.629> movie<00:05:12.870> that's<00:05:13.020> being<00:05:13.169> released
