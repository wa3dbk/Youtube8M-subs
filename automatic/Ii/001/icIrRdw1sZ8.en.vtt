00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.980
 at bmw m5 50d bmw has tried all 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.510
 to pack innovations in one package 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.280
 A car came out the one 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.860
 but quantity can also be incredible 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.330
 Obese is for the stretch of mine 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.330
 view after not the right one 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.730
 first look like the team so hard 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.220
 ever pushes mightily over the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.470
 Front wheels are unlikely to think 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:38.039
 completely different plan than the normal of 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:39.899
 used to diesel is really great 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.310
 notes the car brings the right weight 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.720
 close to equalizing with here to corners 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.070
 it is already a task and also in the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 acceleration pushes the weight completely 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.770
 nice on the values ​​me actually 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.319
 380 ps expected a bit more of 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.420
 50d motor as bmw is called by 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.390
 a total of three turbochargers were ventilated 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.399
 this ensures the bmw's high boost pressure 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.659
 around the engine a big screw clamp 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.299
 it does not have to hurt them 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.799
 but make sure the fast turn 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.009
 with the longer straight we try 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.009
 once again 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.990
 750 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.030
 Idiots are what you can do 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.350
 want 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.190
 text by gas take at most 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.990
 a bit with the stern house but with the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.990
 driving is forgotten 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.930
 embed a bit 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.300
 Small is great but honest from the engine 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.300
 actually expected more 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.630
 at the announcement with the m in the back there 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.270
 you can also sportiness 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.860
 can expect and that remains for me 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.690
 a bit on the road 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.690
 route of the car just too heavy 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.720
 it becomes very synthetic and of m 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.200
 if you ask me there is not much 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.200
 wander like a ghost 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.049
 bmw has shown what is possible and 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.150
 a car had everything re-packed 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.459
 stood things but came out 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.680
 it is just an endangered thing 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.610
 Formal concepts are not too heavy 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.610
 really tight 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:46.200
 This car is out of the woods at all 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.450
 not to bring 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.670
 because what you want to do then stays 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.640
 always good though I dsc now 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.900
 have completely disabled 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.110
 that is already from the side 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.230
 Reference class was safe is the car 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.150
 a question of the m5 50d from bmw is one 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.950
 excellent travel sedan has one 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.140
 amount of power and torque and it 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.870
 incredibly comfortable but where is 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.780
 actually the m in the car unterm 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.670
 This dress is just a 550 with 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.280
 other motor of other drive unit 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.549
 but the athletic note was missing in the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.549
 automobile
