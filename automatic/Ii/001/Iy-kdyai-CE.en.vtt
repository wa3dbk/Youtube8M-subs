00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.849 
up the characters prepare them for
animation<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:15.480> let's<00:04:16.140> do<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.410> guitarist

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
animation so let's do the guitarist

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.400 
animation so let's do the guitarist
first<00:04:17.070> let's<00:04:17.370> go<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.579> prepare<00:04:18.410> character

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
first let's go to prepare character

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.030 
first let's go to prepare character
actions<00:04:21.049> now<00:04:22.049> what<00:04:22.200> we<00:04:22.290> have<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.470> do<00:04:22.650> here<00:04:22.860> is

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
actions now what we have to do here is

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.010 
actions now what we have to do here is
low<00:04:23.160> then<00:04:23.370> some<00:04:23.730> guitarist<00:04:24.270> animations<00:04:24.810> they

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
low then some guitarist animations they

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.070 
low then some guitarist animations they
don't<00:04:25.230> come<00:04:25.500> pre-loaded<00:04:25.980> on<00:04:26.610> this<00:04:27.330> panel<00:04:27.750> and

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
don't come pre-loaded on this panel and

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.470 
don't come pre-loaded on this panel and
we<00:04:28.260> also<00:04:28.380> have<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.740> say<00:04:28.919> as<00:04:29.040> initial<00:04:29.400> state<00:04:29.640> to

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
we also have to say as initial state to

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.830 
we also have to say as initial state to
be<00:04:30.660> guitar<00:04:32.090> that<00:04:33.090> just<00:04:33.300> means<00:04:33.480> that<00:04:33.570> instead

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
be guitar that just means that instead

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.240 
be guitar that just means that instead
of<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:34.050> kind<00:04:34.230> of<00:04:34.260> breathing<00:04:34.620> animation<00:04:35.100> when

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
of a kind of breathing animation when

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.980 
of a kind of breathing animation when
he's<00:04:35.340> idling<00:04:35.730> he<00:04:36.330> now<00:04:36.450> appears<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.840> be

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
he's idling he now appears to be

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.960 
he's idling he now appears to be
strumming<00:04:37.230> so<00:04:38.160> we're<00:04:38.280> going<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.460> load<00:04:38.550> on<00:04:38.700> some

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
strumming so we're going to load on some

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.090 
strumming so we're going to load on some
