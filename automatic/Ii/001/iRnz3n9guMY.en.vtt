00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 engravings done on handmade are 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.900
 made on different media 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.210
 like knives rifles 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.360
 weapon accessories and his prints are 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.130
 made on steel bases so the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.180
 techniques used are the techniques 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.420
 and a hammer to make 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.720
 cast iron ornaments so 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.279
 with a pronounced relief and then 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.099
 we can also make engravings more 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.140
 fine are so soft so with a 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.190
 failure to make motives 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.239
 finer in steel we have the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.360
 possibility also to make 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.199
 gold incrustations to enhance 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.899
 a work of engraving its incrustations 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.930
 so its are possible on all types 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.650
 of steel supports and this allows for 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.360
 customize luxurious way of 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.790
 pieces of rice armor or pieces of 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.300
 cutlery 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:09.470
 I also realized elaborate drawn 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.869
 plow and crafted a knife on which 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.880
 my self I can propose engraving 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.940
 which allows people do not get any 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.520
 own a 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.090
 a hunting knife so this knife of 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.640
 hunting and carried out from 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.460
 modern techniques 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.590
 it is a titanium steel tool steels 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.420
 carbon 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.740
 it's on this blade and a 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:40.009
 length of 26 cm there 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.920
 the dressing of the pads is in 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:47.299
 different types of wood or other 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.810
 natural materials is safe for sure 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.549
 on his knives so an engraving 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.420
 ornamental hollow-bottom type is 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.890
 realized on a basic model 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.509
 so that's his knives there are 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.670
 unique pieces that are signed and 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.020
 numbered and which can also be 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:11.560
 realized with personal desires 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.560
 for knives on how
