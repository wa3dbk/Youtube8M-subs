you're doing a good job at Japanese

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.650

you're imitating something completely
there's<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.440> really<00:01:07.710> rule<00:01:07.920> heavy<00:01:08.250> yeah

comic

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.310 

I<00:01:14.800> think<00:01:15.800> I<00:01:15.890> like<00:01:16.840> classic<00:01:17.840> tattooing<00:01:18.260> because

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
I think I like classic tattooing because

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.260 
I think I like classic tattooing because
there<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.770> little<00:01:19.100> bit<00:01:19.220> of<00:01:19.340> room<00:01:19.520> with<00:01:19.940> room

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
there is a little bit of room with room

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.660 
there is a little bit of room with room
to<00:01:20.570> apply<00:01:21.230> kind<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:22.010> new<00:01:22.160> ideas<00:01:22.580> or

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
to apply kind of new ideas or

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.850 
to apply kind of new ideas or
I<00:01:24.729> think<00:01:25.330> probably<00:01:26.140> someone<00:01:26.409> that<00:01:26.439> has<00:01:26.710> an

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
I think probably someone that has an

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.130 
I think probably someone that has an
idea<00:01:27.189> of<00:01:27.369> something<00:01:27.610> they<00:01:27.850> want<00:01:28.119> and<00:01:28.360> also<00:01:28.659> has

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
idea of something they want and also has

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.310 
idea of something they want and also has
chosen<00:01:29.650> me<00:01:29.860> because<00:01:30.490> of

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
chosen me because of

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.570 
chosen me because of
the<00:01:31.500> things<00:01:31.710> they've<00:01:31.860> seen<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.250> I've<00:01:32.340> done

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
the things they've seen that I've done

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.460 
the things they've seen that I've done
but<00:01:32.820> then<00:01:32.970> also<00:01:33.270> gives<00:01:33.540> me<00:01:33.750> enough<00:01:33.960> freedom<00:01:34.230> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
but then also gives me enough freedom to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.410 
but then also gives me enough freedom to
kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.800> not<00:01:35.460> keep<00:01:35.700> doing<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.030> same<00:01:36.210> tattoo

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
kind of not keep doing the same tattoo

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.440 
kind of not keep doing the same tattoo
over<00:01:37.020> No

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.960 

I<00:01:39.479> think<00:01:39.990> initially<00:01:40.470> probably<00:01:40.710> in

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
I think initially probably in

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.460 
I think initially probably in
and<00:01:42.240> probably<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.840> was<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.080> reason<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
and probably that was the reason I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.170 
and probably that was the reason I
started<00:01:43.830> tattooing<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.460> about<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> tattoo

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
started tattooing like about the tattoo

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.109 
started tattooing like about the tattoo
time<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:47.340> know

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.520 

when<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:52.210> cut<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.450> certain<00:01:52.689> digging<00:01:53.049> deeper<00:01:53.409> it

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
when I cut a certain digging deeper it

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.920 
when I cut a certain digging deeper it
was<00:01:53.649> probably<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.219> chance<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:54.939> inside<00:01:55.329> simply

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
was probably a chance and inside simply

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.980 
was probably a chance and inside simply
warmer<00:01:56.350> shadow

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.560 

there's<00:02:03.799> one<00:02:03.979> guy<00:02:04.189> from<00:02:04.640> New<00:02:04.759> Zealand<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.479> I'm

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
there's one guy from New Zealand and I'm

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.330 
there's one guy from New Zealand and I'm
not<00:02:05.720> sure<00:02:06.170> how<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:06.380> pronounce<00:02:06.799> his<00:02:06.890> name<00:02:07.009> I

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
not sure how you pronounce his name I

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.729 
not sure how you pronounce his name I
think<00:02:07.369> it's<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.729> chick<00:02:08.270> below<00:02:08.599> or<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.319> know<00:02:09.470> so

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
think it's a chick below or you know so

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.020 
think it's a chick below or you know so
yeah<00:02:11.440> as<00:02:12.440> far<00:02:12.650> as<00:02:12.800> like<00:02:12.980> traditional<00:02:13.520> stuff<00:02:13.819> I

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
yeah as far as like traditional stuff I

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.760 
yeah as far as like traditional stuff I
feel<00:02:14.390> like<00:02:14.599> he's<00:02:15.200> kind<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.470> doing<00:02:15.739> what

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
feel like he's kind of doing what

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.740 
feel like he's kind of doing what

yeah<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:25.130> know<00:02:25.220> he's<00:02:25.459> he<00:02:26.120> gets<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.360> lot<00:02:26.450> of

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
yeah you know he's he gets a lot of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.860 
yeah you know he's he gets a lot of
attention<00:02:27.550> but<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:29.150> guy<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.360> think<00:02:29.540> it's

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
attention but that guy I think it's

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.870 
attention but that guy I think it's
really<00:02:30.020> special<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.280> probably<00:02:31.610> not<00:02:31.730> that

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
really special and probably not that

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.880 
really special and probably not that
many<00:02:32.030> people<00:02:32.270> really<00:02:32.600> know<00:02:32.720> about<00:02:32.990> him<00:02:33.640> yeah

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.470 

I<00:02:38.920> think<00:02:39.190> Crowley

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
I think Crowley

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.290 
I think Crowley
so<00:02:41.930> reach<00:02:42.520> outside<00:02:43.520> of<00:02:43.700> tattooing<00:02:44.270> for

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
so reach outside of tattooing for

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.990 
so reach outside of tattooing for
inspiration<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:46.069> think<00:02:46.099> touts<00:02:46.489> yours<00:02:46.790> look

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
inspiration and I think touts yours look

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.400 
inspiration and I think touts yours look
at<00:02:47.120> her<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.450> married<00:02:48.080> today<00:02:48.230> internet<00:02:48.709> now

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.770 

creating<00:02:52.130> watered-down<00:02:52.820> versions<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.600> things

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
creating watered-down versions of things

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.000 
creating watered-down versions of things
that<00:02:53.990> they<00:02:54.140> like<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.380> see<00:02:54.860> and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
that they like and see and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.890 
that they like and see and
it's<00:02:57.099> kind<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.459> shame<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.909> know

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
it's kind of a shame you know

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900 
it's kind of a shame you know
the<00:03:00.170> rawness<00:03:00.590> attaching<00:03:01.129> points<00:03:01.370> going<00:03:01.670> away

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
the rawness attaching points going away

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.550 
the rawness attaching points going away
but<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.450> think<00:03:02.720> it's<00:03:02.840> more<00:03:03.050> more<00:03:03.260> much

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
but is that I think it's more more much

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.630 
but is that I think it's more more much
nice<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:04.459> I<00:03:04.550> feel<00:03:04.580> like

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.880 

outside<00:03:08.940> sources<00:03:09.450> and

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
outside sources and

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.170 
outside sources and
so<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.130> wasn't<00:03:11.520> two<00:03:11.790> steps<00:03:12.120> removed

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
so it wasn't two steps removed

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.760 
so it wasn't two steps removed
there<00:03:13.510> was<00:03:13.629> like<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.840> little

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
there was like a little

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.600 
there was like a little
yeah<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:15.730> just<00:03:15.940> feel<00:03:16.090> like<00:03:16.240> it's<00:03:16.420> just<00:03:16.570> like

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
yeah and I just feel like it's just like

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.430 
yeah and I just feel like it's just like
so<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.820> would<00:03:18.000> say<00:03:18.150> like<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:19.200> know<00:03:19.290> it's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
so I would say like it you know it's

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.250 
so I would say like it you know it's
like<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.800> rolling

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
like the rolling

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.839 
like the rolling
wanting<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.709> sound<00:03:21.860> like<00:03:22.040> blues<00:03:22.250> musicians

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
wanting to sound like blues musicians

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.520 
wanting to sound like blues musicians
you<00:03:23.540> know<00:03:23.659> if<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.870> want<00:03:24.080> to<00:03:24.140> sound<00:03:24.349> like<00:03:24.409> the

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
you know if you want to sound like the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.660 
you know if you want to sound like the
Rolling<00:03:24.800> Stones

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
Rolling Stones

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.559 
Rolling Stones
copy<00:03:26.210> the<00:03:26.390> booze<00:03:26.600> got<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.110> copy<00:03:27.500> this<00:03:27.710> eons

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.089 

you<00:03:31.810> know<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.140> would<00:03:32.260> be<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.409> thing<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:32.859> think

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
you know that would be the thing I think

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.890 
you know that would be the thing I think
it's<00:03:33.219> to<00:03:33.760> look<00:03:33.939> at<00:03:34.090> other<00:03:34.269> things<00:03:34.329> that<00:03:34.780> are

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
it's to look at other things that are

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.770 
it's to look at other things that are
the<00:03:35.109> source<00:03:35.499> of<00:03:35.760> what<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:37.239> things<00:03:37.510> that

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
the source of what the things that

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.239 
the source of what the things that
you're<00:03:37.959> interested<00:03:38.139> in<00:03:38.530> came<00:03:38.799> from<00:03:39.069> as

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:39.249

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
opposed to just popping the thing

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.070 
opposed to just popping the thing
that's<00:03:43.830> kind<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.310> double-edged<00:03:44.850> sword

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080
