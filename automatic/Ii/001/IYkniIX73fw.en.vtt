you<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> little<00:01:09.030> update<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.350> terrain

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you a little update on what the terrain

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.030 
you a little update on what the terrain
is<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.250> definitely<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:11.820> rocky<00:01:13.040> but

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
is like it's definitely very rocky but

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.859 
is like it's definitely very rocky but
the<00:01:14.310> ups<00:01:14.490> really<00:01:14.880> aren't<00:01:15.030> too<00:01:15.119> bad<00:01:15.390> because

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the ups really aren't too bad because

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.649 
the ups really aren't too bad because
they<00:01:16.110> are<00:01:16.259> short<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.420> nice

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
they are short and then you get a nice

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.999 
they are short and then you get a nice
down<00:01:18.960> hill<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.229> there<00:01:19.500> was<00:01:19.590> actually<00:01:19.770> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
down hill and there was actually a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.890 
down hill and there was actually a
pretty<00:01:20.400> long<00:01:20.640> flat<00:01:20.939> section<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.750> did

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
pretty long flat section that I just did

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
pretty long flat section that I just did
so<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.770> too<00:01:22.920> bad<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.340> far<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.820> looks<00:01:24.030> worse

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
so not too bad so far it looks worse

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.359

big<00:02:29.710> deal<00:02:29.890> at<00:02:30.010> all<00:02:30.900> for<00:02:31.900> someone<00:02:32.140> who<00:02:32.320> might<00:02:32.440> be

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
big deal at all for someone who might be

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.350 
big deal at all for someone who might be
coming<00:02:32.830> out<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.190> do<00:02:33.310> day<00:02:33.670> hiking<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.210> or

coming out just do day hiking it or
section<00:02:35.290> hiking<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.770> might<00:02:35.950> seem<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.190> little

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
section hiking it might seem a little

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.780 
section hiking it might seem a little
bit<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:37.000> little<00:02:37.450> bit<00:02:37.630> more<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.220> struggle<00:02:39.490> but

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
bit a little bit more of a struggle but

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.710 
bit a little bit more of a struggle but
really<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:41.500> was<00:02:41.740> not<00:02:42.670> bad<00:02:42.880> at<00:02:43.060> all<00:02:43.180> actually<00:02:43.690> I

kind<00:02:44.020> of<00:02:44.080> enjoyed<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.650> because<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.580> ups<00:02:45.790> it

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
kind of enjoyed it because the ups it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.750 
kind of enjoyed it because the ups it
didn't<00:02:46.240> take<00:02:46.450> but<00:02:46.480> maybe<00:02:47.310> five<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.550> ten

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
didn't take but maybe five to ten
