00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.440 
that goes without saying and he also
gets<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.560> triple<00:01:35.189> swarm<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.210> didn't<00:01:36.390> know

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
gets a triple swarm if you didn't know

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.780 
gets a triple swarm if you didn't know
guys<00:01:36.630> swarm<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.470> last<00:01:37.979> kill<00:01:38.340> sugar<00:01:38.549> belief

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
guys swarm is the last kill sugar belief

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.850 
guys swarm is the last kill sugar belief
and<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.810> basically<00:01:39.960> gets<00:01:40.229> free<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.770> them

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and they basically gets free of them

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.920 
and they basically gets free of them
which<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.340> know<00:01:41.430> which<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.880> beyond<00:01:42.780> amazing

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
which you know which is beyond amazing

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.109 
which you know which is beyond amazing

are really good you know to get free

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.179 
are really good you know to get free
swarms<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> gameplay<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.920> even

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
swarms in the gameplay it is even

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.130 
swarms in the gameplay it is even
pageant<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:50.909> them<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.390> good<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.899> Elias

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
pageant for them so good on you Elias

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.780 
pageant for them so good on you Elias
forgetting<00:01:52.470> those<00:01:52.530> free<00:01:52.799> swarms<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.340> one<00:01:53.579> game

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
forgetting those free swarms in one game

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.069 
forgetting those free swarms in one game
I<00:01:53.970> know<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.270> close<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.780> here<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
I know so close you can see here the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.840 
I know so close you can see here the
park<00:01:55.320> cease<00:01:55.500> using<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.950> wearing<00:01:56.369> class<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
park cease using as wearing class the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.429 
park cease using as wearing class the
modes<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.210> see<00:01:57.390> them<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> right<00:01:57.869> but

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
modes you can see them on the right but

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.870 
modes you can see them on the right but
I'll<00:01:58.500> go<00:01:58.649> over<00:01:58.680> them<00:01:58.890> anyway<00:01:59.130> he's<00:01:59.369> using<00:01:59.640> tier

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
I'll go over them anyway he's using tier

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.030 
I'll go over them anyway he's using tier
1<00:02:00.090> parks<00:02:00.420> hardline<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.380> ghosts<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.920> he's

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
1 parks hardline and ghosts so he's

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.560 
1 parks hardline and ghosts so he's
obviously<00:02:02.219> using<00:02:02.340> bit<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.759> park<00:02:03.090> 1<00:02:03.299> greed

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
obviously using bit of that park 1 greed

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.999 
obviously using bit of that park 1 greed
and<00:02:03.780> then<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.079> may<00:02:04.170> raise<00:02:04.350> wages<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.799> hard

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
and then it may raise wages and hard

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:05.990 
and then it may raise wages and hard
like<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.399> because<00:02:05.430> he<00:02:05.670> gets<00:02:05.880> all

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
like it is because he gets all

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.510 
like it is because he gets all
scorestreaks<00:02:06.570> much<00:02:07.200> quicker<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:08.250> believe

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
scorestreaks much quicker and I believe

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.999 
scorestreaks much quicker and I believe
hardline<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.300> kind<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.840> result<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.709> Y<00:02:10.950> gets

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
hardline is kind of a result of Y gets

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.530 
hardline is kind of a result of Y gets
free<00:02:11.310> swarms<00:02:11.670> because<00:02:12.000> it'd<00:02:12.209> be<00:02:12.330> easier<00:02:12.510> to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
free swarms because it'd be easier to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.670 
free swarms because it'd be easier to
gets<00:02:12.750> warmer<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.200> using<00:02:13.440> hard

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
gets warmer for using hard

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.589 
gets warmer for using hard
9<00:02:13.799> so<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.519> recommend<00:02:14.640> using<00:02:15.150> his<00:02:15.359> hardline

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
9 so I do recommend using his hardline

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.059 
9 so I do recommend using his hardline
if<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.019> want<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.260> get<00:02:16.379> electrical<00:02:16.739> swarms

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
if you want to get electrical swarms

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.039 
if you want to get electrical swarms
like<00:02:17.310> aliases<00:02:17.700> here<00:02:17.909> and<00:02:18.090> also<00:02:18.269> guys<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.689> is

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
like aliases here and also guys as is

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.229 
like aliases here and also guys as is
second<00:02:19.560> tier<00:02:19.739> one<00:02:19.950> part<00:02:20.159> he's<00:02:20.670> using<00:02:21.030> ghost

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
second tier one part he's using ghost

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.839 
second tier one part he's using ghost
which<00:02:21.900> makes<00:02:22.109> you<00:02:22.200> unseen<00:02:22.769> by<00:02:22.920> enemy<00:02:23.219> UAVs<00:02:23.609> and

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
which makes you unseen by enemy UAVs and

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.479 
which makes you unseen by enemy UAVs and
ghost<00:02:24.659> was<00:02:24.900> labeled<00:02:25.560> as<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.739> newbie<00:02:26.219> thing<00:02:26.400> to

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
ghost was labeled as a newbie thing to

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.770 
ghost was labeled as a newbie thing to
be<00:02:26.579> using<00:02:26.819> they're<00:02:26.909> like<00:02:27.030> black<00:02:27.180> ops<00:02:27.329> 1<00:02:27.420> all

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
be using they're like black ops 1 all

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.509 
be using they're like black ops 1 all
our<00:02:27.900> games<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.560> are<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.829> assassin<00:02:29.400> and

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
our games that are like assassin and

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.849 
our games that are like assassin and
stuff<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.299> my<00:02:30.510> opinion<00:02:30.659> I<00:02:31.170> do<00:02:31.290> generally

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
stuff but in my opinion I do generally

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.289 
stuff but in my opinion I do generally
think<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.189> using<00:02:32.370> ghost<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.849> black<00:02:33.000> ops<00:02:33.150> 2

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
think that using ghost and black ops 2

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.149 
think that using ghost and black ops 2
isn't<00:02:33.719> a<00:02:33.750> problem<00:02:33.930> all<00:02:34.200> because<00:02:34.530> everyone

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
isn't a problem all because everyone

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.550 
isn't a problem all because everyone
uses<00:02:35.459> UAV<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.969> personally<00:02:36.420> think<00:02:36.569> UAV<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.439> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
uses UAV I personally think UAV is the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.809 
uses UAV I personally think UAV is the
best<00:02:37.739> cosier<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.099> can<00:02:38.219> get<00:02:38.370> over<00:02:38.670> then<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
best cosier you can get over then the

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.940 
best cosier you can get over then the
orbital<00:02:39.180> vsat<00:02:39.359> but<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.079> UAV<00:02:40.439> news<00:02:40.799> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
orbital vsat but like the UAV news the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.379 
orbital vsat but like the UAV news the
only<00:02:41.099> free<00:02:41.310> killed<00:02:41.609> and<00:02:41.819> then<00:02:42.000> once<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.239> get

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
only free killed and then once you get

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.089 
only free killed and then once you get
UAV<00:02:42.719> you<00:02:43.079> can<00:02:43.230> see<00:02:43.349> what<00:02:43.469> everyone<00:02:43.739> is<00:02:43.859> so<00:02:43.980> in

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
UAV you can see what everyone is so in

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.770 
UAV you can see what everyone is so in
my<00:02:44.189> opinion<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.609> best<00:02:44.700> kind<00:02:44.879> reviews<00:02:45.239> but

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
my opinion is the best kind reviews but

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.970 
my opinion is the best kind reviews but
this<00:02:45.870> isn't<00:02:46.109> the<00:02:46.260> case<00:02:46.439> anymore<00:02:46.769> because

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
this isn't the case anymore because

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.220 
this isn't the case anymore because
obviously<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.430> can<00:02:47.549> use<00:02:47.700> ghost<00:02:47.909> so<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.870> let

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
obviously you can use ghost so I let

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.839 
obviously you can use ghost so I let
fall<00:02:49.439> out<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.919> don't<00:02:50.159> think<00:02:50.340> usually<00:02:50.760> go

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
fall out that I don't think usually go

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.729 
fall out that I don't think usually go
sending<00:02:51.120> moore's<00:02:51.299> new<00:02:51.510> be<00:02:51.629> a<00:02:51.780> lot<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.319> pros<00:02:52.500> use

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
sending moore's new be a lot of pros use

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.890 
sending moore's new be a lot of pros use
it<00:02:52.889> you<00:02:52.980> know<00:02:53.069> just<00:02:53.579> because<00:02:53.700> save<00:02:54.510> an<00:02:54.629> enemy
