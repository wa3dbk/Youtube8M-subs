biggest thing is is three things
actually<00:00:52.770> they're<00:00:53.040> really<00:00:53.220> combined<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.790> have

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
actually they're really combined to have

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.610 
actually they're really combined to have
a<00:00:53.910> profound<00:00:54.390> effect<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> game<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.500> in

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
a profound effect on the game and in

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.160 
a profound effect on the game and in
terms<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.980> responsiveness<00:00:56.610> fluidity<00:00:57.180> feeling

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
terms of responsiveness fluidity feeling

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.500 
terms of responsiveness fluidity feeling
the<00:00:58.260> game<00:00:58.610> so<00:00:59.610> we've<00:00:59.760> completely<00:01:00.210> rewritten

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the game so we've completely rewritten

our dribbling system the way the players

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.100 
our dribbling system the way the players
dribble<00:01:02.970> with<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.330> ball<00:01:03.510> we're<00:01:03.780> looking<00:01:04.020> at

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
dribble with the ball we're looking at

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.299 
dribble with the ball we're looking at
the<00:01:04.199> sort<00:01:04.440> of<00:01:04.470> footed<00:01:04.800> pneus<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> player

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the sort of footed pneus the player

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.250 
the sort of footed pneus the player
messi<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.880> example<00:01:06.330> left<00:01:06.510> 30<00:01:06.750> player<00:01:06.930> Gareth

messi for example left 30 player Gareth
Bale<00:01:07.470> you'll<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.190> them<00:01:08.340> dribbling<00:01:08.790> much<00:01:09.300> more

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
Bale you'll see them dribbling much more

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.120 
Bale you'll see them dribbling much more
sort<00:01:09.660> of<00:01:09.720> left-sided<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> way<00:01:10.740> they<00:01:10.920> run

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
sort of left-sided but the way they run

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.980 
sort of left-sided but the way they run
the<00:01:11.370> May<00:01:11.490> they<00:01:11.640> they<00:01:12.180> actually<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.870> know

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the May they they actually you know

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.080 
the May they they actually you know
control<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.560> ball<00:01:13.740> has<00:01:13.920> been<00:01:14.100> completely

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
control the ball has been completely

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.810 
control the ball has been completely
rewritten<00:01:15.420> we've<00:01:16.200> also<00:01:16.380> worked<00:01:16.580> heavily<00:01:17.580> on

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
rewritten we've also worked heavily on

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.120 
rewritten we've also worked heavily on
our<00:01:18.270> locomotion<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.410> agility<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
our locomotion and the agility of the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.740 
our locomotion and the agility of the
turns<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> responsiveness<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.510> quickness

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
turns the responsiveness the quickness

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.290 
turns the responsiveness the quickness
of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> turns<00:01:22.410> which<00:01:23.369> helps<00:01:23.700> both<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
of the turns which helps both with the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.940 
of the turns which helps both with the
ball<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.720> also<00:01:25.080> without<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> ball<00:01:25.710> so

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
ball and also without the ball so

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 
ball and also without the ball so
there's<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> really<00:01:26.550> nice<00:01:26.790> balance<00:01:27.000> there<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
there's a really nice balance there and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.020 
there's a really nice balance there and
also<00:01:28.229> we've<00:01:28.590> completely<00:01:29.280> reworked<00:01:29.670> up<00:01:29.850> all

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
also we've completely reworked up all

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.420 
also we've completely reworked up all
physics<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> ground<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.160> every

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
physics it's on the ground so every

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.170 
physics it's on the ground so every
literally<00:01:32.790> every<00:01:32.970> ball<00:01:33.210> touch<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.869> now<00:01:35.180> you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
literally every ball touch is now you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.390 
literally every ball touch is now you
know<00:01:36.300> it's<00:01:36.420> different<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.830> know<00:01:37.860> really

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
know it's different and you know really

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.980 
know it's different and you know really
feels<00:01:38.790> really<00:01:39.060> really<00:01:39.240> good<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.600> those<00:01:39.720> three

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
feels really really good and those three

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.270 
feels really really good and those three
things<00:01:40.170> combined<00:01:40.649> make<00:01:40.679> the<00:01:40.979> game<00:01:41.130> feel

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
things combined make the game feel

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.580 
things combined make the game feel
incredibly<00:01:41.670> responsive<00:01:42.360> has<00:01:42.840> great<00:01:43.080> fluidity

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
incredibly responsive has great fluidity

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.160 
incredibly responsive has great fluidity
a<00:01:44.039> great<00:01:44.490> feeling<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.850> control<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.960> that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
a great feeling of control is that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.900 
a great feeling of control is that
something<00:01:46.440> that<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.979> sort<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.399> developed

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
something that you sort of developed

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.480 
something that you sort of developed
based<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.479> player<00:01:48.840> feedback<00:01:49.170> from<00:01:49.740> fifa<00:01:50.190> 14

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
based on player feedback from fifa 14

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that you know pace / apt felt it was a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.200 
that you know pace / apt felt it was a
little<00:01:52.560> bit<00:01:52.800> stiff<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.250> times<00:01:53.490> absolutely<00:01:54.179> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
little bit stiff at times absolutely I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.550 
little bit stiff at times absolutely I
mean<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.509> gotta<00:01:54.630> love<00:01:54.810> feedback<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.320> times

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
mean we gotta love feedback at times

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.900 
mean we gotta love feedback at times
people<00:01:55.860> felt<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.280> game<00:01:56.429> was<00:01:56.580> a<00:01:56.610> little<00:01:56.820> bit

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
people felt the game was a little bit

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.359 
people felt the game was a little bit
unresponsive<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:58.050> also<00:01:58.289> a<00:01:58.440> big<00:01:58.710> progression

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
unresponsive it's also a big progression

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.190 
unresponsive it's also a big progression
and<00:01:59.520> innovation<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.090> our<00:02:00.240> locomotion<00:02:00.750> system

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and innovation in our locomotion system

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.410 
and innovation in our locomotion system
that<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.410> rewrote<00:02:01.710> last<00:02:01.950> year<00:02:02.420> something

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
that we rewrote last year something

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.109 
that we rewrote last year something
that's<00:02:03.679> almost<00:02:04.679> as<00:02:04.860> big<00:02:05.069> as<00:02:05.250> FIFA<00:02:05.490> these<00:02:05.880> days

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
the importance of it well I mean it's

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.400

games<00:03:44.140> will<00:03:44.410> great<00:03:44.680> we're<00:03:44.860> doing<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.100> lot<00:03:45.190> of

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
games will great we're doing a lot of

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.380 
games will great we're doing a lot of
innovations<00:03:45.790> in<00:03:45.910> there<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.090> lot<00:03:46.239> of<00:03:46.270> the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
innovations in there a lot of the

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.060 
innovations in there a lot of the
feeling<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.959> lot<00:03:47.110> of<00:03:47.200> things<00:03:47.770> that<00:03:47.920> we

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
feeling and a lot of things that we

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.949 
feeling and a lot of things that we
talked<00:03:48.250> about<00:03:48.340> in<00:03:48.459> gameplay<00:03:48.760> will<00:03:49.209> be<00:03:49.360> on<00:03:49.480> the

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
talked about in gameplay will be on the

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.870 
talked about in gameplay will be on the
gen<00:03:50.200> 3<00:03:50.440> consoles<00:03:50.950> but<00:03:51.100> ultimately<00:03:51.549> we<00:03:51.730> also

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
gen 3 consoles but ultimately we also

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.940 
gen 3 consoles but ultimately we also
don't<00:03:52.060> want<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.299> limit<00:03:52.450> ourselves<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.920> know

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
don't want to limit ourselves you know

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.229 
don't want to limit ourselves you know
we've<00:03:54.160> got<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.310> lot<00:03:54.459> more<00:03:54.489> power<00:03:54.880> we've<00:03:55.120> got<00:03:55.150> a

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239

lot<00:03:55.360> more<00:03:55.390> horsepower<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:55.989> lot<00:03:56.140> more<00:03:56.260> memory<00:03:56.620> on

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
lot more horsepower a lot more memory on

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.770
