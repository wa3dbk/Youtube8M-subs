they're<00:03:56.069> very<00:03:56.579> have<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.540> lot<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.810> stress<00:03:58.170> and

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
they're very have a lot of stress and

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.470 
they're very have a lot of stress and
tension<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.950> they<00:03:59.489> have<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.609> lot<00:03:59.790> of<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.209> it's

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
tension and they have a lot of and it's

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.240 
tension and they have a lot of and it's
all<00:04:00.600> located<00:04:00.930> in<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.350> suboccipital<00:04:02.010> muscles

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
all located in the suboccipital muscles

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.879 
all located in the suboccipital muscles
here<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:03.000> what<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:03.930> do<00:04:04.019> is<00:04:04.139> take<00:04:04.290> your<00:04:04.350> fingers

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
here so what you do is take your fingers

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.009 
here so what you do is take your fingers
and<00:04:05.069> put<00:04:05.760> them<00:04:05.880> under<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.299> occiput<00:04:06.690> right

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
and put them under the occiput right

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.559 
and put them under the occiput right
here<00:04:07.319> now<00:04:08.010> we<00:04:08.430> can<00:04:08.579> also<00:04:08.700> use<00:04:09.209> applied

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
here now we can also use applied

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.890 
here now we can also use applied
kinesiology<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.530> apply<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:12.120> polarity

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
kinesiology and apply the polarity

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.870 
kinesiology and apply the polarity
techniques<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.519> way<00:04:14.609> we<00:04:14.760> do

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
techniques to this and the way we do

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.140 
techniques to this and the way we do
that<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.090> by<00:04:15.630> muscle<00:04:16.470> testing<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.519> find<00:04:18.090> a

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
that is by muscle testing you find a

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.620 
that is by muscle testing you find a
strong<00:04:18.450> arm<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:20.060> just<00:04:21.060> push<00:04:21.299> straight<00:04:21.599> down

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
strong arm and just push straight down

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.010 
strong arm and just push straight down
and<00:04:22.109> resist<00:04:22.590> hold<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.630> muscle<00:04:24.630> is<00:04:24.720> strong

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
and resist hold and the muscle is strong

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.240 
and resist hold and the muscle is strong
then<00:04:25.530> bend<00:04:25.770> your<00:04:25.860> knees<00:04:26.070> please

all four toes at once

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.670 
all four toes at once
now<00:05:25.350> hold<00:05:25.710> and<00:05:25.980> it<00:05:26.580> goes<00:05:26.760> weak<00:05:27.060> so<00:05:27.900> now<00:05:28.080> we<00:05:28.530> know

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
now hold and it goes weak so now we know

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.020 
now hold and it goes weak so now we know
that<00:05:28.710> there's<00:05:28.980> an<00:05:29.100> imbalance<00:05:29.220> on<00:05:29.700> the<00:05:29.820> left

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
that there's an imbalance on the left

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.360 
that there's an imbalance on the left
side<00:05:30.270> of<00:05:30.420> the<00:05:30.480> body<00:05:30.690> so<00:05:31.440> now<00:05:31.590> we<00:05:31.650> can<00:05:31.890> test<00:05:32.130> each

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
side of the body so now we can test each

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.150 
side of the body so now we can test each
individual<00:05:32.970> toe<00:05:33.180> hold<00:05:33.860> hold<00:05:35.060> hold<00:05:36.060> hold<00:05:37.070> so<00:05:38.070> we

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
individual toe hold hold hold hold so we

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.580 
individual toe hold hold hold hold so we
just<00:05:38.340> find<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.790> water<00:05:39.030> toe<00:05:39.330> going<00:05:39.990> weak<00:05:40.320> and

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
just find the water toe going weak and

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.770 
just find the water toe going weak and
now<00:05:41.040> we<00:05:41.100> can<00:05:41.280> test<00:05:41.490> each<00:05:41.730> individual<00:05:42.360> aspect

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
now we can test each individual aspect

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.400 
now we can test each individual aspect
of<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.020> water<00:05:43.200> tale<00:05:43.440> so<00:05:44.220> first<00:05:44.490> chest<00:05:45.410> pelvis

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
of the water tale so first chest pelvis

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.190 
of the water tale so first chest pelvis
and<00:05:46.970> feet<00:05:47.970> so<00:05:48.570> the<00:05:48.750> pelvis<00:05:49.260> part<00:05:49.530> goes<00:05:49.770> weak<00:05:51.200> so

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
and feet so the pelvis part goes weak so

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.690 
and feet so the pelvis part goes weak so
that<00:05:52.380> means<00:05:52.590> we<00:05:52.770> have<00:05:52.919> a<00:05:52.950> water<00:05:53.280> element

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
that means we have a water element

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.880 
that means we have a water element
imbalance<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.540> that<00:05:55.290> would<00:05:55.410> be<00:05:55.500> somewhere<00:05:55.830> in

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
imbalance and that would be somewhere in

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.280 
imbalance and that would be somewhere in
the<00:05:56.160> psoas<00:05:56.520> muscle<00:05:56.970> along<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.390> this<00:05:57.960> line

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
the psoas muscle along the this line

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.640 
the psoas muscle along the this line
here<00:05:58.760> then<00:05:59.760> we<00:05:59.880> can<00:06:00.030> do<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.750> toe<00:06:01.110> pole<00:06:01.380> here

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
here then we can do the toe pole here

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.670 
here then we can do the toe pole here
and<00:06:05.060> this<00:06:06.060> is<00:06:06.180> a<00:06:06.210> very<00:06:06.510> powerful<00:06:06.780> technique<00:06:07.230> to

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
and this is a very powerful technique to

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.430 
and this is a very powerful technique to
pull<00:06:07.890> on<00:06:07.980> the<00:06:08.100> toes<00:06:08.340> because<00:06:08.970> it<00:06:09.440> releases

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
pull on the toes because it releases

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.980 
pull on the toes because it releases
tremendous<00:06:11.040> amount<00:06:11.250> of<00:06:11.310> energy<00:06:11.690> then<00:06:12.690> we<00:06:12.840> can

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
tremendous amount of energy then we can

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.480 
tremendous amount of energy then we can
move<00:06:13.140> up<00:06:13.260> to<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:13.500> chest<00:06:13.800> there's<00:06:14.160> a<00:06:14.250> source

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
move up to the chest there's a source

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.659 
move up to the chest there's a source

body so for the birth to toe neck would

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.190 
body so for the birth to toe neck would
be<00:06:31.650> around<00:06:31.830> the<00:06:32.340> third<00:06:32.580> cervical<00:06:33.050> vowels<00:06:34.050> will

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
be around the third cervical vowels will

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.529 
be around the third cervical vowels will
be<00:06:34.290> the<00:06:34.410> ileocecal<00:06:34.979> valve<00:06:35.220> and<00:06:35.669> knees<00:06:36.270> would

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
be the ileocecal valve and knees would

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.640 
be the ileocecal valve and knees would
be<00:06:36.570> the<00:06:36.840> lateral<00:06:37.229> meniscus<00:06:37.410> of<00:06:37.950> the<00:06:38.070> knee

by testing here hold that's a five
pointed<00:07:23.620> star<00:07:23.680> balance<00:07:24.340> we<00:07:24.880> can<00:07:25.000> also<00:07:25.150> test

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479 
pointed star balance we can also test

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.439 
pointed star balance we can also test
the<00:07:25.860> energy<00:07:26.860> flows<00:07:27.250> there's<00:07:27.669> a<00:07:27.729> centripetal

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:28.449 
the energy flows there's a centripetal

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:31.200 
the energy flows there's a centripetal
force<00:07:28.930> you<00:07:29.440> can<00:07:29.560> go<00:07:29.680> like<00:07:29.830> that<00:07:30.130> hold<00:07:30.910> that

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
force you can go like that hold that

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.750 
force you can go like that hold that
goes<00:07:31.720> weak<00:07:31.930> and<00:07:32.199> go<00:07:32.320> like<00:07:32.470> that<00:07:32.520> strong<00:07:33.520> so<00:07:33.729> you

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:33.760 
goes weak and go like that strong so you

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.909 
goes weak and go like that strong so you
can<00:07:33.849> correct<00:07:34.389> it<00:07:34.479> by<00:07:34.630> moving<00:07:34.810> like<00:07:35.199> that<00:07:35.440> with

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 
can correct it by moving like that with

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:38.249 
can correct it by moving like that with
the<00:07:36.010> hand<00:07:36.250> there's<00:07:36.970> also<00:07:37.180> a<00:07:37.360> transverse<00:07:37.930> force

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:38.259 
the hand there's also a transverse force

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:39.629 
the hand there's also a transverse force
that<00:07:38.500> runs<00:07:38.650> across<00:07:38.979> the<00:07:39.310> body

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:39.639 
that runs across the body

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:42.270 
that runs across the body
you<00:07:40.150> can<00:07:40.330> test<00:07:40.570> like<00:07:40.810> that<00:07:41.050> hold<00:07:41.380> and<00:07:41.650> then<00:07:42.130> we

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280 
you can test like that hold and then we

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.400 
you can test like that hold and then we
want<00:07:42.430> to<00:07:42.520> bring<00:07:42.729> it<00:07:42.880> in<00:07:43.210> this<00:07:43.360> direction<00:07:43.599> so

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.410 
want to bring it in this direction so

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.080 
want to bring it in this direction so
you<00:07:44.500> can<00:07:44.650> use<00:07:44.800> muscle<00:07:45.220> testing<00:07:45.520> to<00:07:45.669> speed<00:07:45.940> up

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.090 
you can use muscle testing to speed up

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.020 
you can use muscle testing to speed up
your<00:07:46.120> polarity<00:07:46.660> treatments<00:07:47.199> as<00:07:47.320> well<00:07:47.400> as<00:07:48.400> to
