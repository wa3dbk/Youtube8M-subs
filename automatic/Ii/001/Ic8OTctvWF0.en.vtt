10 this device is very portable and
functional<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.260> thing<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.039> would

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
functional but the thing that I would

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.640 
functional but the thing that I would
have<00:00:26.400> expected<00:00:26.519> more<00:00:27.210> out<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.170> since

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
have expected more out of this is since

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.690 
have expected more out of this is since
it<00:00:28.830> has<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.720> cursor<00:00:30.720> /<00:00:31.230> Mouse<00:00:31.560> functionality<00:00:32.460> I

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
it has a cursor / Mouse functionality I

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.639 
it has a cursor / Mouse functionality I
would<00:00:33.690> expect<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.489> scrolling<00:00:35.489> device<00:00:36.649> although

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
would expect a scrolling device although

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.240 
would expect a scrolling device although
it<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.340> not<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.570> device<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.739> still<00:00:41.010> have

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it is not in this device you still have

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.090 
it is not in this device you still have
to<00:00:41.579> scroll<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.870> your<00:00:42.899> fingers<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.710> would

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
to scroll with your fingers as you would

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.090 
to scroll with your fingers as you would
without<00:00:44.520> having<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.210> device<00:00:45.920> in<00:00:46.920> other

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
without having this device in other

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.770 
without having this device in other
words<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.550> would<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.969> using<00:00:48.180> your<00:00:48.420> hands

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
words you would be using your hands

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.410 
words you would be using your hands
against<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> device<00:00:49.730> that<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.239> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
against the device that you have it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.950 
against the device that you have it
hooked<00:00:51.899> up<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.789> so<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.210> device<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.780> very

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
hooked up with so this device is very

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.470 
hooked up with so this device is very
it's<00:00:55.739> very<00:00:56.160> impressive<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:57.120> never<00:00:57.329> thought

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
it's very impressive I never thought

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.310 
it's very impressive I never thought
this<00:00:58.020> would<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.350> been<00:00:58.379> able<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.359> be<00:01:00.359> real

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
this would have been able to be real

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.170 
this would have been able to be real
it's<00:01:02.059> definitely<00:01:03.059> very<00:01:03.809> mind<00:01:04.199> blowing<00:01:05.150> when<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it's definitely very mind blowing when I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.730 
it's definitely very mind blowing when I
first<00:01:06.840> opened<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:08.510> blown<00:01:09.510> away

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
first opened this I was blown away

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.240 
first opened this I was blown away
because<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:11.250> how<00:01:12.110> it<00:01:13.110> wasn't<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.950> laggy

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
because of how it wasn't really laggy

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.960 
because of how it wasn't really laggy
but<00:01:14.720> then<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.869> started<00:01:16.110> using<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
but then I started using it with the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.240 
but then I started using it with the
mouse<00:01:18.500> functionality<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.830> got<00:01:19.979> really

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
mouse functionality and it got really

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.950 
mouse functionality and it got really
laggy<00:01:21.049> um<00:01:22.340> there's<00:01:23.340> not<00:01:23.549> really<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.000> much<00:01:24.240> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
laggy um there's not really that much to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.499 
laggy um there's not really that much to
it<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:26.280> want<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> put<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.970> standby

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
it if you want to put it on a standby

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.679 
it if you want to put it on a standby
mode<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.530> hold<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.220> function<00:01:29.640> key<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.270> back

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
mode you hold the function key and back

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.840 
mode you hold the function key and back
then<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.470> want<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> bring<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> keyboard<00:01:32.400> back

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
then you want to bring the keyboard back

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
then you want to bring the keyboard back
you<00:01:33.689> use<00:01:33.900> three<00:01:34.170> fingers<00:01:34.200> spread<00:01:34.799> them<00:01:34.920> apart

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
you use three fingers spread them apart

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.670 
you use three fingers spread them apart
and<00:01:35.400> tap<00:01:36.030> where<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.689> keyboard<00:01:37.380> was

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and tap where the keyboard was

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.340 
and tap where the keyboard was
originally<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.490> it'll<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.270> will<00:01:39.509> appear<00:01:40.170> in

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
originally and it'll it will appear in

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.179 
originally and it'll it will appear in
the<00:01:41.189> same<00:01:41.430> place<00:01:41.640> now<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.040> it

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the same place now you have to have it

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.490 
the same place now you have to have it
on<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> flat<00:01:45.119> surface<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.899> order<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.409> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
on a flat surface in order for it to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.300 
on a flat surface in order for it to
function<00:01:47.189> properly<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.229> then<00:01:49.619> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
function properly if you do not then it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.399 
function properly if you do not then it
will<00:01:50.729> start<00:01:51.540> thinking<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.380> are

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
will start thinking that you are

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.280 
will start thinking that you are
pressing<00:01:52.979> random<00:01:53.280> buttons<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.750> will<00:01:54.899> type

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
pressing random buttons and it will type

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.280 
pressing random buttons and it will type
random<00:01:55.740> numbers<00:01:56.009> or<00:01:56.880> letters<00:01:56.939> into<00:01:57.810> your

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
random numbers or letters into your

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.910 
random numbers or letters into your
device<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.790> have<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.090> hooked<00:02:00.210> up<00:02:00.420> with

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
device that you have it hooked up with

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.340 
device that you have it hooked up with
now<00:02:02.060> overall<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.299> would<00:02:03.360> give<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.810> 6<00:02:04.170> out<00:02:04.320> of

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
now overall I would give this a 6 out of

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.160 
now overall I would give this a 6 out of
10<00:02:04.649> because<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:06.390> things<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.750> they<00:02:06.930> tried

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
10 because of the things that they tried

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.580 
10 because of the things that they tried
to<00:02:07.200> add<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.250> they<00:02:08.340> did<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.670> it

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
to add in here and they did not it

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.710 
to add in here and they did not it
wouldn't<00:02:10.590> really<00:02:10.770> work<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.580> well<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.209> would

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
wouldn't really work that well I would

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.309 
wouldn't really work that well I would
have<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.020> press

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
have to press

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.619 
have to press
the<00:02:13.439> buttons<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.950> few<00:02:14.609> more<00:02:15.480> times<00:02:15.810> than<00:02:16.109> once

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
the buttons a few more times than once

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.209 
the buttons a few more times than once
that's<00:02:18.629> pretty<00:02:18.989> much<00:02:19.230> all<00:02:19.469> that<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:19.799> found

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
that's pretty much all that I found

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.849 
that's pretty much all that I found
negatively<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.209> this<00:02:21.359> device<00:02:21.689> overall<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.769> is

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
charging port right here and then the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.740 
charging port right here and then the
pairing<00:02:43.290> button<00:02:43.939> it's<00:02:44.939> really<00:02:45.269> small<00:02:45.689> and

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
pairing button it's really small and

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.240 
pairing button it's really small and
it's<00:02:46.409> inconvenient<00:02:47.569> um<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:49.560> really<00:02:49.859> have<00:02:50.099> to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
it's inconvenient um you really have to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.689 
it's inconvenient um you really have to
like<00:02:50.400> press<00:02:50.669> it<00:02:50.819> with<00:02:50.939> the<00:02:51.090> cap<00:02:51.299> I<00:02:52.459> wish<00:02:53.459> that

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:53.699 
like press it with the cap I wish that

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.000 
like press it with the cap I wish that
they<00:02:53.909> would<00:02:54.060> have<00:02:54.120> had<00:02:54.359> a<00:02:54.629> bigger<00:02:55.349> pairing

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
they would have had a bigger pairing

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.929 
they would have had a bigger pairing
button<00:02:57.949> the<00:02:58.949> way<00:02:59.099> that<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.430> works<00:02:59.609> is<00:02:59.879> that

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
button the way that it works is that

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.199 
button the way that it works is that
uses<00:03:00.419> an<00:03:00.629> ir<00:03:01.139> detector<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:02.489> is<00:03:02.639> what<00:03:02.819> you<00:03:02.969> see

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
uses an ir detector that is what you see

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.209 
uses an ir detector that is what you see
in<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:04.169> silver<00:03:04.709> ring<00:03:05.219> right<00:03:06.060> here<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:07.219> that

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
in this silver ring right here and that

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:09.890
