00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.160
 within the basic knowledge that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.080
 we must have maintenance of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.720
 kitchen plumbing there is an aspect 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.090
 that we should not neglect is the one that has 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.170
 what to do with the washing machine sockets 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.300
 the water inlet as the exit let's 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.920
 to see what things are the most important 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.930
 to know we have reproduced in this 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.840
 model the two elements so that the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.540
 see in a very clear way here 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.649
 we have the water intake is the most normal 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.390
 a single washing machine outlet is possible 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.700
 in the houses you find two with which 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.559
 you will have less problem and it is possible that 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.000
 in the most modern houses you already find 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.800
 two but let it be one of them water 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.289
 hot because the new regulations 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.239
 It also allows us to drink water 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.090
 hot mostly from solar energy 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.449
 and we close it to the dishwasher or the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.519
 washing machine 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.560
 let's see how we make a 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.689
 and installation in conditions especially 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.820
 when it can happen to us especially in 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.409
 old houses that we need to have two 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.229
 you take one for washing machine and one for 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.550
 dishwasher and we only have this one is very 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.310
 simple 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.140
 first of all we are going to dismantle the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.950
 taking of the washing machine for this agrees 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.900
 if you have a pincer like you're peak 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.760
 of parrot when they are big tools 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.100
 much better because you will always be able to 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.980
 work more at ease let's take the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.530
 the washing machine before we logically have 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.130
 that have always cut the step of 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.130
 tap 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.190
 fortunately, we do not have 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.750
 installed we're not going to throw water tube in 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.730
 your kitchen you have a little water at 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.830
 ground but if you have the caution of 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.340
 always close the cutting keys on the 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.340
 There are problems 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.180
 then let's release this key 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.830
 of washing machine now yes to drop a 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.270
 washing machine key logically how is the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.580
 that cuts the step I have to go more 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.709
 back in the installation and I should cut the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.850
 general installation at least if I have 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.380
 a cutting key for the kitchen the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.380
 kitchen and if not the house 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.450
 to release this key the easiest is 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.450
 Use the wrench 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.630
 Y 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.519
 very well I already have free take in this 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.780
 case we have made a shot that you see that 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.760
 so that we understand it well we have 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.670
 left out in your kitchen the normal 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.780
 is that this shot always go flush 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.120
 that is, we see it 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.680
 approximately in this way between 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.450
 tiles and here we have it for 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.540
 always understand the pieces that you 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.219
 we teach 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.750
 let's replace the key if we want 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.640
 give a double output the normal thing is that 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.939
 just replace it with a tap of this 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.680
 type this is a double element with the 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.019
 metal handles as you see and that I 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.079
 gives service simultaneously 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.430
 example to the washing machine and the dishwasher 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.890
 exactly install it 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.269
 just like when we dismantled it the only 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.670
 extra precaution that we have to 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.980
 have always installed a tap or 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.720
 any item that has no place 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.840
 directly a board is that we have 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.000
 to give Teflon 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.000
 so we go to the usual procedure 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.290
 we take the teflon in the right hand and 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.139
 Always remember when we give Teflon 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.950
 one important thing is that we have it 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:37.719
 to give in the sense that it facilitates 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.209
 when we are going to put it inside your 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:43.090
 thread does not unravel whenever 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.080
 facilitate and then that the tightening goes in 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.000
 the same direction as Teflon 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.100
 how many laps are we going to give it, then look 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.040
 in this really there are no rules 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.020
 fixed but always plumbing is said 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.069
 that if we give 20 laps about little 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:02.530
 more or less it will be well subject 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.530
 I think we 're going to leave it there 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.860
 and we are going to put it in its place 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.700
 I 'm not going to press it much because 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.310
 we see ourselves at the service does not 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.260
 missing for installation but you if 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.810
 always press it until it arrives 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.660
 really do stop you can help 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.540
 also from the gag or you can 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.690
 hook it 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.570
 better still with a key to make 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.070
 pressure if in spite of everything you will need a 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.930
 additional take more for any reason 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.070
 you also have the possibility of 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.950
 incorporate small bifurcators 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:50.560
 as this is a simple bifurcation of 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.560
 plastic that when I put it 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.430
 allows me to also take advantage of two 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.800
 exits is not the method as you see more 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.170
 effective because it's not a very system 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.880
 plastic clamping is not going 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.620
 to never make a thread as good as 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.140
 the metal but as a temporary solution 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.420
 if we tighten it thoroughly we could 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.570
 work but I say as a resource 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:16.560
 almost almost on time this would be the solution 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:19.380
 that allows any multiplication 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.360
 of elements inside the kitchen other 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.430
 problem that we sometimes have with the ones with 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.580
 the washing machine takes and that sometimes we 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.710
 consultations is the problem of good lime 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.630
 the problem of lime if you do not have it 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.010
 solved directly the uses themselves 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.070
 of detergents and their own 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.300
 manufacturer's instructions for 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.930
 old washing machines you have some 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.169
 solutions 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.169
 here 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.370
 this is the anti cal you see that it is a 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.470
 very simple material is about 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.320
 simply this kind of box 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.320
 a magnet carries inside discs 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.650
 ceramics that what they do is magnetize 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.140
 the lime particles that go through the 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.510
 entrance by the for the take that is the 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.310
 only function that has this 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.200
 magnetization that is done are the 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.720
 particles what it does is it avoids the 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.790
 inconstant effect of lime lime 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.220
 when it enters, it is no longer going to be fixed 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.560
 no place to place it can be 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.940
 place at any point 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.040
 of the shot 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.040
 and fix it is as simple as placing it 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.729
 holding it right here 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:30.129
 and to hook it that you already go 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:34.620
 doing quietly and you are 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:34.620
 traverse it through the past these lives 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.880
 You see, we put the four bridles 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.400
 as the one taken behind the washing machine does not 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.170
 you see and this element that you do not have to 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.670
 to be changing it has no wear no 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.860
 There is no one who forms anywhere 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.630
 it's simply magnetic disks 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.550
 that are acting all the time that 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.840
 this will work to remove the 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.250
 problems that we have of lime in the 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.570
 washing machine 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.610
 Well, these are the options 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.990
 Installation is very easy as you see you 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.910
 just in case you try anyway 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.230
 have always well controlled where 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.230
 you have the general cutting key
