on<00:01:45.660> this<00:01:45.750> record<00:01:46.080> which<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.440> play<00:01:46.619> melodies

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
on this record which is to play melodies

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.609 
on this record which is to play melodies
for<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> long<00:01:48.450> time<00:01:48.690> I<00:01:48.720> thought<00:01:48.990> melodies<00:01:49.440> were

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
for a long time I thought melodies were

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.200 
for a long time I thought melodies were
only<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> vocalists<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
only for the vocalists and that the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.760 
only for the vocalists and that the
guitar<00:01:51.540> should<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.050> heavy<00:01:52.259> riffs<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
guitar should just do heavy riffs and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
guitar should just do heavy riffs and
crazy<00:01:53.040> solos<00:01:53.520> stay<00:01:54.390> away<00:01:54.570> from<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.840> melodies

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
crazy solos stay away from the melodies

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.719 
crazy solos stay away from the melodies
but<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.650> this<00:01:56.009> album<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.550> broke<00:01:56.820> my<00:01:57.000> own<00:01:57.180> rule

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729
