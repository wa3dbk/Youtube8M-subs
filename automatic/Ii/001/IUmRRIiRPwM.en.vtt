on<00:00:09.000> right<00:00:09.269> now<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.740> evidence<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:11.429> hard<00:00:12.240> so

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
on right now this evidence is so hard so

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.129 
on right now this evidence is so hard so
monumentally<00:00:14.219> hard<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:15.330> hard<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.960> could

monumentally hard so hard that it could

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.830 
monumentally hard so hard that it could
be<00:00:16.260> mistaken<00:00:16.710> as<00:00:16.949> being<00:00:17.220> soft<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:18.420> don't<00:00:18.690> be

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
if you look closely at the end you can

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.500 
if you look closely at the end you can
see<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.290> number<00:00:40.770> 3<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.850> all<00:00:42.030> know<00:00:42.300> what

see the number 3 and we all know what

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.369 
see the number 3 and we all know what
that<00:00:42.719> means

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
that means

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.130 
that means
Hitler<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> Jew<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.570> centuries<00:00:45.899> people

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
Hitler was a Jew for centuries people

have been living under the false belief
that<00:00:48.239> Hitler<00:00:48.629> was<00:00:48.809> not<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.110> Jew<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:49.890> it

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
that Hitler was not a Jew but as it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.610 
that Hitler was not a Jew but as it
turns<00:00:50.280> out<00:00:50.489> he<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:51.719> now<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.410> may<00:00:52.590> be

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
turns out he was now you may be

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.350 
turns out he was now you may be
wondering<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> hell<00:00:53.879> does<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.059> have

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
wondering what the hell does that have

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.090 
wondering what the hell does that have
to<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.629> fallout<00:00:55.199> 4<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:55.980> you're

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
to do with fallout 4 and if you're

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.369 
to do with fallout 4 and if you're
wondering<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:57.059> come<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.329> men<00:00:57.750> can't

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
wondering that then come on men can't

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.939 
wondering that then come on men can't
you<00:00:58.590> see<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.789> obvious<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.379> hard

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
you see it it's so obvious and so hard

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.399 
you see it it's so obvious and so hard
since<00:01:02.609> Hitler<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> Jew<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:04.019> means<00:01:04.229> his

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
since Hitler was a Jew that means his

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.120 
since Hitler was a Jew that means his
religion<00:01:04.949> had<00:01:05.129> three<00:01:05.519> letters<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.299> three

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
religion had three letters in it three

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.350 
religion had three letters in it three
letters<00:01:08.130> looks<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.880> we're<00:01:09.060> back<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> square

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
letters looks like we're back to square

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.109 
letters looks like we're back to square
one<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> number<00:01:10.470> three<00:01:10.680> right<00:01:11.070> wrong<00:01:11.460> this

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
one with a number three right wrong this

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.240 
one with a number three right wrong this
number<00:01:12.570> three<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.020> different<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:13.979> it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
number three is different because it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.460 
number three is different because it
represents<00:01:14.820> letters<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.720> exact<00:01:16.140> same<00:01:16.320> amount

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
represents letters the exact same amount

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.260 
represents letters the exact same amount
of<00:01:16.680> letters<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.189> word<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.640> hasn't<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
of letters that the word out hasn't it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.230 
of letters that the word out hasn't it
and<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.720> word<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.380> course<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.549> fallout

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and the word out of course is in fallout

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179 
and the word out of course is in fallout
so<00:01:21.689> what<00:01:21.900> does<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.170> mean<00:01:22.470> well<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.830> don't<00:01:23.100> know

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
so what does this mean well I don't know

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.280 
so what does this mean well I don't know
but<00:01:23.460> what<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.790> know<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.990> divide

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
but what I do know is that if you divide

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.560 
but what I do know is that if you divide
3<00:01:25.710> by<00:01:26.070> 2<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:26.850> 1.5<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> 1<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.680> 1.5

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
3 by 2 you get 1.5 and the 1 in 1.5

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.420 
3 by 2 you get 1.5 and the 1 in 1.5
represents<00:01:30.570> fallout<00:01:31.049> 1<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.189> 5

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
represents fallout 1 and the 5

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.630 
represents fallout 1 and the 5
represents<00:01:33.030> fallout<00:01:33.869> 5<00:01:34.290> that's<00:01:34.920> right<00:01:35.250> not

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
represents fallout 5 that's right not

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.249 
represents fallout 5 that's right not
only<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.030> proven<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.509> fallout<00:01:36.840> 4<00:01:37.079> will

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
only have I proven that fallout 4 will

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.899 
only have I proven that fallout 4 will
be<00:01:37.380> released<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.070> I've<00:01:38.189> also<00:01:38.369> proven<00:01:38.820> that

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
be released but I've also proven that

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.649 
be released but I've also proven that
fallout<00:01:39.180> 5<00:01:39.570> will<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.229> well<00:01:40.700> damn<00:01:41.700> I'm<00:01:42.000> good

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
fallout 5 will be as well damn I'm good

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.749 
fallout 5 will be as well damn I'm good
but<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> doesn't<00:01:43.409> stop<00:01:43.740> there<00:01:44.159> because<00:01:44.460> I'm
