I guess a close friend or family member
like<00:02:55.849> not<00:02:56.000> like<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.180> random<00:02:56.540> person<00:02:56.780> public

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109

like the pores of my nose have seen
larger<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.470> don't<00:03:03.470> know<00:03:03.530> why<00:03:03.739> I<00:03:04.069> think<00:03:04.760> it's

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
larger I don't know why I think it's

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.910 
larger I don't know why I think it's
because<00:03:05.480> when<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.840> when<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.560> use<00:03:06.769> these

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
because when you when you use these

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.069 
because when you when you use these
strips<00:03:07.730> they're<00:03:08.090> very<00:03:08.299> very<00:03:08.480> harsh<00:03:08.780> on<00:03:08.989> your

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.410 
strips they're very very harsh on your
face<00:03:09.349> so<00:03:10.250> because<00:03:10.609> they<00:03:10.730> essentially<00:03:11.060> remove

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
face so because they essentially remove

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.160 
face so because they essentially remove
the<00:03:11.569> first<00:03:11.750> layer<00:03:11.959> of<00:03:11.989> skin<00:03:12.680> um<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:14.170> once

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
the first layer of skin um and once

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.660 
the first layer of skin um and once
you've<00:03:15.379> removed<00:03:15.709> all<00:03:15.950> that<00:03:16.040> dirt<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.400> oil

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
a little bit larger and more defined

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.539 
a little bit larger and more defined
because<00:03:45.379> it<00:03:45.680> just<00:03:45.829> is<00:03:45.949> there's<00:03:46.220> always<00:03:46.370> that

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
because it just is there's always that

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
that and then almost having like just

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.509 
that and then almost having like just
enlarging<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.840> pore<00:03:57.109> over<00:03:57.440> time<00:03:57.919> that

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
enlarging that pore over time that

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.309 
enlarging that pore over time that
you'll<00:03:58.669> see<00:03:59.000> on<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.389> sides<00:03:59.599> of<00:03:59.690> your<00:03:59.810> nose<00:03:59.959> so

I really really regret

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.599 
I really really regret
honestly<00:04:02.690> using<00:04:03.139> these<00:04:03.290> um<00:04:03.590> I've<00:04:04.250> stopped

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
honestly using these um I've stopped

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.729 
honestly using these um I've stopped
using<00:04:04.790> them<00:04:05.060> since<00:04:05.389> I<00:04:05.629> just<00:04:05.989> take<00:04:06.349> care<00:04:06.590> of<00:04:06.650> my

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
using them since I just take care of my

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.099 
using them since I just take care of my
skin<00:04:06.799> a<00:04:07.129> lot<00:04:07.280> better<00:04:07.519> so<00:04:07.790> I<00:04:08.090> eliminate<00:04:08.930> the

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
skin a lot better so I eliminate the

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.219 
skin a lot better so I eliminate the
need<00:04:09.319> to<00:04:09.500> use<00:04:09.739> these<00:04:10.459> poor<00:04:10.970> strips<00:04:11.299> but<00:04:12.019> I

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:12.229 
need to use these poor strips but I

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.439 
need to use these poor strips but I
really<00:04:12.530> wish<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:12.739> I<00:04:13.040> had<00:04:13.370> known<00:04:13.639> that<00:04:13.970> that

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
really wish that I had known that that

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.779 
really wish that I had known that that
because<00:04:15.199> now<00:04:15.319> permanently<00:04:16.010> you<00:04:16.130> can't<00:04:16.430> reduce

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
because now permanently you can't reduce

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.659 
because now permanently you can't reduce
pores<00:04:17.239> yeah<00:04:18.049> one<00:04:18.650> of<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.889> things<00:04:19.159> to<00:04:19.430> reuse

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
pores yeah one of the things to reuse

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.200 
pores yeah one of the things to reuse
pore<00:04:19.970> size<00:04:20.209> is<00:04:20.709> um<00:04:21.739> you<00:04:22.520> could<00:04:22.729> try<00:04:22.940> beta

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
pore size is um you could try beta

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.399 
pore size is um you could try beta
hydroxy<00:04:23.779> acids

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:24.409 
hydroxy acids

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:26.589 
hydroxy acids
I<00:04:24.469> hear<00:04:25.340> they<00:04:25.490> go<00:04:25.639> really<00:04:25.940> really<00:04:26.060> deep<00:04:26.210> into

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
I hear they go really really deep into

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.700 
I hear they go really really deep into
the<00:04:26.719> skin<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.050> are<00:04:27.380> able

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
the skin and are able

to<00:04:27.830> clean<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.100> pores<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:28.820> I'll<00:04:29.539> do<00:04:29.690> another

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
to clean the pores and I'll do another

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.480 
to clean the pores and I'll do another
video<00:04:30.169> about<00:04:30.380> that<00:04:30.740> once<00:04:30.949> I<00:04:31.039> have<00:04:31.190> researched

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
video about that once I have researched

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.490 
video about that once I have researched
more<00:04:31.820> about<00:04:32.120> really<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.660> ingredients<00:04:33.380> of<00:04:33.440> the

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
more about really the ingredients of the

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.870 
more about really the ingredients of the
chemicals<00:04:33.889> and<00:04:33.949> what<00:04:34.100> it<00:04:34.190> does<00:04:34.400> exactly<00:04:34.639> to

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
chemicals and what it does exactly to

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.540 
chemicals and what it does exactly to
your<00:04:34.940> skin<00:04:35.330> but<00:04:36.139> I<00:04:36.320> highly<00:04:36.650> don't<00:04:36.979> recommend

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
your skin but I highly don't recommend

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.820 
your skin but I highly don't recommend
this<00:04:37.820> um<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.750> think<00:04:39.080> it's<00:04:39.380> kind<00:04:39.620> of<00:04:39.680> one<00:04:39.800> of

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
this um I think it's kind of one of

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.279 
this um I think it's kind of one of
those<00:04:39.949> easy<00:04:40.669> cop<00:04:41.150> outs<00:04:41.389> and<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:41.780> feels<00:04:41.960> really

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
those easy cop outs and it feels really

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.469
