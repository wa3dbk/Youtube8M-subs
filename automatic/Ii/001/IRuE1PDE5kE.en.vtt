tomorrow is Beach so I came up with this
idea<00:00:17.070> where<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.490> would<00:00:17.609> start<00:00:18.000> off<00:00:18.119> wearing<00:00:18.420> a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
idea where I would start off wearing a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.349 
idea where I would start off wearing a
pilot<00:00:19.170> suit<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.039> then<00:00:20.520> I'd<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> stewardess

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
pilot suit and then I'd be a stewardess

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.320 
pilot suit and then I'd be a stewardess
and<00:00:21.660> then<00:00:22.260> I'd<00:00:22.380> end<00:00:22.410> up<00:00:22.859> as<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.550> hula<00:00:23.880> dancer<00:00:23.970> on

and then I'd end up as a hula dancer on
the<00:00:24.390> beach<00:00:24.650> so<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> thought<00:00:25.980> about<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.460> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.330 
the beach so I thought about it for a
really<00:00:26.699> long<00:00:26.939> time<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.750> then<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.650> thought<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
really long time and then I thought I

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.590 
really long time and then I thought I
