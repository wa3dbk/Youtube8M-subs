in<00:00:05.430> one<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.820> my<00:00:05.910> other<00:00:06.030> videos<00:00:06.150> I<00:00:06.660> talked<00:00:06.930> about

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
in one of my other videos I talked about

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.410 
in one of my other videos I talked about
how<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.830> made<00:00:08.250> very<00:00:08.700> cheap<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.210> cheerful

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
how I made very cheap and cheerful

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.870 
how I made very cheap and cheerful
landing<00:00:09.990> gear<00:00:10.230> that<00:00:10.740> was<00:00:10.860> very<00:00:11.160> light<00:00:11.520> and

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
landing gear that was very light and

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.470 
landing gear that was very light and
nice<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.050> robust<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.800> this<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:15.000> basically

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
nice and robust and this is basically

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.589 
nice and robust and this is basically
the<00:00:15.809> pieces<00:00:16.380> that<00:00:16.650> are<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.950> those<00:00:17.189> likes<00:00:18.029> and

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
the pieces that are in those likes and

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.260 
the pieces that are in those likes and
what<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.290> a<00:00:19.349> 35<00:00:19.950> millimeter<00:00:20.490> PCB

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
what it is is a 35 millimeter PCB

the top a little rubber foot and then

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.900 
the top a little rubber foot and then
I'm<00:00:27.300> not<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.480> little<00:00:27.869> black<00:00:28.320> nylon<00:00:28.740> screw<00:00:29.520> to<00:00:29.760> go

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
I'm not a little black nylon screw to go

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.759 
I'm not a little black nylon screw to go
together<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.960> make<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.410> really

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
together and to make it really

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.040 
together and to make it really
straightforward<00:00:32.120> you<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.150> put<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.720> screw

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
straightforward you just put the screw

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.049 
straightforward you just put the screw
through<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.559> foot<00:00:38.390> screw<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.570> foot<00:00:40.790> into<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
through the foot screw the foot into the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
through the foot screw the foot into the
PCB<00:00:44.210> put<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.510> through<00:00:46.080> the<00:00:46.199> hole<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.769> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
PCB put that through the hole in the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.149 
PCB put that through the hole in the
model<00:00:47.220> and<00:00:47.400> put<00:00:47.970> the<00:00:48.120> nut<00:00:48.330> on<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.750> other<00:00:48.870> side

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
model and put the nut on the other side

very<00:00:50.159> very<00:00:50.670> straightforward<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.989> challenge

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
very very straightforward the challenge

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.240 
very very straightforward the challenge
that<00:00:52.379> I've<00:00:52.470> been<00:00:52.500> having<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.040> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
that I've been having is that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.100 
that I've been having is that
particularly<00:00:53.549> with<00:00:53.729> fpv<00:00:54.239> flights<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
particularly with fpv flights the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.289 
particularly with fpv flights the
landing<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.680> not<00:00:55.949> always<00:00:56.220> as<00:00:56.519> controlled<00:00:57.059> as

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:57.299 
landing is not always as controlled as

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:58.939 
landing is not always as controlled as
I'd<00:00:57.479> like<00:00:57.750> sometimes<00:00:58.260> I've<00:00:58.440> got<00:00:58.589> a<00:00:58.619> little<00:00:58.860> bit

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
I'd like sometimes I've got a little bit

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.710 
I'd like sometimes I've got a little bit
of<00:00:59.040> forward<00:00:59.309> sideways<00:00:59.970> backward<00:01:00.479> movement

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
of forward sideways backward movement

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.329 
of forward sideways backward movement
and<00:01:01.110> that<00:01:01.860> it's<00:01:02.640> causing<00:01:03.030> these<00:01:03.150> to<00:01:03.390> break<00:01:03.600> off

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
and that it's causing these to break off

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.760 
and that it's causing these to break off
at<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.460> very<00:01:05.700> top<00:01:06.000> part<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.840> every

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
at this very top part here and every

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.289 
at this very top part here and every
time<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:08.700> potentially<00:01:09.180> also

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
time I do that I'm potentially also

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.569 
time I do that I'm potentially also
losing<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> foot<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.859> what<00:01:11.250> I've<00:01:11.340> done<00:01:11.520> is

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
losing the foot so what I've done is

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.310 
losing the foot so what I've done is
kind<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.939> upgraded<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.509> design<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.140> want<00:01:13.259> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
kind of upgraded the design and want to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.319 
kind of upgraded the design and want to
share<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.340> rather<00:01:14.939> than<00:01:15.119> have

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
share that with you so rather than have

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.170 
share that with you so rather than have
these<00:01:15.509> pieces<00:01:15.899> what<00:01:16.439> I've<00:01:16.560> done<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.070> I've<00:01:17.820> firm

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
these pieces what I've done is I've firm

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.789 
these pieces what I've done is I've firm
still<00:01:18.479> kept<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> foot<00:01:19.109> and<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> other<00:01:19.619> bits

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
still kept the foot and the other bits

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.690 
still kept the foot and the other bits
and<00:01:19.920> bobs<00:01:21.109> but<00:01:22.109> I've<00:01:22.229> got<00:01:22.380> rid<00:01:22.649> of<00:01:22.679> those<00:01:23.399> two

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and bobs but I've got rid of those two

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.529 
and bobs but I've got rid of those two
pieces<00:01:23.969> and<00:01:24.390> replaced<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:26.329> stand<00:01:27.329> off

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
pieces and replaced it with a stand off

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.300 
pieces and replaced it with a stand off
that<00:01:28.289> has<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:29.329> m3<00:01:30.329> thread<00:01:30.929> all<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.590> way<00:01:31.859> through

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
that has a m3 thread all the way through

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.580 
that has a m3 thread all the way through
and<00:01:32.579> then<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.659> actually<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:35.749> then<00:01:36.749> put

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and then what I actually do is then put

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.310 
and then what I actually do is then put
the<00:01:37.950> bolt<00:01:38.249> a<00:01:38.549> metal<00:01:39.420> bolt<00:01:39.659> through<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.109> bottom

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the bolt a metal bolt through the bottom

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.190 
the bolt a metal bolt through the bottom
of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.679> model<00:01:40.979> with<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.090> washer<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:44.119> then

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
of the model with the washer and then

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.550 
of the model with the washer and then
that<00:01:46.200> bolt<00:01:47.179> actually<00:01:48.179> screws<00:01:48.689> into<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.319> end

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that bolt actually screws into one end

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.499 
that bolt actually screws into one end
of<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:51.600> foot<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:55.289> pad<00:01:55.920> goes<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
of the foot and the pad goes in to the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.489 
of the foot and the pad goes in to the
bottom<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.640> much<00:02:00.240> much<00:02:00.899> stronger

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
bottom and that is a much much stronger

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.770 
bottom and that is a much much stronger
leg<00:02:01.859> and<00:02:02.219> what<00:02:02.429> happens<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.999> in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.359> event<00:02:03.630> of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
leg and what happens is in the event of

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.919 
leg and what happens is in the event of
a<00:02:04.310> slightly<00:02:05.310> faster<00:02:05.460> than<00:02:06.030> expected<00:02:06.210> crash

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
a slightly faster than expected crash

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.950 
a slightly faster than expected crash
what<00:02:07.439> happens<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.490> this<00:02:08.700> screw<00:02:09.210> actually

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
what happens is just this screw actually

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.690 
what happens is just this screw actually
bends<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.470> little<00:02:10.710> bit<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.160> can<00:02:11.310> bend<00:02:11.580> it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
bends a little bit and you can bend it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.809 
bends a little bit and you can bend it
back<00:02:11.970> with<00:02:12.330> your<00:02:12.540> fingers<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:14.220> I'm<00:02:14.670> actually

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
back with your fingers so I'm actually

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.339 
back with your fingers so I'm actually
just<00:02:15.030> about<00:02:15.239> fit<00:02:15.510> one<00:02:15.659> on<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.900> our<00:02:15.989> model<00:02:16.260> I

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
just about fit one on to our model I

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.750 
just about fit one on to our model I
thought<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.709> was<00:02:16.830> useful<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.310> show

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
thought it was useful to show

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.729 
thought it was useful to show
it<00:02:17.879> so<00:02:18.390> let's<00:02:18.599> just<00:02:18.840> zoom<00:02:18.900> out<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.590> we'll<00:02:19.709> have

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
it so let's just zoom out and we'll have

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.819 
it so let's just zoom out and we'll have
a<00:02:19.920> look<00:02:20.189> at<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:21.299> being<00:02:21.659> installed<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.439> one<00:02:22.769> of

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
a look at it being installed on one of

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.850 
a look at it being installed on one of
my<00:02:23.040> quads<00:02:24.019> so<00:02:25.019> here's<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.470> quality<00:02:25.769> it's

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
my quads so here's the quality it's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.800 
my quads so here's the quality it's
already<00:02:26.159> got<00:02:26.730> four<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.000> these<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.360> place<00:02:27.599> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
already got four of these in place and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.509 
already got four of these in place and
you<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:28.019> see<00:02:28.230> what<00:02:28.590> I've<00:02:28.860> done<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.280> an

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
you can see what I've done it's an

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.690 
you can see what I've done it's an
actual<00:02:30.209> pin<00:02:30.689> itself<00:02:31.140> stays<00:02:31.739> because<00:02:32.519> it's

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
actual pin itself stays because it's

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.089 
actual pin itself stays because it's
actually<00:02:32.909> screwed<00:02:33.599> into<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.290> plate<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.799> that

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
actually screwed into the plate and that

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.100 
actually screwed into the plate and that
means<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.549> if<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.940> do<00:02:36.000> lose<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.780> little

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
means that if I do lose this little

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.350 
means that if I do lose this little
piece<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.560> can<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.190> screw<00:02:38.400> another<00:02:38.610> one<00:02:38.879> onto

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
piece I can just screw another one onto

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.580 
piece I can just screw another one onto
this<00:02:39.480> rather<00:02:39.780> than<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:40.079> to<00:02:40.230> fiddle<00:02:40.409> about

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
this rather than have to fiddle about

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.800 
this rather than have to fiddle about
trying<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.430> get<00:02:41.519> my<00:02:41.640> fingers<00:02:42.060> into<00:02:42.329> hole<00:02:42.510> nuts

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
trying to get my fingers into hole nuts

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.960 
trying to get my fingers into hole nuts
together<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.409> whatnot<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.430> put<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.790> on

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
together and whatnot so to put this on

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.699 
together and whatnot so to put this on
it's<00:02:45.150> pretty<00:02:45.359> straightforward<00:02:45.629> or<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.560> we

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
it's pretty straightforward or that we

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.080 
it's pretty straightforward or that we
now<00:02:46.890> do<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.450> just<00:02:48.450> we<00:02:48.569> roll<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.019> down<00:02:50.090> for

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
now do is just we roll this down for

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.289 
now do is just we roll this down for
very<00:02:51.390> lightweight<00:02:52.400> landing<00:02:53.400> gear<00:02:53.730> that

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
very lightweight landing gear that

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.559 
very lightweight landing gear that
doesn't<00:02:54.659> cost<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.989> lot<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.879> will<00:02:56.879> take<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.269> lot

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
doesn't cost a lot and will take a lot

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.550 
doesn't cost a lot and will take a lot
of<00:02:57.599> punishment

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
of punishment

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.379 
of punishment
hopefully<00:02:59.280> that's<00:02:59.430> useful<00:02:59.639> for<00:02:59.849> some<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.239> you

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
hopefully that's useful for some of you

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.210 
hopefully that's useful for some of you
who<00:03:00.420> are<00:03:00.690> looking<00:03:00.930> at<00:03:01.049> this<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.379> figuring<00:03:02.099> out

how to put legs on to a onto a quad nice

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.180 
how to put legs on to a onto a quad nice
thing<00:03:06.150> about<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.420> 35<00:03:06.840> millimetres<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.620> for

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
thing about the 35 millimetres is for

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.699 
thing about the 35 millimetres is for
pretty<00:03:08.670> much<00:03:08.760> every<00:03:09.269> 3s<00:03:10.170> battery<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.620> you're

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
pretty much every 3s battery that you're

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.190 
pretty much every 3s battery that you're
going<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:10.859> come<00:03:11.069> across<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.579> even<00:03:12.510> some<00:03:13.109> of

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
going to come across and even some of

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.229 
going to come across and even some of
the<00:03:13.260> thinner<00:03:13.470> for<00:03:13.709> us<00:03:13.889> is<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.459> gives<00:03:14.760> just

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
the thinner for us is it gives just

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.750 
the thinner for us is it gives just
enough<00:03:15.480> clearance<00:03:15.959> between<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.950> battery<00:03:17.609> and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
enough clearance between the battery and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.509 
enough clearance between the battery and
the<00:03:18.150> ground<00:03:18.409> thanks<00:03:19.409> for<00:03:19.530> watching<00:03:19.829> please
