all right welcome back we have icing

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.690 
all right welcome back we have icing
here<00:00:04.020> we're<00:00:04.290> going<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.560> create<00:00:04.950> icing<00:00:05.580> we're

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
here we're going to create icing we're

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.509 
here we're going to create icing we're
going<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.000> use<00:00:06.180> shortening<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.220> if<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.340> don't

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
going to use shortening and if you don't

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.009 
going to use shortening and if you don't
have<00:00:08.730> shortening<00:00:09.240> if<00:00:09.450> you're<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.840> country

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
have shortening if you're in a country

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.680 
have shortening if you're in a country
like<00:00:10.639> when<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.670> live<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:11.969> New<00:00:12.120> Zealand<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.509> find

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
like when I live in New Zealand I find

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.959 
like when I live in New Zealand I find
it<00:00:12.809> very<00:00:13.440> difficult<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.889> find<00:00:14.070> shortening<00:00:14.519> you

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
it very difficult to find shortening you

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.750 
it very difficult to find shortening you
can<00:00:15.120> also<00:00:15.299> use<00:00:15.570> butter<00:00:16.160> if<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.220> are<00:00:17.460> going<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
can also use butter if you are going to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.179 
can also use butter if you are going to
use<00:00:17.880> butter<00:00:18.090> try<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> find<00:00:18.779> unsalted<00:00:19.740> butter

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
use butter try to find unsalted butter

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.490 
use butter try to find unsalted butter
and<00:00:20.720> then<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:22.080> icing<00:00:22.890> sugar<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:24.289> we<00:00:25.289> have

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
and then we have icing sugar and we have

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.490 
and then we have icing sugar and we have
some<00:00:25.800> warm<00:00:26.070> water<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.720> some<00:00:27.960> instant

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
some warm water and we have some instant

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.130 
some warm water and we have some instant
coffee<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:29.220> warm<00:00:29.760> water<00:00:30.740> now<00:00:32.059> this<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.239> about<00:00:33.480> 2

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
coffee in warm water now this is about 2

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.220 
coffee in warm water now this is about 2
cups<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:35.149> shortening<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.480> again<00:00:36.750> if<00:00:36.960> you're<00:00:37.079> in

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
cups of shortening so again if you're in

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.280 
cups of shortening so again if you're in
the<00:00:37.320> metric<00:00:37.680> system<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.489> cup<00:00:39.239> size<00:00:39.450> with<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the metric system just a cup size with a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.940 
the metric system just a cup size with a
bit<00:00:40.469> more<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.120> this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.360> about<00:00:42.660> 3<00:00:43.410> cups<00:00:43.649> of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
bit more and this is about 3 cups of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.139 
bit more and this is about 3 cups of
icing<00:00:44.489> sugar<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:46.489> we<00:00:47.489> will<00:00:47.640> see<00:00:47.820> how<00:00:47.969> much<00:00:48.090> of

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
icing sugar and we will see how much of

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
icing sugar and we will see how much of
that<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.570> need<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.170> go<00:00:49.320> alright<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that we need as we go alright so the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.529 
that we need as we go alright so the
first<00:00:50.730> thing<00:00:50.879> we're<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.420> we're

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
first thing we're going to do is we're

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.670 
first thing we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> put<00:00:51.870> our<00:00:51.960> shortening<00:00:52.350> into<00:00:52.469> our

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
going to put our shortening into our

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:03.529 
going to put our shortening into our
bowl<00:00:53.059> using<00:00:54.059> our<00:00:54.329> spatula<00:01:02.390> shortening<00:01:03.390> is

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
bowl using our spatula shortening is

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.370 
bowl using our spatula shortening is
just<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.989> vegetable<00:01:04.530> fat<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:06.020> if<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.200> don't

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
just a vegetable fat so if you don't

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.050 
just a vegetable fat so if you don't
watch<00:01:07.500> shortening<00:01:07.950> years<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.430> also<00:01:08.580> just

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
watch shortening years you can also just

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.590 
watch shortening years you can also just
look<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.390> vegetable<00:01:10.380> fat<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.360> we'll<00:01:12.360> just

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
look up vegetable fat and we'll just

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.660 
look up vegetable fat and we'll just
scrape<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.170> into<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> bowl<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.549> we're

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
scrape that into the bowl and what we're

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.130 
scrape that into the bowl and what we're
going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.090> we're<00:01:15.210> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.450> mix<00:01:15.840> this

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
going to do is we're going to mix this

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.410 
going to do is we're going to mix this
we're<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.470> beat<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.939> like<00:01:17.939> crazy<00:01:20.420> until

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
we're going to beat it like crazy until

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.440 
we're going to beat it like crazy until
it's<00:01:21.570> nice<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.950> smooth<00:01:22.950> before<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.909> add<00:01:24.090> any

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it's nice and smooth before we add any

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.200 
it's nice and smooth before we add any
of<00:01:24.810> our<00:01:24.930> other<00:01:25.020> ingredients<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.909> let's<00:01:26.939> take

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
of our other ingredients so let's take

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.359 
of our other ingredients so let's take
our<00:01:27.330> blender

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
our blender

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.810 
our blender
now<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.240> start<00:01:30.600> mixing<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:31.110> low

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
now you can start mixing on low

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.670 
now you can start mixing on low
otherwise<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.180> might<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.479> clump<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.170> throw

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
otherwise it might just clump and throw

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:46.480 
otherwise it might just clump and throw
it<00:01:34.799> at<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> full<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.820> start<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.150> low

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.510 

like<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:48.900> we<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.290> mix<00:01:49.680> um<00:01:49.920> hi<00:01:50.190> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
like that and now we can mix um hi and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.880 
like that and now we can mix um hi and
really<00:01:51.030> get<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.270> nice<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.420> creamy<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.470> fluffy

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
really get it nice and creamy and fluffy

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.240 
really get it nice and creamy and fluffy
and<00:01:53.190> light

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.429 

and<00:01:59.250> again<00:02:00.090> slowly<00:02:00.450> turning<00:02:00.810> off<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.259> beater

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
and again slowly turning off the beater

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.929 
and again slowly turning off the beater
before<00:02:01.829> raising<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.429> up<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.759> you're<00:02:02.909> not

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
before raising it up so you're not

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.719 
before raising it up so you're not
spraying<00:02:03.539> all<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.829> shortening<00:02:05.369> all<00:02:05.490> over

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
spraying all of that shortening all over

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.600 
spraying all of that shortening all over
the<00:02:05.850> place<00:02:06.060> where<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.960> nice

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
the place where we have a nice

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.400 
the place where we have a nice
consistency<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.910> nice<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.450> smooth<00:02:10.080> and

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
consistency is nice and smooth and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.940 
consistency is nice and smooth and
whipped<00:02:10.769> up<00:02:12.019> okay<00:02:13.019> so<00:02:13.080> now<00:02:13.410> we're<00:02:13.709> going<00:02:13.830> to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
whipped up okay so now we're going to

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.610 
whipped up okay so now we're going to
add<00:02:14.129> our<00:02:14.489> icing<00:02:15.209> sugar<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:16.470> about

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
add our icing sugar so that's about

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.490 
add our icing sugar so that's about
three<00:02:16.920> cups<00:02:17.129> worth<00:02:17.480> again<00:02:18.480> if<00:02:19.080> you're<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
three cups worth again if you're in the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.869 
three cups worth again if you're in the
metric<00:02:19.769> system<00:02:19.799> I'm<00:02:20.250> not<00:02:20.430> sure<00:02:20.580> how<00:02:20.700> much<00:02:20.819> that

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
metric system I'm not sure how much that

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.320 
metric system I'm not sure how much that
is<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:21.209> simply<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> nice<00:02:22.049> tall<00:02:22.349> glass<00:02:23.060> will<00:02:24.060> do

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
is but simply a nice tall glass will do

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.309 
is but simply a nice tall glass will do
this<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.440> also<00:02:25.769> very<00:02:26.069> versatile<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:27.319> rarely

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
this is also very versatile I rarely

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.990 
this is also very versatile I rarely
make<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.010> exact<00:02:29.400> amount<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:31.010> always<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.370> try

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
make the exact amount I always just try

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.259 
make the exact amount I always just try
and<00:02:33.239> see<00:02:33.510> now<00:02:34.370> now<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.579> this<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:36.000> here<00:02:36.120> if

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
and see now now that this is in here if

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.030 
and see now now that this is in here if
we<00:02:36.420> go<00:02:36.599> in<00:02:36.750> there<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:37.049> our<00:02:37.079> mixer<00:02:37.590> on<00:02:37.980> high

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
we go in there with our mixer on high

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.420 
we go in there with our mixer on high
it's<00:02:38.730> going<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.060> pull<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:40.230> go<00:02:40.410> everywhere<00:02:41.160> so

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
it's going to pull and go everywhere so

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.870 
it's going to pull and go everywhere so
we<00:02:42.120> really<00:02:42.510> want<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.780> actually<00:02:43.200> first<00:02:43.730> mix<00:02:44.730> it

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
we really want to actually first mix it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.839 
we really want to actually first mix it
before<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.299> turn<00:02:45.480> on<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.840> little<00:02:46.440> bit<00:02:46.709> just<00:02:47.579> to

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
before we turn on a little bit just to

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.080 
before we turn on a little bit just to
get<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.150> scrubbing<00:02:48.870> onto<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.970> it's

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
get it scrubbing onto it so that it's

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:59.589 
get it scrubbing onto it so that it's
not<00:02:51.209> going<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.480> fly<00:02:51.660> everywhere<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:56.239> little<00:02:57.239> bit

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:06.160 

got<00:03:00.599> some<00:03:00.870> chunks

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.340 

see<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.940> now<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.270> can<00:03:09.390> turn<00:03:09.630> on<00:03:09.690> my<00:03:09.810> mixer<00:03:10.200> on

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
see that now I can turn on my mixer on

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.150 
see that now I can turn on my mixer on
low<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.850> won't<00:03:12.000> fly<00:03:12.240> all<00:03:12.420> over<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.630> place

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
low and it won't fly all over the place

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:33.149 
low and it won't fly all over the place
all<00:03:14.160> right<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:14.460> just<00:03:14.760> turn<00:03:14.910> though

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159
