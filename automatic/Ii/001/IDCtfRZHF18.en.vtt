00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.209 

the<00:01:42.209> scallions<00:01:42.780> are<00:01:42.959> being<00:01:43.289> made<00:01:43.619> into<00:01:43.950> a

paste so I don't really want to use the

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.039 
paste so I don't really want to use the
grinder<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.459> the<00:01:47.579> scallions<00:01:48.090> next<00:01:48.780> I'm<00:01:48.899> going
