00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
becomes a little flat little boring so

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.749 
becomes a little flat little boring so
we're<00:01:18.900> gonna<00:01:18.990> find<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.920> middle<00:01:20.369> ground

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.280 
we're gonna find that in middle ground
of<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.060> move<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> closer

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
of that move the closer

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.050
