00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.910
 all the guys mailing first Marx and the beer is Karl Plech buying because I had to go 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.750
 play another game i can be sure if play black ops 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.529
 Krippner through 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.509
 That's why I dug up somewhere in a quarter 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.509
 So the part of Strate pisses me off blackouts 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.220
 and I do not know what they did Black Ops, however, is here 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.760
 shooting through the wall is not nearly as extreme as in Black Ops 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.759
 Car ends up not nearly as extreme as Black Ops 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.280
 there are other things energy but otherwise that is actually 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.590
 one of the best percent multiplayer games she has admitted 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.190
 so far 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.780
 the bags are maybe a bit cathedral times good 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.490
 Amos say in the old code Ahlen is it's almost only I still only saw one 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.740
 dream 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.450
 but almost exclusively that is characterized by being in the case 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.370
 easy 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.359
 all play at the end of 40 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.510
 over threw in this part are bad 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.000
 Jordaan from most but have it 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.810
 and as Spock then drops with grenades in the end Mertel Don 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.940
 I play pretty much the worst class you can play this game 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.340
 or hip worst 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.510
 this weapon is the biggest crap 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.050
 you can see the thing has incredible muzzle-fire choice on the one 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.420
 Opponent targets the old times title 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.590
 the first shot no longer 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.590
 excluded Branch Baker will hit big 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.300
 Xing warps 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.310
 at the local fire department Rensch 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.750
 and Pierre's race Bettys her this one channel is one of the biggest 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.800
 Brands like this game actually hate the rest very well percent 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.060
 partly better are additional costs than worse are the reason 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.950
 you can i'm really good with a list actually 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.460
 There are a lot more delicious 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.460
 yes customization gives 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510
 Alone for Ganske Street for the whole day 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.800
 by law on VOX 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.680
 however, around 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.140
 the relatively fast test field was worth what is always so many 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.140
 Variation possibilities are there really not true 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.469
 this part are these but seemed a pretty over 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:11.670
 Compared to other things 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.180
 With Dieter Nuhr finally developing now the one music box in 40 recorded 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.609
 was also here in the chanson I had failed 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.899
 Pistols are invariably poor that part of the bush entered badly 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.929
 Voigt's and Context Infinity is doing chance around 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.739
 Melee attacks have seen one with a deep little ranger poster 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.250
 that was the maximum caught only in Schlichting cold 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.819
 far way is not possible 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:36.869
 the dogs 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:40.709
 the poet the most important but is now gone are 1 7 scored in the parts 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:46.119
 but the opponents do not make room in front, but they need two hits 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.309
 So the main work is not to know some dogs are sold in 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.900
 with Dietrich trying the Orishas country are very similar 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.919
 through the muzzle flash Nadal just not 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.489
 Skibbe me flat 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.700
 Pfizer I deliberately again but is class 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.129
 Say patterns 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.849
 Here it was easier for me to do this professional racing and that through 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.339
 The walls reveal the story in Black Ops Call extremely 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.129
 I hope so a little bit something improved 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.989
 it is very commendable Saul I think what I think is good in principle is that 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.439
 one the game for people with slow connection 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.489
 want to make playable 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.119
 which in my opinion really Diack around 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:25.200
 the main reason was that triumphant change 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.200
 with Black Ops 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:30.559
 and around 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.309
 the purchases four and five 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.139
 was that shooting the walls not so bad 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.139
 maybe the host advantage was stronger 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:41.759
 Nero can not say anything 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:44.599
 Sansal in Black Ops actually did that 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.599
 that apparently really transferred the hit 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.239
 ummann has arrived if a restaurant 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.279
 at one on DAX put correctly 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:58.019
 in Altenthann they have my own such a thing in my mind 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.299
 made 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.029
 In other words, we have looked to see if Lokal was really wrong and then 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:04.939
 again on the house that is again 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.599
 that had the crisis advantage that gave 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.839
 significantly less through the wall I shoot and after he read 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:11.999
 Black Ops is 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:15.129
 if you have to go to Renneberg you have to say that 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.949
 so bad 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:19.690
 This was never the beginning of the band's history 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:20.699
 from 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.930
 from Cord 4 5 to 6 20 back 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.229
 He sketched the game to say I got some other videos 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.590
 at the very beginning the uploaded 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.590
 So who wants more of God 15 I can see that yes 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.620
 and Lisa, I also have to play others 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.620
 the part always been a bit in the shade of cod4 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.620
 since the year cod4 actually 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.729
 Infinity Ward was once the chief developer of Cott 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.620
 now anyway 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.590
 no more 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.590
 or at least officially, I think so 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.539
 Arnach was the eleventh of the half of her employee 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.210
 did not imagine that that is that it goes on like this 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.930
 supposedly the next party is already in development I dare 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.059
 to remind him that it is not Infinity Ward 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:14.059
 and where do I want to believe yet no one 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:18.709
 One thing to say about the thing that seemed really good that day is agree 

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:19.680
 become 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.460
 So it's the worst kind of gun here 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.280
 around 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.990
 four play better different but actually in this machine 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.360
 should let play 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.360
 namely you are running fast 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.949
 one is very close to the outside air but shoots over race speed 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.069
 really to use 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.019
 So do not recommend around there no Europe eV always Warfare 2 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:45.249
 and also 13 percent so weird when, for example, couples followed 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:47.279
 Sondershausen the course 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.889
 beautifully reliable from percent higher with goal-setting legislative 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.930
 Percent, this weapon is not the best that plays for the power 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.809
 namely almost no damage as bad 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:58.800
 around 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.879
 yes times read that this weapon on the PC here I have to the table 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:03.719
 Studer 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:07.269
 The finally will probably be on the PC also supposedly different because Polanski makes 

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:09.289
 There were much less damage 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.219
 the Briton John was going to console console versions 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:14.710
 for whatever reason 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.139
 because of the absolute upper class here in this part SNP 40 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.280
 Plan Dagan out at annoying power with neutral loud percent so it is 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.249
 absolutely not important 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:28.169
 then allowed and around the popular even her Kanaken dry recognizes it 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.189
 you actually important character here 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.729
 Fleiner has restarted with 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.159
 around 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.150
 yes I think the game is also at the same time 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.069
 it is also up to 30 now 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:41.999
 It is good that it has not raised the Court 4 against which will be until 25 in the 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:43.529
 Free for all 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:47.529
 the buyers FBIs 30 clock MEZ again to three two he is pointless completely honest 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:51.129
 the more recommend role I want him to end the Londoner at a decent halftime 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.139
 are on that you are played new network 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:56.780
 Kirk m as you see here or maybe pull does not exist in this one 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.849
 Part of the canal in order Modern Warfare 2 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:01.379
 yes you can see 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.599
 many loved readers I should be opponents 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:07.330
 but as I said I have to go play others 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.919
 make it good first time closing
