00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello people welcome to one 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.000
 short ultimately opels in the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.870
 Information video about the game 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.550
 stronghold crusader 2 the game is 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.960
 Now recently appeared already 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.539
 three days ago and many wonder where 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.740
 is the actual card editor 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.180
 quite simply I go sometimes comes 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 Solution as you the card editor for 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.880
 stronghold crusader 2 gets in 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.820
 old team with you on library then 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.009
 you go down to tools then scrolls 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.020
 you a little and then you will find 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.809
 usually works two stronger 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.460
 the culprit we download you that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.670
 So two megawatts holds relatively 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.890
 kept small and then you get too 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.410
 put this one here on the desktop and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.030
 it is the folders accordingly 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:01:00.210
 her the search and the team apps come 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:04.530
 otherwise a windows 32 04 school reads 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.150
 and then that will be here that is in 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.180
 principle also the secret of the engine 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.830
 at 2 crusader and yes but you can 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.960
 just because the cards create so at 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.229
 the here of user here is before three 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.420
 knows the will with the stalker 2 map 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.330
 also know editor so are not 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.409
 a lot really different from that and me 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.409
 could show it to me very briefly 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.670
 which then looks here as follows 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.500
 Loading took something is also her 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.470
 see here but just the texture and 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.920
 very high quality card editor so the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.050
 texture, I believe too 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:58.250
 high so there's all very well 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:02:05.540
 to recognize in any case her last 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:07.730
 grad rupp and that of 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.960
 mccartneys holding knows each file new 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.700
 create 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:24.020
 the card was great the center 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:26.300
 courts the area here I think so 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.130
 even no feedback so best 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.160
 make free camera up here then can 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.800
 you also here that's not a 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.350
 game team so how stupid are you there 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.910
 can the cars roll left here 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.100
 you find something important for 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.230
 the beginning is in the world the 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.340
 Fractions of eight are completing 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.709
 the lands below can you 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.370
 install and then you have life here 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.959
 according to different colors too 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.520
 After that we had a well-adjusted 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:59.080
 Point of the west on sky rivers 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:02.450
 several such fun here borders plus 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.840
 has things to do with ctrl left click 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.100
 then wishing to express rom 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.600
 daily here things 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.600
 that's the water here, for example 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.780
 For example, we take the resources 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.750
 so once with the texture that 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.150
 then take the important issue of scratching here 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.510
 we choose the rosary the texture 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.800
 from this I am 31 and then the 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.730
 You can drive to the left 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.730
 to find a way around 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.159
 the oasis 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.110
 then you can stop but just source 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.640
 the funny still in play here must 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.260
 every tree here is really individual 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.370
 that means here you see everyone 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.599
 Tree is a single object played 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.280
 except you can see objects up here 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.620
 highlight disable very whole 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.629
 So again and then you can do so here 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.510
 the trees room amacker fun once 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:08.989
 should put down to water 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:12.349
 just like the mini e so have those were 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.209
 oase to yourself iron knows you can 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.789
 me as three hours 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:20.019
 the texture take my perfectly big 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.019
 That's what this is about 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:29.360
 show so know man or 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:32.530
 you can add fractions here like 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.530
 those big boobs 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.400
 that must be known 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.389
 then could have spent stones also see times 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.389
 a little bit bigger 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:55.249
 that you can do it then 

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:56.839
 likewise the ornament steiner can 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.930
 you clap on now so little 

00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:01.339
 Three of these are the basics if 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.749
 her here in the tile effect stone again 

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:04.580
 then you want to delete the control 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:06.169
 pension, it just has to make fun of it 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.449
 This area looked again and then 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.699
 it will be gone with kate again 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.479
 Add 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.039
 But it's just a little short 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.039
 gossip is fun 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:20.899
 so that one has seen everything that way 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:22.159
 you may still have some bad luck ornament here 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:25.580
 to do something like that here 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:30.080
 that does not look no and no 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.209
 So you know q2 so take your own building 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.020
 we enjoy the bergfried mark zuckerberg 

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:39.009
 with numero three that's in the big one 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.009
 there and the stables more 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:52.440
 so you also have everything here knows 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.720
 also to add sounds eg now 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.720
 here we have an oasis in the sound 2 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:05.030
 and still wind through the trees 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:13.410
 one would have to hear feet are the 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:15.479
 Landtechnik looks easy you can 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.130
 All German women and the card 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.560
 It would be best to reduce those around us 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.930
 he situations ground the muscle to 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.650
 show how exactly you all scale from 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.300
 the size of your rpo tutorial now 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.639
 to the map editor 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.320
 I hope I like it and when he gets one 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.720
 wanted to see more video of me like 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.169
 I would like to subscribe and do not subscribe until 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.169
