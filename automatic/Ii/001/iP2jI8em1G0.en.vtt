our<00:01:20.469> turn<00:01:20.799> will<00:01:21.039> be<00:01:21.159> wider<00:01:21.399> we<00:01:21.969> may<00:01:22.090> end<00:01:22.299> up

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
our turn will be wider we may end up

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.599 
our turn will be wider we may end up
hitting<00:01:22.869> a<00:01:23.079> mountain<00:01:23.380> so<00:01:23.889> we'll<00:01:24.069> do<00:01:24.219> our<00:01:24.340> turn

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
hitting a mountain so we'll do our turn

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
us down here which you can see it's a

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.839 
us down here which you can see it's a
fourteen<00:01:41.139> hundred<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.409> thirty<00:01:41.649> feet<00:01:42.009> if<00:01:42.369> your

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:42.849 
fourteen hundred and thirty feet if your

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:46.949 
fourteen hundred and thirty feet if your
airspeed<00:01:43.209> is<00:01:43.359> 135<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:45.090> 2040<00:01:46.090> feet<00:01:46.329> if<00:01:46.630> your

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
airspeed is 135 and 2040 feet if your

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.529 
airspeed is 135 and 2040 feet if your
airspeed<00:01:47.499> is<00:01:47.649> above<00:01:47.829> 180<00:01:48.399> knots<00:01:48.639> now<00:01:49.149> we'll<00:01:49.389> be

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
airspeed is above 180 knots now we'll be

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.599 
airspeed is above 180 knots now we'll be
about<00:01:49.630> 155<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:50.920> we're<00:01:51.099> going<00:01:51.219> to<00:01:51.279> keep<00:01:51.459> it

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
about 155 so we're going to keep it

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.669 
about 155 so we're going to keep it
about<00:01:51.700> 1,500<00:01:52.569> but<00:01:52.959> then<00:01:53.109> again<00:01:53.229> this<00:01:53.529> is<00:01:53.649> a

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
about 1,500 but then again this is a

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.769 
about 1,500 but then again this is a
visual<00:01:54.159> approach<00:01:54.279> so<00:01:55.090> at<00:01:55.209> some<00:01:55.389> point<00:01:55.450> we're

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:55.779 
visual approach so at some point we're

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:57.120 
visual approach so at some point we're
going<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:55.929> start<00:01:55.990> our<00:01:56.259> descent<00:01:56.619> because<00:01:56.829> by

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
going to start our descent because by

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.739 
going to start our descent because by
the<00:01:57.189> time<00:01:57.399> we<00:01:57.520> roll<00:01:57.669> a<00:01:57.729> lot<00:01:57.939> on<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.359> final

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
the time we roll a lot on to the final

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:01.319 
the time we roll a lot on to the final
we<00:01:59.109> need<00:01:59.289> to<00:01:59.439> be<00:01:59.560> between<00:01:59.889> 900<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.609> 1000<00:02:01.179> feet

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
we need to be between 900 and 1000 feet

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.569 
we need to be between 900 and 1000 feet
if<00:02:01.749> you're<00:02:02.590> interested<00:02:03.069> in<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.249> rest<00:02:03.399> of<00:02:03.520> this

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
if you're interested in the rest of this

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.699 
if you're interested in the rest of this
approach<00:02:03.939> look<00:02:04.689> at<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.899> other<00:02:05.020> video<00:02:05.349> and<00:02:05.619> it

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
approach look at the other video and it

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:06.779 
approach look at the other video and it
will<00:02:05.859> actually<00:02:06.069> guide<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.520> through<00:02:06.700> the

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
will actually guide you through the

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.609 
will actually guide you through the
whole<00:02:06.819> approach<00:02:07.240> at<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:08.020> point<00:02:08.319> we're<00:02:08.590> just

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
whole approach at this point we're just

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.440 
whole approach at this point we're just
going<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:08.920> pick<00:02:09.250> up<00:02:09.489> about<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:10.000> mile<00:02:10.239> or<00:02:10.420> two

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
going to pick up about a mile or two

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.809 
going to pick up about a mile or two
from<00:02:10.780> point<00:02:11.050> D<00:02:11.140> 3<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:11.860> which<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.489> going<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.700> do

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.620 

hey<00:02:35.310> guys<00:02:35.550> were<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.940> airplane<00:02:36.150> right<00:02:36.270> now

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
hey guys were in the airplane right now

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.930 
hey guys were in the airplane right now
we<00:02:37.020> are<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> t-bot<00:02:37.860> localizer<00:02:38.370> we're

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
we are on a t-bot localizer we're

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.970 
we are on a t-bot localizer we're
getting<00:02:39.270> pretty<00:02:39.420> close<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.020> three<00:02:40.680> miles

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
getting pretty close to that three miles

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.950 
getting pretty close to that three miles
we<00:02:41.340> have<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.610> do<00:02:41.760> or<00:02:41.970> turn<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.600> heading<00:02:42.780> of

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
we have to do or turn to a heading of

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.250 
we have to do or turn to a heading of
297<00:02:43.830> so<00:02:44.460> let's<00:02:44.910> go<00:02:45.060> fully<00:02:45.390> visual<00:02:45.960> at<00:02:46.080> this

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
297 so let's go fully visual at this

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.080 
297 so let's go fully visual at this
point<00:02:46.590> because<00:02:46.950> we<00:02:47.100> do<00:02:47.250> have<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.550> whole<00:02:47.670> area

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
point because we do have the whole area

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.700 
point because we do have the whole area
in<00:02:48.240> sight<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.840> we're<00:02:49.020> going<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.200> use<00:02:49.350> our<00:02:49.530> eyes

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
in sight and we're going to use our eyes

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.560 
in sight and we're going to use our eyes
and<00:02:50.130> we're<00:02:50.280> going<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.460> use<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.730> headings<00:02:51.060> with

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
and we're going to use the headings with

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.840 
and we're going to use the headings with
a<00:02:51.600> circle<00:02:51.960> tool<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.260> procedure<00:02:55.520> okay<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:56.580> we

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
a circle tool and procedure okay so we

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.850 
a circle tool and procedure okay so we
are<00:02:56.880> at<00:02:57.030> 3<00:02:57.510> miles<00:02:57.750> let's<00:02:58.170> turn<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.620> heading

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
are at 3 miles let's turn to a heading

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.060 
are at 3 miles let's turn to a heading
of<00:02:59.010> 297<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.270> do<00:03:00.480> use<00:03:00.780> heading<00:03:01.140> bugs<00:03:01.410> because

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
of 297 I do use heading bugs because

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.320 
of 297 I do use heading bugs because
sometimes<00:03:02.430> when<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.700> gets<00:03:02.880> busy<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.270> the

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
sometimes when it gets busy in the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.240 
sometimes when it gets busy in the
cockpit<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.050> less<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.680> have<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:04.860> think<00:03:05.100> about

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
cockpit the less I have to think about

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.320 
cockpit the less I have to think about
the<00:03:05.580> better<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:07.820> now<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:08.850> just<00:03:08.940> want<00:03:09.240> you

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
the better it is now I just want you

in the flight simulator I've been flying

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.480 
in the flight simulator I've been flying
plenty<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.080> real<00:03:19.260> life<00:03:19.470> but<00:03:19.800> not<00:03:20.430> the

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
plenty in the real life but not the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.390 
plenty in the real life but not the
flight<00:03:20.850> sim<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.270> I've<00:03:21.390> chosen<00:03:21.740> 757<00:03:22.740> because<00:03:23.250> I

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
flight sim and I've chosen 757 because I

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.770 
flight sim and I've chosen 757 because I
love<00:03:23.580> this<00:03:23.760> plane<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.300> it's<00:03:24.420> also<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.720> little

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
love this plane and it's also a little

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.390 
love this plane and it's also a little
bit<00:03:24.960> harder<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.260> handle<00:03:25.710> on<00:03:25.800> Microsoft<00:03:26.280> Flight

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
bit harder to handle on Microsoft Flight

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.580 
bit harder to handle on Microsoft Flight
Simulator<00:03:26.670> than<00:03:27.090> some<00:03:27.240> other<00:03:27.390> planes<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.410> this

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
Simulator than some other planes so this

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:38.449 
Simulator than some other planes so this
should<00:03:28.740> be<00:03:28.770> interesting

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.259

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.150 

this<00:04:37.690> point<00:04:37.990> we<00:04:38.260> actually<00:04:38.350> passed<00:04:38.890> that

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
this point we actually passed that

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160 
this point we actually passed that
tallest<00:04:39.700> obstacle<00:04:40.300> on<00:04:40.390> our<00:04:40.510> approach<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.050> our

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
tallest obstacle on our approach and our

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.900 
tallest obstacle on our approach and our
super<00:04:41.380> line<00:04:41.650> approach<00:04:41.980> so<00:04:42.520> we<00:04:42.550> can<00:04:42.730> actually

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
super line approach so we can actually

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.670 
super line approach so we can actually
start<00:04:43.150> our<00:04:43.420> descent<00:04:43.720> below<00:04:44.020> that<00:04:44.230> fourteen

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
start our descent below that fourteen

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.370 
start our descent below that fourteen
hundred<00:04:44.980> and<00:04:45.100> thirty<00:04:45.400> feet<00:04:46.080> here<00:04:47.080> we<00:04:47.260> are

hundred and thirty feet here we are

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.170 
hundred and thirty feet here we are
three<00:04:47.680> miles<00:04:47.920> let's<00:04:48.340> turn<00:04:48.640> to<00:04:48.670> a<00:04:48.820> heading<00:04:49.030> of

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
three miles let's turn to a heading of

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.050 
three miles let's turn to a heading of
three<00:04:49.480> one<00:04:49.750> six<00:04:50.220> until<00:04:51.220> we<00:04:51.430> reach<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.850> four

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
three one six until we reach the four

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.500 
three one six until we reach the four
mile<00:04:52.270> mark<00:04:53.400> there's<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.670> handing<00:04:55.000> of<00:04:55.120> three

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
mile mark there's the handing of three

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.930 
mile mark there's the handing of three
one<00:04:55.720> six<00:04:56.170> they<00:04:56.860> were<00:04:56.920> pretty<00:04:57.130> close<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.700> it

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.340 

okay<00:05:00.940> now<00:05:01.090> this<00:05:01.240> four<00:05:01.540> mile<00:05:01.720> mark<00:05:01.990> is<00:05:02.140> going<00:05:02.260> to

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
okay now this four mile mark is going to

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.990 
okay now this four mile mark is going to
come<00:05:02.560> up<00:05:02.710> really<00:05:03.040> quick<00:05:03.280> so<00:05:03.460> we<00:05:03.610> have<00:05:03.760> to<00:05:03.880> be

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
come up really quick so we have to be

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.280 
come up really quick so we have to be
ready<00:05:05.160> here's<00:05:06.160> the<00:05:06.340> four<00:05:06.550> miles<00:05:07.110> let's<00:05:08.110> talk

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
ready here's the four miles let's talk

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.810 
ready here's the four miles let's talk
about<00:05:08.470> this<00:05:08.650> turn<00:05:09.070> a<00:05:09.280> little<00:05:09.400> bit<00:05:09.640> because

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
about this turn a little bit because

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.520 
about this turn a little bit because
this<00:05:10.030> is<00:05:10.210> going<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.390> be<00:05:10.480> a<00:05:10.510> hard<00:05:10.810> turn<00:05:11.080> we're

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
this is going to be a hard turn we're

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.230 
this is going to be a hard turn we're
going<00:05:11.680> to<00:05:11.740> try<00:05:11.920> to<00:05:11.980> be<00:05:12.190> at<00:05:12.280> about<00:05:12.400> 1,000<00:05:13.210> feet

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
going to try to be at about 1,000 feet

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.590 
going to try to be at about 1,000 feet
is<00:05:13.660> rolling<00:05:14.200> out<00:05:14.320> off<00:05:15.040> to<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.310> final<00:05:15.700> here<00:05:15.880> one

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
is rolling out off to the final here one

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.940 
is rolling out off to the final here one
thing<00:05:16.750> that<00:05:16.930> I<00:05:16.960> did<00:05:17.080> find<00:05:17.320> out<00:05:17.440> when<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.650> start

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
thing that I did find out when I start

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.650 
thing that I did find out when I start
teaching<00:05:18.100> could<00:05:18.370> that's<00:05:18.550> how<00:05:18.700> to<00:05:18.760> fly<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.540> Air

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
teaching could that's how to fly the Air

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.600 
teaching could that's how to fly the Air
Force<00:05:19.960> ROTC<00:05:20.200> cadets<00:05:20.950> and<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.220> Civil<00:05:21.520> Air

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
Force ROTC cadets and the Civil Air

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.580 
Force ROTC cadets and the Civil Air
Patrol<00:05:21.640> cadet<00:05:22.060> or<00:05:22.420> their<00:05:22.960> initial<00:05:23.350> flights

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
Patrol cadet or their initial flights

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.350 
Patrol cadet or their initial flights
was<00:05:24.340> that<00:05:24.490> they<00:05:24.700> didn't<00:05:25.000> they<00:05:25.120> don't<00:05:25.270> have

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
was that they didn't they don't have

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.730 
was that they didn't they don't have
problems<00:05:25.600> with<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.870> individual<00:05:26.320> maneuvers

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
problems with the individual maneuvers

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.500 
problems with the individual maneuvers
they<00:05:26.890> can<00:05:27.040> get<00:05:27.160> those<00:05:27.340> pretty<00:05:27.580> quick<00:05:27.940> one<00:05:28.420> of

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
they can get those pretty quick one of

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.060 
they can get those pretty quick one of
the<00:05:28.600> biggest<00:05:28.900> problems<00:05:29.350> they<00:05:29.500> initially<00:05:29.710> had

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
the biggest problems they initially had

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.280 
the biggest problems they initially had
was<00:05:30.340> rolling<00:05:30.670> out<00:05:30.850> at<00:05:31.060> specific<00:05:31.510> altitudes<00:05:32.050> at

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
was rolling out at specific altitudes at

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.440 
was rolling out at specific altitudes at
specific<00:05:32.800> enemies<00:05:33.130> so<00:05:33.760> it's<00:05:33.910> very<00:05:34.030> important

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
specific enemies so it's very important

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.360 
specific enemies so it's very important
that<00:05:34.480> we<00:05:34.600> practice<00:05:35.050> these<00:05:35.260> rolling<00:05:36.040> out

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
that we practice these rolling out

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.490 
that we practice these rolling out
during<00:05:37.300> these<00:05:37.450> descending<00:05:37.990> or<00:05:38.110> climbing

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
during these descending or climbing

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.380 
during these descending or climbing
turns<00:05:38.740> that<00:05:39.160> we<00:05:39.250> roll<00:05:39.460> out<00:05:39.640> at<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:39.940> altitude

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
turns that we roll out at the altitude

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.360 
turns that we roll out at the altitude
we<00:05:40.600> want<00:05:40.810> to<00:05:40.990> we're<00:05:41.590> actually<00:05:41.800> doing<00:05:42.220> two

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
we want to we're actually doing two

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.190 
we want to we're actually doing two
things<00:05:42.400> at<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:42.910> same<00:05:43.120> time<00:05:43.180> but<00:05:43.990> with

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
things at the same time but with

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:51.600 
things at the same time but with
practice<00:05:44.740> we<00:05:44.980> all<00:05:45.130> get<00:05:45.340> better

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.089 

all<00:05:52.180> right<00:05:52.449> there's<00:05:52.719> the<00:05:52.930> runaway<00:05:53.349> we<00:05:53.860> are

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
all right there's the runaway we are

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.429 
all right there's the runaway we are
right<00:05:54.400> at<00:05:54.550> than<00:05:54.699> 1000<00:05:55.389> feet<00:05:55.599> so<00:05:55.990> we're<00:05:56.139> looking

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:56.439 
right at than 1000 feet so we're looking

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.709 
right at than 1000 feet so we're looking
good<00:05:56.590> there<00:05:56.860> we<00:05:57.520> underside<00:05:58.030> at<00:05:58.180> just<00:05:58.419> a<00:05:58.509> little

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
good there we underside at just a little

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.240 
good there we underside at just a little
bit<00:05:58.810> but<00:05:58.990> that's<00:05:59.110> it<00:05:59.379> that's<00:05:59.530> okay<00:05:59.949> that's

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
bit but that's it that's okay that's

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.550 
bit but that's it that's okay that's
good<00:06:00.490> we<00:06:00.939> are<00:06:01.300> just<00:06:01.419> going<00:06:01.689> to<00:06:01.750> roll<00:06:01.900> up<00:06:02.139> lined

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
good we are just going to roll up lined

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.950 
good we are just going to roll up lined
up<00:06:02.710> with<00:06:02.860> it<00:06:02.889> really<00:06:03.250> quick<00:06:03.490> and<00:06:03.759> land<00:06:04.030> the

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
up with it really quick and land the

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.689 
up with it really quick and land the
pappi<00:06:05.379> looks<00:06:05.590> like<00:06:05.740> we're<00:06:05.919> high<00:06:06.099> but<00:06:06.400> believe

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
pappi looks like we're high but believe

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.550 
pappi looks like we're high but believe
me<00:06:06.729> we're<00:06:07.030> too<00:06:07.210> close<00:06:07.360> for<00:06:07.719> it<00:06:07.840> we<00:06:08.139> will<00:06:08.289> get<00:06:08.469> in

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
me we're too close for it we will get in

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.420 
me we're too close for it we will get in
the<00:06:08.650> glide<00:06:08.889> slope<00:06:09.189> within<00:06:09.490> seconds<00:06:11.430> let's

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
the glide slope within seconds let's

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.990 
the glide slope within seconds let's
make<00:06:12.669> that<00:06:12.849> roll<00:06:13.120> onto<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.469> 500

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.930 

there<00:06:19.600> we<00:06:19.840> are<00:06:19.870> we're<00:06:20.230> on<00:06:20.380> the<00:06:20.470> glide<00:06:20.680> slope

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
there we are we're on the glide slope

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.070 
there we are we're on the glide slope
let's<00:06:21.940> add<00:06:22.090> a<00:06:22.120> little<00:06:22.300> bit<00:06:22.420> of<00:06:22.480> power<00:06:22.690> we<00:06:22.870> want

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
let's add a little bit of power we want

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.850 
let's add a little bit of power we want
to<00:06:23.170> be<00:06:23.260> at<00:06:23.380> 138<00:06:24.310> knots<00:06:24.580> as<00:06:24.790> we<00:06:24.910> touch<00:06:25.120> down<00:06:28.860> 200

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
to be at 138 knots as we touch down 200

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.500 
to be at 138 knots as we touch down 200
at<00:06:30.250> this<00:06:30.430> point<00:06:30.700> we<00:06:30.850> are<00:06:30.940> aiming<00:06:31.180> for<00:06:31.360> a

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
at this point we are aiming for a

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.940 
at this point we are aiming for a
certain<00:06:31.900> point<00:06:32.080> in<00:06:32.230> the<00:06:32.320> runway<00:06:32.620> we<00:06:32.710> want<00:06:32.890> to

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
certain point in the runway we want to

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.980 
certain point in the runway we want to
land<00:06:33.160> forget<00:06:33.910> about<00:06:34.000> the<00:06:34.180> Pappy<00:06:34.390> lights<00:06:34.690> we're

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
land forget about the Pappy lights we're

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.710 
land forget about the Pappy lights we're
too<00:06:35.170> close<00:06:35.320> for<00:06:35.590> that<00:06:36.090> we<00:06:37.090> have<00:06:37.240> our<00:06:37.420> spot

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
too close for that we have our spot

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.550 
too close for that we have our spot
let's<00:06:38.050> get<00:06:38.290> on<00:06:38.410> the<00:06:38.500> centerline<00:06:39.180> 100

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:50.629 

50<00:06:43.330> 40<00:06:44.330> 30

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.960 

there's<00:06:51.240> some<00:06:51.389> crosswinds

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:53.970 
there's some crosswinds

00:06:53.970 --> 00:07:01.320 

touchdown<00:06:55.200> reverse<00:06:56.200> thrusters

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.439 

and<00:07:01.419> that's<00:07:02.020> what<00:07:02.199> happens<00:07:02.530> in<00:07:02.680> cross<00:07:02.889> ones

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:03.449 
and that's what happens in cross ones

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:05.850 
and that's what happens in cross ones
but<00:07:04.449> on<00:07:04.599> all<00:07:04.840> pretty<00:07:05.110> good<00:07:05.259> landing

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
but on all pretty good landing

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.499 
but on all pretty good landing
let's<00:07:06.159> take<00:07:06.340> a<00:07:06.370> look<00:07:06.610> at<00:07:06.669> the<00:07:06.729> flight<00:07:06.940> path<00:07:07.210> and

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:07.509 
let's take a look at the flight path and

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:09.749 
let's take a look at the flight path and
then<00:07:07.960> the<00:07:07.990> outside<00:07:08.199> view<00:07:08.650> and<00:07:09.250> again<00:07:09.370> thanks

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 
then the outside view and again thanks

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.070 
then the outside view and again thanks
