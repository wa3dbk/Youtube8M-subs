00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.150
 good lucia what to do in these 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.519
 social vacations in summer what is 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.600
 more or less and you are still working 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.600
 they go out to tour the country 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:25.100
 the first one we came anchorena and we're going 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.990
 stay about 10-12 days so everything in there 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.769
 always some appointment meeting because they are going to 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.410
 come for example some Koreans 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.210
 delegation of parliamentarians and ran from 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.590
 important emotion for Uruguay as 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:45.360
 it seems that we are on vacation 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:49.080
 and then we will receive them and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.860
 then the good thing is that in the 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.030
 Summer is not over as the rhythm 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.720
 then this later we will continue 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:03.090
 living on weekends this field 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:06.510
 of nice game longer but but there 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.900
 things to do and I do not mention this 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.050
 ballet in this commitment 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.090
 so it says more or less our to 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.220
 get away from the political context and 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.890
 more likes to make a little beach or 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.950
 how is the theme yesterday and two dishes in 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.110
 anchorena one in washing the san juan and 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.110
 another for the river of silver 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.110
 but what we do not like are the 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:37.090
 borbollones because 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.730
 now we are incognito a bit 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.650
 of some noodles and we're out 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:47.320
 because we came with the dog because of that 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.979
 then I did not have a beach that 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.340
 we are by many stages you said have 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.040
 past does not rest the part that we 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.390
 like in the rural area and there 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.390
 snag precious 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.750
 president finally a message 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.490
 we could say that for the beginning of 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.310
 year for all the people here of carmelo 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.380
 of the area in the previous case was in the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.100
 food so thank you very much and you 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.150
 we ask for a message 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.989
 I think that 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.060
 unequivocally this region is called 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.489
 prosperity and the problems that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.519
 brings prosperity because he does not want 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.480
 the forward modernity has a 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.480
 Magic wand 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.670
 also treason because and is and his 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.310
 filth the whole package of progress 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.410
 comes with everything this charge does 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.010
 multiply wealth the welfare of 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.850
 many people but they appear I think the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.060
 Argentina's investment in this region is 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.080
 portentous and is injecting 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.930
 permanently a share of value that 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.950
 I do not know if the Carmelites our 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.670
 subconscious here the farm is paid a 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.860
 value that neither to plant cocaine and that 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.020
 is the presence of good 6 says of 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.120
 keep and that comes from this side I 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.930
 it seems that it is the historical phenomenon what 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.930
 will have to administer 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.750
 inevitable the expansion of says of that 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.350
 macro city 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.680
 will tend to transform this every time 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.950
 more in an internan of that big city 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.860
 I'm not going to live 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:37.170
 that they are younger, try 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.170
 try to float the good of it 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.180
 and preserves the good of traditions 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.799
 that do not militate 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.430
 I returned what you are in the changes 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.430
 cultural
