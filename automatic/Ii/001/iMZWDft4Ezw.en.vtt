in<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.350> video<00:00:19.710> I'm<00:00:19.980> going<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.220> explain<00:00:20.369> and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
in this video I'm going to explain and

in this video I'm going to explain and
demonstrate<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.480> constituent<00:00:22.080> parts<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.769> a

sharp<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.580> from<00:03:18.180> an<00:03:18.299> improvisation

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
sharp so from an improvisation

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.050 
sharp so from an improvisation
standpoint<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:19.920> couldn't<00:03:20.250> really<00:03:20.430> blanket

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
standpoint you couldn't really blanket

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.360

with<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.299> G<00:03:21.510> harmonic<00:03:21.660> minor<00:03:21.959> scale<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:23.190> have

with the G harmonic minor scale you have

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.569 
with the G harmonic minor scale you have
to<00:03:23.610> play<00:03:24.209> this<00:03:24.390> specific<00:03:25.049> scale<00:03:25.579> however

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
to play this specific scale however

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.190 
to play this specific scale however
there<00:03:27.060> are<00:03:27.209> some<00:03:27.329> other<00:03:27.450> references<00:03:28.049> you

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
there are some other references you

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.920 
there are some other references you
could<00:03:28.349> make<00:03:28.560> while<00:03:28.920> improvising<00:03:29.780> over<00:03:30.780> those

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
could make while improvising over those

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.220 
could make while improvising over those
chords<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.910> is<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.209> whole<00:03:33.690> tone<00:03:33.930> sound

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
chords and that is the whole tone sound

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.559 
chords and that is the whole tone sound
because<00:03:34.950> there<00:03:35.160> is<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.340> Augmented<00:03:36.329> chord

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
because there is a Augmented chord

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.259 
because there is a Augmented chord
within<00:03:36.870> their<00:03:37.170> scale<00:03:37.530> starting<00:03:38.489> from<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:39.239> a

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
within their scale starting from the a

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:47.390 
within their scale starting from the a
sharp<00:03:40.340> major<00:03:41.340> doing<00:03:41.700> iron<00:03:45.920> this<00:03:46.920> gives<00:03:47.190> us<00:03:47.280> a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
sharp major doing iron this gives us a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.490 
sharp major doing iron this gives us a
more<00:03:47.549> latitude<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.150> create<00:03:48.750> other<00:03:48.900> sonorities

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
more latitude to create other sonorities

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.330 
more latitude to create other sonorities
within<00:03:49.889> that<00:03:50.209> within<00:03:51.209> those<00:03:51.540> six<00:03:51.810> notes<00:03:52.340> the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
within that within those six notes the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.990 
within that within those six notes the
time<00:03:53.850> signature<00:03:54.120> for<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.630> solo<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:55.730> 4/4<00:03:56.730> there

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
time signature for the solo is 4/4 there

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.120 
time signature for the solo is 4/4 there
are<00:03:57.120> two<00:03:57.299> bars<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.690> four<00:03:57.870> for<00:03:58.139> one<00:03:58.470> bar<00:03:58.680> seven

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
are two bars of four for one bar seven

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.750 
are two bars of four for one bar seven
sixteen<00:03:59.519> so<00:03:59.850> it's<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.299> one<00:04:01.109> two<00:04:01.220> three<00:04:02.220> four

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
sixteen so it's like one two three four

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.930 
sixteen so it's like one two three four
one<00:04:03.269> two<00:04:03.630> three<00:04:04.170> four<00:04:04.739> one<00:04:05.400> two<00:04:05.459> people<00:04:05.819> must

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
one two three four one two people must

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.500 
one two three four one two people must
be<00:04:06.150> one<00:04:06.389> two<00:04:06.900> three<00:04:07.470> four<00:04:08.060> it's<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.120> little<00:04:09.389> bit

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
be one two three four it's a little bit

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.390 
be one two three four it's a little bit
tricky<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:09.959> solve<00:04:10.590> all<00:04:10.769> of<00:04:10.799> that<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:11.340> you

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
tricky to solve all of that so you

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.650 
tricky to solve all of that so you
really<00:04:11.489> have<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:11.819> be<00:04:11.970> thinking<00:04:12.239> about<00:04:12.450> the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
really have to be thinking about the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.000 
really have to be thinking about the
meter<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:13.109> your<00:04:13.200> head<00:04:13.380> when<00:04:13.590> you're<00:04:13.739> solving

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
meter in your head when you're solving

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.409 
meter in your head when you're solving
over<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:15.470> but<00:04:16.470> in<00:04:16.620> creates<00:04:16.889> an<00:04:17.010> interesting

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
over it but in creates an interesting

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.650 
over it but in creates an interesting
rhythmic<00:04:18.419> friction<00:04:19.200> let's<00:04:19.440> say
