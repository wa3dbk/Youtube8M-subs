00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.369 

oh<00:00:01.879> yeah<00:00:04.640> singer<00:00:05.640> pitch<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.779> ends<00:00:07.109> up<00:00:07.200> down

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
oh yeah singer pitch the ends up down

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.379 
oh yeah singer pitch the ends up down
into<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.680> dirt<00:00:07.890> because<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:09.030> looks<00:00:09.240> like<00:00:09.300> a

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
into the dirt because it looks like a

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.039 
into the dirt because it looks like a
fastball<00:00:10.099> that<00:00:11.120> drops<00:00:12.120> off<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.570> table<00:00:12.900> right

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
fastball that drops off the table right

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.410 
fastball that drops off the table right
at<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.230> end<00:00:13.429> in<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.700> way<00:00:16.400> it's<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.910> opposite<00:00:18.330> of

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
at the end in a way it's the opposite of

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.750 
at the end in a way it's the opposite of
a<00:00:18.510> riser<00:00:18.859> it's<00:00:19.859> different<00:00:20.189> from<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.460> curveball

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
a riser it's different from a curveball

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.390 
a riser it's different from a curveball
so<00:00:21.240> instead<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.840> curveball<00:00:22.140> it's<00:00:23.130> going<00:00:23.279> to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
so instead of a curveball it's going to

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.390 
so instead of a curveball it's going to
break<00:00:23.550> down<00:00:24.619> sinkers<00:00:25.619> are<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.920> come<00:00:26.189> in

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
break down sinkers are going to come in

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.330 
break down sinkers are going to come in
and<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:26.820> drop<00:00:27.349> so<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:28.949> going<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.099> come

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
and just drop so it's just going to come

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.339 
and just drop so it's just going to come
in<00:00:29.519> straight<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.119> drop<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:31.170> is

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
in straight in and drop and this is

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.490 
in straight in and drop and this is
because<00:00:32.809> opposite<00:00:33.809> arises<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.320> you're<00:00:34.410> going

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
because opposite arises or you're going

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.620 
because opposite arises or you're going
to<00:00:34.559> have<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> holes<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.190> top<00:00:35.399> solid<00:00:36.329> Pro<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
to have the holes on top solid Pro and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.619 
to have the holes on top solid Pro and
bottom<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.649> spin<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.420> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.570> be

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
bottom and the spin is going to be

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.799 
bottom and the spin is going to be
coming<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> create

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
coming like this so it's going to create

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.479 
coming like this so it's going to create
higher<00:00:42.809> pressure<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.290> top<00:00:43.500> low<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> bottom

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
higher pressure on top low on the bottom

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.290 
higher pressure on top low on the bottom
which<00:00:45.059> with<00:00:45.600> enough<00:00:46.020> rotation<00:00:47.000> let<00:00:48.000> you

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
which with enough rotation let you

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
which with enough rotation let you
literally<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.020> air<00:00:49.260> comes<00:00:49.770> out<00:00:49.920> from<00:00:50.100> under

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
literally the air comes out from under

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.939 
literally the air comes out from under
it<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:51.180> drops<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.110> instead<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.440> breaking

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
it and just drops so instead of breaking

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.760 
it and just drops so instead of breaking
it<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.160> drop<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.760> let's<00:00:53.969> break<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.180> down<00:00:54.770> on

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
it just drop so let's break it down on

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.790 
it just drop so let's break it down on
the<00:00:55.949> grip<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:58.079> take<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.670> do<00:00:59.670> exactly

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
the grip so just take it do exactly

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.640 
the grip so just take it do exactly
imagine<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> seam<00:01:02.160> around<00:01:02.809> two<00:01:03.809> fingers<00:01:04.229> same

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
imagine the seam around two fingers same

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.490 
imagine the seam around two fingers same
basic<00:01:05.070> grip<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.430> every<00:01:05.640> other<00:01:05.790> pitch<00:01:06.380> line<00:01:07.380> it

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
basic grip is every other pitch line it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.899 
basic grip is every other pitch line it
up<00:01:07.590> don't<00:01:08.159> let<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> knuckle-touch

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
up don't let the knuckle-touch

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.200 
up don't let the knuckle-touch
but<00:01:09.810> you're<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.890> holes

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
but you're going to have the holes

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.270 
but you're going to have the holes
facing<00:01:12.210> towards<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> sky<00:01:12.950> facing<00:01:13.950> straight

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
facing towards the sky facing straight

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.690 
facing towards the sky facing straight
up<00:01:14.490> all<00:01:15.360> right<00:01:15.570> now<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.710> key<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.250> sinker

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
up all right now the key with a sinker

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.010 
up all right now the key with a sinker
is<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.060> delivery<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.570> going<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> little

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
is the delivery is going to be a little

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.080 
is the delivery is going to be a little
funky<00:01:19.820> it's<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.330> almost<00:01:22.369> 3/4<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
funky it's going to be almost 3/4 to the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.810 
funky it's going to be almost 3/4 to the
side<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.689> when<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.020> end<00:01:25.259> up<00:01:25.500> imagine<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.640> want

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
side so when you end up imagine you want

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.140 
side so when you end up imagine you want
to<00:01:26.909> create<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.570> spinning<00:01:28.229> top<00:01:28.610> like<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
to create a spinning top like this so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.620 
to create a spinning top like this so
you<00:01:30.900> want<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.439> ball<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.979> moving<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you want the ball to be moving like this

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.050 
you want the ball to be moving like this
alright<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:34.979> throw<00:01:35.220> overhand<00:01:35.579> you'll

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
alright so if you throw overhand you'll

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.420 
alright so if you throw overhand you'll
just<00:01:36.299> end<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.570> throwing<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.049> weird<00:01:37.350> half<00:01:38.040> slider

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
just end up throwing a weird half slider

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.740 
just end up throwing a weird half slider
than<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:38.939> works<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
than that really works you're going to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.399 
than that really works you're going to
take<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.049> freeness<00:01:40.890> singer<00:01:41.960> do<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> side

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
take the freeness singer do to the side

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.440 
take the freeness singer do to the side
so<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.280> ball<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.000> holes<00:01:48.240> are

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
so that the ball out so the holes are

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.260 
so that the ball out so the holes are
still<00:01:48.659> facing<00:01:48.930> higher<00:01:49.829> time<00:01:50.130> that's<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.060> goal

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
still facing higher time that's the goal

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.700 
still facing higher time that's the goal
when<00:01:51.509> you're<00:01:51.630> practicing<00:01:55.310> hmm<00:01:57.560> that's<00:01:58.560> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
when you're practicing hmm that's a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.780 
when you're practicing hmm that's a
sinker

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
sinker

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.520 
sinker
that<00:02:00.390> was<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> little<00:02:00.750> higher<00:02:00.960> than<00:02:01.230> I<00:02:01.260> wanted

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that was a little higher than I wanted

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.000 
that was a little higher than I wanted
it<00:02:01.650> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.730> see<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:02.970> goes<00:02:03.150> in<00:02:03.180> dives<00:02:04.050> down<00:02:04.410> dug

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
it you can see it goes in dives down dug

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.560 
it you can see it goes in dives down dug
to<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.400> bottom<00:02:05.730> that<00:02:05.820> covers<00:02:06.150> especially

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
to the bottom that covers especially

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.169 
to the bottom that covers especially
pitches<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.320> there's<00:02:07.470> more<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:08.790> wiffle<00:02:09.060> ball

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
pitches but there's more to wiffle ball

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.330 
pitches but there's more to wiffle ball
than<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.479> pitching<00:02:09.740> there's<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.920> flip<00:02:11.100> side

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
than just pitching there's the flip side

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.850 
than just pitching there's the flip side
the<00:02:11.760> hitting<00:02:12.120> hitting<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.140> we've<00:02:13.530> shown<00:02:13.830> you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the hitting hitting and we've shown you
