00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello everyone, who was the maxim? 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.960
 video let's see how heavy games go on 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.649
 samsung galaxy core 2 first game this 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.649
 real racing 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.540
 appreciate the graphics and gameplay overall 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.910
 runs almost run your real 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.910
 racing 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.240
 started the game skip this cartoon 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.609
 and now look at the graphics 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.960
 I will say right away that she is somewhere on average 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.430
 level drawing is not very detailed 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.450
 see that there is a display in the mirrors 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.240
 if you look from the cabin and a little bit 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 on so twitches a little bit not 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.990
 goes smoothly in principle as a whole to play 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:42.090
 forever comfortable there is no problem but 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.009
 if so here to find fault here 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.930
 a little bit but still podlagivaet 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.179
 when compared with the same iphone 4s then 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.179
 there the game is a little bit smoother 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.750
 This if to speak precisely about this game but 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.390
 everything else is present 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.649
 graphic effects like here for example 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.429
 sand from under the wheels if you go on 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:12.180
 off-road and in general, well, then everything works 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.890
 great play comfortable close this 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.130
 the game go to the next game number 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.190
 two asphalt 8 airborne 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.579
 also look at the graphics and gameplay in 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.579
 whole 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.800
 the game loaded 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.959
 removed location and start the race 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.799
 we unloaded the game 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.950
 twitches a little I don't know whether 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.160
 you can see it on the camera on the schedule so she 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.590
 somewhere at the middle level and here at 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.550
 the smoothness of the game here are the moments it goes 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.550
 very smoothly moments a little bit 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.550
 podlagivaet 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.980
 now everything seems to play well of course 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.840
 comfortable it does not create any problems 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.330
 on drawing graphics right now 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:04:00.050
 try again began to face 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:02.170
 something does not work or with another 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.170
 by car 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.140
 here and see what's not here when 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.600
 encounter on the same if play 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.610
 iPhone when faced with others 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.970
 machines that 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.730
 a bunch of splinters scatters around 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.520
 there is no such thing here a little bit though 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:32.120
 here so more or less but still 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:35.800
 inferior to the same iphone on the schedule 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.450
 the same game works of course fine 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.990
 twitches in places but generally play 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.320
 comfortable move on to the next game 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.470
 game number three d trigger 2 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.470
 run the game 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.420
 we wait while it is loaded also we will estimate 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:08.030
 gameplay 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:11.030
 the graphics here the game plunged and we start 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.030
 play 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.690
 plunged game 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.980
 twitches a little 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.190
 saver will now see how it will be in 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.190
 the game 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:19.840
 In the game everything is quite smoothly such 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.840
 I do not notice any serious lags 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.390
 play absolutely comfortable now we 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:31.570
 do this task a little bit 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:34.280
 that she has covered herself but in general, everything 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:39.860
 remarkably better than in real drawings 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:42.110
 and asphalt 8 maybe she's just a game not 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.190
 such demanding graphics as real 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.190
 racing and asphalt 8 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:04.900
 so here so here so go some 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.430
 heavy games on samsung galaxy core 2 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.259
