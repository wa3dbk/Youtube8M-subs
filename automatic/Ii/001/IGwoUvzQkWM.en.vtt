those guys click grip in that little rim
right<00:03:52.980> there<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:54.870> that'll<00:03:55.170> just<00:03:55.319> slide<00:03:55.620> right

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
right there so that'll just slide right

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.809 
right there so that'll just slide right
back<00:03:55.829> in<00:03:56.160> there<00:03:56.340> pump<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:58.370> we<00:03:59.370> place<00:03:59.609> this

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
back in there pump so we place this

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.080 
back in there pump so we place this
particular<00:04:00.359> light<00:04:00.569> it<00:04:00.750> says<00:04:00.959> right<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:02.090> you

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
little bit of residue on there and then

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.190 
little bit of residue on there and then
when<00:04:19.940> that<00:04:20.090> heats<00:04:20.390> up<00:04:20.600> to<00:04:20.780> however<00:04:21.020> many
