00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.830
 I'm sitting here in my room and there 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.970
 hang hair and there are the legs 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 my sister with hair 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.849
 because I have our experiment before and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.310
 you will be there live as I am 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.960
 already bad a few of you 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.880
 knows selection of schiri had that yes 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.880
 also in it is just so plastic 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.960
 I just got from Amazon and one like that 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.840
 a thing somehow costs five euros or 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.000
 so that's now the color 1b that is 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.140
 nature black so so brown black 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.980
 almost exactly there I had to in between 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.360
 brush chronologie luketic the surfaces 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.280
 which also completely through and 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.960
 look at the end how long I have the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.520
 wants to have and we just got the movie 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.579
 have made and without booty 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.030
 Now we are not looking red anymore 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.129
 golden dress cup and capa because me 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.920
 somehow too demanding why 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.840
 besides wide look at hair braiding 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.360
 This is the case here 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.110
 I've now been just a bit on 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.970
 occiput 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.840
 see current status now 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.490
 Atlantis and there are now 13 braids and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.990
 It really takes incredibly long and we 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.100
 have now become a little smaller 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.950
 here and I did not succeed 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.259
 It will take but it is really blatant 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.240
 an active intermediate copy number 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.170
 ariel and 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.509
 far and all this long I know 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.710
 yet I now have everything together 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.390
 used to when the club piece 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.579
 cut them off so they can now 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.140
 It is really unbelievable 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:50.200
 how long that took me so people 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.280
 I actually did it 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.270
 finished now I'm honest 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.270
 beat 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:02.780
 Here I am again and I have 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:04.939
 just somehow forget one more 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.989
 So, what do you have to say? 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:12.110
 I sealed those down here with 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.239
 a straightener it is just him 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.620
 separates the so open to expire 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.459
 and then just with hot water 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.099
 to seal 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.220
 but in that I partly so much 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.629
 thick pottery have either for really stupid 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.109
 So I have those with a quiet 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:34.269
 I have no idea so um sealed 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:34.269
 I believe the 60 braids and we have 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:46.150
 566 believe 55 of this pack here 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.500
 I need to show this here 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.730
 This packing has that color 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.320
 remaining purchase because I had considered 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.950
 perhaps even colored surfaces 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.540
 but I have not done yet 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.550
 yes it took a very long time because 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.400
 want to do it yourself, I would you 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.320
 really recommend you to get help 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.430
 especially now for the hair one behind 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.620
 it certainly gets somehow 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.760
 alone 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.080
 but I was very thankful that mine 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.770
 sister helped me the hair 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.930
 to do in the back because that's not the case 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.180
 easy it so you have to be so 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.180
 strand of hair take from the fake hair 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.120
 a narrow strand of hair in front of their own 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.120
 hair the fake hair once drum 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.790
 wrap and then with your own hair 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.850
 So now braid mine 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:37.670
 own hair still intertwined in it and 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:40.430
 that is really stressful alone and 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.130
 as conclusive as it is now 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.670
 Looks like I think about it 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.870
 i'm cool so it will be - totally different me 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.110
 think it's really cool 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.060
 it looks good on what it looks like but it is 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.720
 too damn hard 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.060
 These hairs are so heavy too 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.980
 getting used to it because I do not know 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.720
 it's just that that leaves the face 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.450
 also look very different, I'm just 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.890
 My hair gets used to it like my face 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.540
 frame and that's something else 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.760
 they are heavy, they feel different 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.130
 on 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.570
 they look a bit different, too, I know 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.190
 not sure if they are mine 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.950
 I like it so I think for example 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.700
 such girls as shirin are really that 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.860
 type for it 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.300
 I'm not sure yet 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.570
 she's fine with me personally now 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.070
 I do not know if or 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.080
 as long as I let them in there 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.729
 but the experiment has me on everyone 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.800
 case really well just like only 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.110
 let's see what it will look like 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.510
 could it look like me 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.580
 and most of all, what's the fuck? 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.170
 , the only people that makes even a 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.840
 I'll never and never again 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.180
 brakes again 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.610
 no joke so I have so many things 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.260
 I made my own dirt 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.250
 and I made brakes myself and 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.080
 I cut my hair myself 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.270
 and whether that's polio or short 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.000
 Hairstyle I have already taken time 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.590
 But I really do not want that 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.320
 Do that again has me more 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.720
 Being stressed would also be self-power 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.010
 they are not very regular either 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.540
 If you think so from a pro 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.840
 then they are very much 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:21.330
 regularly staked and small 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.800
 yes , I have a neat hold here 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.640
 I also have a few short ones from time to time 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.940
 between 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.470
 Therefore, do not know what's upside down 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.370
 is just something I am now 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.750
 so spontaneous have made and yes think so 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.700
 I'm actually cool about it 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.620
 that's just somehow I do not know 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.660
 always so smart ideas and then I do 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.380
 spontaneously and then it always will be 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.920
 so wild and crazy but that belongs 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.570
 somehow to me if you still 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.860
 have any questions and I have the 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.690
 then maybe you can answer 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.400
 she likes to put me in the 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.210
 comments to 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.410
 I'm so tired people and shit though 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:03.210
 I think I can not bring that 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.770
 to go to sleep now because then 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.360
 I can not sleep tonight 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.310
 Well, I hope you liked that 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.960
 I'll take you to this experiment 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.730
 have taken and yes let's see what 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.420
 next is me myself 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.620
 curious; excited 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.620
 Take care people
