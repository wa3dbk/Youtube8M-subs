a<00:00:42.360> lot<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.629> times<00:00:43.129> with<00:00:44.129> weight<00:00:44.370> loss<00:00:44.399> its

a lot of times with weight loss its

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.319 
a lot of times with weight loss its
determination<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:46.140> rough<00:00:46.469> it's

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
determination that's rough it's

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.979 
determination that's rough it's
motivation<00:00:48.329> that's<00:00:48.870> rough<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.670> I<00:00:50.989> think

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
motivation that's rough and I think

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.959 
motivation that's rough and I think
maybe<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.469> would<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.550> know<00:00:53.670> give
