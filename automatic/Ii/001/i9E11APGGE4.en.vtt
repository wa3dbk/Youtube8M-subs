00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.119
 a few days ago it came out on the territory 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.220
 Japanese hunter show 4 is already 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.650
 become one of the best-selling titles 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.570
 of the year just inside the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.680
 territory 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.119
 despite this the fact that precisely 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.859
 has already reached the stores has 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.610
 prevented from arriving on the showfloor of 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.170
 tokyo game show 2013 where it is not present 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.519
 replaced we can say so true woman 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.870
 mobile sign but we don't talk about it 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.059
 because probably even almost 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.989
 certainly will never reach the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.150
 European market 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.770
 despite this important absence 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.980
 the one demonstrating 4 we are anyway 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.149
 managed to get the game under control 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.399
 through precisely the version invents 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.450
 in stores and we can tell you which ones 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.219
 are the aspects that we have most 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.309
 hit and the most interesting ones too 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.809
 in view of a secure European exit of 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.239
 which, however, is not yet available 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.030
 a date the title fits into the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.170
 furrow of the series must always be done 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.479
 grow your character 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.250
 acquiring new items new weapons 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.619
 new armor for these go 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.039
 complete the forces defeated monsters e 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.610
 visit explored areas ever more full 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.039
 of enemies 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.959
 in short, the shape is the classic one 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.580
 despite this case with for the fourth 

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:23.099
 chapter the first specially designed 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.300
 for 3ds he still thought of 

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:27.300
 develop a whole series of new ones 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.590
 both technical and gameplay additions from 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.149
 technical point of view 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.789
 these improvements are enough 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.330
 the game is evident compared to others 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.399
 ultimate always on 3ds is more fluid a 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.080
 even brighter colors 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.640
 the models of the characters of the environments 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.440
 monsters are a little bit more defined 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.259
 in general it seemed to be there too 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.940
 much a lot more variety in 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.789
 gameplay terms instead the news 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.220
 main are those related to 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.140
 map that is not totally free of 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.000
 loads as it was initially 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.069
 thought there are still loads 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.319
 however the areas are bigger and 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.360
 above all, in short, a sense of 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.509
 exploration has been quite a lot 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.950
 improved and now just turns into 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.360
 look for objects from 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.940
 collect for the quests of enemies from 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.709
 defeat with greater interest and less 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.270
 possible than before going straight 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.370
 to the point 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.750
 in addition to this there are 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.930
 the series of improvements in the movements of the 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.250
 character for example this can 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.530
 climb walls freely and 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.049
 also fight while climbing 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.760
 in addition the combat system 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.379
 to a whole series of new movements ad 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.140
 example possible to jump into the head i 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.670
 enemies hit in mid-air and then 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.590
 obviously use the two weapons 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.900
 unreleased 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.829
 in short, many small improvements 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.049
 they seem to create a complex 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.610
 absolutely deserving the former 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.379
 feedback from japan is absolutely 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.629
 positive both in terms of copies sold 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.920
 precisely we said at the beginning and also in 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.019
 terms of printing that it seems to have 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.359
 welcomed positively for the 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.250
 moment the biggest downside that there is 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.629
 we want to emphasize is precisely 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.670
 the absence of an Italian date does not 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.900
 we know when it will be released 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.150
 outside the Japanese territory 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.220
 however we are certain that this will happen 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.870
 all that remains is to hope that capcom e 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.790
 nintendo agree, however, for a 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.549
 quick release 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.079
 certainly to be included among the titles of 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.549
 those to wait are more interesting 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.540
 absolutely for all owners of 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.540
 nintendo 3ds 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.870
 sweet chocolate ice cream a little salty 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.270
 to chocolate ice cream 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.770
 if you don't watch that chaos will be cocks 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.770
 word of grace
