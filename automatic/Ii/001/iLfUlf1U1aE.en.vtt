00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.869 
course back in 2005 and then you went
off<00:03:19.209> f1<00:03:20.109> testing<00:03:20.560> was<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.519> a<00:03:21.579> little<00:03:21.699> bit

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
off f1 testing was it a little bit

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.789 
off f1 testing was it a little bit
demoralizing<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.569> then<00:03:22.750> have<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.109> go<00:03:23.139> back<00:03:23.620> to

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
demoralizing to then have to go back to

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.229 
demoralizing to then have to go back to
the<00:03:23.829> DTM<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.519> in<00:03:25.150> an<00:03:25.239> old<00:03:25.389> car<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:27.489> wasn't<00:03:27.970> them

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
the DTM and in an old car it wasn't them

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.659 
the DTM and in an old car it wasn't them
it<00:03:28.599> wasn't<00:03:29.169> the<00:03:29.470> moralizing<00:03:29.769> at<00:03:30.159> all<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.549> go

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
it wasn't the moralizing at all to go

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.270 
it wasn't the moralizing at all to go
back<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.909> DTM<00:03:31.329> because<00:03:31.720> if<00:03:32.470> any<00:03:32.709> if<00:03:32.859> I<00:03:32.980> had<00:03:33.129> my

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
back to DTM because if any if I had my

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.390 
back to DTM because if any if I had my
way<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.459> would<00:03:33.579> have<00:03:33.699> stayed<00:03:33.909> in<00:03:34.090> DTM<00:03:34.480> in<00:03:34.599> 2006

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
way I would have stayed in DTM in 2006

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.189 
way I would have stayed in DTM in 2006
as<00:03:36.400> well<00:03:36.639> as<00:03:36.760> test<00:03:37.030> but<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.389> thing<00:03:37.810> was<00:03:37.840> in

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
as well as test but the thing was in

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.689 
as well as test but the thing was in
tears<00:03:38.409> and<00:03:38.560> six<00:03:38.769> there<00:03:38.919> was<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.129> much<00:03:39.250> testing

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
tears and six there was so much testing

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.189 
tears and six there was so much testing
you<00:03:39.819> couldn't<00:03:40.120> do<00:03:40.239> both<00:03:40.540> of<00:03:40.599> them<00:03:40.810> basically

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
you couldn't do both of them basically

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.890 
you couldn't do both of them basically
so<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.709> had<00:03:42.129> to<00:03:42.159> choose<00:03:42.459> one<00:03:42.669> or<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.849> other<00:03:42.909> so

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
so I had to choose one or the other so

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.899 
so I had to choose one or the other so
going<00:03:44.379> back<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.620> DTM<00:03:45.159> was<00:03:45.340> always<00:03:45.609> going<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.879> be

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
going back to DTM was always going to be

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.640 
going back to DTM was always going to be
an<00:03:46.060> option<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.479> think<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.199> it<00:03:47.470> was

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
an option I think and and it was

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.770 
an option I think and and it was
obviously<00:03:48.010> disappointing<00:03:48.639> that<00:03:48.819> when<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.540> went

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
obviously disappointing that when I went

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.330 
obviously disappointing that when I went
back<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:50.139> couldn't<00:03:50.440> have<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.650> new<00:03:50.859> car<00:03:51.099> straight

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
back I couldn't have a new car straight

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.759 
back I couldn't have a new car straight
away<00:03:51.639> you<00:03:51.849> know<00:03:52.030> I<00:03:52.269> was<00:03:53.049> expecting<00:03:53.409> that<00:03:53.709> to

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
away you know I was expecting that to

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.409 
away you know I was expecting that to
happen<00:03:53.889> you<00:03:54.489> know<00:03:54.549> obviously<00:03:54.699> being<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.209> former

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419

you<00:05:31.720> know<00:05:31.750> both<00:05:32.050> drivers<00:05:32.530> will<00:05:32.680> get<00:05:32.860> you<00:05:33.040> know

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
you know both drivers will get you know

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.920 
you know both drivers will get you know
absolutely<00:05:33.550> equal<00:05:33.700> treatment<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.450> and<00:05:34.840> will

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
absolutely equal treatment and and will

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.020 
absolutely equal treatment and and will
be<00:05:35.050> driven<00:05:35.410> very<00:05:35.860> hard<00:05:36.160> and<00:05:36.310> I<00:05:36.400> think<00:05:36.610> they

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
be driven very hard and I think they

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.880 
be driven very hard and I think they
will<00:05:37.180> push<00:05:37.360> each<00:05:37.480> other<00:05:37.630> so<00:05:37.840> hard<00:05:38.140> that<00:05:38.320> it<00:05:38.740> can

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
will push each other so hard that it can

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.500 
will push each other so hard that it can
only<00:05:39.010> get<00:05:39.340> better<00:05:39.400> as<00:05:39.790> the<00:05:39.880> season<00:05:40.030> goes<00:05:40.330> on

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
only get better as the season goes on

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.660 
only get better as the season goes on
you<00:05:40.690> know<00:05:40.720> they're<00:05:41.230> not<00:05:41.260> two<00:05:42.010> people<00:05:42.220> that<00:05:42.520> are

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
you know they're not two people that are

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.610 
you know they're not two people that are
going<00:05:42.850> to<00:05:42.940> fall<00:05:43.810> out<00:05:43.840> with<00:05:44.020> each<00:05:44.230> other<00:05:44.440> you

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
going to fall out with each other you

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.510 
going to fall out with each other you
know<00:05:44.650> they're<00:05:44.890> just<00:05:45.040> going<00:05:45.130> to<00:05:45.250> push<00:05:45.400> each

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
know they're just going to push each

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.920 
know they're just going to push each
other<00:05:45.700> as<00:05:45.850> hard<00:05:46.060> as<00:05:46.120> they<00:05:46.210> can<00:05:46.270> and<00:05:46.660> I<00:05:46.720> think

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
other as hard as they can and I think

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.150 
other as hard as they can and I think
the<00:05:47.020> relationship<00:05:47.260> will<00:05:47.800> just<00:05:47.980> get<00:05:48.100> better

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
the relationship will just get better

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.190 
the relationship will just get better
and<00:05:48.430> better<00:05:48.550> and<00:05:48.850> that<00:05:49.060> will<00:05:49.210> help<00:05:49.390> the<00:05:49.960> car

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
and better and that will help the car

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.500 
and better and that will help the car
and<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.500> team<00:05:50.680> to<00:05:50.830> develop<00:05:51.240> and<00:05:52.240> what<00:05:52.360> about
