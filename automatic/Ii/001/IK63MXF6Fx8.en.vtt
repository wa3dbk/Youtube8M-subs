00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.350 
right hands I've seen people just
absolutely<00:00:46.980> go<00:00:47.219> crazy<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.059> thing

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
absolutely go crazy with this thing

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.500

put<00:00:54.120> simply<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.840> recon<00:00:55.260> using<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> MAV<00:00:55.949> is

put simply a recon using the MAV is

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.340 
put simply a recon using the MAV is
probably<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.910> most<00:00:56.940> useful<00:00:57.449> recon<00:00:58.050> that

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
probably the most useful recon that

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.979 
probably the most useful recon that
you'll<00:00:58.500> find<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:59.190> battlefield<00:00:59.910> 3<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.780> let's

there<00:01:14.189> are<00:01:14.369> some<00:01:14.580> other<00:01:14.760> ways<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.450> which<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
there are some other ways in which you

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.810 
there are some other ways in which you
can<00:01:15.869> use<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.350> ma<00:01:16.590> vie<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.040> terrorize<00:01:17.580> your

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
while in the ma vie I'm not quite sure

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.420 
while in the ma vie I'm not quite sure
what<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> range<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.680> motion<00:01:28.890> sensing

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
what the range of the motion sensing

on that matter let me know in the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.429 
on that matter let me know in the
comments<00:01:37.259> below<00:01:37.610> but<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:39.119> seems<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.810> bit

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
comments below but it seems to be a bit

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.440 
comments below but it seems to be a bit
finicky<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.159> some<00:01:41.490> levels<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.119> quite

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
finicky on some levels it's quite

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.069 
finicky on some levels it's quite
extensive<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:44.369> range<00:01:44.610> seems<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.329> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
extensive and the range seems to be you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.260 
extensive and the range seems to be you
know<00:01:46.200> quite<00:01:46.470> large<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.159> other<00:01:47.640> levels<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
know quite large on other levels it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.940 
know quite large on other levels it
seems<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:49.049> barely<00:01:49.380> even<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.560> around

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
seems like it can barely even see around

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.120 
seems like it can barely even see around
a<00:01:50.100> corner<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:51.090> I'm<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.329> quite<00:01:51.540> sure<00:01:52.130> what

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
a corner so I'm not quite sure what

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.819 
a corner so I'm not quite sure what
that's<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:54.090> about<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.930> as<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.439> here

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that's all about but as you can see here

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.950 
that's all about but as you can see here
I'm<00:01:56.040> sensing<00:01:56.579> those<00:01:56.729> enemies<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.210> below<00:01:57.780> me

as<00:03:07.769> just<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.190> standard<00:03:08.640> motion<00:03:09.060> sensor<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.660> can

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
as just a standard motion sensor you can

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.320 
as just a standard motion sensor you can
deploy<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.620> put<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.940> good<00:03:12.090> position

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
then you can just exit out of it and

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.190 
then you can just exit out of it and
carry<00:03:20.820> on<00:03:20.910> your<00:03:21.180> merry<00:03:21.390> little<00:03:21.450> way<00:03:21.690> and
