or for other inhabited planets has

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.109 
or for other inhabited planets has
become<00:01:28.539> incredibly<00:01:29.500> difficult<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.429> what

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
become incredibly difficult and what

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.350 
become incredibly difficult and what
they<00:01:31.240> do<00:01:31.300> is<00:01:31.479> they<00:01:31.869> go<00:01:32.050> out<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.640> big<00:01:33.640> planets

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
they do is they go out to big planets

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.080 
they do is they go out to big planets
that<00:01:34.810> are<00:01:34.869> in<00:01:35.229> deep<00:01:35.619> deep<00:01:35.860> bound<00:01:36.099> space<00:01:36.459> and

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
that are in deep deep bound space and

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.210 
that are in deep deep bound space and
they<00:01:37.179> mine<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.840> whole<00:01:38.110> entire<00:01:38.560> planet<00:01:39.130> they

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
they mine the whole entire planet they

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.580 
they mine the whole entire planet they
just<00:01:39.429> rip<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:39.910> pieces<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.599> once<00:01:41.349> we<00:01:41.500> had

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
just rip it to pieces and once we had

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.469 
just rip it to pieces and once we had
that<00:01:41.619> image<00:01:41.860> of<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:42.490> this<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:43.030> know<00:01:43.119> planet

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
that image of like this you know planet

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.630 
that image of like this you know planet
being<00:01:43.660> ripped<00:01:43.810> apart<00:01:43.959> we<00:01:44.380> thought<00:01:44.619> but<00:01:45.459> what

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
being ripped apart we thought but what

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.100 
being ripped apart we thought but what
if<00:01:45.759> you<00:01:45.940> ripped<00:01:46.179> apart<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.539> planet<00:01:46.869> there<00:01:46.990> was

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
if you ripped apart a planet there was

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.010 
if you ripped apart a planet there was
something<00:01:47.410> inside

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.390 

creating<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.080> rich<00:01:51.200> backstory<00:01:51.740> is<00:01:51.890> important

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
creating a rich backstory is important

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.690 
creating a rich backstory is important
because<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:54.530> gives<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.070> grapples<00:01:55.520> to

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
because it it gives you the grapples to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.310 
because it it gives you the grapples to
make<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.000> real<00:01:56.210> for<00:01:56.300> people<00:01:56.510> otherwise

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
make it real for people otherwise

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.440 
make it real for people otherwise
everything<00:01:57.650> becomes<00:01:58.130> just<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.670> 2d<00:01:58.970> cardboard

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
everything becomes just a 2d cardboard

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.020 
everything becomes just a 2d cardboard
cutout<00:01:59.900> of<00:02:00.110> some<00:02:00.680> kind<00:02:00.979> of<00:02:01.130> cliche<00:02:01.460> stereotype

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
cutout of some kind of cliche stereotype

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.060 
cutout of some kind of cliche stereotype
and<00:02:02.270> it's<00:02:02.450> it's<00:02:02.930> not<00:02:03.140> really<00:02:03.350> entertaining<00:02:03.800> at

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
and it's it's not really entertaining at

the story of dead space is powerful

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.990 
the story of dead space is powerful

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
because of its intensity and because of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.440 
because of its intensity and because of
materialism<00:03:26.570> and<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:27.950> think<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:29.120> don't<00:03:29.269> see

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
materialism and I think you don't see

materialism and I think you don't see
that<00:03:29.570> in<00:03:29.720> games

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
that in games

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.660 
that in games
right<00:03:31.060> from<00:03:31.269> beginning<00:03:31.980> we<00:03:32.980> wanted<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.400> make<00:03:33.610> a

right from beginning we wanted to make a

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.280 
right from beginning we wanted to make a
really<00:03:34.150> good<00:03:34.180> story<00:03:34.510> wanted<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:34.900> make<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.019> very

very<00:03:35.590> strong<00:03:35.739> story<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.849> that's<00:03:36.909> because

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
very strong story and that's because

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.940 
very strong story and that's because
that's<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:38.140> kind<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.379> game<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.560> we<00:03:38.739> want

that's the kind of game that we want

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:51.559 
that's the kind of game that we want
