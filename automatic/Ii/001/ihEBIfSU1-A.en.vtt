00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 very good companions to be here 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.520
 we are one more day in a new blog in 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.520
 my room on the wall 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.610
 then I do is because we 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.170
 you are making a blog to devis and you 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.960
 you make videos of games that you make 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.289
 doing so many blogs that you already have 2 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.390
 2 very bad but good I wanted to increase is 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.130
 a couple of little things that come better 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.130
 put a blog to make a video 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.259
 recording only brings me water like that and I already 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.149
 I'm getting used to talking to a 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.929
 little circle so if you are a little circulito 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.929
 well crystal 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.130
 I'm going to tell you a couple of things that 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.260
 I always comment on twitter but I do not 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.880
 all on twitter I do not know what you expect 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.900
 twitter then once the failure of 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.239
 pokemon risk boom of truth 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.640
 I said it in geek world and I was going to 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.980
 upload it that same day I tried to record 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.100
 everything and it would be the first chapter first 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.489
 I could not record it the game sound was not 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.140
 it does not have sound because windows 8 does not 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.990
 has sound in the game because if not 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.479
 it works it can not aggravate it could not 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.820
 render what could not climb it was everything 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.160
 English and then I did not get the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.020
 way to do it well and I had to 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.020
 cancel it I can not upload pokemon 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.369
 raise you feeling it a lot because I'm not going 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.950
 to change operating system and more 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.259
 when I just format and that takes me 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.210
 to another point but first I want me to 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.590
 you recommend below in the comments 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.590

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.530
 I want you to recommend me games that you 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.230

 I do not have a lot of games here but 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.490

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.780
 a wait of 20 days at the most either 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.660
 I want to stretch out a lot because it gets 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.120

 for the computer the tower what is the 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.110
 armed this where everything is given 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.380
 icon that's why I basically study and there's 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.020
 I had tortillas that one could not 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.910

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.599
 in trouble 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.599
 but you see also pokemon recaude will be the 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:50.879
 substitute of forest that also went bad 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:54.480
 there is a damn strip but the case is 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:57.120
 that I have to again I'm going to stop 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.220
 butt and let's go to the total goal 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.260
 of the video this is the setup that there is 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.659
 you asked me a lot and we are going to do 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.579
 a little quickie setup of what is 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.010
 this you do not see in my room because 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.620
 there are those a blue wall with two 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.849
 stickers that you always see in the videos 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.920
 so you already know how to comment under games 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.020
 low 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.739
 good guys here I have already the camera 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.720

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.099
 what he rode here beware of him there 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.380

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:32.010
 I'm going to record the blogs, well, here 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.800

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.450
 theme in the micro is the jet and deep blue 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.250
 microphones so that if you want it 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.569
 pretty good consult the micro a 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.360
 little old-fashioned already because I think they have 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.730
 come out new versions with anti nebur 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.200
 The popping of the fabric is for 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.209
 that does not strain so much the bad audio and 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.040
 all this and a separation then 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.470
