00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.899 
weapons so you know if you're going to
spin<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> box<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.500> very<00:01:37.860> very<00:01:38.130> risky<00:01:38.700> because

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
spin the box is very very risky because

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.569 
spin the box is very very risky because
you<00:01:39.390> obviously<00:01:39.950> 950<00:01:40.950> points<00:01:41.220> goes<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> very

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
you obviously 950 points goes a very

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.280 
you obviously 950 points goes a very
long<00:01:41.880> way<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.689> challenge<00:01:43.049> because

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
long way in this challenge because

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.080 
long way in this challenge because
obviously<00:01:43.640> we're<00:01:44.640> only<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.060> using

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
obviously we're only going to be using

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.880 
obviously we're only going to be using
shotguns<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.930> points<00:01:46.259> aren't<00:01:46.409> really<00:01:46.619> going<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
shotguns I points aren't really going to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.899

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
challenge which is designed to be as

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.360 
challenge which is designed to be as
much<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:31.420> doom<00:03:31.660> as<00:03:31.900> possible<00:03:32.800> so<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.070> hope

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
much like doom as possible so I hope

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.540 
much like doom as possible so I hope
they<00:03:33.550> enjoy<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.090> challenge<00:03:34.269> I<00:03:34.600> think<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.140> is

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
they enjoy the challenge I think it is

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.310 
they enjoy the challenge I think it is
the<00:03:36.550> best<00:03:36.940> challenge<00:03:37.630> that<00:03:37.870> there<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.140> out

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
the best challenge that there is out

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.170 
the best challenge that there is out
there<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.950> mean<00:03:39.459> compared<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.850> all<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.060> other

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
there I mean compared to all the other

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.820 
there I mean compared to all the other
ones<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:40.660> I've<00:03:40.750> made<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.019> like<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.470> pistols

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
ones that I've made and like the pistols

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.710 
ones that I've made and like the pistols
only<00:03:41.950> challenge<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.519> all<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.760> stuff<00:03:42.910> this

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
only challenge and all that stuff this

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.830 
only challenge and all that stuff this
is<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.980> hardest<00:03:45.430> challenge<00:03:45.970> most<00:03:46.450> definitely

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
is the hardest challenge most definitely

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.020 
is the hardest challenge most definitely
because<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:48.010> know<00:03:48.130> no<00:03:48.340> jug<00:03:48.640> you'll<00:03:48.880> get

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
because you know no jug you'll get

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.520 
because you know no jug you'll get
double<00:03:49.180> tap<00:03:49.510> which<00:03:49.720> will<00:03:49.810> help<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.080> Remington

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
double tap which will help the Remington

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.820 
double tap which will help the Remington
be<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.010> lot<00:03:51.220> more<00:03:51.250> powerful<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.930> then<00:03:53.440> you

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
be a lot more powerful and then you

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.170 
be a lot more powerful and then you
might<00:03:54.040> die<00:03:54.250> with<00:03:54.489> it<00:03:54.580> then<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.820> got<00:03:54.910> another

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
might die with it then it got another

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.539 
might die with it then it got another
2,000<00:03:55.630> points<00:03:55.750> points<00:03:56.110> are<00:03:56.410> an<00:03:56.560> issue<00:03:56.709> so<00:03:57.370> it

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
2,000 points points are an issue so it

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.070 
2,000 points points are an issue so it
is<00:03:57.670> very<00:03:57.910> difficult<00:03:58.060> indeed<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:58.870> you're<00:03:58.959> not

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080
