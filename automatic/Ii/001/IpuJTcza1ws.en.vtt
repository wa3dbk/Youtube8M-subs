in<00:00:00.089> the<00:00:00.269> study<00:00:00.539> of<00:00:00.630> logic<00:00:00.930> there's<00:00:01.380> an

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
in the study of logic there's an

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.320 
in the study of logic there's an
argument<00:00:01.709> at<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.100> fallacy<00:00:02.610> known<00:00:02.639> as<00:00:03.120> the

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
argument at a fallacy known as the

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.000 
argument at a fallacy known as the
argument<00:00:03.870> from<00:00:03.959> incredulity<00:00:07.010> now

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
argument from incredulity now

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.250 
argument from incredulity now
incredulity<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:09.120> defined<00:00:09.510> as<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.870> state<00:00:10.110> of

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
incredulity is defined as the state of

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.870 
incredulity is defined as the state of
mind<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.710> which<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:11.040> are<00:00:11.160> unwilling<00:00:11.580> or

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
mind in which you are unwilling or

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.910 
mind in which you are unwilling or
unable<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.509> believe<00:00:12.990> something<00:00:13.320> like<00:00:13.740> if

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
unable to believe something like if

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.440 
unable to believe something like if
someone<00:00:14.340> tells<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.730> though<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.089> know<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
someone tells you though you know the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.180 
someone tells you though you know the
government<00:00:15.929> puts<00:00:16.170> tiny<00:00:16.470> cameras<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.100> your

government puts tiny cameras in your

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.070 
government puts tiny cameras in your
Cheerios<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.850> they<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.180> spy<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.720> inside

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
Cheerios so they can spy on the inside

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.779 
Cheerios so they can spy on the inside
of<00:00:19.199> your<00:00:19.350> body<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.800> you're<00:00:20.130> like<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.640> know<00:00:20.670> I

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
of your body and you're like you know I

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.880 
of your body and you're like you know I
find<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.330> hard<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.779> believe<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
find that hard to believe you are in a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.340 
find that hard to believe you are in a
state<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.189> incredulity<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.630> are<00:00:24.840> incredulous

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
state of incredulity you are incredulous

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.410 
state of incredulity you are incredulous
and<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:26.099> can't<00:00:26.369> help<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:26.760> be<00:00:26.970> incredulous

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
and we can't help but be incredulous

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.779 
and we can't help but be incredulous
sometimes<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.349> fact<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.830> mindset<00:00:29.250> often

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
sometimes in fact that mindset often

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.730 
sometimes in fact that mindset often
leads<00:00:29.970> us<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.330> gain<00:00:30.570> new<00:00:30.840> information<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.679> new

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
leads us to gain new information and new

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.920 
leads us to gain new information and new
experience<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.579> problem<00:00:32.820> arises<00:00:33.570> when<00:00:33.600> our

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
experience the problem arises when our

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.020 
experience the problem arises when our
incredulity<00:00:34.290> stops<00:00:35.010> us<00:00:35.219> from<00:00:35.430> digging<00:00:35.610> deeper

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
incredulity stops us from digging deeper

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.000 
incredulity stops us from digging deeper
the<00:00:36.149> argument<00:00:36.600> from<00:00:36.690> incredulity<00:00:37.010> basically

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the argument from incredulity basically

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.709 
the argument from incredulity basically
takes<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.430> form<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.850> can't<00:00:39.210> believe<00:00:39.540> this

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
takes the form I can't believe this

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.569 
takes the form I can't believe this
therefore<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.590> can't<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.920> true<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.460> can

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
therefore it can't be true and you can

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.160 
therefore it can't be true and you can
word<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> argument<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.629> different<00:00:42.989> ways<00:00:43.140> like

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
word the argument in different ways like

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.290 
word the argument in different ways like
I<00:00:43.710> can't<00:00:43.980> imagine<00:00:44.129> how<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.820> could<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.210> true

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
I can't imagine how that could be true

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.330 
I can't imagine how that could be true
therefore<00:00:45.989> there's<00:00:46.230> no<00:00:46.289> way<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.770> true<00:00:47.039> or

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
therefore there's no way it's true or

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.520 
therefore there's no way it's true or
this<00:00:47.610> doesn't<00:00:48.030> make<00:00:48.149> sense<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.750> me<00:00:48.989> personally

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
this doesn't make sense to me personally

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.200 
this doesn't make sense to me personally
therefore<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.190> true<00:00:50.489> or<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.820> could<00:00:51.000> say

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
therefore it's not true or you could say

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.360 
therefore it's not true or you could say
if<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.899> were<00:00:52.199> true<00:00:52.500> then<00:00:52.829> someone<00:00:53.219> could

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
if this were true then someone could

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.189 
if this were true then someone could
have<00:00:53.430> imagined<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.149> proved<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.660> by<00:00:54.809> now<00:00:55.020> but

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
have imagined or proved it by now but

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.869 
have imagined or proved it by now but
since<00:00:55.469> no<00:00:55.620> one<00:00:55.770> has<00:00:55.890> imagined<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.460> prove<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
since no one has imagined to prove it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.160 
since no one has imagined to prove it
then<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.180> means<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.719> true<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
then that means it's not true and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.630 
then that means it's not true and
because<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.859> argument<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.370> also

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
because of this this argument is also

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.250 
because of this this argument is also
sometimes<00:00:59.879> called<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.420> argument<00:01:00.899> from<00:01:00.989> lack

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
sometimes called the argument from lack

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.990 
sometimes called the argument from lack
of<00:01:01.440> imagination<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.250> an<00:01:02.430> example<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.940> this

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
of imagination so an example of this

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
of imagination so an example of this
argument<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.199> don't<00:01:04.260> understand<00:01:04.799> how

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
argument is I don't understand how

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.160 
argument is I don't understand how
anyone<00:01:05.400> could<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.850> asexual<00:01:06.330> therefore<00:01:07.080> I'm

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
anyone could be asexual therefore I'm

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
anyone could be asexual therefore I'm
pretty<00:01:07.380> sure<00:01:07.560> asexuality<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.700> thing<00:01:08.909> or

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
pretty sure asexuality is not a thing or

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.700 
pretty sure asexuality is not a thing or
no<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.600> has<00:01:09.750> figured<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> way<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.409> make

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
no one has figured out a way to make

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.289 
no one has figured out a way to make
robots<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.280> are<00:01:11.490> smart<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:11.970> humans

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
robots that are smart as humans

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.670 
robots that are smart as humans
therefore<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:12.960> never<00:01:13.110> find<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> way<00:01:13.619> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
therefore we will never find a way to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.350 
therefore we will never find a way to
make<00:01:13.890> robots<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.340> are<00:01:14.520> smart<00:01:14.760> as<00:01:14.850> humans<00:01:15.000> so

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
make robots that are smart as humans so

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.700 
make robots that are smart as humans so
as<00:01:15.540> you've<00:01:15.689> probably<00:01:15.810> guessed<00:01:16.200> by<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
as you've probably guessed by now the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.620 
as you've probably guessed by now the
problem<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.400> argument<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
problem with this argument is in the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
problem with this argument is in the
lack<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.990> imagination<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.430> or

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
lack of imagination it's because you or

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.490 
lack of imagination it's because you or
any<00:01:20.880> individual<00:01:21.600> can't<00:01:21.960> personally

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
any individual can't personally

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.560 
any individual can't personally
understand<00:01:23.159> or<00:01:23.400> imagine<00:01:23.490> something<00:01:24.240> does<00:01:24.420> not

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
understand or imagine something does not

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.539 
understand or imagine something does not
mean<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> no<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.770> understand<00:01:26.310> or

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
mean that no one can understand or

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.100 
mean that no one can understand or
imagine<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.150> thing<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.659> also<00:01:27.780> doesn't

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
imagine that thing and it also doesn't

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.960 
imagine that thing and it also doesn't
mean<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.890> personally<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.670> never

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
mean that you personally will never

close myself off to it I'm done let's

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.240 
close myself off to it I'm done let's
move<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:20.080> but<00:02:20.350> for<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.650> reasons<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.100> I've

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
move on but for the reasons that I've

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.460 
move on but for the reasons that I've
said<00:02:21.490> before<00:02:21.670> that's<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.330> pretty<00:02:22.660> silly<00:02:23.110> way<00:02:23.410> to

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
said before that's a pretty silly way to

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.380 
said before that's a pretty silly way to
think<00:02:23.860> now<00:02:24.100> obviously<00:02:24.580> it's<00:02:24.790> okay<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.210> be

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
think now obviously it's okay to be

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.000 
think now obviously it's okay to be
suspicious<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.960> skeptical<00:02:26.650> when<00:02:26.740> things

suspicious of skeptical when things
don't<00:02:27.250> quite<00:02:27.550> add<00:02:27.580> up<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.240> but<00:02:28.420> that

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
don't quite add up to you but that

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.030 
don't quite add up to you but that

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
should encourage you to find more

and<00:02:32.110> not<00:02:32.200> just<00:02:32.410> close<00:02:32.680> yourself<00:02:32.830> off<00:02:33.250> and

and not just close yourself off and

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.010 
and not just close yourself off and
write<00:02:33.700> off<00:02:33.910> everyone<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.540> doesn't<00:02:34.870> agree

with<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.320> you'd<00:02:35.500> probably<00:02:35.740> be<00:02:36.160> surprised<00:02:36.640> at

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
with you you'd probably be surprised at

how often your gut reaction and your
common<00:02:39.400> sense<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:40.150> wrong<00:02:40.600> but<00:02:40.960> to<00:02:41.080> me

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
common sense is just wrong but to me

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.930 
common sense is just wrong but to me
that's<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.620> beauty<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.040> being<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.370> part<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.820> a

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
sense because I'm heterosexual and it

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.730 
sense because I'm heterosexual and it
would<00:03:22.540> be<00:03:22.660> hard<00:03:22.900> for<00:03:23.050> me<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.260> speak<00:03:23.500> from<00:03:23.650> the
