00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
training with before I was even born I

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.070 
training with before I was even born I
mean<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.150> sets<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.540> source<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.840> information

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
mean that sets a source of information

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.510 
mean that sets a source of information
that<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.620> can

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
that I can

that I can
it's<00:02:56.970> never<00:02:57.090> stepped<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.480> stage<00:02:57.720> itself

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
it's never stepped on a stage itself

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.350 
it's never stepped on a stage itself
once<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:58.950> think<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.190> know<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.340> all<00:03:02.360> figured

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
once you think you know it all figured

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.870 
once you think you know it all figured
out<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.660> do<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:04.190> with<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.310> low<00:03:05.460> inside<00:03:05.640> pitch

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
out to do this with a low inside pitch

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.050 
out to do this with a low inside pitch
the<00:03:06.840> tables<00:03:07.290> see<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.100> lot<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.310> people<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:08.760> used<00:03:08.970> to

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
the tables see a lot of people I used to

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.000 
the tables see a lot of people I used to
piss<00:03:09.240> too<00:03:09.450> we've<00:03:10.080> grabbed<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.470> little<00:03:10.590> cables

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
piss too we've grabbed a little cables

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.190 
piss too we've grabbed a little cables
and<00:03:11.130> yeah<00:03:11.300> keep<00:03:12.300> them<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.600> air<00:03:12.720> and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
and yeah keep them in the air and

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.630 
and yeah keep them in the air and
eventually<00:03:13.740> one<00:03:13.860> day<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:13.980> kind<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.310> realized

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
eventually one day I kind of realized

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.300 
eventually one day I kind of realized
like<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.910> hot<00:03:15.090> storm<00:03:15.390> i<00:03:15.540> purchased<00:03:15.990> this<00:03:16.860> really

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
like a hot storm i purchased this really

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.240 
like a hot storm i purchased this really
wicked<00:03:17.520> pump<00:03:17.940> at<00:03:18.060> my<00:03:18.180> front<00:03:18.360> delt<00:03:18.690> or<00:03:19.440> be<00:03:20.100> like

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
wicked pump at my front delt or be like

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.150 
wicked pump at my front delt or be like

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
most kids or younger trainers too much

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.100 
most kids or younger trainers too much
waiting<00:03:23.430> device<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.970> through<00:03:24.150> cranking<00:03:24.990> you

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
waiting device it through cranking you

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.420 
waiting device it through cranking you
get<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.590> don't<00:03:25.710> know<00:03:25.770> where<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.010> get<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.250> part

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
get I don't know where you get the part

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.240 
get I don't know where you get the part
it's<00:03:27.180> what<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.390> did<00:03:27.630> was<00:03:27.810> basically<00:03:28.740> just<00:03:28.950> found

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
it's what I did was basically just found

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.890 
it's what I did was basically just found
a<00:03:29.280> way<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.430> do<00:03:29.550> cable<00:03:29.910> fly<00:03:30.060> would<00:03:30.270> change<00:03:30.750> the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
a way to do cable fly would change the

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.260 
a way to do cable fly would change the
angle<00:03:31.310> not<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:32.490> much<00:03:32.640> end<00:03:32.820> up<00:03:32.910> pulling<00:03:33.060> up

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
angle not so much end up pulling up

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.090 
angle not so much end up pulling up
above<00:03:33.570> where<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.840> shoulder<00:03:34.200> takes<00:03:34.410> in<00:03:34.590> but

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
above where the shoulder takes in but

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.210 
above where the shoulder takes in but
just<00:03:35.340> enough<00:03:35.810> enough<00:03:36.810> with<00:03:36.990> an<00:03:37.080> angle<00:03:37.440> where

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
just enough enough with an angle where

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.710 
just enough enough with an angle where
I'm<00:03:38.370> actually<00:03:38.550> kind<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:38.880> bringing<00:03:39.210> it<00:03:39.270> in<00:03:39.480> and

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
I'm actually kind of bringing it in and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.380 
I'm actually kind of bringing it in and
up<00:03:40.320> just<00:03:40.740> find<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.040> flow<00:03:41.190> through<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:41.700> without

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
up just find a flow through this without

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.030 
up just find a flow through this without
actually<00:03:42.630> bring<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.050> answer<00:03:43.290> your<00:03:43.440> Delta<00:03:43.800> I

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
actually bring the answer your Delta I

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.460 
actually bring the answer your Delta I
mean<00:03:44.610> it's<00:03:44.730> something<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.210> you<00:03:45.960> know<00:03:46.050> I<00:03:46.260> can

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
mean it's something that you know I can

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.250 
mean it's something that you know I can
explain<00:03:46.710> it<00:03:46.830> as<00:03:47.220> best<00:03:47.250> as<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.700> can<00:03:48.200> but<00:03:49.200> you

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
explain it as best as I can but you

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.230 
explain it as best as I can but you
really<00:03:49.500> kind<00:03:49.770> of<00:03:49.830> got<00:03:49.980> you<00:03:50.700> know<00:03:50.790> hands-on

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
really kind of got you know hands-on

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.650 
really kind of got you know hands-on
feel<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.840> oh<00:03:52.440> wait<00:03:52.800> yeah<00:03:53.400> that's<00:03:53.670> weird

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
we're actually put a couple plates under

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.890 
we're actually put a couple plates under
flat<00:03:58.630> bench<00:04:00.270> find<00:04:01.270> effects<00:04:01.510> would<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:01.720> like

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
flat bench find effects would you like

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.160 
flat bench find effects would you like
two<00:04:02.020> additional<00:04:02.470> minus<00:04:03.250> 45<00:04:04.090> degrees<00:04:04.120> I<00:04:04.780> don't

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
two additional minus 45 degrees I don't

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.990 
two additional minus 45 degrees I don't
really<00:04:05.260> feel<00:04:05.530> it<00:04:05.620> as<00:04:05.710> much<00:04:05.920> but<00:04:06.460> that<00:04:06.610> slight

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
really feel it as much but that slight
