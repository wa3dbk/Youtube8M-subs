00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.240 

over<00:00:34.240> the<00:00:34.330> course<00:00:34.480> of<00:00:34.690> my<00:00:35.140> career<00:00:35.200> I've<00:00:36.040> come

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
over the course of my career I've come

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.860 
over the course of my career I've come
to<00:00:36.370> appreciate<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.940> role<00:00:37.300> that<00:00:37.360> the<00:00:37.660> mind

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
to appreciate the role that the mind

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.840 
to appreciate the role that the mind
plays<00:00:38.050> in<00:00:38.380> performance<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.100> I<00:00:39.460> think<00:00:39.490> where

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
plays in performance and I think where

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.060 
plays in performance and I think where
it<00:00:39.940> became<00:00:40.240> really<00:00:41.050> evident<00:00:41.470> to<00:00:41.590> me<00:00:41.620> was<00:00:41.890> this

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
it became really evident to me was this

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.970 
it became really evident to me was this
spring<00:00:42.430> when<00:00:42.760> I<00:00:42.790> was<00:00:43.470> debuting<00:00:44.470> on<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:44.770> track

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
spring when I was debuting on the track

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.510 
spring when I was debuting on the track
in<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:45.190> 5,000<00:00:45.970> my<00:00:46.720> first<00:00:47.050> few<00:00:47.560> races<00:00:47.770> I<00:00:48.190> felt

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
in the 5,000 my first few races I felt

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.580 
in the 5,000 my first few races I felt
that<00:00:48.730> I<00:00:48.760> wasn't<00:00:49.060> running<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:50.080> my<00:00:50.379> physical

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
that I wasn't running to my physical

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.650 
that I wasn't running to my physical
potential<00:00:51.129> my<00:00:51.520> training<00:00:51.940> had<00:00:52.059> indicated<00:00:52.480> that

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
potential my training had indicated that

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.020 
potential my training had indicated that
I<00:00:52.720> was<00:00:52.930> ready<00:00:53.140> for<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.410> 15-30<00:00:54.309> but<00:00:54.550> I<00:00:54.730> was

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
I was ready for a 15-30 but I was

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.390 
I was ready for a 15-30 but I was
running<00:00:55.390> some<00:00:55.809> disappointing<00:00:56.410> times<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:57.010> I

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
running some disappointing times and I

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.640 
running some disappointing times and I
think<00:00:57.670> I<00:00:57.790> realized<00:00:58.239> that<00:00:58.450> my<00:00:58.809> mind<00:00:59.170> was<00:00:59.410> really

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
think I realized that my mind was really

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.400 
think I realized that my mind was really
the<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.400> piece<00:01:00.640> there<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.180> so<00:01:01.660> I<00:01:01.690> went<00:01:02.230> back

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
the the piece there and so I went back

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.930 
the the piece there and so I went back
and<00:01:02.440> made<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.830> few<00:01:03.040> changes<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.489> my<00:01:03.640> approach<00:01:03.910> to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
and made a few changes to my approach to

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.609 
and made a few changes to my approach to
the<00:01:04.210> race<00:01:04.360> and<00:01:04.629> ended<00:01:05.199> up<00:01:05.290> running<00:01:05.470> a

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
the race and ended up running a

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.550 
the race and ended up running a
breakthrough<00:01:05.860> race<00:01:06.250> pv<00:01:07.210> by<00:01:07.240> 13<00:01:07.840> seconds<00:01:08.350> and

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
breakthrough race pv by 13 seconds and

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.930 
breakthrough race pv by 13 seconds and
three<00:01:08.920> seconds<00:01:09.250> off<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.369> Olympic<00:01:09.820> be

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
three seconds off the Olympic be

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.190 
three seconds off the Olympic be
standard

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.230 

that<00:01:15.380> in<00:01:15.500> my<00:01:15.590> first<00:01:15.799> two<00:01:16.070> races<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:16.670> spring<00:01:17.030> I

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
that in my first two races this spring I

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.569 
that in my first two races this spring I
was<00:01:17.539> far<00:01:17.810> too<00:01:17.840> focus<00:01:18.530> on<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.920> outcome<00:01:19.340> on<00:01:19.520> the

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
was far too focus on the outcome on the

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.230 
was far too focus on the outcome on the
split<00:01:20.240> times<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.780> I<00:01:21.320> needed<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:22.210> detach<00:01:23.210> from

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
split times and I needed to detach from

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.050 
split times and I needed to detach from
that<00:01:23.689> and<00:01:23.929> focus<00:01:24.140> instead<00:01:24.560> on<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.219> process<00:01:25.850> I

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
that and focus instead on the process I

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.730 
that and focus instead on the process I
needed<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.630> break<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.020> race<00:01:27.170> down<00:01:27.439> a<00:01:27.469> little

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
needed to break the race down a little

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.459 
needed to break the race down a little
bit<00:01:27.890> more<00:01:28.189> and<00:01:28.429> get<00:01:28.729> fully<00:01:29.240> engaged<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:30.350> other

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
bit more and get fully engaged the other

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.469 
bit more and get fully engaged the other
part<00:01:30.799> was<00:01:30.950> I<00:01:31.189> needed<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.700> commit<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.329> race

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
part was I needed to commit to the race

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.940 
part was I needed to commit to the race
a<00:01:32.509> little<00:01:32.840> more<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.229> believe<00:01:33.649> in<00:01:33.799> myself

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
a little more and believe in myself

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.410 
a little more and believe in myself
because<00:01:34.250> there<00:01:34.490> was<00:01:34.579> a<00:01:34.640> lot<00:01:34.789> of<00:01:34.819> doubts<00:01:35.119> in<00:01:35.299> my

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
because there was a lot of doubts in my

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.200 
because there was a lot of doubts in my
mind<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:35.960> about<00:01:36.679> committing<00:01:37.189> to<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.490> faster

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
mind and about committing to a faster

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.330 
mind and about committing to a faster
early<00:01:38.509> pace<00:01:38.719> and<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.439> I<00:01:39.469> really<00:01:39.770> went<00:01:39.920> back<00:01:40.100> and

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
early pace and so I really went back and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.940 
early pace and so I really went back and
worked<00:01:40.579> on<00:01:40.789> on<00:01:41.119> those<00:01:41.659> things<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.229> came<00:01:42.829> up

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
worked on on those things and came up

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.100 
worked on on those things and came up
with<00:01:42.979> some<00:01:43.280> mental<00:01:43.549> strategies<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.329> it

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
with some mental strategies and it

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.530 
with some mental strategies and it
worked<00:01:45.530> out<00:01:45.649> great

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.390 

I<00:01:49.600> found<00:01:50.560> over<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:50.890> course<00:01:51.130> of<00:01:51.220> my<00:01:51.340> career

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
I found over the course of my career

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.400 
I found over the course of my career
that<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:52.210> mind<00:01:52.450> needs<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.810> be<00:01:52.900> trained<00:01:53.200> in<00:01:53.290> the

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
that the mind needs to be trained in the

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.290 
that the mind needs to be trained in the
same<00:01:53.650> way<00:01:53.830> that<00:01:53.980> the<00:01:54.130> body<00:01:54.340> is<00:01:54.460> trained<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.270> I

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
same way that the body is trained so I

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.910 
same way that the body is trained so I
try<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.660> work<00:01:55.960> on<00:01:56.170> different<00:01:56.440> mental

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
try to work on different mental

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.330 
try to work on different mental
techniques<00:01:57.340> in<00:01:57.490> my<00:01:57.610> training<00:01:58.620> for<00:01:59.620> example<00:02:00.040> in

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
techniques in my training for example in

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.260 
techniques in my training for example in
workouts<00:02:01.120> I<00:02:01.360> might<00:02:01.630> try<00:02:02.230> to<00:02:02.760> break<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:04.000> the

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
workouts I might try to break the the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.600 
workouts I might try to break the the
workout<00:02:04.690> up<00:02:04.840> into<00:02:05.230> two<00:02:05.710> different<00:02:05.890> parts<00:02:06.370> and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
workout up into two different parts and

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.520 
workout up into two different parts and
give<00:02:07.120> myself<00:02:07.300> objectives<00:02:08.050> in<00:02:08.200> each<00:02:08.320> interval

some<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.400> my<00:02:24.430> workouts<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.240> I<00:02:25.930> try<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.440> find

some of my workouts and I try to find

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.020 
some of my workouts and I try to find
ways<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.390> make<00:02:28.540> workouts<00:02:29.220> mimic<00:02:30.220> races<00:02:30.730> so

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
ways to make workouts mimic races so

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.750 
ways to make workouts mimic races so
that<00:02:31.209> i<00:02:31.240> can<00:02:31.560> come<00:02:32.560> away<00:02:32.800> with<00:02:32.830> just<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.550> sense

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
that i can come away with just a sense

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.010 
that i can come away with just a sense
of<00:02:33.850> confidence<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.360> I'm<00:02:34.510> ready<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.840> tackle

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020

the<00:02:35.260> race

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.530 

lastly<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:39.950> think<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.850> need<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.060> come<00:02:41.330> to

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
lastly I think you need to come to

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.060 
lastly I think you need to come to
expect<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.140> there's<00:02:42.350> going<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.710> be<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:42.830> point

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
expect that there's going to be a point

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.070 
expect that there's going to be a point
in<00:02:43.250> every<00:02:43.430> race<00:02:43.880> where<00:02:44.420> your<00:02:44.540> mind<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:44.870> going

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
in every race where your mind is going

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.050 
in every race where your mind is going
to<00:02:45.200> tell<00:02:45.350> you<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.560> slow<00:02:45.680> down<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.760> think

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
to tell you to slow down and I think

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.840 
to tell you to slow down and I think
coming<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:47.960> expect<00:02:48.620> those<00:02:48.830> voices<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.550> know

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
coming to expect those voices and know

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.550 
coming to expect those voices and know
that<00:02:50.060> they're<00:02:50.240> really<00:02:50.450> just<00:02:50.600> your<00:02:51.320> mind

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
that they're really just your mind

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.050 
that they're really just your mind
telling<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.220> your<00:02:52.370> body<00:02:52.580> is<00:02:52.700> working

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
telling you that your body is working

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.660 
telling you that your body is working
hard<00:02:53.210> except<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.320> voices<00:02:54.710> but<00:02:55.010> talk<00:02:55.220> back<00:02:55.460> to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
hard except the voices but talk back to

them I can do this I can push harder and
it's<00:02:58.820> at<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.000> point<00:02:59.180> where<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.840> really<00:03:00.170> need

think<00:03:15.740> really<00:03:16.100> my<00:03:16.370> biggest<00:03:16.670> piece<00:03:16.820> of<00:03:16.880> advice

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
think really my biggest piece of advice

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.710 
think really my biggest piece of advice
is<00:03:17.330> that<00:03:17.780> your<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.980> are<00:03:19.280> able<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.210> accomplish

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
is that your you are able to accomplish

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.510 
is that your you are able to accomplish
so<00:03:21.110> much<00:03:21.140> more<00:03:21.350> physically<00:03:22.010> than<00:03:22.160> you<00:03:22.310> think

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
so much more physically than you think

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.520 
so much more physically than you think
if<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:23.030> just<00:03:23.240> override<00:03:23.660> those<00:03:23.900> negative

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
if you just override those negative

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.160 
if you just override those negative
voices<00:03:24.710> in<00:03:25.010> your<00:03:25.040> head
