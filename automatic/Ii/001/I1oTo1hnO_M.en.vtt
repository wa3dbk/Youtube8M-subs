of<00:01:21.000> skills<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.360> honest<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:21.750> obviously

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
of skills to be honest but obviously

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.170 
of skills to be honest but obviously
each<00:01:22.590> one's<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.979> bit<00:01:23.100> different<00:01:23.180> runecrafting

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
each one's a bit different runecrafting

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.910 
each one's a bit different runecrafting
I<00:01:24.600> never<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.170> get<00:01:25.290> bored<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.650> so

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
I never really get bored of so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.320 
I never really get bored of so
runecrafting<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.640> probably<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.000> my<00:01:27.060> top

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
runecrafting is probably one my top

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330 
runecrafting is probably one my top
skills<00:01:27.630> attack<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.710> enjoying<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
skills attack I'm enjoying that at the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.140 
skills attack I'm enjoying that at the
moment<00:01:29.490> that's<00:01:29.729> quite<00:01:29.880> good

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
moment that's quite good

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.840 
moment that's quite good
apart<00:01:31.110> from<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.350> divinations<00:01:32.280> okay<00:01:32.640> it's

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
apart from that divinations okay it's

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
apart from that divinations okay it's
just<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.030> bit<00:01:33.180> slow<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> guess<00:01:33.799> dungeoneering<00:01:34.799> is

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
just a bit slow I guess dungeoneering is

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.440 
just a bit slow I guess dungeoneering is
okay<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.729> gets<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> bit<00:01:36.060> boring<00:01:36.329> around

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
okay it just gets a bit boring around

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.480 
okay it just gets a bit boring around
for<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> time<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.409> probably<00:01:37.770> runecrafting<00:01:38.159> to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
for a time so probably runecrafting to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.649 
for a time so probably runecrafting to
be<00:01:38.549> honest<00:01:38.759> because<00:01:38.820> that's<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
be honest because that's one of the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.170 
be honest because that's one of the
things<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.650> runespan<00:01:40.979> especially<00:01:41.970> that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
things in the runespan especially that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.969 
things in the runespan especially that
I've<00:01:42.270> never<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:42.780> bored<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.110> next<00:01:43.890> up

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
I've never really got bored of next up

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.679 
I've never really got bored of next up
we<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.399> question<00:01:44.850> from<00:01:45.030> Kingsley<00:01:45.450> back

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
we have a question from Kingsley back

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
we have a question from Kingsley back
again<00:01:45.930> from<00:01:46.079> last<00:01:46.409> time<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.920> he<00:01:47.280> wants<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
again from last time and he wants to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.520 
again from last time and he wants to
know<00:01:47.700> what<00:01:47.970> got<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> mystery<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> follow<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
know what got a mystery do I follow and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.109 
know what got a mystery do I follow and
I'm<00:01:49.860> actually<00:01:49.979> following<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.549> goodness<00:01:50.850> I've

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
I'm actually following the goodness I've

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.330 
I'm actually following the goodness I've
joined<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.409> don't<00:01:52.649> really<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.130> why

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
joined that and I don't really know why

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.429 
joined that and I don't really know why
to<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.579> honest<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:53.970> because<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.570> don't<00:01:54.960> really

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
to be honest it's because I don't really

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.100 
to be honest it's because I don't really
favor<00:01:55.829> any<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.759> Gods<00:01:57.030> stuff<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.689> so

their<00:03:41.280> minds<00:03:41.519> or<00:03:41.579> whatever<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.359> obviously<00:03:42.870> cuz

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
their minds or whatever so obviously cuz

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.180 
their minds or whatever so obviously cuz

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
interviews sort of thing I guess with

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.020 
interviews sort of thing I guess with
like<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.980> group<00:04:08.220> people<00:04:08.370> like<00:04:08.579> I<00:04:08.670> just<00:04:08.819> said<00:04:08.970> I

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
like the group people like I just said I

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.479 
like the group people like I just said I
went<00:04:09.239> with<00:04:09.389> and<00:04:09.599> mod<00:04:10.560> mark<00:04:10.829> and<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.459> was

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
went with and mod mark and it was

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.940 
went with and mod mark and it was
basically<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:12.299> ask<00:04:12.930> each<00:04:13.319> other<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.769> like

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
basically to ask each other and like

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.530 
basically to ask each other and like
tell<00:04:14.280> mod<00:04:14.459> mark<00:04:14.700> what<00:04:14.940> we<00:04:15.030> thought<00:04:15.239> about<00:04:15.329> the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
tell mod mark what we thought about the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
game what to improve what to add well we

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.130 
game what to improve what to add well we
didn't<00:04:29.910> like<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:30.510> know<00:04:30.630> all<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:30.840> stuff

didn't like and you know all that stuff
like<00:04:31.260> that<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:31.740> it<00:04:32.190> was<00:04:32.280> really<00:04:32.430> awesome<00:04:32.640> to<00:04:32.850> go

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
like that so it was really awesome to go

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.460 
like that so it was really awesome to go
down<00:04:33.150> there<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.390> obviously<00:04:33.690> I<00:04:33.780> guess<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.200> just

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
to my last Q&amp;A episode which was about

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.670 
to my last Q&amp;A episode which was about
combat<00:05:18.060> versus<00:05:18.450> skills<00:05:18.750> which<00:05:18.960> one<00:05:19.230> I<00:05:19.440> prefer

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
combat versus skills which one I prefer

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.290 
combat versus skills which one I prefer
which<00:05:20.070> one<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.400> prefer<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.790> stuff<00:05:20.940> like<00:05:21.000> that

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
which one you prefer to stuff like that

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.390 
which one you prefer to stuff like that
and<00:05:21.480> for<00:05:22.050> me<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.500> doesn't<00:05:22.890> read<00:05:23.070> well<00:05:23.100> in<00:05:23.340> my

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
and for me it doesn't read well in my

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.550 
and for me it doesn't read well in my
opinion<00:05:23.700> I<00:05:23.760> guess<00:05:23.940> because<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.480> liked<00:05:25.140> both<00:05:25.350> of

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
opinion I guess because I liked both of

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.140 
opinion I guess because I liked both of
them<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:25.890> didn't<00:05:26.190> really<00:05:26.220> state<00:05:26.580> an<00:05:26.669> opinion<00:05:27.060> on

the<00:05:34.080> background<00:05:34.530> so<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:34.770> know<00:05:34.890> make<00:05:35.100> the<00:05:35.190> most

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
the background so you know make the most

the background so you know make the most
of<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.520> XP<00:05:35.820> while<00:05:36.000> it's<00:05:36.120> there<00:05:36.300> and<00:05:36.570> yeah<00:05:37.080> I

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
of the XP while it's there and yeah I

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.540 
of the XP while it's there and yeah I
don't<00:05:37.410> really<00:05:37.650> need<00:05:37.890> to<00:05:37.980> good<00:05:38.100> as<00:05:38.190> I<00:05:38.250> like<00:05:38.370> both

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
getting one of those pretty soon that is

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.450 
getting one of those pretty soon that is
part<00:06:46.050> of<00:06:46.080> my<00:06:46.200> future<00:06:46.410> plan<00:06:46.740> so<00:06:46.950> do<00:06:47.040> expect<00:06:47.370> to

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
part of my future plan so do expect to

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.750 
part of my future plan so do expect to
do<00:06:47.550> that

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
do that

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.670 
do that
fairly<00:06:48.360> soon<00:06:48.510> I<00:06:48.660> guess<00:06:48.840> on<00:06:49.020> my<00:06:49.110> channel<00:06:49.440> in<00:06:49.590> a

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
fairly soon I guess on my channel in a

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.260 
fairly soon I guess on my channel in a
video<00:06:49.920> because<00:06:50.550> it<00:06:50.790> would<00:06:50.880> be<00:06:50.970> a<00:06:51.000> lot<00:06:51.150> easier

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
video because it would be a lot easier

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.760 
video because it would be a lot easier
than<00:06:51.600> going<00:06:51.720> around<00:06:51.870> picking<00:06:52.200> them<00:06:52.410> all<00:06:52.530> up<00:06:52.650> I

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
than going around picking them all up I

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.410
