because<00:00:44.379> communication<00:00:45.129> is<00:00:45.519> such<00:00:45.729> an

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
because communication is such an

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.469 
because communication is such an
important<00:00:46.719> part<00:00:47.049> of<00:00:47.350> being<00:00:47.949> a<00:00:48.729> physician<00:00:49.209> and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
important part of being a physician and

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.539 
important part of being a physician and
to<00:00:49.510> me<00:00:49.839> is<00:00:50.170> almost<00:00:50.409> the<00:00:50.589> most<00:00:50.620> important<00:00:51.339> part

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:51.549 
to me is almost the most important part

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.829 
to me is almost the most important part
of<00:00:51.670> it<00:00:52.469> internal<00:00:53.469> medicine<00:00:53.799> was<00:00:54.359> clearly<00:00:55.359> the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
of it internal medicine was clearly the

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.829 
of it internal medicine was clearly the
right<00:00:56.049> place<00:00:56.619> for<00:00:56.649> me<00:00:57.209> as<00:00:58.209> soon<00:00:58.359> as<00:00:58.449> I<00:00:58.569> did<00:00:58.629> my

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
right place for me as soon as I did my

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.569 
right place for me as soon as I did my
first<00:00:58.989> oncology<00:00:59.529> rotation<00:00:59.649> it<00:01:00.100> was<00:01:00.190> obvious

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
first oncology rotation it was obvious

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.479 
first oncology rotation it was obvious
that<00:01:00.729> that<00:01:00.909> was<00:01:01.059> for<00:01:01.299> me<00:01:01.440> part<00:01:02.440> of<00:01:02.559> it<00:01:02.649> was<00:01:02.859> the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
that that was for me part of it was the

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.179 
that that was for me part of it was the
people<00:01:03.819> who<00:01:03.969> go<00:01:04.119> into<00:01:04.299> oncology<00:01:04.689> I<00:01:05.170> had<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.950> lot

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
people who go into oncology I had a lot

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.789 
people who go into oncology I had a lot
of<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.399> same<00:01:06.640> values<00:01:07.420> that<00:01:07.659> I<00:01:07.930> have<00:01:08.170> being

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
of the same values that I have being

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.380 
of the same values that I have being
able<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:09.009> communicate<00:01:09.549> with<00:01:09.700> patients<00:01:10.210> I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
able to communicate with patients I

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.240 
able to communicate with patients I
think<00:01:10.719> that's<00:01:10.899> an<00:01:11.049> important<00:01:11.500> trait<00:01:11.979> for

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
think that's an important trait for

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.859 
think that's an important trait for
being<00:01:12.460> an<00:01:12.609> oncologist<00:01:13.180> because<00:01:13.390> you<00:01:13.689> do<00:01:13.840> have

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
being an oncologist because you do have

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.389 
being an oncologist because you do have
to<00:01:14.229> help<00:01:14.380> people<00:01:14.740> through<00:01:14.950> very<00:01:15.189> difficult

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
to help people through very difficult

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.389 
to help people through very difficult
times<00:01:15.789> you<00:01:16.299> do<00:01:17.200> lose<00:01:17.439> a<00:01:17.469> lot<00:01:17.859> of<00:01:17.890> people<00:01:18.310> that

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
times you do lose a lot of people that

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.760 
times you do lose a lot of people that
you<00:01:18.520> care<00:01:18.789> about<00:01:18.939> and<00:01:19.329> so<00:01:19.840> it's<00:01:20.049> important<00:01:20.619> to

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
you care about and so it's important to

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.990 
you care about and so it's important to
have<00:01:21.009> an<00:01:21.609> ability<00:01:22.329> to<00:01:23.009> feel<00:01:24.009> that<00:01:24.250> sadness<00:01:24.520> but

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
have an ability to feel that sadness but

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.240 
have an ability to feel that sadness but
not<00:01:25.210> have<00:01:25.479> it<00:01:25.630> consume<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.170> in<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.070> last

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
not have it consume you in the last

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.219 
not have it consume you in the last
decade<00:01:27.640> there's<00:01:27.850> been<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.329> many<00:01:28.479> advances<00:01:29.079> in

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
decade there's been so many advances in

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.169 
decade there's been so many advances in
how<00:01:29.409> we<00:01:29.469> treat<00:01:29.950> a<00:01:29.979> lot<00:01:30.280> of<00:01:30.460> different<00:01:30.789> cancers

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
how we treat a lot of different cancers

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.539 
how we treat a lot of different cancers
particularly<00:01:31.780> lung<00:01:32.289> cancer<00:01:32.710> it's<00:01:33.130> great<00:01:33.369> to

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
particularly lung cancer it's great to

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.370 
particularly lung cancer it's great to
be<00:01:33.670> able<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:34.060> talk<00:01:34.539> to<00:01:34.570> someone<00:01:34.899> who's<00:01:35.109> newly

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
diagnosed and say you know don't give up

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.630 
diagnosed and say you know don't give up
hope<00:01:37.299> we<00:01:38.259> have<00:01:38.499> these<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:39.039> offer<00:01:39.189> you<00:01:39.399> now<00:01:39.579> that

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
we wouldn't have had five years ago just

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.690 
we wouldn't have had five years ago just
imagine<00:01:41.920> what<00:01:42.039> we're<00:01:42.189> going<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.340> have<00:01:42.520> in

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
another year or two so let's work on

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.219 
another year or two so let's work on
this<00:01:46.090> together<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.689> figure<00:01:46.899> out<00:01:46.929> a<00:01:47.049> way<00:01:47.170> to
