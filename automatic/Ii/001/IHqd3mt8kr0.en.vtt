00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
nickel on D 5100 and therefore I would

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.169

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
however you are going to need to do some

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.399 
however you are going to need to do some
post-processing<00:01:55.659> with<00:01:56.659> a<00:01:56.929> good<00:01:57.109> piece<00:01:57.289> of

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
post-processing with a good piece of

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.620 
post-processing with a good piece of
software<00:01:57.649> I<00:01:57.829> like<00:01:58.069> them<00:01:58.310> because<00:01:58.969> of<00:01:59.389> this

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
software I like them because of this

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.469 
software I like them because of this
bowing<00:02:00.200> effect<00:02:00.590> that<00:02:01.009> you<00:02:01.100> get<00:02:01.279> at<00:02:01.490> 80<00:02:01.729> mil<00:02:02.149> on

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
bowing effect that you get at 80 mil on

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.599 
bowing effect that you get at 80 mil on
those<00:02:02.810> on<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.289> road<00:02:03.439> on<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:03.920> zoom<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.279> I

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
those on the road on the zoom and I

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.760 
those on the road on the zoom and I
don't<00:02:04.729> see<00:02:05.090> any<00:02:05.209> problems<00:02:05.509> at<00:02:05.600> all<00:02:05.749> but<00:02:06.619> when

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
don't see any problems at all but when

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.100 
don't see any problems at all but when
you're<00:02:06.920> taking<00:02:07.189> shots<00:02:07.369> 18<00:02:07.819> mil<00:02:08.090> there<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:08.959> this

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
you're taking shots 18 mil there is this

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.470 
you're taking shots 18 mil there is this
awful<00:02:09.860> barrier<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.490> bad<00:02:10.700> now<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.300> can

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
awful barrier and it is bad now it can

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.610 
awful barrier and it is bad now it can
easily<00:02:11.810> be

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
easily be

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.150 
easily be
sorted<00:02:13.099> in<00:02:13.790> post-processing<00:02:14.450> but<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:15.980> the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
sorted in post-processing but it's the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.990 
sorted in post-processing but it's the
sort<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.430> person<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.200> travels<00:02:18.200> around<00:02:19.000> and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
sort of person that travels around and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.130 
sort of person that travels around and
doesn't<00:02:20.360> want<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.569> bother<00:02:20.660> messing<00:02:20.930> around

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
doesn't want to bother messing around

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.850

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
something light like rooms that's not

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.900 
something light like rooms that's not
for<00:02:29.390> me<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.510> say<00:02:30.040> my<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.250> half<00:02:31.400> certainly

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
for me to say my and a half certainly

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.420 
for me to say my and a half certainly
won't<00:02:32.060> because<00:02:32.540> she<00:02:33.260> puts<00:02:33.620> her<00:02:33.890> pictures

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
won't because she puts her pictures

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.940 
won't because she puts her pictures
straight<00:02:34.700> onto<00:02:34.849> her<00:02:35.030> iPad<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:37.549> then<00:02:38.950> whatever

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
straight onto her iPad and then whatever

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.530 
straight onto her iPad and then whatever
but<00:02:40.280> essentially<00:02:40.849> if<00:02:40.910> she<00:02:41.000> doesn't<00:02:41.269> do<00:02:41.360> any

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
but essentially if she doesn't do any

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.710 
but essentially if she doesn't do any
post<00:02:41.750> processing<00:02:42.260> tool<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.120> as<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.269> lens<00:02:44.569> for

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
post processing tool so as a lens for

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.920 
post processing tool so as a lens for
her<00:02:44.870> it's<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.230> no-no<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.209> inside<00:02:47.569> look<00:02:47.750> into

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
her it's a no-no so the inside look into

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.870 
her it's a no-no so the inside look into
other<00:02:48.079> lenses<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.829> have<00:02:49.160> found<00:02:49.489> a<00:02:49.670> lens

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
other lenses and I have found a lens

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.270 
other lenses and I have found a lens
which<00:02:50.239> for<00:02:51.019> her<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.170> think<00:02:51.319> will<00:02:51.590> be<00:02:51.709> much<00:02:51.890> more

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
which for her I think will be much more

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.479 
which for her I think will be much more
useful<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.760> that's<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.090> Tamara<00:02:53.420> on<00:02:53.540> 18<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.890> 70

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
useful and that's the Tamara on 18 to 70

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.759 
useful and that's the Tamara on 18 to 70
it's<00:02:56.120> about<00:02:56.329> half<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.630> size<00:02:56.750> third<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.680> the

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
it's about half the size third of the

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.210 
it's about half the size third of the
price<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:59.019> it's<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.230> nice<00:03:00.440> nice<00:03:00.799> little<00:03:00.829> inch

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
price and it's a nice nice little inch

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.619 
price and it's a nice nice little inch
so<00:03:01.489> I'm<00:03:01.640> gonna<00:03:01.819> have<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.000> look<00:03:02.090> at<00:03:02.239> that<00:03:02.329> later

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
so I'm gonna have a look at that later

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.930 
so I'm gonna have a look at that later
on<00:03:03.670> so<00:03:04.670> anyway<00:03:04.849> back<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.030> 18<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.510> 300<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:07.459> long

on so anyway back to 18 to 300 the long
the<00:03:08.840> long<00:03:09.019> range<00:03:09.290> all<00:03:09.709> of<00:03:10.190> DX<00:03:10.519> you<00:03:11.150> know<00:03:11.269> of

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
the long range all of DX you know of

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.350 
the long range all of DX you know of
what<00:03:11.660> five<00:03:11.870> crop<00:03:12.170> factor<00:03:12.349> body<00:03:12.769> is<00:03:13.489> phenomenal

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
what five crop factor body is phenomenal

some<00:03:22.730> issue<00:03:22.880> so<00:03:23.329> each<00:03:23.750> picture<00:03:24.440> gradually

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
some issue so each picture gradually

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.770 
some issue so each picture gradually
zooms<00:03:25.220> in<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:25.970> think<00:03:26.030> it's<00:03:26.480> gonna<00:03:26.630> stop

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780

in the picture and there you'll see the
percentage<00:04:05.629> battery<00:04:06.110> science<00:04:06.530> we<00:04:06.709> go<00:04:06.830> back

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
percentage battery science we go back

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.199 
percentage battery science we go back
and<00:04:07.340> look<00:04:07.459> at<00:04:07.580> that<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.360> if<00:04:08.450> you're<00:04:08.599> into

night with lots of straight edges there

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.150 
night with lots of straight edges there
might<00:04:17.060> be<00:04:17.090> some<00:04:17.329> issues<00:04:17.570> for<00:04:17.810> you<00:04:17.959> at<00:04:18.229> that<00:04:18.290> 18

eighteen to two hundred I think is still
a<00:05:48.260> good<00:05:48.470> buy<00:05:48.849> and<00:05:49.849> probably<00:05:50.210> you<00:05:50.720> might<00:05:50.930> find

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
a good buy and probably you might find

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.980 
a good buy and probably you might find
more<00:05:52.520> secondhand<00:05:53.060> ones<00:05:53.270> I<00:05:53.389> think<00:05:53.720> a<00:05:53.840> lot<00:05:53.960> of

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
more secondhand ones I think a lot of

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.710 
more secondhand ones I think a lot of
people<00:05:54.260> will<00:05:54.440> swap<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:55.070> eighteen<00:05:55.699> to<00:05:55.820> 200<00:05:56.330> for

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
people will swap the eighteen to 200 for

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.620 
people will swap the eighteen to 200 for
the<00:05:56.810> eighteen<00:05:57.110> to<00:05:57.260> 300<00:05:57.889> in<00:05:58.789> which<00:05:59.000> case<00:05:59.300> I

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
the eighteen to 300 in which case I

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.790 
the eighteen to 300 in which case I
think<00:05:59.690> the<00:05:59.930> 18<00:06:00.260> to<00:06:00.440> 2

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
think the 18 to 2

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.920 
think the 18 to 2
as<00:06:01.099> a<00:06:01.280> secondhand<00:06:01.729> boy<00:06:01.940> I<00:06:02.360> think<00:06:02.629> that's

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
as a secondhand boy I think that's

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.999 
as a secondhand boy I think that's
probably<00:06:03.139> the<00:06:04.009> way<00:06:04.430> I'll<00:06:04.550> both<00:06:04.729> my<00:06:05.210> other<00:06:05.360> half

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
probably the way I'll both my other half

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.850 
probably the way I'll both my other half
or<00:06:07.009> that<00:06:07.789> the<00:06:07.940> Tamara<00:06:08.270> 118<00:06:08.659> to<00:06:08.780> 270<00:06:09.319> as<00:06:09.500> another

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
or that the Tamara 118 to 270 as another

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.430 
or that the Tamara 118 to 270 as another
option<00:06:10.310> so<00:06:10.690> I'm<00:06:11.690> sorry<00:06:11.840> I<00:06:11.990> haven't<00:06:12.199> got<00:06:12.319> one

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
option so I'm sorry I haven't got one

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.350 
option so I'm sorry I haven't got one
here<00:06:12.710> but<00:06:12.979> you<00:06:13.460> know<00:06:13.580> I<00:06:13.610> was<00:06:13.940> thinking<00:06:13.970> about

here but you know I was thinking about

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.360 
here but you know I was thinking about
buying<00:06:14.569> one<00:06:14.720> but<00:06:15.110> definitely<00:06:15.860> after<00:06:15.979> using<00:06:16.220> it

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
buying one but definitely after using it

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.860 
buying one but definitely after using it
it's<00:06:16.520> a<00:06:16.639> no<00:06:16.789> for<00:06:17.000> me

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
so nothing wrong with the quality or

so nothing wrong with the quality or
anything<00:06:19.879> like<00:06:20.240> that<00:06:20.300> it's<00:06:20.870> just<00:06:21.020> not<00:06:21.440> not<00:06:21.770> for
