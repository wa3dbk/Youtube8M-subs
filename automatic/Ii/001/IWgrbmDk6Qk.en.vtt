00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.639
 The planet silencers offer the following

 repair service 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:20.150

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.040
 Vito is currently exhaust system 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.620
 the car is a particulate filter and 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.750
 catalyst however it is only shells 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.399
 because the internal elements in them 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:59.020

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.750
 the catalyst is cleaned as the case 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.240
