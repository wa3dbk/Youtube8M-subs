00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 a and u with you but i thought i need to be 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.850
 in trend 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.099
 right there recently signed a new actor 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.080
 for the role of Frank Castle and this is the best moment 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.179
 to show you all the strangest 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.799
 images of a punisher in which we saw 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.700
 This character is quite long 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.890
 comic life 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.960
 I will say right away that in this small video 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.820
 waiting for you 7 incarnations with atypical 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.740
 appearance or behavior for our 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.420
 avenger and in the end concisely 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.140
 I will speak about the new actor 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.140
 drove 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.480
 we will not fly somewhere far in the past 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.580
 and start with the 2012 version and the brother you 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.860
 Frank and and made up the pretty famous 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.780
 a writer who wrote the 21st edition of it 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.580
 ruler change is actually wrong 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.070
 a lot at first glance here is a method 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.800
 add a beard and any cool dude 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.410
 will become even cooler and in general it works 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.129
 but also Greg completely removes the excess 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.290
 chatter 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.379
 and silent main characters and even with 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.660
 a beard on top of that 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.160
 the success of a lot of action his release 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.380
 impress with their dynamics 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.509
 who do you even want an excess of dialogue 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.080
 punisher that man of action in the first 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.940
 turn 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.250
 and therefore this image suits him 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.560
 perfect well yes here he is himself 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.090
 fighting styles so I advise 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.190
 read to one and all 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.350
 followed by the black version 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.420
 hangman and surprisingly many she was not 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.270
 against the backdrop of the current tolerastov head 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.160
 brain back in 1992 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.410
 he became black after plastic 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.050
 surgeries and with that skin color frank 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.670
 releases 60 to 62 appear 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.220
 inclusive in this short storyline 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.500
 lineup he collaborates with hatch cage 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.830
 another version is the max version 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.970
 punisher is the maximum concentration 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.979
 cruelty and violence in the pages 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.040
 comic book action which takes place during 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.570
 marvel universe which does not exist 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.340
 superheroes chronology of the character's life 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.740
 remained untouched hero appears 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.140
 our eyes are already 50-year-old fighting dog 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.180
 who ruled the ship itself by crime 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.430
 last 30 years in one of the issues 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.860
 it is mentioned that over the years he loved in short 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.200
 about 2 thousand people and that is not counting 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.689
 his killing vietnam war crazy 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.399
 get off here is what is remembered by this maron 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.630
 max version so it deserved 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.390
 gets my list 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.209
 okay let's digress from its dark and 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.940
 gloomy images of someone jati butterflies 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.220
 a pony ball from the manga of miles from Marvel 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.220
 here is this female version of the punisher 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.690
 the name with the amount of such a night geisha she 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.480
 does not kill or use firearms 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.790
 weapons replacing it with martial arts and 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.579
 whip there already the action takes place in 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.340
 Tokyo here such brain trouble 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.480
 happened to authors and smarr 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.890
 back to something me not already on 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.260
 the moon is no less strange 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.270
 on the decline in the popularity of the character in the 90s 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.340
 was launched line called 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.870
 purgatory where carotene bullets itself 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.670
 head on and resurrected form 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.180
 supernatural agent of angels and 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.430
 demons 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.040
 he doesnâ€™t remember anything about me 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.080
 reminds popular then spawn there 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.030
 some parallels and I agree 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.950
 I consider it good that they did not develop 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.020
 this line is further but similar yet 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.850
 returned to other supernatural 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.070
 incarnation of carotene became from king 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.390
 CTP emerged after death Franco in 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.970
 the battle with the son of wolverine 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.520
 before the movie ordered murder norman osborne 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.590
 ok life casla returned the legion of monsters to 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.600
 this plot from king asal beats against 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.730
 cyber samurai armies 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.920
 monsters of hunters and not only with them 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.000
 there is a lot of absolutely sucking 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.459
 things going on 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.280
 the last we have is noir frank 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.989
 from the universe the earth is 7200 7 in this 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.750
 of the universe of frank castle he was younger 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.700
 the son of the First World War veterans 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.160
 adolescent castilio but contacted bad 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.350
 Schultz guys and not just dumped out 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.600
 and as it is known from the mafia one road 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.030
 gang revenges him for escaping by killing his father 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.150
 then Frank took on a new name punisher 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.489
 and swore revenge of course this is not 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.590
 all punitive but i tried choice for 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.570
 you 7 of the most diverse of their key on 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.160
 my opinion and all about what I did not have time 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.260
 say tell tell in future release 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.780
 biography of Frank Castle it is necessary 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.489
 will it be such a mini preview cut there 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.650
 there will be a lot of juicy 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.239
 interesting events and now several 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.820
 words by actors whose the other day 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.590
 signed namely Johnny bird 0 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.540
 I have seen quite a few roles and 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.610
 I can say for sure that he 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.690
 fits perfectly in appearance yes not 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.579
 the best candidate 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.380
 but still need to judge after the release 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.780
 new season daredevils 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.640
