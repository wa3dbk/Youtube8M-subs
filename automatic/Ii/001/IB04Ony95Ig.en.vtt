00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.720
 I started to really prepare for 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.700
 out 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.440
 in the last two years then in 2014 and 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.859
 2013 really really 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.210
 they did before but I believe that 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.199
 if the person is in the 8th grade the still has 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.269
 a lot of time to change a lot is 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.439
 It's always you see something, then. 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.039
 for example if the person is not doing well in the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.410
 school 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.880
 she can start and even then she can not. 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.830
 start my school I think 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.000
 involves a whole change of attitude 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.370
 I wanted to talk but it 's not so simple. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.899
 make a behavior will change one 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.370
 series of things but if the person has a 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.140
 Motivation as I said only has a goal 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.760
 only has a focus to prove and do everything 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.590
 can draw energy and disposition to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.940
 do it all so I think it's a lot 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.350
 important things make sense 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.149
 for the person only has a goal that makes 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.070
 too much sense for her she'll be able to 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.039
 do anything to get out 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.969
 sometimes she has less time but has more 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.739
 I always think it gives 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.940
 So I think that for those who are trying to leave 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.770
 There's plenty of time to change a lot. 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.850
 just have to start type today and not from here 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.700
 two years ago 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.290
 and I believed series did not have many 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.880
 extracurricular activities maybe 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.530
 I started thinking about studying outside 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.060
 but if you refuse the truth is that every 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.150
 world outside of school of thing that I 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.799
 I can do it so I think people 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.720
 are the first it does not have 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.490
 plenty of time to do a lot 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.090
 I did not come here to anyone who is in doubt. 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.640
 about if you go now when you were 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.770
 finishing 3rd year of high school or if 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.460
 Apply when you are after you pulled me up 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.460
 it's a personal thing I'm ready I 'm not 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.920
 It's a very subjective thing, I guess. 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.500
 We talk to several people some 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.780
 and others who did not apply 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.180
 direct with each the third year is 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.780
 very interesting to know how was the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.560
 experience of each is and is just that 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.850
 You do not like it 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.110
 the person has to be aware that 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.740
 If it was mine and I have to 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.360
 enjoy 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.670
 You're going to have a year of the book is very 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.049
 easy do you have you have free time you 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.010
 do nothing with it 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.210
 and I 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.740
 - We often talk to 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.420
 The amount of things you do is 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.940
 inversely proportional to the quantity 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.530
 of time you have on holiday and such 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.210
 and ends up making a lot and ends 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.970
 doing nothing and not just talking then 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.500
 So if it's to be good and you have to go 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.590
 with the head of another discipline to 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.480
 do a lot of things I want to do is 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.410
 better to take the blow and get 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.020
 You use this time for thing 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.390
 interesting and ours to prepare and 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.530
 but I believe it would be a good 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.250
 option for those without discipline 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.250
 to do this
