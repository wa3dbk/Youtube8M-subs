stuff<00:01:50.210> supposed<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.569> grow<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:51.050> guess<00:01:51.319> it

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
stuff supposed to grow I guess it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.590 
stuff supposed to grow I guess it
doesn't<00:01:51.560> matter<00:01:51.770> how<00:01:51.860> much<00:01:52.009> there<00:01:52.190> is<00:01:52.220> but

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
doesn't matter how much there is but

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.230 
doesn't matter how much there is but
more<00:01:53.600> grows<00:01:53.869> faster<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:54.979> put<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.579> warm<00:01:55.850> milk<00:01:56.060> I

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
more grows faster I put the warm milk I

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.569 
more grows faster I put the warm milk I
mix<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:56.630> all<00:01:56.719> up<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.200> then<00:01:57.979> I<00:01:58.040> put<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.369> warm

okay<00:03:29.550> experiment<00:03:30.550> on<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:31.110> kefir<00:03:32.110> which<00:03:32.350> i

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
okay experiment on the kefir which i

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.700 
okay experiment on the kefir which i
think<00:03:32.830> is<00:03:33.100> more<00:03:33.280> yogurt<00:03:33.760> than<00:03:33.970> anything<00:03:34.710> the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
think is more yogurt than anything the

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.530 
think is more yogurt than anything the
bottle<00:03:36.160> in<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.400> foreground<00:03:36.730> on<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.120> right<00:03:37.300> is

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
bottle in the foreground on the right is

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.990 
bottle in the foreground on the right is
the<00:03:38.110> new<00:03:39.180> mixture<00:03:40.180> of<00:03:40.450> some<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.350> old

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
the new mixture of some of the old

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.210 
the new mixture of some of the old
yogurt<00:03:43.200> mixed<00:03:44.200> with<00:03:44.320> some<00:03:44.530> sterilized<00:03:44.920> milk

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
yogurt mixed with some sterilized milk

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.970 
yogurt mixed with some sterilized milk
and<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.760> worked<00:03:45.940> fine<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:47.620> turned<00:03:47.830> into

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
and it worked fine it it turned into

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.170 
and it worked fine it it turned into
yogurt<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:48.460> I<00:03:48.490> don't<00:03:48.670> have<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.820> buy<00:03:48.970> their

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
yogurt so I don't have to buy their

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.990 
yogurt so I don't have to buy their

older one which I've had out now my
daughter<00:03:58.180> got<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.900> little<00:03:59.290> harder<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.830> had

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
daughter got it a little harder I had

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.130 
daughter got it a little harder I had
her<00:04:00.220> put<00:04:00.460> it<00:04:00.610> in<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:02.020> area<00:04:02.350> above<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.590> heat

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
her put it in the area above the heat

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.130 
her put it in the area above the heat
register<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:06.390> got<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.420> little<00:04:07.690> hotter<00:04:07.840> than<00:04:07.959> I

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
register and got a little hotter than I

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.500 
register and got a little hotter than I
wanted<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.620> think<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:09.010> well<00:04:09.820> exceeded<00:04:10.209> 100

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510

wanted I think it well exceeded 100
degrees<00:04:10.830> was<00:04:11.830> both<00:04:12.490> them<00:04:12.730> were<00:04:12.790> very<00:04:13.000> hot
