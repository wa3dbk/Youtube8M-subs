00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.810 
story I thought it was so fun and fast
paced<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.380> unlike<00:01:44.220> any<00:01:44.520> other

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
paced and just unlike any other

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.060 
paced and just unlike any other
dystopian<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.810> read<00:01:45.960> before<00:01:46.079> first<00:01:46.860> off

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
dystopian I have read before first off

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it's a dystopian standalone which is

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.600 
it's a dystopian standalone which is
completely<00:01:49.200> different<00:01:49.350> from<00:01:50.070> anything<00:01:50.369> else

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
completely different from anything else

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.810 
completely different from anything else
but<00:01:51.409> just<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> whole<00:01:52.560> concept<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> whole

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820

and<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.060> ugliest<00:02:16.510> series<00:02:16.900> by<00:02:17.080> Scott

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
and that is the ugliest series by Scott

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.949 
and that is the ugliest series by Scott
Westerfeld<00:02:17.520> these<00:02:18.520> books<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.510> was<00:02:19.720> probably

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
Westerfeld these books this was probably

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.680 
Westerfeld these books this was probably
the<00:02:20.200> first<00:02:20.620> series<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.130> ever<00:02:21.400> completed<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.240> I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
the first series I ever completed and I

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.080 
the first series I ever completed and I
ever<00:02:22.930> really<00:02:23.530> really<00:02:23.860> loved<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:24.940> thought

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
ever really really loved I just thought

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.510 
ever really really loved I just thought
it<00:02:25.209> was<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:25.630> fun<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.020> interesting<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.250> it's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
it was so fun and interesting and it's

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.850 
it was so fun and interesting and it's
probably<00:02:27.989> other<00:02:28.989> than<00:02:29.319> The<00:02:29.440> Giver

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
probably other than The Giver

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.370 
probably other than The Giver
it's<00:02:30.190> probably<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.940> first<00:02:31.209> dystopian<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:32.350> I

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
it's probably the first dystopian that I

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.650 
it's probably the first dystopian that I
read<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:32.920> it'd<00:02:33.069> be<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> first<00:02:33.450> dystopian<00:02:34.450> that

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
read so it'd be the first dystopian that

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.510 
read so it'd be the first dystopian that
I<00:02:34.690> read<00:02:34.959> like<00:02:35.080> willingly<00:02:35.530> without<00:02:36.040> having<00:02:36.400> to

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
I read like willingly without having to

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.699 
I read like willingly without having to
for<00:02:36.730> school<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.270> I<00:02:37.569> just<00:02:37.900> really<00:02:38.410> really

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
for school and I just really really

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.740 
for school and I just really really
enjoyed<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:39.100> these<00:02:39.520> books<00:02:39.819> really<00:02:40.060> kind<00:02:40.660> of

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
enjoyed it these books really kind of

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.470 
enjoyed it these books really kind of

got me on like a reading spurt for a

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.150 
got me on like a reading spurt for a
while<00:02:43.690> because<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:44.230> used<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.620> like<00:02:44.830> I<00:02:45.010> would

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
while because I used to like I would

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.560 
while because I used to like I would
read<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.400> book<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.820> that<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.000> couldn't<00:02:46.300> read

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
read a book and that I couldn't read

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.810 
read a book and that I couldn't read

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
anything for like months and months and

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.009 
anything for like months and months and
then<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:48.970> would<00:02:49.090> read<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.300> book<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.720> like<00:02:49.870> it

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
then I would read a book and like it

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.690 
then I would read a book and like it
would<00:02:50.140> be<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.260> whole<00:02:50.590> cycle<00:02:50.920> now<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:51.580> just

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
would be that whole cycle now I just

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.830 
would be that whole cycle now I just
read<00:02:52.060> constantly<00:02:52.720> but<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.470> think<00:02:53.890> I<00:02:54.010> read<00:02:54.310> like

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
read constantly but I think I read like

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.199 
read constantly but I think I read like
the<00:02:55.920> six<00:02:56.920> books<00:02:57.130> in<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.400> row<00:02:57.580> after<00:02:57.970> reading

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
the six books in a row after reading

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.180 
the six books in a row after reading
these<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:58.690> these<00:02:58.810> really<00:02:59.170> got<00:02:59.350> me<00:02:59.560> into

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
these so these really got me into

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.370 
these so these really got me into
reading<00:03:00.400> for<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> little<00:03:01.030> bit<00:03:01.209> there<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:02.019> yeah

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
it'll be interesting reading it now like

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.390 
it'll be interesting reading it now like
having<00:05:16.000> actual<00:05:16.560> people<00:05:17.560> as<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.980> characters

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
having actual people as the characters

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.620 
having actual people as the characters
in<00:05:18.550> my<00:05:18.580> mind<00:05:18.850> if<00:05:19.030> that<00:05:19.060> makes<00:05:19.360> sense

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
in my mind if that makes sense

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.450 
in my mind if that makes sense
like<00:05:20.050> when<00:05:20.500> I<00:05:20.530> read<00:05:20.770> these<00:05:20.890> I<00:05:20.950> didn't<00:05:21.400> know

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
like when I read these I didn't know

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.760

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
actually seen the first movie and I've

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.630 
actually seen the first movie and I've
seen<00:05:28.300> like<00:05:29.050> who<00:05:29.620> plays<00:05:29.920> who<00:05:30.190> it's<00:05:30.430> gonna<00:05:30.520> be

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.610

interesting<00:05:31.240> picturing<00:05:31.810> those<00:05:32.020> people<00:05:32.380> as

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
interesting picturing those people as

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.440 
interesting picturing those people as
characters<00:05:33.130> while<00:05:33.370> reading<00:05:33.700> this<00:05:33.820> I<00:05:34.060> hope

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.490 
that made some sense this next one is
another<00:05:37.270> one<00:05:37.630> that<00:05:37.930> it<00:05:38.020> will<00:05:38.110> probably

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
another one that it will probably

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.620 
another one that it will probably
definitely<00:05:38.980> be<00:05:39.400> rereading<00:05:39.910> this<00:05:40.150> year<00:05:40.420> and

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
hoping to read it again before the air

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.650 
hoping to read it again before the air
comes<00:05:57.310> out<00:05:57.460> which<00:05:57.670> is<00:05:57.820> kind<00:05:57.880> of<00:05:58.090> the<00:05:58.210> fourth

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
I feel like it's kind of a companion but

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.310 
I feel like it's kind of a companion but
they're<00:06:04.000> kind<00:06:04.240> of<00:06:04.330> advertising<00:06:04.840> it<00:06:05.080> as<00:06:05.290> a

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
they're kind of advertising it as a

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.250 
they're kind of advertising it as a
continuation<00:06:05.920> but<00:06:06.790> whatever<00:06:07.450> I<00:06:07.750> really<00:06:08.080> want
