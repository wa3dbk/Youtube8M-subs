here's<00:00:35.640> where<00:00:35.850> things<00:00:36.059> get<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.390> little

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
here's where things get a little

here's where things get a little
interesting<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:37.620> weren't<00:00:37.860> already<00:00:37.980> when

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
interesting they weren't already when

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.340 
interesting they weren't already when
they<00:00:38.969> looked<00:00:39.210> at<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.480> samples<00:00:39.960> under<00:00:40.320> a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
they looked at the samples under a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.150 
they looked at the samples under a
microscope

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
microscope

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.360 
microscope
researchers<00:00:41.820> found<00:00:42.030> mites<00:00:42.450> present<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.370> 14%

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
researchers found mites present in 14%

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.610 
researchers found mites present in 14%
of<00:00:44.489> adults<00:00:44.850> instead<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.870> stopping<00:00:46.410> there

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
of adults instead of stopping there

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.680 
of adults instead of stopping there
however<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.309> group<00:00:47.520> went<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.149> test<00:00:48.450> for

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
however the group went on to test for

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.139 
however the group went on to test for
demodex<00:00:49.170> DNA<00:00:49.649> because<00:00:50.370> these<00:00:50.550> mites<00:00:50.879> may

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
demodex DNA because these mites may

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.029 
demodex DNA because these mites may
occur<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.690> patches<00:00:52.050> around<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> body

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
occur in patches around the body

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.430 
occur in patches around the body
researchers<00:00:54.030> wanted<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> test<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.930> traces<00:00:55.410> of

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
researchers wanted to test for traces of

researchers wanted to test for traces of
the<00:00:55.590> mites<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.039> case<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.460> simply<00:00:56.820> weren't

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the mites in case they simply weren't
