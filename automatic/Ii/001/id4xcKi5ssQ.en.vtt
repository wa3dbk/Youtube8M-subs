00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
with it one is the microfiber and the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.080 
with it one is the microfiber and the
other<00:01:32.369> end<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.390> mascara<00:01:34.049> there<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.850> only

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
other end is the mascara there the only

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.969 
other end is the mascara there the only
thing<00:01:36.240> wrong<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.900> would<00:01:36.960> say<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.650> packet

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
thing wrong I would say is that packet

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.740 
thing wrong I would say is that packet
is<00:01:38.070> slightly<00:01:38.340> damaged<00:01:38.880> because<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.329> shoved<00:01:39.600> it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
is slightly damaged because I shoved it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.359 
is slightly damaged because I shoved it
in<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> draw<00:01:40.259> with<00:01:40.500> one<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.740> my<00:01:40.799> other<00:01:40.950> mascara

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
in the draw with one of my other mascara

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.960 
in the draw with one of my other mascara
so<00:01:41.700> that's<00:01:41.939> all<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.170> still<00:01:43.380> sealed

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
so that's all you see it's still sealed

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.069 
so that's all you see it's still sealed
perhaps<00:01:44.970> slightly<00:01:45.149> damaged<00:01:45.600> there<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.020> I

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
perhaps slightly damaged there and I

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.210 
perhaps slightly damaged there and I
have<00:01:46.229> actually<00:01:46.380> mentioned<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.040> an
