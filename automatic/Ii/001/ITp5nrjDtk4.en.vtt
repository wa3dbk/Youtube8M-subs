00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.859
 dangerous to all and to all people 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.200
 get along a video yes I know I 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.130
 have not done much but I will 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.130
 to do one you have before you my ps3 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:24.330
 and 360 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.039
 so this is a model of ps3 but here I 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.269
 you make a video 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.189
 because you know it's hot in 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.940
 this moment and that the material is provided 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.840
 who does not like heat is at stake 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.460
 it's very often what happens through 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.100
 report to consoles including ps3 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.390
 they do what is called an island so 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.260
 yl water d light of day so the light 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.079
 I so she is overheating and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.329
 this insecurity like that and makes it the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.300
 overheating comes from the processor in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.550
 to just do the one that actually make it into 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.559
 did I want you m with a stripper 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.350
 thermal what I already did once 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.379
 on our fat patois so - you speak 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.820
 from the asim 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.200
 so that if he rejects the heat by these 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:15.509
 mouths 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:17.580
 I put him in the provision slim 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.500
 before the age is so heat by 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.540
 these little mouths and so first 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.510
 but we know it should be smaller 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.300
 fruit so the sea 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.050
 that they are cleared and not others 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.110
 components that produce heat 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:40.820
 both are also heated 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.890
 so a very simple thing I will you 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.670
 certainly know about its cvc steeples 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.330
 bells or did not want to give in before 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.170
 you take two sometimes three others 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.960
 casting dy balls had three options 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.870
 she was really very simple 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.520
 that in fact that was able to raise it so in fact 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.180
 the heat will pass there is a fluid game 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.700
 r actually 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.050
 so the heat is going to go in 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.450
 done underneath and on a flow will be more 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.330
 recently ben reitzes also a very trick 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.920
 simple and it's a document to do it 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.360
 so even do it with other objects 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.520
 the style of the caps etc 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.000
 showering dilemma totally it works 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.930
 very very well me it's true that ben 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.940
 now I'm going to show you 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.989
 something of which there is first 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:36.500
 put cadmium on the 610 a second 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.880
 is it be it finds in commerce and 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.930
 bars 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.930
 but who also walk ps3 in all 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.240
 so I think wait we 're going to mess up the 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.940
 mark still does not see the margin 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.690
 so that's what we knew 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.470
 so the cross ten years for pc 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.230
 the aspiration is taken there under and 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.820
 gets there what make you say to 2 the 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.290
 on top and extracting buy on 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.930
 sides it works very well it's 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.690
 besides, what I use 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.290
 if you are a little bit more difficult 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:23.340
 to ask but returns the mark hp or 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:29.560
 so do not care I thank you so here is 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.690
 yes I love it propels event is 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.680
 probably their barking 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.680
 squeaks fixie a fan here and 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.500
 day but that's what I form 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.590
 I am wary of what that it made me 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.620
 you can do like this and especially a 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.990
 thing that do not do if we lose I do not say 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.990
 regularly when his parents 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.390
 then take the time when dry air 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.160
 and you blow in there 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.010
 in addition he dismantled what I already have 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.840
 done or so a technique that I do not 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.670
 not recommend it is to put it in 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.709
 security for the fan to turn 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.090
 worked for me it's really a 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.730
 thing that I keep going because in 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.410
 this perfection so that's it for this 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.880
 video I hope you enjoyed on 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.010
 reductions compared to that had been 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.560
 not hurt 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.280
 I'm really sorry this week I 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.450
 may not be able to do 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.260
 because I'm leaving again on vacation 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.970
 and it's super boring does not do 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.840
 watch out for this pot of my little pony 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.730
 I'm just the end so here I am you 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.220
 had said of prodigies doing it 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.220
 the latest videos and lease
