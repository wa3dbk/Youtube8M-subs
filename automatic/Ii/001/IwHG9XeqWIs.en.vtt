00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
have obsidian which the bits of lava

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.109 
have obsidian which the bits of lava
glow<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.049> needs<00:01:43.290> some<00:01:43.530> work<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.520> comparator

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
glow that needs some work the comparator

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.510 
glow that needs some work the comparator
has<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> little<00:01:45.810> symbol<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> Wi-Fi

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
has like a little symbol like a Wi-Fi

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.460 
has like a little symbol like a Wi-Fi
one<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.700> guess<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.689> when<00:01:48.840> he<00:01:48.930> turned<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
one I guess and when he turned on it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.429 
one I guess and when he turned on it
glows<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.979> which<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.750> then<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
glows up which I like then we have the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.690 
glows up which I like then we have the
command<00:01:52.829> Bock<00:01:53.070> which<00:01:55.189> which<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.460> guess<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
command Bock which which I guess the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.889 
command Bock which which I guess the
button<00:01:56.969> has<00:01:57.060> changed<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.450> jukebox

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
button has changed the jukebox

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.569 
button has changed the jukebox
