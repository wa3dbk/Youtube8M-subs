00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.230 

see<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.270> pressure<00:04:52.510> is<00:04:52.690> getting<00:04:52.870> degrees<00:04:54.240> we

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
see the pressure is getting degrees we

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.060 
see the pressure is getting degrees we
can<00:04:55.360> say<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.630> oxygen<00:04:56.170> cylinder<00:04:56.710> level<00:04:56.980> is

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
can say the oxygen cylinder level is

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.270 
can say the oxygen cylinder level is
becoming<00:04:57.520> low<00:04:57.670> and<00:04:58.800> this<00:04:59.800> can<00:04:59.980> be<00:05:00.100> directly

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
becoming low and this can be directly

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.690 
becoming low and this can be directly
transferred<00:05:00.670> to<00:05:01.180> a<00:05:01.390> doctor<00:05:02.130> who<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.160> holding

mobile<00:05:17.080> phone<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:18.490> we<00:05:19.090> preferred<00:05:19.570> a<00:05:19.750> Wi-Fi

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200

these parameters can also be uploaded to
