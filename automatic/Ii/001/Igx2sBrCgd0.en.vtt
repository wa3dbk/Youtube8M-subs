00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.689
 a fruit of the cactus family 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.779
 also known many countries by fruit 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.520
 dragon the pitaya has a lush color 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.419
 originated in Central America and 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.340
 Mexico 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:30.020
 on the big field your book is 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.020
 investing in fruit cultivation 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.320
 you've heard about our pitaya 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.750
 fruit it is known as the fruit 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.720
 of the dragon, the largest producers are 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.030
 Vietnam to Colombia and Mexico and here in 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.130
 Brazil there are few areas where 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.500
 cultivated and we went to a 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.420
 property near the big field for 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.750
 show how the production of this 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.750
 fruit 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.130
 there are some fruit variations 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.300
 The most common type is the red 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.790
 white mpu 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.940
 but there is also that of shell and pulp 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.760
 red and a very strong red almost 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.729
 Nile is the sole producer of the 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.510
 city began cultivation three years ago 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.640
 has 400 feet on his property he has already 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.369
 this year sold four tonnes of 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.950
 fruit trades in five locations 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.690
 including ceasa as it is the only 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.940
 producer says the price is 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.640
 compensating but wants the fruit to 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.420
 make it better known last year 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.800
 I sold loyal ones but I thought that if I 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.170
 He would not give more and the highly personal that 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.570
 savored the pita has to know the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.080
 $ 12 not to be expensive for those who do not know 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.360
 nor will buy right 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.050
 so I proposed neither of $ 8 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.420
 so the whole wind production in the capita 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.420
 is from the cactus family but its 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.250
 cultivation is different but very easy to 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.069
 mounting a structure to which it is 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.410
 support is recommended . 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.480
 two meters between the stakes 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.180
 it should be planted on the side of a 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.340
 strong wood stake or a wall 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.280
 after that in about four months 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.890
 it has already climbed by this base and 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.260
 the branches as a plant 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.970
 who likes water from the property was 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.050
 made an irrigation system for 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.870
 drip 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.300
 the water stays on all the way and as 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.790
 Compost is down according to the producer 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.150
 water already helps it to better penetrate 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.920
 donation cares are 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:51.489
 last year I passed 123 way 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.480
 where the owner but is a chemical fertilizer is to have 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:58.030
 the truck fell jane how more 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:04.110
 a glass of new chemical also with this 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:09.310
 60 days before flowering and 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.260
 more than 60 days of collection 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.989
 natural enemies of the plant are the 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.360
 birds and ants open accounts the 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.550
 producer leaves the smaller fruits for him 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.330
 but already the ants he apply poison 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.520
 found my agent to kill me because 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.890
 ant that someone giving here 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.660
 a garment between right and spoils 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.880
 and for those who do not know how to eat the fruit 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.930
 Your book is going to explain to us. He 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:41.740
 how do you do 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:45.550
 cut off 4,501 waits until Christmas 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:49.570
 it only red from the extensive botton that 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.910
 does not want to be white in the capital as well 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.610
 can be planted in pots and 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.270
 fruits in the first year after planting 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.270
 of the piles
