east of spawn to these coordinates over

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.600 
east of spawn to these coordinates over
here<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.680> actually<00:00:43.950> find<00:00:44.100> yourself<00:00:44.250> an

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
here you actually find yourself an

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.209 
here you actually find yourself an
aboveground<00:00:44.940> end<00:00:45.809> portal<00:00:46.140> early<00:00:46.469> step<00:00:46.739> it's

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
aboveground end portal early step it's

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.650 
aboveground end portal early step it's
it's<00:00:47.550> star<00:00:47.730> spot<00:00:47.940> ground<00:00:48.120> actually<00:00:48.300> can't<00:00:48.570> be

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
it's star spot ground actually can't be

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360 
it's star spot ground actually can't be
fully<00:00:48.809> above<00:00:48.989> grandma<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> closest

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
fully above grandma this is the closest

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.709 
fully above grandma this is the closest
to<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> ground<00:00:50.760> level<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.120> could<00:00:51.300> get<00:00:51.480> an<00:00:51.570> end

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
to the ground level you could get an end

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.869 
to the ground level you could get an end
portal<00:00:51.989> ax<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.320> if<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.309> pick<00:00:53.430> down<00:00:53.579> one

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
portal ax and if you just pick down one

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.250 
portal ax and if you just pick down one
block<00:00:54.059> from<00:00:54.180> an<00:00:54.390> affair<00:00:54.660> obviously<00:00:54.989> want<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
block from an affair obviously want to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.630 
block from an affair obviously want to
be<00:00:55.320> careful<00:00:55.590> work<00:00:55.890> try<00:00:56.160> doing<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.430> one<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
be careful work try doing in one of the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.310 
be careful work try doing in one of the
corners<00:00:56.969> will<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.149> my<00:00:57.270> recommendation<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:58.079> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
corners will be my recommendation if you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.319 
corners will be my recommendation if you
look<00:00:58.440> down<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.949> couple<00:00:59.190> blocks<00:00:59.579> then<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
look down just a couple blocks then you

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.549 
look down just a couple blocks then you
will<00:01:00.449> find<00:01:00.660> opens<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> couple<00:01:01.170> blocks<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
will find opens a couple blocks in the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.689 
will find opens a couple blocks in the
corners<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.100> dig<00:01:02.219> down<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.520> block

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
corners but if you dig down one block

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.310 
corners but if you dig down one block
from<00:01:02.730> anywhere<00:01:03.030> else<00:01:03.180> you'll<00:01:03.840> find<00:01:04.049> yourself

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
from anywhere else you'll find yourself

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.780 
from anywhere else you'll find yourself
in<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> end<00:01:04.949> portal<00:01:05.339> room<00:01:05.460> which<00:01:05.640> is

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
in the end portal room which is

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.130 
in the end portal room which is
ridiculous<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.450> completely<00:01:06.780> cut<00:01:06.900> from<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
ridiculous it's completely cut from the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.210 
ridiculous it's completely cut from the
rest<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> stronghold<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.040> is

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
rest of the stronghold which is

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.280 
rest of the stronghold which is
beneficial<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.760> some<00:01:08.970> ways<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.080> means<00:01:10.200> you

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
beneficial in some ways and it means you

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.020 
beneficial in some ways and it means you
can<00:01:10.439> get<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> end<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.280> soon<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:11.640> possible

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
can get to the end as soon as possible

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.850 
can get to the end as soon as possible
in<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.210> world<00:01:12.450> because<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> just
