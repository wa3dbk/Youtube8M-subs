 the Bulgarian history museum has 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.410
 now something unusual to show 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.139
 vampire skeletons have been discovered 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.540
 after the exhumation of the remains and 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.470
 two individuals buried for more than 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.900
 800 years Bulgarian archaeologists digging 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.119
 in a monastery near the city sopol 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.789
 discover skeletons that have been 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.769
 submitted to the pagan ritual for 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.869
 prevent men from becoming 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.949
 in vampires plays pro durban worst form 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.690
 to prevent suspects from 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.340
 to turn vampires into a group of 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.680
 brave men reopened their graves 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.079
 the middle of the night and pierced the bodies with 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.790
 iron a rod of wood bars 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.540
 iron were used for vampires 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.039
 Richer 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.320
 the internet is not interesting cases 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.969
 of vampires were relatively rare 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.860
 because in their the pol where they were 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.870
 unearthed 700 and Christian cultures 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.460
 we found only two evidences 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.190
 of manipulation against christian vampires 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.260
 I call yesterday the head of the museum said 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.720
 that vampires did not need to 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.670
 long fangs to drink blood there is no 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.659
 evidence that vampires had teeth 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.729
 longer 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.710
 let's think logically it really 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.900
 would need longer teeth to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.119
 drinking blood from the vein or would it be possible 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.070
 do this with the normal teeth of 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.290
 explained that these people 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.570
 were considered bad during their 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.060
 life and people thought that they 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.310
 could become vampires after death 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.490
 bulgaria is bordered by romania 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.650
 land of the noble platex vlad o 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.930
 it was associated with the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.820
 Dracula character he was not a 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.640
 vampire but became famous for his 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.829
 cruelty and inspired the fictitious name of 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.430
 dracula created by white writer 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.600
 stocker the discovery of skeletons 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.420
 occurred during excavations carried out 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.030
 near a church which suggests that 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.520
 could have been second aristocrats 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.860
 the archaeologists is this is the first time 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.340
 that the vampire burial is discovered in 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.340
 their powder
