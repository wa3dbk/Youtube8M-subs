00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.750
 everyone who owed who liked the 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.350
 Christmas 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.430
 but the game that lived just north of 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.280
 villa who did not the grinch hated the 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.640
 Christmas entire Christmas season 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.590
 now do not ask me why and nobody 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.410
 he knows very well nothing 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.860
 it could be your head that was not very 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.410
 well adjusted could be their best 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.040
 shoes that were a bit fair 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:55.720
 but I think that is the most obvious reason 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.910
 was that his heart was twice as much 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.150
 little 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.890
 the grinch hated those who 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.830
 caves they could only produce I teach them 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.770
 they meanwhile decorated the city 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.909
 those happy ones are already hanging 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.640
 Christmas socks he said 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.140
 Christmas is tomorrow but stop the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.320
 Christmas to come is practically here 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.890
 because tomorrow I know that all children 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.310
 and girls will wake up early and with 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.869
 the gifts obtained will make noise noise 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.869
 and noise 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.770
 and then they will celebrate it with roasted meat and 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.329
 flan wherever 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:51.120
 with a huge banquet that will come from a 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.380
 end of one table to another 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.030
 and later 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:02.740
 something I detest more 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.580
 they will all come together to warm a wine 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.580
 cynical 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.980
 I must have a life but like 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.510
 and then he received an idea 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:23.310
 a magnificent and 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.310
 the gray received a very bad idea 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.980
 today I do not know what he does 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.640
 I'll make a quick costume for Santa 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.300
 we go 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.750
 and the greens became a disguise of santa 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.080
 claus in the blink of an eye what 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.450
 the only thing I needed now was man the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.720
 fine and if I look around but 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.270
 I did not have any reindeer but like the 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:01.100
 incident an idea occurred to him 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.770
 He called his dog - and took a horn that 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.850
 he had remained on the ground and tied it to 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:12.380
 the head to look like a challenge 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:15.890
 then he picked up his monkey sled by hand to 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:21.260
 I took it and put a few sacks 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:24.160
 old and finer greens came out from his 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.390
 cave towards villa who 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.900
 all the windows were reigning 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.930
 peace and silence all those who 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.440
 they were having happy salaries the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.130
 grinch stood in the first house went up 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.030
 up to the roof and slipped inside to 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.030
 through the fireplace 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.510
 then when the green was already 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:55.470
 inside the house he thought if santa nails 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.319
 you can give all these gifts in a 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.709
 only night I can remove them in one 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.860
 only night began to remove all the 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:09.620
 Decorations of a phrase 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:12.020
 from socks to gifts on the greens 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.150
 was the sets with more laughter 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.250
 malevolent 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.370
 once done this he went to the kitchen 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.360
 opened the fridge and I remove the food 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.590
 for the feast of tomorrow 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.310
 I was left alone and almost everything was missing 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.010
 the christmas tree 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.500
 while I was trying to get out 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:38.030
 Through the file there was already a 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.790
 small that the one who was flummoxed and 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.840
 He asked the grings as if he were a saint 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:49.100
 claus santa claus you make giant the 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:52.310
 Christmas tree is very cunning he 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.160
 he invented a quick lie that says 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.860
 I want I am taking this tree 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.850
 because he has a light bulb on this side 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.950
 that does not work - I'll take my workshop and 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.669
 tomorrow morning you will not have 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:10.790
 arranged right here and cindy to look for a 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:14.540
 glass of water took it very quiet and 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:17.090
 went to sleep the greens was accompanied by a 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.030
 once done this the green continued 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.620
 taking the Christmas net and the mother-of-pearl 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:28.660
 and in the house he left only one crumb of bread 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:32.530
 that not even a mouse could eat it 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.560
 he did the same in the other houses he 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.110
 He wore everything and only left one cheek 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.249
 of bread that I could not even eat a 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.249
 mouse 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:45.540
 if he carried all his sets in the 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:49.200
 bags that he had brought in the first 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:53.960
 all who was asleep all who 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:57.570
 he was relaxed he went up in his cave and there 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.650
 He started climbing the sled to the summit of 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:03.509
 the mountain 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:06.850
 I was going to dawn I had the sleigh 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:09.700
 hanging from the mountain prepared for 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:13.630
 fall to the precipice 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:17.800
 but before the grinch wanted to hear the 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:20.680
 weeping and crying from the quines but for 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:26.640
 his surprise did not hear that began to 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.640
 listen to a Christmas song 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.850
 that sound I do not know what the 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:37.400
 who have taken the gifts from them 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:41.060
 I have removed the decorations 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:46.210
 then the grinch turned his head towards 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:49.920
 villa turned and saw them in cabbage singing 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:54.790
 it was a big surprise for them 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.580
 then the grinch saw everything clear 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:01.150
 perhaps 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:05.580
 Christmas I do not know with three just understand 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:09.090
 maybe Christmas at the best 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.090
 means something more 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:17.420
 and what happened afterwards those who 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:20.450
 they affirm that the same day the heart of the 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.569
 greens grew three times more than 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.289
 normal 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:28.409
 he began to lower his sleigh with all the 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:33.289
 christmas tackle touching a big 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:33.289
 trumpet to warn you have 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:42.509
 and it was the same as in short the rose beat 

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:42.509
 of the feast
