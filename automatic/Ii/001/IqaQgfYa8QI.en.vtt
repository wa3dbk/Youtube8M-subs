00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.630 

and<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.230> takes<00:01:12.410> your<00:01:12.530> pulse<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:13.190> my<00:01:13.310> pulse<00:01:13.520> is

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
and it takes your pulse so my pulse is

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.330 
and it takes your pulse so my pulse is
79<00:01:14.180> beats<00:01:14.660> per<00:01:14.840> minute<00:01:15.110> at<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:15.290> time<00:01:15.500> but

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
79 beats per minute at this time but

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.800 
79 beats per minute at this time but
this<00:01:16.460> particular<00:01:16.670> watch<00:01:17.120> can<00:01:17.360> do<00:01:17.480> a<00:01:17.510> lot<00:01:17.780> more

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
this particular watch can do a lot more

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.140 
this particular watch can do a lot more
than<00:01:18.230> just<00:01:18.260> take<00:01:18.560> your<00:01:18.740> pulse<00:01:18.920> now<00:01:19.790> one<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.030> the

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
than just take your pulse now one of the

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.400 
than just take your pulse now one of the
first<00:01:20.300> things<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:20.690> noticed<00:01:21.080> about<00:01:21.170> this

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
first things that I noticed about this

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.670 
first things that I noticed about this
watch<00:01:21.710> is<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.400> alarm<00:01:22.790> setting<00:01:23.540> has<00:01:23.780> actually

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
watch is the alarm setting has actually

watch is the alarm setting has actually
you<00:01:24.830> can<00:01:24.950> set<00:01:25.130> up<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.250> five<00:01:25.490> alarms<00:01:26.000> with<00:01:26.180> this

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
you can set up to five alarms with this

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.470 
you can set up to five alarms with this
thing<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.200> there's<00:01:27.410> one<00:01:27.620> two<00:01:27.860> three<00:01:27.890> four<00:01:28.480> five

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
thing so there's one two three four five

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.300 
thing so there's one two three four five
different<00:01:29.930> alarms<00:01:30.170> each<00:01:30.530> one<00:01:30.740> can<00:01:30.890> be<00:01:30.950> set

down press the mode button again and you
get<00:01:36.650> to<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.860> chronograph<00:01:37.310> now<00:01:38.120> this<00:01:38.330> is<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.480> not

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
get to the chronograph now this is a not

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.410 
get to the chronograph now this is a not
just<00:01:39.230> a<00:01:39.320> regular<00:01:39.650> stopwatch<00:01:40.280> it<00:01:41.000> works<00:01:41.210> as<00:01:41.390> a

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
just a regular stopwatch it works as a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.110 
just a regular stopwatch it works as a
regular<00:01:41.660> stopwatch<00:01:42.380> but<00:01:42.620> it<00:01:42.710> also<00:01:42.860> has<00:01:43.220> the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
alarms so that's why they're less than a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.310 
alarms so that's why they're less than a
second<00:02:40.390> okay<00:02:41.390> we<00:02:41.540> hit<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.780> mode<00:02:41.930> button<00:02:42.260> again

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
second okay we hit the mode button again

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
and we get to the exercise mode now this

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.570 
and we get to the exercise mode now this
is<00:02:44.840> one<00:02:45.110> of<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.320> most<00:02:45.590> feature<00:02:45.890> packed<00:02:46.040> modes

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
is one of the most feature packed modes

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.880 
is one of the most feature packed modes
there<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:47.000> because<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.540> allows<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:48.050> to<00:02:48.320> count

there is because it allows you to count

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.400 
there is because it allows you to count
the<00:02:49.100> calories<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.640> burn<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.330> count<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.110> fat

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
the calories you burn and count the fat

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.990 
the calories you burn and count the fat
in<00:02:51.650> grams<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.310> burn<00:02:52.520> during<00:02:52.790> a

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
rate so it's got different sets of data

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.219 
rate so it's got different sets of data
to<00:04:39.180> show<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.419> after<00:04:39.780> you're<00:04:39.900> done<00:04:39.990> with<00:04:40.110> your
