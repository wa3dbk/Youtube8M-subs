sniper<00:00:10.500> rifles<00:00:11.389> in<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.509> way<00:00:12.660> sniper<00:00:13.080> if<00:00:13.259> it's

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
sniper rifles in a way sniper if it's

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.099 
sniper rifles in a way sniper if it's
actually<00:00:13.799> easier<00:00:14.160> time<00:00:14.400> with<00:00:14.429> because<00:00:15.109> you

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
actually easier time with because you

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.620 
actually easier time with because you
just<00:00:16.289> have<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:16.650> shot<00:00:16.859> did<00:00:17.699> worry<00:00:17.970> about<00:00:18.029> you

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
just have one shot did worry about you

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.510 
just have one shot did worry about you
have<00:00:18.750> one<00:00:18.990> shot<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> nail<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:20.189> don't<00:00:20.369> really

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
have one shot to nail you don't really

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.279 
have one shot to nail you don't really
have<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.789> care<00:00:21.090> about<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.510> recoil<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
have to care about the recoil of the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.439 
have to care about the recoil of the
guts<00:00:22.590> up<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.920> down<00:00:23.130> over<00:00:23.369> all<00:00:23.910> other<00:00:24.119> place

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
guts up and down over all other place

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.200 
guts up and down over all other place
you<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.830> shoot<00:00:25.830> one<00:00:26.070> bullet<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.550> hit<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
you just shoot one bullet and hit it and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.769 
you just shoot one bullet and hit it and
kill<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.990> although<00:00:29.179> it's<00:00:30.179> not<00:00:30.269> that

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
kill it with it although it's not that

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.680 
kill it with it although it's not that
easy<00:00:30.990> because<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:32.550> set<00:00:32.790> taking<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> into

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
easy because you all set taking the into

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
easy because you all set taking the into
consideration<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.559> bullet<00:00:35.130> velocity<00:00:35.250> how

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
consideration the bullet velocity how

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.900 
consideration the bullet velocity how
the<00:00:36.180> enemy<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.719> moving<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.649> distance<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.370> so

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the enemy is moving the distance and so

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.049 
the enemy is moving the distance and so
on<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.239> let's<00:00:40.230> talk<00:00:40.739> about<00:00:40.800> will<00:00:41.160> drop<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.550> like

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
on so let's talk about will drop is like

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.910 
on so let's talk about will drop is like
the<00:00:42.540> most<00:00:42.690> obvious<00:00:42.930> thing<00:00:43.290> when<00:00:43.530> talking

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the most obvious thing when talking

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.020 
the most obvious thing when talking
about<00:00:44.040> aiming<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.879> sniper<00:00:45.629> evel's<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
about aiming with the sniper evel's and

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
about aiming with the sniper evel's and
to<00:00:48.030> start<00:00:48.210> off<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.780> don't<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.289> shoot

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
to start off with I don't really shoot

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.229 
to start off with I don't really shoot
at<00:00:49.770> enemies<00:00:49.920> above<00:00:50.399> twenty<00:00:50.670> fifty<00:00:50.940> meters

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
at enemies above twenty fifty meters

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.080 
at enemies above twenty fifty meters
it's<00:00:51.660> not<00:00:51.840> worth<00:00:52.079> my<00:00:52.260> time<00:00:52.640> except<00:00:53.640> when<00:00:53.730> they

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
it's not worth my time except when they

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.060 
it's not worth my time except when they
are<00:00:54.180> standing<00:00:54.360> still<00:00:54.719> then<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> might<00:00:55.230> pop<00:00:55.440> 12

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
are standing still then I might pop 12

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.400 
are standing still then I might pop 12
shot<00:00:56.280> at<00:00:56.460> them<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.570> miss<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.230> hit<00:00:58.379> I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
shot at them if I miss that if I hit I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.310 
shot at them if I miss that if I hit I
hit<00:00:58.649> de<00:00:58.829> mes<00:00:59.129> amis<00:00:59.280> I'm<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.210> gonna<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:01.199> to

hit de mes amis I'm not gonna like to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.130 
hit de mes amis I'm not gonna like to
keep<00:01:01.500> trying<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.039> they're<00:01:02.359> just<00:01:03.359> waste<00:01:03.840> my

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
keep trying and they're just waste my

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.429 
keep trying and they're just waste my
time<00:01:04.409> shooting<00:01:04.739> at<00:01:04.979> anyone<00:01:05.339> far<00:01:05.580> away<00:01:05.760> because

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
time shooting at anyone far away because

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.780 
time shooting at anyone far away because
they're<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.560> really<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.799> threat<00:01:08.100> anyway<00:01:08.369> if

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
they're not really a threat anyway if

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090 
they're not really a threat anyway if
there<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.390> sniper<00:01:09.689> far<00:01:10.080> away<00:01:10.260> then<00:01:10.500> just

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
there is a sniper far away then just

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.190 
there is a sniper far away then just
leaving<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.610> there<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.850> big<00:01:12.030> IFS<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.720> limb<00:01:12.900> put<00:01:13.110> in

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
leaving be there a big IFS a limb put in

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.300 
leaving be there a big IFS a limb put in
the<00:01:14.299> like<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.990> guess<00:01:16.350> operation<00:01:16.799> firestorm<00:01:17.009> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the like I guess operation firestorm is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
the like I guess operation firestorm is
the<00:01:17.400> most<00:01:17.549> obvious<00:01:17.729> choice<00:01:18.119> because<00:01:18.390> they're

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the most obvious choice because they're

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.929 
the most obvious choice because they're
on<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> heel<00:01:19.470> stick<00:01:19.830> or<00:01:20.159> mountains<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.790> guess

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
on the heel stick or mountains I guess

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880 
on the heel stick or mountains I guess
if<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.150> called<00:01:21.390> them<00:01:21.540> they<00:01:22.350> won't<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:22.710> do

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
if you called them they won't really do

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.200 
if you called them they won't really do
anything<00:01:23.130> maybe<00:01:23.369> they're<00:01:23.670> gonna<00:01:23.759> get<00:01:23.939> two

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
anything maybe they're gonna get two

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.380 
anything maybe they're gonna get two
kills<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.780> whole<00:01:24.960> game<00:01:25.170> that's<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:27.210> not

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
kills the whole game that's it so not

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.649 
kills the whole game that's it so not
really<00:01:27.630> worth<00:01:27.840> your<00:01:28.020> time<00:01:28.200> didn't<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:29.659> just

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
really worth your time didn't like just

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.539 
really worth your time didn't like just
focus<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.170> take<00:01:31.409> them<00:01:31.860> down<00:01:32.040> because<00:01:32.220> they

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
focus on take them down because they

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.420 
focus on take them down because they
won't<00:01:32.729> even<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.420> anything<00:01:34.520> but<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:37.409> way<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> aim

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
won't even do anything but the way I aim

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.060 
won't even do anything but the way I aim
for<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.820> better<00:01:39.420> drop<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.229> kind<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.920> take

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
for a better drop is that I kind of take

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.090 
for a better drop is that I kind of take
a<00:01:41.130> mental<00:01:41.520> picture<00:01:42.350> every<00:01:43.350> time<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.560> shoot<00:01:43.829> I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
a mental picture every time I shoot I

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.760 
a mental picture every time I shoot I
like<00:01:44.310> almost<00:01:45.270> yet<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.750> could<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.409> could<00:01:46.590> say

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
like almost yet we could you could say

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.460 
like almost yet we could you could say
that<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.100> take<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> mental<00:01:47.549> picture<00:01:47.610> because

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
that that take a mental picture because

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.649 
that that take a mental picture because
after<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:50.310> about<00:01:50.430> how<00:01:50.820> big<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.240> target<00:01:51.540> is

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
after I see about how big the target is

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.130 
after I see about how big the target is
and<00:01:52.549> because<00:01:53.549> I've<00:01:53.790> got<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.540> many<00:01:54.659> times<00:01:54.960> I

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and because I've got so many times I

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.160 
and because I've got so many times I
know<00:01:55.290> about<00:01:55.770> how<00:01:56.250> far<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.700> based<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
know about how far it is based on the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.760 
know about how far it is based on the
size<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> enemy<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.170> can't<00:02:01.439> really<00:02:01.590> tell

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
size of the enemy so I can't really tell

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.219 
size of the enemy so I can't really tell
you<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.159> 100<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.969> course<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.899> tell<00:02:04.079> now

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
you if it's 100 of course I can tell now

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.480 
you if it's 100 of course I can tell now
but<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.740> beginning<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.130> couldn't<00:02:05.399> really

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
but in the beginning I couldn't really

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.880 
but in the beginning I couldn't really
tell<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.729> towards<00:02:06.090> 120<00:02:06.840> millimeters<00:02:07.439> away<00:02:07.560> I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
tell if towards 120 millimeters away I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.029 
tell if towards 120 millimeters away I
just<00:02:08.550> saw<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.759> size<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> enemy<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.690> just

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
just saw the size of the enemy and just

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.220 
just saw the size of the enemy and just
roughly<00:02:11.039> aimed<00:02:11.310> where<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> thought<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.360> was<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
roughly aimed where I thought it was and

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.100 
roughly aimed where I thought it was and
through<00:02:14.230> experience<00:02:14.830> I've<00:02:15.160> learned<00:02:15.190> that

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
through experience I've learned that

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.530 
through experience I've learned that
it's<00:02:17.110> 150<00:02:18.040> meters<00:02:18.310> down<00:02:18.490> there<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.300> that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
it's 150 meters down there if it's that

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.180 
it's 150 meters down there if it's that
high<00:02:19.750> then<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.050> have<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.290> end<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.740> higher<00:02:20.980> on

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
high then I have to end that higher on

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.760 
high then I have to end that higher on
the<00:02:21.370> on<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.030> scope<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.510> if<00:02:23.290> you're<00:02:23.410> using<00:02:23.530> it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
the on the scope and if you're using it

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.860 
the on the scope and if you're using it
m4a<00:02:24.250> file<00:02:24.520> that's<00:02:24.880> my<00:02:25.090> favourite<00:02:25.480> favourite

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
m4a file that's my favourite favourite

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.440 
m4a file that's my favourite favourite
sniper<00:02:26.170> rifle<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.650> course<00:02:27.030> then<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.210> first

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
sniper rifle of course then the first

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.260 
sniper rifle of course then the first
dot<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.900> 250<00:02:29.500> meters<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.880> if<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.060> know<00:02:31.180> you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
dot is 250 meters so if you know you

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.180 
dot is 250 meters so if you know you
just<00:02:31.390> roughly<00:02:31.810> how<00:02:31.960> far<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.320> then<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.040> can

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
just roughly how far it is then you can

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.180 
just roughly how far it is then you can
adjust<00:02:33.280> according<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.240> first<00:02:34.450> dot<00:02:34.630> and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
adjust according to the first dot and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.260 
adjust according to the first dot and
like<00:02:36.190> i<00:02:36.220> said<00:02:36.370> i<00:02:36.490> don't<00:02:36.610> really<00:02:36.850> go<00:02:37.030> over<00:02:37.060> the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
like i said i don't really go over the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.640 
like i said i don't really go over the
first<00:02:37.480> off<00:02:37.660> because<00:02:37.990> i<00:02:38.110> don't<00:02:38.350> think<00:02:38.530> it's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
first off because i don't think it's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.680 
first off because i don't think it's
worth<00:02:38.830> my<00:02:39.040> time<00:02:39.220> it<00:02:39.580> gives<00:02:39.760> ya<00:02:39.970> like<00:02:40.420> i<00:02:40.450> said

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
worth my time it gives ya like i said

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.840 
worth my time it gives ya like i said
and<00:02:40.980> when<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.040> get<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.220> collect<00:02:42.580> closer

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
and when you get to collect closer

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.450 
and when you get to collect closer
ranges<00:02:43.300> such<00:02:43.480> as<00:02:43.720> below<00:02:44.440> 50<00:02:44.830> meters<00:02:45.160> or<00:02:45.190> so

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
ranges such as below 50 meters or so

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.370 
ranges such as below 50 meters or so
then<00:02:46.120> it's<00:02:46.270> more<00:02:46.450> like<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> just<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.990> point<00:02:47.260> and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
then it's more like a just a point and

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.720 
then it's more like a just a point and
click<00:02:47.440> game<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:48.010> just<00:02:48.160> point<00:02:48.460> at<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.640> enemy

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
click game you just point at the enemy

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.930 
click game you just point at the enemy
and<00:02:49.090> click<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.900> he<00:02:49.990> dies<00:02:50.200> if<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.920> aim<00:02:51.130> at<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
and click and he dies if you aim at the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.000 
and click and he dies if you aim at the
head<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.150> course<00:02:52.480> because<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.620> head<00:02:53.770> is<00:02:53.800> the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
head of course because the head is the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.260 
head of course because the head is the
main<00:02:54.160> target<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.640> shouldn't<00:02:54.910> aim<00:02:55.120> at

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
main target you shouldn't aim at

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.450 
main target you shouldn't aim at
anything<00:02:55.510> but<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.960> head<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:57.100> head<00:02:57.220> is<00:02:57.370> the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
anything but the head the head is the

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.950 
anything but the head the head is the
only<00:02:57.580> thing<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:58.180> could<00:02:58.360> shoot<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.720> should

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
only thing you could shoot you should

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.040 
only thing you could shoot you should
see<00:02:59.340> it's<00:03:00.340> kind<00:03:00.520> of<00:03:00.610> us<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:01.000> guess<00:03:01.480> I'm<00:03:01.600> kind<00:03:01.990> of

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
see it's kind of us I guess I'm kind of

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.840 
see it's kind of us I guess I'm kind of
a<00:03:02.080> strange<00:03:02.350> thing<00:03:02.710> because<00:03:02.890> when<00:03:03.490> I<00:03:03.580> see<00:03:03.760> an

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
a strange thing because when I see an

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.970 
a strange thing because when I see an
enemy<00:03:03.970> through<00:03:04.570> my<00:03:04.690> sniper<00:03:04.930> scope<00:03:05.230> then<00:03:05.500> the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
enemy through my sniper scope then the

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.130 
enemy through my sniper scope then the
whole<00:03:06.130> body<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.640> gone<00:03:07.060> pretty<00:03:07.570> much<00:03:07.720> i<00:03:07.900> just

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
whole body is gone pretty much i just

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.750

skied the head the head is the only
thing<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.120> see<00:03:10.300> because<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.780> my<00:03:10.960> target<00:03:11.320> I'm

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.390 
time then I'm not going to focus on
getting<00:03:28.960> in<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.230> head<00:03:29.380> because<00:03:29.560> it's<00:03:29.980> I'm

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
getting in the head because it's I'm

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.490 
getting in the head because it's I'm
gonna<00:03:30.610> kill<00:03:30.790> him<00:03:30.940> no<00:03:31.600> matter<00:03:31.810> if<00:03:32.050> I<00:03:32.110> shoot<00:03:32.290> in

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
gonna kill him no matter if I shoot in

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.230 
gonna kill him no matter if I shoot in
the<00:03:32.620> head<00:03:32.740> or<00:03:32.770> if<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.130> or<00:03:33.310> at<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.850> foot<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:34.030> him

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
the head or if it or at the foot of him

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.150 
the head or if it or at the foot of him
something<00:03:35.140> else<00:03:35.260> can<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.500> input<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.770> body<00:03:35.950> and

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
something else can I input the body and

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.370 
something else can I input the body and
yeah<00:03:36.820> just<00:03:37.180> kill<00:03:37.360> him<00:03:37.450> with<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.930> second<00:03:38.230> shot

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
yeah just kill him with the second shot

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.940 
yeah just kill him with the second shot
the<00:03:39.300> hottest<00:03:40.300> part<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.630> think<00:03:40.930> about<00:03:41.170> aiming

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
the hottest part of think about aiming

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.860 
the hottest part of think about aiming
with<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.160> sniper<00:03:42.460> Ephesus<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:43.030> shooting<00:03:43.750> as

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
with the sniper Ephesus that shooting as

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.590 
with the sniper Ephesus that shooting as
moving<00:03:44.110> targets<00:03:44.610> because<00:03:45.610> they<00:03:46.270> might<00:03:46.420> not

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
moving targets because they might not

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.030 
moving targets because they might not
even<00:03:46.720> keep<00:03:46.990> moving<00:03:47.350> they<00:03:47.620> must<00:03:47.860> stop

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
even keep moving they must stop

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.430 
even keep moving they must stop
eventually<00:03:48.340> or<00:03:48.940> just<00:03:49.510> just<00:03:50.020> when<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.230> about

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
eventually or just just when you about

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.530 
eventually or just just when you about
to<00:03:50.560> shoot<00:03:50.710> and<00:03:50.950> then<00:03:51.040> they've<00:03:51.250> stopped<00:03:51.460> so<00:03:52.420> you

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
to shoot and then they've stopped so you

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.000 
to shoot and then they've stopped so you
aim<00:03:52.690> in<00:03:52.840> front<00:03:53.020> of<00:03:53.080> him<00:03:53.170> then<00:03:53.350> good<00:03:53.560> economies

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
aim in front of him then good economies

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.840 
aim in front of him then good economies
or<00:03:54.570> if<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:55.690> just<00:03:55.740> decides<00:03:56.740> to<00:03:56.740> run<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.430> different

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
or if it just decides to run a different

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.060 
or if it just decides to run a different
way<00:03:57.970> different<00:03:58.510> direction<00:03:59.140> just<00:03:59.560> move<00:03:59.920> the

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
way different direction just move the

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.520 
way different direction just move the
outer<00:04:00.160> out<00:04:00.370> of<00:04:00.520> toil<00:04:00.760> of<00:04:00.940> your<00:04:01.090> bullet<00:04:01.530> not

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
outer out of toil of your bullet not

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.250 
outer out of toil of your bullet not
really<00:04:02.800> anything<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.400> can<00:04:03.580> about<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:03.970> and

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
really anything you can about it and

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.200 
really anything you can about it and
because<00:04:05.260> it's<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.890> have<00:04:06.040> about<00:04:06.220> just<00:04:07.150> about

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
because it's you have about just about

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.030 
because it's you have about just about
over<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.720> second<00:04:08.170> before<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:08.530> can<00:04:08.680> shoot<00:04:08.830> it<00:04:08.950> a

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
over a second before you can shoot it a

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.580 
over a second before you can shoot it a
second<00:04:09.370> time<00:04:09.400> maybe<00:04:10.360> even<00:04:10.660> more<00:04:10.870> if<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.140> have

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
second time maybe even more if you have

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.620 
second time maybe even more if you have
to<00:04:11.710> take<00:04:11.920> some<00:04:12.220> like<00:04:12.820> another<00:04:13.030> second<00:04:13.480> just<00:04:13.600> to

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
to take some like another second just to

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.750 
to take some like another second just to
get<00:04:13.810> their<00:04:13.960> aim<00:04:14.080> right<00:04:14.470> again<00:04:14.770> then<00:04:15.640> the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
get their aim right again then the

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.670 
get their aim right again then the
enemies<00:04:16.060> can<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.270> know<00:04:16.600> that<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:17.380> are<00:04:17.530> shooting

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
enemies can I know that you are shooting

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.810 
enemies can I know that you are shooting
a<00:04:17.920> thing<00:04:18.100> because<00:04:18.280> it's<00:04:18.520> going<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.760> get

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
a thing because it's going to get

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.599 
a thing because it's going to get
suppressed<00:04:19.150> properly<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:19.960> then<00:04:20.430> he's<00:04:21.430> going

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
suppressed properly and then he's going

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.700 
suppressed properly and then he's going
to<00:04:21.700> try<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.030> run<00:04:22.210> away<00:04:22.240> from<00:04:22.480> you<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:22.990> you

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
to try and run away from you and you

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.110 
to try and run away from you and you
problem<00:04:24.160> not<00:04:24.310> forget<00:04:24.669> to<00:04:24.700> me

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
problem not forget to me

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.490 
problem not forget to me
it's<00:04:26.120> something<00:04:26.480> I<00:04:26.540> struggle<00:04:26.690> with<00:04:26.930> a<00:04:27.110> lot<00:04:27.230> and

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
it's something I struggle with a lot and

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.680 
it's something I struggle with a lot and
it's<00:04:27.920> very<00:04:28.220> hard<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.490> get<00:04:28.640> better<00:04:28.820> at<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.060> you

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
it's very hard to get better at it you

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.870 
it's very hard to get better at it you
just<00:04:29.900> have<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.110> keep<00:04:30.320> trying<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.520> problem

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
just have to keep trying and the problem

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.220 
just have to keep trying and the problem
with<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.030> is<00:04:32.180> that<00:04:32.330> it's<00:04:32.750> almost<00:04:33.020> like<00:04:33.200> a

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
with it is that it's almost like a

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.020 
with it is that it's almost like a
guessing<00:04:33.470> game<00:04:33.620> sometimes<00:04:34.430> they're<00:04:34.910> gonna

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
guessing game sometimes they're gonna

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.700 
guessing game sometimes they're gonna
stop<00:04:35.300> sometimes<00:04:35.810> they're<00:04:35.960> not<00:04:35.990> sometimes

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
stop sometimes they're not sometimes

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.640 
stop sometimes they're not sometimes
going<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.040> keep<00:04:37.190> going<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.610> same<00:04:37.790> direction

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
going to keep going the same direction

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.790 
going to keep going the same direction
eventually<00:04:39.650> young<00:04:39.830> is<00:04:40.040> going<00:04:40.700> to<00:04:40.790> learn<00:04:40.940> the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
eventually young is going to learn the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.920 
eventually young is going to learn the
patterns<00:04:42.800> of<00:04:43.160> how<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.400> move<00:04:43.730> like<00:04:44.570> if<00:04:44.720> they're

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
patterns of how the move like if they're

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.570 
patterns of how the move like if they're
gonna<00:04:45.350> cross<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.740> road<00:04:45.920> and<00:04:46.160> you<00:04:46.250> have<00:04:46.400> no

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
gonna cross the road and you have no

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.280 
gonna cross the road and you have no
other<00:04:46.700> stairs<00:04:47.300> on<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.540> other<00:04:47.810> side<00:04:47.990> of<00:04:48.020> road

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
other stairs on the other side of road

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.600 
other stairs on the other side of road
them<00:04:48.500> they're<00:04:48.740> probably<00:04:49.010> going<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.310> go<00:04:49.430> there

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
them they're probably going to go there

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.050 
them they're probably going to go there
don't<00:04:49.940> leave<00:04:50.270> stay<00:04:50.450> in<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.870> open<00:04:52.060> but

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
don't leave stay in the open but

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.880 
don't leave stay in the open but
sometimes<00:04:53.510> they<00:04:53.720> just<00:04:53.960> stay<00:04:54.350> in<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.590> open

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
sometimes they just stay in the open

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.480 
sometimes they just stay in the open
because<00:04:55.040> place<00:04:55.760> around<00:04:56.060> them<00:04:56.270> you<00:04:56.480> just<00:04:57.490> it's

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
because place around them you just it's

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.270 
because place around them you just it's
a<00:04:58.580> very<00:04:58.790> difficult<00:04:59.360> thing<00:04:59.690> to<00:04:59.750> learn<00:04:59.960> and

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
a very difficult thing to learn and

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.310 
a very difficult thing to learn and
that's<00:05:01.280> about<00:05:01.430> it<00:05:01.550> though<00:05:01.730> I<00:05:02.180> don't<00:05:02.990> think<00:05:03.080> I

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
that's about it though I don't think I

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.340 
that's about it though I don't think I
had<00:05:03.470> anything<00:05:03.500> else<00:05:04.100> on<00:05:04.370> accuracy<00:05:04.730> if<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.420> if

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
had anything else on accuracy if you if

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.720 
had anything else on accuracy if you if
there's<00:05:06.620> something<00:05:06.800> obvious<00:05:07.250> that<00:05:07.400> i<00:05:07.430> missed

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
there's something obvious that i missed

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.060 
there's something obvious that i missed
then<00:05:08.060> just<00:05:08.240> let<00:05:08.450> me<00:05:08.540> know<00:05:08.690> and<00:05:08.930> this<00:05:09.800> one

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
then just let me know and this one

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.500 
then just let me know and this one
subject<00:05:10.310> that<00:05:10.520> it<00:05:10.670> didn't<00:05:11.090> really<00:05:11.210> talk<00:05:11.450> about

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
subject that it didn't really talk about

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.140 
subject that it didn't really talk about
in<00:05:11.870> that<00:05:11.960> sensitivity<00:05:12.820> that's<00:05:13.820> because

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
in that sensitivity that's because

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.120 
in that sensitivity that's because
sensitivity<00:05:14.750> is<00:05:14.810> so<00:05:14.990> individual<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:15.710> i<00:05:15.890> don't

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
sensitivity is so individual and i don't

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.790 
sensitivity is so individual and i don't
really<00:05:16.430> i<00:05:16.730> can<00:05:17.630> tell<00:05:17.840> you<00:05:17.960> how<00:05:18.170> what<00:05:18.470> is<00:05:18.620> this

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
really i can tell you how what is this

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.740 
really i can tell you how what is this
david<00:05:19.040> you<00:05:19.220> if<00:05:19.340> you'd<00:05:19.520> use<00:05:19.700> because<00:05:19.970> that's

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
david you if you'd use because that's

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.510 
david you if you'd use because that's
not<00:05:20.870> might<00:05:21.350> not<00:05:21.530> be<00:05:21.740> their<00:05:21.950> perfect<00:05:22.160> fit<00:05:22.490> for

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
not might not be their perfect fit for

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.700 
not might not be their perfect fit for
you<00:05:22.670> at<00:05:22.820> all<00:05:22.970> you<00:05:23.840> have<00:05:23.960> to<00:05:24.050> try<00:05:24.260> it<00:05:24.290> up<00:05:24.500> for

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
you at all you have to try it up for

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.810 
you at all you have to try it up for
yourself<00:05:24.770> and<00:05:25.130> eventually<00:05:25.550> you're<00:05:25.670> going<00:05:25.760> to

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
yourself and eventually you're going to

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.850 
yourself and eventually you're going to
learn<00:05:25.940> it<00:05:26.060> and<00:05:26.660> figure<00:05:27.230> out<00:05:27.260> what's<00:05:27.620> bet<00:05:27.830> for

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
learn it and figure out what's bet for

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.730 
learn it and figure out what's bet for
you<00:05:28.210> just<00:05:29.210> try<00:05:29.450> and<00:05:29.570> pay<00:05:30.080> for<00:05:30.260> a<00:05:30.320> while<00:05:30.470> i'll

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
you just try and pay for a while i'll

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.580 
you just try and pay for a while i'll
just<00:05:31.060> play<00:05:32.060> some<00:05:32.270> more<00:05:32.390> what<00:05:33.170> you<00:05:33.290> do<00:05:33.410> like

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
just play some more what you do like

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.920 
just play some more what you do like
better<00:05:33.800> higher<00:05:34.370> lower<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:34.970> just<00:05:35.480> try<00:05:35.870> and

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
better higher lower and just try and

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.800 
better higher lower and just try and
find<00:05:36.230> the<00:05:36.380> perfect<00:05:36.560> balance<00:05:36.860> for<00:05:37.070> you<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:38.570> i'm

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
find the perfect balance for you and i'm

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.220 
find the perfect balance for you and i'm
running<00:05:39.290> fairly<00:05:40.070> low<00:05:40.340> i<00:05:40.370> guess<00:05:40.700> i<00:05:41.140> think<00:05:42.140> i

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
running fairly low i guess i think i

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.790 
running fairly low i guess i think i
have<00:05:42.260> about<00:05:42.620> 800<00:05:43.070> DPI<00:05:44.140> if<00:05:45.140> i<00:05:45.290> drag<00:05:45.470> my<00:05:45.530> mouse

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
have about 800 DPI if i drag my mouse

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.960 
have about 800 DPI if i drag my mouse
about<00:05:46.330> 15<00:05:47.330> 20<00:05:47.480> meters<00:05:47.980> centimeters<00:05:48.980> of<00:05:49.550> course

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
about 15 20 meters centimeters of course

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.810 
about 15 20 meters centimeters of course
across<00:05:50.840> my<00:05:51.080> mousepad<00:05:51.290> i<00:05:51.560> get<00:05:51.830> about<00:05:52.010> the<00:05:52.250> 360

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
across my mousepad i get about the 360

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.950 
across my mousepad i get about the 360
180<00:05:53.660> so<00:05:53.930> i<00:05:53.990> can<00:05:54.140> turn<00:05:54.260> now<00:05:54.470> we're<00:05:54.710> very<00:05:54.860> easy<00:05:55.280> I

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
180 so i can turn now we're very easy I

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.650 
180 so i can turn now we're very easy I
I<00:05:56.960> have<00:05:57.230> no<00:05:57.410> chance<00:05:57.680> to<00:05:57.770> do<00:05:57.950> a<00:05:57.980> 360<00:05:58.580> I<00:05:58.790> don't

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
I have no chance to do a 360 I don't

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.560 
I have no chance to do a 360 I don't
have<00:05:59.780> any<00:06:00.140> reason<00:06:00.440> to<00:06:00.650> do<00:06:00.830> it<00:06:00.860> either<00:06:01.070> but<00:06:01.570> yeah

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
have any reason to do it either but yeah

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.220 
have any reason to do it either but yeah
that's<00:06:02.990> about<00:06:03.110> how<00:06:03.590> high<00:06:04.250> my<00:06:04.400> sensitivities

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
that's about how high my sensitivities

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.550 
that's about how high my sensitivities
although<00:06:06.230> I<00:06:06.260> guess<00:06:06.460> and<00:06:08.140> you<00:06:09.140> just<00:06:09.290> have<00:06:09.470> to

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
although I guess and you just have to

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.930 
although I guess and you just have to
try<00:06:09.740> it<00:06:09.770> out<00:06:09.920> an<00:06:10.100> imaginary<00:06:10.430> cuz<00:06:10.640> I'm<00:06:10.760> gonna

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
try it out an imaginary cuz I'm gonna

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.500 
try it out an imaginary cuz I'm gonna
find<00:06:11.180> your<00:06:11.420> perfect<00:06:11.900> balance<00:06:12.460> and<00:06:13.510> something

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
find your perfect balance and something

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.060 
find your perfect balance and something
that<00:06:14.540> could<00:06:14.900> be<00:06:15.050> interesting<00:06:15.320> that<00:06:15.650> is<00:06:15.800> it's

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
that could be interesting that is it's

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.210 
that could be interesting that is it's
that<00:06:16.310> I'm<00:06:16.550> always<00:06:16.910> gone<00:06:17.420> lower<00:06:17.950> ever<00:06:18.950> since

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
that I'm always gone lower ever since

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.180 
that I'm always gone lower ever since
the<00:06:19.340> starter<00:06:19.820> do<00:06:20.530> playing<00:06:21.530> properly<00:06:21.980> I<00:06:22.010> guess

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
the starter do playing properly I guess

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.310 
the starter do playing properly I guess
I<00:06:22.370> did<00:06:22.550> always<00:06:22.790> gone<00:06:23.180> down<00:06:23.390> because<00:06:23.630> it<00:06:23.990> feels

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
I did always gone down because it feels

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.950 
I did always gone down because it feels
better<00:06:24.590> when<00:06:24.710> I<00:06:24.920> have<00:06:24.980> lower<00:06:25.250> but<00:06:26.030> note<00:06:26.240> that<00:06:26.270> I

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
better when I have lower but note that I

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.440 
better when I have lower but note that I
don't<00:06:27.650> have<00:06:27.800> too<00:06:28.010> low<00:06:28.160> because<00:06:28.370> I<00:06:28.730> still<00:06:29.300> won't

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
don't have too low because I still won't

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.170 
don't have too low because I still won't
be<00:06:29.690> able<00:06:29.720> to<00:06:29.960> turn<00:06:30.140> 180<00:06:30.590> very<00:06:31.010> fast<00:06:31.280> and<00:06:31.520> one

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
be able to turn 180 very fast and one

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.460 
be able to turn 180 very fast and one
night<00:06:32.360> is<00:06:32.510> cleaner<00:06:32.750> a<00:06:32.870> crucial<00:06:33.710> point<00:06:33.920> because

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
night is cleaner a crucial point because

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.340 
night is cleaner a crucial point because
that's<00:06:36.470> when<00:06:36.650> he<00:06:36.710> turn<00:06:36.889> around<00:06:37.090> pretty<00:06:38.090> much

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
that's when he turn around pretty much

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.950 
that's when he turn around pretty much
it's<00:06:39.350> not<00:06:39.560> really<00:06:39.770> any<00:06:40.009> other<00:06:40.940> reason<00:06:41.389> I<00:06:41.539> just

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
it's not really any other reason I just

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.330 
it's not really any other reason I just
want<00:06:42.139> to<00:06:42.199> be<00:06:42.289> able<00:06:42.320> to<00:06:42.530> turn<00:06:42.680> on<00:06:42.740> as<00:06:43.009> fast<00:06:43.160> as

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
want to be able to turn on as fast as

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.680 
want to be able to turn on as fast as
possible<00:06:43.400> because<00:06:43.880> sometimes<00:06:44.270> you<00:06:44.360> get<00:06:44.479> shot

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
possible because sometimes you get shot

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.080 
possible because sometimes you get shot
behind<00:06:44.930> and<00:06:45.259> just<00:06:45.289> want<00:06:45.710> to<00:06:45.880> pinpoint<00:06:46.880> him

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
behind and just want to pinpoint him

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.930 
behind and just want to pinpoint him
instantly<00:06:47.990> you<00:06:48.199> don't<00:06:48.380> have<00:06:49.130> to<00:06:49.250> drag<00:06:49.820> your

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
instantly you don't have to drag your

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.550 
instantly you don't have to drag your
mouse<00:06:50.000> several<00:06:50.509> times<00:06:50.750> and<00:06:50.900> eventually<00:06:51.020> gonna

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
mouse several times and eventually gonna

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.640 
mouse several times and eventually gonna
get<00:06:51.800> around<00:06:52.039> to<00:06:52.280> him<00:06:52.870> and<00:06:53.870> yet<00:06:54.020> that<00:06:54.289> concludes

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
get around to him and yet that concludes

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.100 
get around to him and yet that concludes
my<00:06:54.949> segment<00:06:55.580> on<00:06:55.759> accuracy<00:06:56.120> I<00:06:56.389> might<00:06:56.750> go<00:06:56.900> follow

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
my segment on accuracy I might go follow

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.749 
my segment on accuracy I might go follow
up<00:06:57.229> in<00:06:57.350> the<00:06:57.440> future<00:06:57.800> if<00:06:57.949> I<00:06:58.039> have<00:06:58.190> some<00:06:58.400> new

up in the future if I have some new
