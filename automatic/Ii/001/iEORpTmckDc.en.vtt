00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.950
 the month of August has arrived and that 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.180
 means time for a new one 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.350
 telekoopwijzer 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.150
 I had a special return from vacation 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.009
 but you can just use it 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.470
 look under your palm tree or where you then 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.000
 I am on vacation in this video 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.439
 of course the highlights of the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.239
 go through your list 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.800
 it is quite a number his number 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.599
 new devices announced despite 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.099
 the vacation is fun 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.439
 and you were allowed the complete list 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.320
 want to read then that is of course possible 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.660
 You can find it in the map above 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.940
 or in the description of this video well 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.180
 nice new device has been announced is the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.190
 motorola motokey 2015 or the motor gee 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.170
 third generation that you will want to call 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.540
 that case the new engine is gee met 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.180
 number of fine updates for 200 euros 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.380
 it again a new budget topper 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.760
 I have n't had him in my hands yet 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.200
 I honestly say but I have it there 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.760
 full confidence that it will just be again 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.980
 very good device 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.730
 now has a pretty good 13 megapixel 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.800
 camera 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.630
 it has a snapdragon 410 processor 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.090
 which is slightly faster than the previous one 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.460
 has standard 4g and the phone is 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.899
 in addition, waterproof opposite for corridor 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.819
 That is of course a nice improvement 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.889
 and also across many other phones 

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:13.439
 that is quite unique in this segment 

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:15.030
 if you are more of a power user than you can 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.549
 you know you spend a little more money on you 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.679
 phone for example the oneplus one kun 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.619
 you then buy 250 euros which costs for the 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.329
 16 gigabyte version 300 euros for the 64 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.700
 gigabyte version then just gets whole 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.289
 complete and pretty good phone quickly 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.569
 bring back with a processor 3 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.369
 gigabyte of memory almost stock 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.869
 Android experience with some more 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.810
 adjustment options 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.149
 thanks to manager mot android 5 point zero 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.770
 lollipop currently has a 13 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.389
 megapixel camera 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.859
 it is just all-round very good device 

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:45.149
 disadvantage is that the memory is not 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.179
 Extensible advantage is that the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.590
 battery is pretty good and yes it is 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.899
 device may be slightly less 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.509
 well finished polished than appliances 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.009
 from well-known manufacturers, but pay there 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.539
 you just a lot less so 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.920
 that is certainly worth the effort 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.450
 worth 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.039
 other option if you have a little smaller 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.429
 screen is the lg g2 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:08.099
 the lg g2 costs around 280 euros and really 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.450
 A 5.2 inch full HD screen makes them very beautiful 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.160
 screen too 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.019
 In addition, the device is now 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.800
 update to android lollipop he has 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.150
 a bed will be nice 13 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.890
 epics for camera with optical 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.700
 image stabilization in addition is the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.200
 phone 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.120
 equipped with buttons on the back 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.680
 which at least is separate or you like it 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.750
 likes or dislikes 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.190
 find useful or find less useful then yes 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.260
 you just have to decide for yourself 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.310
 in any case, it is something again 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.650
 different than usual 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.390
 the phone is quite complete though 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.460
 here too the memory applies 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.080
 not extensible that is definitely one 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.970
 disadvantage of lg g2 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.500
 just like the oneplus one, lg g2 does 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.480
 again a very good battery that is one 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.060
 advantage of the device and all-round 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.700
 just a very good picture for 32 euros 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.320
 despite the fact that he is a bit older 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.710
 another device that struck me positively 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.170
 This month the LG Flex 2 is a lot 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.560
 newer unit and despite so 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.360
 is new 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.040
 and has quite high and specifications 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.100
 it is not that expensive 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.170
 180 euros and for that 380 euros you get 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.130
 a telephone with a snapdragon 810 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.590
 Processor 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.870
 3 gigabytes of memory and 5 11 inches 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.130
 full hd screen that is bent 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.840
 he also has a pretty good one 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.090
 camera a 13 megapixel camera with 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.670
 optical image stabilization that just yes 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.930
 good results put down 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.270
 everywhere it's just a very good one 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.010
 telephone disadvantage is that snapdragon 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.110
 810 processor that is in it what 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.640
 has problems that might also be one 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.950
 of the reasons why the price is so low 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.730
 if he can overheat, then he will do something 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.520
 become slower 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.170
 yes that's just a shame but for 380 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.820
 euro is certainly one of the faster ones 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.860
 so you can get telephones 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.230
 I wouldn't mind too much about it either 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.760
 Annoy additionally has telephone 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.440
 extensive interface that what matters to me 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.540
 regards pretty good looks and 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.239
 330 euros is just one 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.880
 incredibly good tiel other good deal 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.400
 what is more recent is the huawei p 8 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.380
 weeks you can buy for around 430 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.450
 euros and for those 430 euros you get one 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.709
 phone that is very thin that very 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.750
 nicely designed with an aluminum 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.060
 he also has unibody 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.739
 good 5.2 inch full hd screen 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.480
 13 megapixel camera with optical 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.090
 Image stabilization that is also nice 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.580
 drop pictures and finally it is one 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.200
 phone that you just work smoothly and 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.000
 despite the fact that it is so thin another one 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.830
 nice battery has memory 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.750
 expandable and yes it is just whole 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.910
 complete picture if you have one 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.340
 phone that just does not want a top device 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.020
 have to be and with that also just something 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.110
 want to save money then this is 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.940
 a good choice if you have a telephone with you 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.860
 your subscription wants what is really good 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.599
 device is for not too much money then 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.710
 you have to be with the sony xperia z3 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.590
 compact 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.789
 that xperia z3 compact post 23 euros per 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.360
 month then you have a hollandsnieuwe 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.750
 subscription 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.830
 500 mb texts or calling minutes 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.039
 that is common for most people 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.169
 enough and yes with that subscription you get 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.030
 just phone for free and have your best 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.289
 a good waterproof phone 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.060
 20.7 megapixel camera 4.6 inch screen hd 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.130
 resolution but for a sharp and 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.810
 nice in addition, the phone has one 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.550
 nice interface for me is that 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.319
 quickly through its snapdragon 800 one 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.120
 processor has 2 gigabytes of memory 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.400
 instead of three but good 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.979
 better life and it is for me 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.750
 just a pretty very good overall picture 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.030
 there are not really many disadvantages 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.849
 He can also do very well from our review 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.680
 I certainly have a little after and yes 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.150
 with the subscription this is just one 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.289
 incredibly good deal 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.210
 Finally, I want some attention 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.460
 spend on the oneplus to the is just 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.349
 announced and that's a phone yes 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.330
 which is simply very good for little money 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.630
 at least it seems that way again 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.310
 to become 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.870
 he does have an invite again 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.150
 Systemic should get invitation 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.229
 so to buy it for that you really 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.479
 arrive 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.490
 sandy if take a while when that 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.380
 Exact is unknown but I would be there 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.210
 Don't assume that you have one within two 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.430
 months on the mat 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.740
 The phone has good specifications 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.539
 available from 330 euros and 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.360
 for that money you get a phone with 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.919
 a snapdragon 810 processor 4 gigabytes 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.810
 main memory or 3 gigabytes of main memory 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.889
 indicate which version you are purchasing 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.539
 he also has one 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.819
 fingerprint scanner the body is what 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.199
 higher quality than with the oneplus one it 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.050
 screen would have gotten better 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.300
 the camera has gotten better and you are already with 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.090
 though it is just complete and very good 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.500
 total picture for that money 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.770
 we hope to review soon 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.690
 And then of course we will talk about it 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.669
 go tell but for now it seems 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.469
 just incredibly good device for not 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.819
 so very much that was before him again 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:26.319
 this month 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.569
 the highlights of the telekoopwijzer 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.340
 August 2015 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.919
 So you want to see the full list check 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.659
 just the annotation in this video or the 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.260
 description of this video is a 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:37.940
 link to that list 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.830
 and yes you can get away on 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.460
 to beat thanks for looking up 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.010
 the next time 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.670
 enjoy your vacation and hope you do 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.670
 some have had to
