00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.670 

I've<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.580> laid<00:00:29.820> out<00:00:29.850> a<00:00:30.210> simple<00:00:30.630> city<00:00:30.990> using

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
I've just laid out a simple city using

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.500 
I've just laid out a simple city using
all<00:00:32.400> the<00:00:32.579> different<00:00:32.669> road<00:00:33.030> types<00:00:33.270> to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
all the different road types to

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.360 
all the different road types to
demonstrate<00:00:33.960> what<00:00:34.079> they<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.770> section<00:00:35.040> is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
demonstrate what they do this section is

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.970 
demonstrate what they do this section is
built<00:00:35.610> using<00:00:35.880> low<00:00:36.239> density<00:00:36.750> dirt<00:00:36.989> road<00:00:37.440> which

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
built using low density dirt road which

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.330 
built using low density dirt road which
has<00:00:38.129> two<00:00:38.550> lanes<00:00:39.080> now<00:00:40.080> I<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.470> to<00:00:40.500> start<00:00:40.680> out<00:00:41.129> my

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
has two lanes now I like to start out my

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.729 
has two lanes now I like to start out my
city<00:00:41.640> building<00:00:42.360> basically<00:00:42.750> only<00:00:43.200> medium

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
city building basically only medium

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.500 
city building basically only medium
density<00:00:44.070> avenues<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.910> these<00:00:45.210> dirt<00:00:45.480> roads

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
density avenues and these dirt roads

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.350 
density avenues and these dirt roads
because<00:00:46.199> they're<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> cheapest<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.460> when

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
because they're the cheapest so when

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.869 
because they're the cheapest so when
you're<00:00:48.510> ready<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.290> upgrade<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:50.100> little<00:00:50.550> bit<00:00:50.699> you

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you're ready to upgrade a little bit you

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.570 
you're ready to upgrade a little bit you
can<00:00:51.000> upgrade<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.750> these<00:00:51.930> low<00:00:52.620> density<00:00:53.100> streets

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
can upgrade to these low density streets

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.950 
can upgrade to these low density streets
which<00:00:54.420> each<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.530> two<00:00:55.769> lanes<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.930> a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
which each have two lanes and this is a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.549 
which each have two lanes and this is a
good<00:00:58.290> sort<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.480> beginning<00:01:00.480> start<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.440> your

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
good sort of beginning start for your

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.039 
good sort of beginning start for your
city<00:01:01.979> once<00:01:02.879> you've<00:01:03.059> gotten<00:01:03.269> enough<00:01:03.570> money<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
city once you've gotten enough money to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.050 
city once you've gotten enough money to
upgrade<00:01:04.080> from<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.769> dirt<00:01:04.949> roads<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.729> good<00:01:05.940> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
upgrade from the dirt roads it's good to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.550 
upgrade from the dirt roads it's good to
go<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> these<00:01:06.390> guys<00:01:06.659> because<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> dirt<00:01:07.290> roads

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
go to these guys because the dirt roads

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.710 
go to these guys because the dirt roads
have<00:01:08.010> lots<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.490> traffic<00:01:08.760> problems<00:01:08.970> once<00:01:09.600> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
have lots of traffic problems once you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.210 
have lots of traffic problems once you
start<00:01:09.990> getting<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.320> lot<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.619> buildings<00:01:11.040> in

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
start getting a lot of buildings in

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.390 
start getting a lot of buildings in
there<00:01:11.570> now<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.350> section<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> built<00:01:14.190> using

there now this section is built using

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.630 
there now this section is built using
medium<00:01:15.090> density<00:01:15.450> streets<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:17.369> want<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
medium density streets you want to

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
upgrade your low density streets to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.200 
upgrade your low density streets to
medium<00:01:19.950> density<00:01:20.250> streets<00:01:20.640> when<00:01:21.030> you're

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
medium density streets when you're

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.899 
medium density streets when you're
starting<00:01:21.510> to<00:01:21.659> feel<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.250> push<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.700> more

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
starting to feel that push for more

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.820 
starting to feel that push for more
money<00:01:24.180> once<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.049> feel<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.350> you've<00:01:25.470> gotten

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
money once you feel like you've gotten

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.880 
money once you feel like you've gotten
the<00:01:26.210> whole<00:01:27.210> city<00:01:27.750> under<00:01:28.110> control<00:01:28.560> at<00:01:28.740> low

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the whole city under control at low

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.550 
the whole city under control at low
density<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:30.600> want<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.900> start<00:01:31.080> upgrading

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
density you want to start upgrading

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.740 
density you want to start upgrading
selectively<00:01:32.010> to<00:01:32.250> medium<00:01:32.580> density<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.509> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
selectively to medium density so that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.230 
selectively to medium density so that
you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.340> start<00:01:35.340> getting<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.759> little<00:01:35.880> bit<00:01:36.119> of

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
you can start getting a little bit of

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.539 
you can start getting a little bit of
those<00:01:36.359> bigger<00:01:36.630> buildings<00:01:37.130> now<00:01:38.130> I'm<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
those bigger buildings now I'm going to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.919 
those bigger buildings now I'm going to
show<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> section<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.359> the<00:01:39.479> city<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.869> was

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
show you a section of the city that was

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.499 
show you a section of the city that was
built<00:01:40.170> using<00:01:40.320> high<00:01:40.710> density<00:01:41.250> roads<00:01:41.520> high

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
built using high density roads high

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.149 
built using high density roads high
density<00:01:42.960> roads<00:01:43.200> are<00:01:43.380> great<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:43.799> they

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
density roads are great because they

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.830 
density roads are great because they
allow<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.429> any<00:01:44.820> density<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> building<00:01:45.749> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
allow for any density of building to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.139 
allow for any density of building to
come<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.140> along<00:01:46.380> them<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:47.429> have<00:01:47.579> four<00:01:47.880> lanes

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
come in along them they have four lanes

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.410 
come in along them they have four lanes
as<00:01:48.539> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.289> see<00:01:49.670> these<00:01:50.670> higher<00:01:50.939> density

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
as you can see these higher density

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.450 
as you can see these higher density
buildings<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:52.020> higher<00:01:52.499> density<00:01:52.979> traffic

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
buildings have higher density traffic

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.139 
buildings have higher density traffic
problems<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:55.369> they<00:01:56.369> also<00:01:56.640> require<00:01:57.119> more

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
problems and they also require more

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.130 
problems and they also require more
water<00:01:57.749> produce<00:01:58.590> more<00:01:58.829> sewage<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.520> garbage

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
water produce more sewage and garbage

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.380 
water produce more sewage and garbage
but<00:02:01.140> they<00:02:02.009> come<00:02:02.249> with<00:02:02.429> more<00:02:02.609> sims<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.210> more

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
but they come with more sims and more

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.969 
but they come with more sims and more
jobs<00:02:03.659> for<00:02:03.899> sims<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.590> it's<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.189> trade-off<00:02:06.979> now

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
jobs for sims so it's a trade-off now

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.499 
jobs for sims so it's a trade-off now
I'm<00:02:08.100> going<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.399> show<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.880> little<00:02:09.090> bit<00:02:09.210> about

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
I'm going to show you a little bit about

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.200 
I'm going to show you a little bit about
the<00:02:09.690> road<00:02:09.899> upgrade<00:02:10.380> tool<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:12.000> see

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
the road upgrade tool as you can see

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.210 
the road upgrade tool as you can see
this<00:02:12.900> building<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.440> ready<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.800> go<00:02:13.950> up<00:02:13.980> in

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
this building is ready to go up in

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.080 
this building is ready to go up in
density<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:16.500> can't<00:02:16.860> along<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.819> type<00:02:18.060> of

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
density but it can't along this type of

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.740 
density but it can't along this type of
road<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:18.750> built<00:02:18.990> on

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
road that it's built on

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.930 
road that it's built on
so<00:02:21.290> I'm<00:02:21.530> going<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.830> go<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.100> my<00:02:22.250> road<00:02:22.490> palette

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
so I'm going to go to my road palette

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.360 
so I'm going to go to my road palette
click<00:02:23.570> on<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.870> road<00:02:24.020> upgrade<00:02:24.470> tool<00:02:24.710> click<00:02:25.250> on

click on the road upgrade tool click on
the<00:02:25.520> section<00:02:25.850> of<00:02:25.940> road<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.210> I<00:02:26.420> want<00:02:26.660> to

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
the section of road that I want to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.210 
the section of road that I want to
upgrade<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.610> then<00:02:28.610> upgrade<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.830> as<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:31.100> can

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
upgrade and then upgrade it as you can

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.240 
upgrade and then upgrade it as you can
see<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.640> new<00:02:32.600> construction<00:02:33.290> on<00:02:33.470> your<00:02:33.530> higher

see the new construction on your higher
density<00:02:34.730> building<00:02:35.030> begins<00:02:35.420> immediately<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
density building begins immediately and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.530 
density building begins immediately and
I'm<00:02:37.310> just<00:02:37.460> going<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.670> speed<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.060> up<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.300> that

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
I'm just going to speed this up so that

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.940 
I'm just going to speed this up so that
we<00:02:38.990> can<00:02:39.110> see<00:02:39.320> some<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.560> these<00:02:39.680> buildings

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
we can see some of these buildings

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.230 
we can see some of these buildings
coming<00:02:40.840> going<00:02:41.840> in<00:02:42.080> up<00:02:42.230> in<00:02:42.500> density<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.160> fun<00:02:43.820> but

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
coming going in up in density is fun but

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.030 
coming going in up in density is fun but
it<00:02:44.330> can<00:02:44.360> also<00:02:44.570> be<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.840> challenge<00:02:45.140> higher

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
it can also be a challenge higher

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.010 
it can also be a challenge higher
density<00:02:46.550> buildings<00:02:46.910> hold<00:02:47.240> more<00:02:47.480> sims<00:02:47.810> and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
density buildings hold more sims and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.420 
density buildings hold more sims and
give<00:02:48.920> them<00:02:49.070> more<00:02:49.280> jobs<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:51.040> they<00:02:52.040> require

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
give them more jobs but they require

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.020 
give them more jobs but they require
more<00:02:52.790> power<00:02:53.090> more<00:02:53.900> water<00:02:54.459> they<00:02:55.459> produce<00:02:55.700> more

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
more power more water they produce more

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.180 
more power more water they produce more
garbage<00:02:56.270> in<00:02:56.630> sewage<00:02:57.020> and<00:02:57.260> they're<00:02:57.980> more

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
garbage in sewage and they're more

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.190 
garbage in sewage and they're more
sensitive<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.940> negative<00:02:59.090> things<00:02:59.600> like<00:02:59.870> fire

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
sensitive to negative things like fire

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.870

crime<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.220> health<00:03:01.580> issues<00:03:05.740> well<00:03:06.880> that's
