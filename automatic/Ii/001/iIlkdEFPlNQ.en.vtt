this strategy you can try the art DEFCON
strategy<00:07:21.539> which<00:07:21.719> works<00:07:21.960> good<00:07:22.199> as<00:07:22.319> well<00:07:23.509> but

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:24.509 
strategy which works good as well but

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:27.379 
strategy which works good as well but
it's<00:07:24.690> really<00:07:24.990> up<00:07:25.229> to<00:07:25.379> you<00:07:25.469> what<00:07:25.650> you<00:07:25.680> do<00:07:25.860> I<00:07:26.389> just

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:27.389 
it's really up to you what you do I just

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:29.719 
it's really up to you what you do I just
posted<00:07:27.750> this<00:07:28.110> one<00:07:28.289> because<00:07:28.409> it<00:07:28.680> works<00:07:28.889> good<00:07:29.219> so

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:29.729 
posted this one because it works good so

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:33.309 
posted this one because it works good so
wonderful<00:07:30.360> players<00:07:30.599> which<00:07:30.870> covers<00:07:31.259> everyone

00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:33.319 
wonderful players which covers everyone

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:38.209 
wonderful players which covers everyone
so<00:07:34.319> this<00:07:34.500> basically<00:07:35.340> wraps<00:07:35.969> it<00:07:36.210> up<00:07:36.300> now<00:07:37.099> if<00:07:38.099> you

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:38.219 
so this basically wraps it up now if you
