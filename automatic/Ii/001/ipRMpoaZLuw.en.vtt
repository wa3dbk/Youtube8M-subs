00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
salt element seemed to go maybe just a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.380 
salt element seemed to go maybe just a
touch<00:01:39.210> more<00:01:39.710> it's<00:01:40.710> not<00:01:40.799> seasoned<00:01:41.430> yet<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.970> this

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
touch more it's not seasoned yet so this

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.749 
touch more it's not seasoned yet so this

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
find out the stalks are packed full of

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.040 
find out the stalks are packed full of
flavor<00:02:45.520> and<00:02:45.910> just<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.600> whole<00:02:46.630> cooking

flavor and just that whole cooking

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.450 
flavor and just that whole cooking
process<00:02:47.110> we<00:02:47.560> just<00:02:47.740> basically<00:02:47.890> take<00:02:48.190> away<00:02:48.340> that

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
process we just basically take away that

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.550 
process we just basically take away that
crunch<00:02:49.120> making<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> new<00:02:49.780> bit<00:02:49.930> more<00:02:50.020> soft<00:02:50.350> and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
crunch making a new bit more soft and

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.050 
crunch making a new bit more soft and
nice<00:02:50.740> for<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.070> tortellini<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:51.940> can

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
nice for the tortellini and you can

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.840 
nice for the tortellini and you can
smell<00:02:52.300> that<00:02:52.360> through<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.870> coriander<00:02:53.850> you

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
smell that through the coriander you

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.950 
smell that through the coriander you
want<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.060> make<00:02:55.150> sure<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.420> don't<00:02:55.630> actually<00:02:55.780> use

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
want to make sure you don't actually use

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.230 
want to make sure you don't actually use
all<00:02:56.350> these<00:02:56.500> beautiful<00:02:56.800> leaves<00:02:57.160> here<00:02:57.550> because

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
all these beautiful leaves here because

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.790 
all these beautiful leaves here because
as<00:02:58.330> soon<00:02:58.480> as<00:02:58.600> you<00:02:58.720> put<00:02:58.870> them<00:02:59.020> into<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.470> soup

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
as soon as you put them into the soup

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.010 
as soon as you put them into the soup
when<00:03:00.250> you're<00:03:00.370> cooking<00:03:00.520> with<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.880> pasta<00:03:01.390> then

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
when you're cooking with the pasta then

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.830 
when you're cooking with the pasta then
they'll<00:03:02.200> go<00:03:02.490> dark<00:03:03.490> and<00:03:03.760> you<00:03:04.510> lose<00:03:04.660> with<00:03:04.810> that

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
they'll go dark and you lose with that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.170 
they'll go dark and you lose with that
vibrancy<00:03:05.320> all<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.010> vibrancy<00:03:06.520> exactly<00:03:07.000> keep

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
vibrancy all the vibrancy exactly keep

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.360 
vibrancy all the vibrancy exactly keep
that<00:03:07.360> for<00:03:07.570> for<00:03:07.870> garnish<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.380> guess<00:03:08.590> what<00:03:09.070> we<00:03:09.190> can

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
that for for garnish I guess what we can

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.000 
that for for garnish I guess what we can
use<00:03:09.550> is<00:03:09.840> something<00:03:10.840> it's<00:03:11.140> our<00:03:11.410> Asian<00:03:11.800> greens

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
use is something it's our Asian greens

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.470 
use is something it's our Asian greens
there<00:03:12.340> so<00:03:12.520> we're<00:03:12.640> just<00:03:12.670> gonna<00:03:12.850> turn<00:03:13.330> off<00:03:13.450> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
there so we're just gonna turn off the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
there so we're just gonna turn off the
heat<00:03:13.600> cut<00:03:14.560> them<00:03:14.650> into<00:03:14.770> thirds<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:16.410> leave<00:03:17.410> that

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500
