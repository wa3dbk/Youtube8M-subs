00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 what's up youtube is so small I hope that 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.080
 are very good, well, guys, we're in 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.260
 news 0.10 point zero already sounds a 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.389
 bit strange but that's how they said it 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.130
 the developers guys that after 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.070
 to be in this version after that 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.949
 all 0.9 points are made x goes to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.210
 come a 0.10 point zero is official already 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.619
 they announced it on twitter 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.099
 developers and the 0.9 not to 1.0 is not going 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.570
 to come the after the 0.9 then 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.790
 let's see here excuse this video what 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.640
 It was a bit quick without taking pictures or 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.590
 like to organize it but today I have today 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.300
 have some things in the day and I have to 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.420
 go I'm recording it early then 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.800
 this is to record it fast good for 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.950
 start here this to see it we started 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.520
 where we started here for the first the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.309
 jeff says tweets point to 0.9 x 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 the many as they have to leave 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.320
 0.9 point x up to even 0.9 point 9 goes 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.710
 to be continued by a 0.10 point 0 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.010
 not a 1.0 zero point so how can they 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.660
 see there is the one that confirms that it is not going 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.479
 to have a zero point said not to have 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.550
 one that there will not be a 1.0 after 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.950
 this one but that's going to be a 0.10 point 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.720
 zero a little strange but good we 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.200
 we will have to get used to it and that too 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.360
 says they 're going to try this one to do more and 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.580
 frequently updates 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.390
 well we have also some cops 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.310
 minecraft and as there are no ender eyes 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.200
 to look for the stronghold now the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.820
 reds will always be generated 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.770
 under the villas as the oasis that 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.360
 it went up yesterday, well, it was not so 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.160
 incredible as it seemed but now 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.570
 the foreigners are going to be then the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.270
 most times under the villas 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.830
 so that they are not a small chance or 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.000
 greater chance of finding one because 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.900
 has people would be almost impossible 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.030
 find the ones that 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.610
 and for good to clarify or good 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.370
 for good to confirm it or for 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.050
 speak well let's say it well not all 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.690
 villas obviously have foreigners 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.130
 but the works are of the 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.899
 villas when they are generated so that 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.180
 obviously you are going to have to look for several 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.620
 villas maybe the first one 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.530
 once you touch that is below you have to 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.240
 search several villas 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.090
 and that more than more guys go to that is 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.160
 everything here that more here puts that 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.569
 can fix this bug is good the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.400
 purple cake book that is very 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.790
 father who is fixing everything for 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.350
 the 0.20 point 9.2 and well here we go to 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.720
 see the tweet of taking your now for 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.430
 read them everything important ok first 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.470
 says that we must continue the arrangement of 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.230
 books today and that there have been more 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.110
 cases and more than good that what is 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.720
 Of course many mods and mods are more 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.550
 other things that meanwhile 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.080
 experiencing in far land if this 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.510
 is a photo that was contributed more or in the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.980
 falklands the truth is that then the 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.600
 imagine the farlan a little different 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.950
 about a droid video a while ago 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.530
 when your book of fablans in the will 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.060
 if they were different but good and what 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.480
 well that also obviously what more 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.819
 is fixing this is what the bushing 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.700
 this one of the grass that looked 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.860
 this various colors of how darko 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.010
 iris here a question that you ask is 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.620
 that if there is going to be a 0.2 0.9 points and 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.370
 if it will be a 0.9 points after 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.660
 what apple 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.040
 the serve available the 0.9 point 1 as 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.740
 you know on android already came out 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.600
 like 2 or 3 days and the same year has come out 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.460
 from the 0.9 point one eye is bad but 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.640
 well it does not matter and another thing is that it is 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.810
 important that this institute says that 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.060
 if your game is separated from generating together 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.950
 you are flying and you do not generate chus 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.900
 in front of you 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.900
 it means that it's good news that 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.480
 down there is a foreigner but this 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.340
 only works at 0.9 point 0 and 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.470
 in 0.9 point 1 because that's what they're going to 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.780
 fix for the 0.9 point two so 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.580
 nothing more if you already know by now you can 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.140
 find so easy stronghold and that 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.590
 here it is and from there on famous youtube 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.590
 Question 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.870
 how far away are the land of the 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:13.900
 photo as tomÃ¡s and says it's a 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.120
 approximately 10 thousand blocks and here 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.130
 It is 10 thousand blocks away from space 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.049
 which, well, I thought it was a 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.320
 little more than blocks e but good and for 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.289
 Last we go high to johan's twitter 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.550
 that is here quickly and well he does not 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.740
 I would say a lot but the only thing 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.639
 the only tweet he tweeted though he 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.460
 I heard weird was that good area plus bus 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.639
 arranged for today's 0.9 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.500
 there's going to be a 0.9 point 2 to a 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.639
 update this week that opens the 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.800
 books and nothing else 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.620
 good if things are all news the 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.820
 truth is that no is not is not so 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.070
 important but the truth is that they are 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.720
 things that are not good if they come in handy 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.729
 to know how good that there will not be a 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.729
 1.0 what everyone thought was not 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.259
 that is going to be a to 0.10 and good that is 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.940
 lengthening the books that nobody is good 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.800
 they are taking a little longer to remove them 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.240
 but if they are going to leave and the truth is that 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.680
 I have not started my series myself 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.470
 survival because of that everything is 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.150
 quite unstable and I have been created a 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.840
 couple of times recording then I do not want 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.940
 what's wrong with me 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.860
 in a series in the guys for now 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.650
 let's wait more at 0.9 points 2 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.600
 while it is retracting sheets to 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.940
 best recorded them android mods 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.350
 people told me that if I wanted and nothing 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.580
 more boys I love you so much we'll see you in 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.580
 another video goodbye
