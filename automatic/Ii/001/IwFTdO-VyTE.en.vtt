00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
either side of this game but I think

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.140 
either side of this game but I think
both<00:02:34.530> both<00:02:35.160> teams<00:02:35.490> gonna<00:02:35.730> have<00:02:35.880> an<00:02:36.030> eye<00:02:36.120> on

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150

both both teams gonna have an eye on
their<00:02:36.630> league<00:02:36.810> games<00:02:37.880> do<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:38.970> think<00:02:39.150> that

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
their league games do you think that

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.090 
their league games do you think that
like<00:02:39.420> into<00:02:39.930> really<00:02:40.170> want<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.560> win<00:02:40.710> this<00:02:40.740> sort

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
like into really want to win this sort

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.320 
like into really want to win this sort
of<00:02:41.130> more<00:02:41.310> than<00:02:41.340> top<00:02:41.670> noms<00:02:41.940> if<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.210> think

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
of more than top noms if you think

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.210 
of more than top noms if you think
they're<00:02:42.420> gonna<00:02:42.510> be<00:02:42.690> trying<00:02:42.960> harder<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:45.020> think

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
they're gonna be trying harder I think

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.030 
they're gonna be trying harder I think
both<00:02:47.220> teams<00:02:47.870> would<00:02:48.870> obviously<00:02:49.380> like<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.890> win

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
both teams would obviously like to win

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.040 
both teams would obviously like to win
but<00:02:50.340> maybe<00:02:50.970> not<00:02:51.180> going<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.540> given<00:02:51.840> a

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
but maybe not going to be given a

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.810 
but maybe not going to be given a
hundred<00:02:52.500> percent<00:02:52.590> especially<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:53.520> first

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
hundred percent especially in this first

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.260 
hundred percent especially in this first
game<00:02:54.470> for<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.530> reason<00:02:55.740> at<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.460> prices<00:02:56.730> I

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270
