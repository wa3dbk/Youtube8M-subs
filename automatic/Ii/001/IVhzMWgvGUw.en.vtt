but except you're going to start playing

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.240 
but except you're going to start playing
with<00:00:30.029> levels<00:00:30.420> from<00:00:31.170> your<00:00:31.320> basic<00:00:31.500> pieces<00:00:31.830> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
with levels from your basic pieces and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.729 
with levels from your basic pieces and
go<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.090> go<00:00:33.239> back<00:00:33.420> down<00:00:33.449> you<00:00:34.230> guys<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.649> your

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
go up and go back down you guys in your

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.799 
go up and go back down you guys in your
head<00:00:34.949> and<00:00:35.190> also<00:00:35.730> your<00:00:35.969> forearms<00:00:36.629> and

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
head and also your forearms and

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.720 
head and also your forearms and
basically<00:00:37.500> being<00:00:37.770> off<00:00:38.070> your<00:00:38.309> head<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.489> is

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
basically being off your head and is

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.700 
basically being off your head and is
using<00:00:39.000> your<00:00:39.239> control<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:39.929> your<00:00:40.170> arm<00:00:40.379> strength

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
using your control and your arm strength

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.540 
using your control and your arm strength
to<00:00:41.699> use<00:00:41.909> all<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> streets<00:00:42.600> transitions<00:00:43.190> it<00:00:44.190> is

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
to use all the streets transitions it is

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.559 
to use all the streets transitions it is
very<00:00:44.760> important<00:00:45.179> to<00:00:45.210> start<00:00:45.479> developing

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:45.569 
very important to start developing

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:48.290 
very important to start developing
control<00:00:46.319> and<00:00:46.620> also<00:00:46.889> how<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> go<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:47.969> levels

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
control and also how to go with levels

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.029 
control and also how to go with levels
because<00:00:48.600> once<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.870> start<00:00:49.109> adding<00:00:49.260> levels<00:00:49.769> to

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
because once you start adding levels to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.860 
because once you start adding levels to
what<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.339> doing<00:00:50.609> your<00:00:50.729> freezes<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.600> starts

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
what you're doing your freezes it starts

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.200 
what you're doing your freezes it starts
to<00:00:51.989> look<00:00:52.109> a<00:00:52.139> little<00:00:52.319> bit<00:00:52.440> more<00:00:52.649> dynamic<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.370> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
to look a little bit more dynamic and it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.639 
to look a little bit more dynamic and it
adds<00:00:54.389> more<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.780> what<00:00:55.079> you're<00:00:55.229> actually<00:00:55.409> doing

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
adds more to what you're actually doing

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.039 
adds more to what you're actually doing
well<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.940> hope<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.210> guys<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.539> enjoy<00:00:57.629> it

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
check it out right now so here we are

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.579 
check it out right now so here we are
we're<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.839> start<00:01:01.019> with<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.229> basic

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
we're going to start with the basic

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.619 
we're going to start with the basic
freezes<00:01:01.979> again<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.609> we're<00:01:03.269> going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.479> play

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
freezes again and we're going to play

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.030 
freezes again and we're going to play
with<00:01:03.780> different<00:01:03.929> levels<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.559> time<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.949> you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
with different levels this time to you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.340 
with different levels this time to you
mess<00:01:05.220> up<00:01:05.630> utilizing<00:01:06.630> transitions<00:01:07.200> with

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
mess up utilizing transitions with

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
mess up utilizing transitions with
increases<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.940> one<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> most

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
increases but this is one of the most

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.080 
increases but this is one of the most
basic<00:01:09.690> elements<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.610> transition<00:01:11.610> increases

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
basic elements of transition increases

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.390 
basic elements of transition increases
this<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.170> something<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.770> fundamental

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
this is something that very fundamental

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
this is something that very fundamental
of<00:01:14.490> me<00:01:14.640> when<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.300> was<00:01:15.390> younger<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.990> was

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
of me when I was younger and I was

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.930 
of me when I was younger and I was
developing<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.190> i<00:01:17.220> will<00:01:17.370> show<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.580> guys<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
developing so i will show you guys the

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.090 
developing so i will show you guys the
different<00:01:18.270> variations<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.050> so<00:01:19.800> when<00:01:19.980> you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
different variations of it so when you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.010 
different variations of it so when you
start<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.640> start<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.810> baby

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
start as you start here in the baby

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.870 
start as you start here in the baby
position<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.430> when<00:01:23.550> you're<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.790> to

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
position and then when you're going to

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.970 
position and then when you're going to
lose<00:01:24.000> use<00:01:24.270> your<00:01:24.450> back<00:01:24.660> leg<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.620> push<00:01:25.830> yourself

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
lose use your back leg to push yourself

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.160 
lose use your back leg to push yourself
up<00:01:26.430> at<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.150> same<00:01:27.330> time<00:01:27.510> that<00:01:27.690> you<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:27.960> your

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
up at the same time that you use your

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.380 
up at the same time that you use your
inner<00:01:28.500> arm<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:29.340> arm<00:01:29.520> leg<00:01:29.700> you're<00:01:29.850> stepping<00:01:30.270> up

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
inner arm the arm leg you're stepping up

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.460 
inner arm the arm leg you're stepping up
push<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.350> weight<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.760> go<00:01:32.880> up

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
push your weight up so when you go up

push your weight up so when you go up
slide<00:01:34.470> out<00:01:34.620> but<00:01:35.190> if<00:01:35.370> you<00:01:35.490> notice<00:01:35.790> my<00:01:36.090> packet

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
slide out but if you notice my packet

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.980 
slide out but if you notice my packet
was<00:01:37.260> hooked<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> back<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.210> sucking

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
was hooked up to the back so the sucking

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.020 
was hooked up to the back so the sucking
find<00:01:40.200> my<00:01:40.290> balance<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.800> away<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.730> i<00:01:41.880> can

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
find my balance right away and i can

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.930 
find my balance right away and i can
bring<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.300> fact<00:01:42.480> that<00:01:42.630> money<00:01:43.020> too<00:01:43.260> okay<00:01:44.160> so

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
it all and you're going to remember to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.249 
it all and you're going to remember to
keep<00:01:57.569> your<00:01:57.750> back<00:01:58.020> leg<00:01:58.259> back<00:01:59.270> okay<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.140> gives

keep your back leg back okay so it gives

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.740 
keep your back leg back okay so it gives
you<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> balance<00:02:01.740> right<00:02:02.009> boy<00:02:02.509> then<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.600> bring

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
you the balance right boy then you bring

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.449 
you the balance right boy then you bring
it<00:02:03.899> back<00:02:04.049> down<00:02:04.729> alright<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> next<00:02:06.630> step

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
it back down alright so the next step

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.900 
it back down alright so the next step
would<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.519> to<00:02:08.940> expand<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.989> little<00:02:10.019> bit<00:02:10.259> more<00:02:10.910> you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
would be to expand a little bit more you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.759 
would be to expand a little bit more you
have<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> try<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.540> combine<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.989> together<00:02:13.260> and

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
have to try and combine it together and

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.119 
have to try and combine it together and
now<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.549> just<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.819> basic<00:02:15.000> way<00:02:15.269> to<00:02:15.330> good

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
now this is just a basic way to good

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:22.819 
now this is just a basic way to good
start<00:02:17.129> here<00:02:18.170> form<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> chance<00:02:21.019> drop<00:02:22.019> then

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
start here form to a chance drop then

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:28.490 
start here form to a chance drop then
again<00:02:23.269> form<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:25.500> chance<00:02:26.060> drop<00:02:27.110> now<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.140> advance

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
again form so chance drop now to advance

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.339 
again form so chance drop now to advance
that<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.180> play<00:02:30.360> with<00:02:30.480> any<00:02:30.630> variations<00:02:31.260> of

that you can play with any variations of

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.770 
that you can play with any variations of
the<00:02:31.470> same<00:02:31.530> thing<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.209> cross<00:02:33.569> your

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
the same thing so you can cross your

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.699 
the same thing so you can cross your
legs<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:34.739> be<00:02:34.860> here<00:02:35.099> cross<00:02:36.060> your<00:02:36.090> legs

you can use your reverse babies which is

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.509 
you can use your reverse babies which is
another<00:02:43.379> variation<00:02:43.739> as<00:02:44.160> well<00:02:46.400> when<00:02:47.400> you're

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
another variation as well when you're

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.140 
another variation as well when you're
doing<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:48.079> keep<00:02:49.079> your<00:02:49.230> center<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.590> gravity<00:02:50.150> tie

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
doing it keep your center of gravity tie

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.780 
doing it keep your center of gravity tie
to<00:02:51.209> yourself<00:02:51.720> don't<00:02:52.470> be<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:52.799> extended<00:02:53.430> if

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
to yourself don't be so extended if

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.150 
to yourself don't be so extended if
you're<00:02:54.030> really<00:02:54.180> extend<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.840> yeah<00:02:55.319> it's<00:02:55.829> a<00:02:56.010> lot

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
you're really extend it yeah it's a lot

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.699 
you're really extend it yeah it's a lot
harder<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.810> develop<00:02:57.810> momentum<00:02:58.590> especially

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
harder to develop momentum especially

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.190 
harder to develop momentum especially
with<00:02:59.280> your<00:02:59.400> hands<00:02:59.639> positions<00:03:00.209> depends<00:03:01.019> where

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
with your hands positions depends where

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.740 
with your hands positions depends where
you<00:03:01.290> put<00:03:01.500> your<00:03:01.530> hands<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.609> sort<00:03:02.850> of<00:03:02.880> profiles

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
you put your hands in a sort of profiles

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.140 
you put your hands in a sort of profiles
to<00:03:03.900> develop<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.290> transition<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.970> more

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
to develop the transition so the more

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.970 
to develop the transition so the more
you<00:03:06.180> bought<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:07.349> better<00:03:07.560> chance<00:03:07.859> you<00:03:07.920> have

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
you bought in the better chance you have

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.360 
you bought in the better chance you have
a<00:03:08.160> fashion<00:03:08.849> develop<00:03:09.540> any<00:03:09.720> more<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:11.190> last

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
a fashion develop any more and the last

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.710 
a fashion develop any more and the last
point<00:03:11.639> for<00:03:12.329> you<00:03:12.450> guys<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:13.590> already<00:03:14.220> got<00:03:14.400> this

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
point for you guys that already got this

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.990 
point for you guys that already got this
if<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.900> already<00:03:15.959> have<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.440> basic<00:03:17.000> freeze

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
if you already have this basic freeze

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.440 
if you already have this basic freeze
transitions<00:03:18.959> and

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
transitions and

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.670 
transitions and
then<00:03:20.450> it's<00:03:20.780> time<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.049> take<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.349> the<00:03:21.530> next

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
then it's time to take it to the next

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.850 
then it's time to take it to the next
level<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.760> next<00:03:23.030> level<00:03:23.330> would<00:03:24.260> be<00:03:24.319> for<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:24.830> to

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
level the next level would be for you to

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.949 
level the next level would be for you to
do<00:03:25.159> it<00:03:25.310> without<00:03:25.519> you<00:03:25.819> guys<00:03:25.970> on<00:03:26.120> your<00:03:26.299> head<00:03:26.599> a

lot of us use our head for everything

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.960 
lot of us use our head for everything
that<00:03:29.599> we<00:03:29.720> do<00:03:29.870> specially<00:03:30.319> increases<00:03:30.920> well<00:03:31.819> is

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
that we do specially increases well is

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.460 
that we do specially increases well is
it<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.360> that<00:03:32.450> when<00:03:32.599> I<00:03:32.629> had<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.110> I'm<00:03:33.200> guilty

it and that when I had and I'm guilty
like<00:03:33.799> myself<00:03:34.190> because<00:03:34.790> I<00:03:35.030> am<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.780> bloom<00:03:36.079> that

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
like myself because I am the bloom that

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.589 
like myself because I am the bloom that
allows<00:03:36.560> all<00:03:36.890> out<00:03:37.069> of<00:03:37.190> business<00:03:37.549> but<00:03:38.390> if<00:03:38.480> you

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
allows all out of business but if you

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.149 
allows all out of business but if you
really<00:03:38.750> want<00:03:38.989> to<00:03:39.049> develop<00:03:39.260> on<00:03:39.680> controlling

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
really want to develop on controlling

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.759 
really want to develop on controlling
strength<00:03:40.519> within<00:03:41.390> here<00:03:41.690> within<00:03:42.019> your<00:03:42.290> dancing

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
strength within here within your dancing

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.100 
strength within here within your dancing
with<00:03:42.860> new<00:03:43.069> pieces<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.909> you<00:03:44.000> start<00:03:44.420> learning

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
with new pieces and you start learning

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.860 
with new pieces and you start learning
how<00:03:45.319> to<00:03:45.440> phrase<00:03:45.769> without<00:03:45.920> using<00:03:46.310> your<00:03:46.549> head

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
how to phrase without using your head

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.899 
how to phrase without using your head
okay<00:03:47.870> so<00:03:47.930> an<00:03:48.709> example<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.370> it's<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.670> same

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
okay so an example is it's the same

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.319 
okay so an example is it's the same
thing<00:03:51.459> when<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.549> do<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:52.849> would<00:03:52.970> be<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.120> same

again if you notice my center of gravity

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.230 
again if you notice my center of gravity
with<00:04:23.479> him<00:04:23.720> he'll<00:04:23.900> never<00:04:24.169> extended<00:04:24.880> so<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:25.910> is

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
that different forms to it I get

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.650 
that different forms to it I get
creative<00:04:32.419> with<00:04:32.570> that<00:04:32.780> as<00:04:33.080> well<00:04:33.889> as<00:04:34.310> doing<00:04:35.090> do

creative with that as well as doing do

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.300 
creative with that as well as doing do
it<00:04:35.780> on<00:04:35.990> both<00:04:36.110> sides<00:04:36.410> if<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:37.669> hear<00:04:38.470> up<00:04:40.450> switch

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
it on both sides if you hear up switch

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.370 
it on both sides if you hear up switch
boom<00:04:43.310> that<00:04:44.300> would<00:04:44.419> be<00:04:44.599> it<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:44.900> i<00:04:44.960> hope<00:04:45.139> you<00:04:45.169> guys
