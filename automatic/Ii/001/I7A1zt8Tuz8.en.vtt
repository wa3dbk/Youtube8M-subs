00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the front line so that way it can

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.229 
the front line so that way it can
totally<00:00:54.710> saturate<00:00:55.710> into<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> skin<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.910> what

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
totally saturate into the skin so what

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.439 
totally saturate into the skin so what
we<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:57.840> open<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.969> it<00:00:59.969> comes<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
we do is we open it up it comes with a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.590 
we do is we open it up it comes with a
little<00:01:00.600> top<00:01:01.160> that<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.340> self<00:01:02.609> puncturing<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.480> we

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
little top that is self puncturing so we

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.469 
little top that is self puncturing so we
turn<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.930> around<00:01:04.670> puncturing<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.880> top<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
turn it around puncturing the top of the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.230 
turn it around puncturing the top of the
cup<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.320> open<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:08.520> what<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:08.790> want<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.090> do

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
cup so it's open then what we want to do

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.539 
cup so it's open then what we want to do
is<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:10.170> between<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.710> dog's<00:01:10.890> shoulder<00:01:11.310> blades

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
is in between the dog's shoulder blades

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.789 
is in between the dog's shoulder blades
where<00:01:11.760> they<00:01:11.850> can't<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.990> lick<00:01:13.200> we

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
where they can't get to it to lick we

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.469 
where they can't get to it to lick we
want<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.310> part<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.850> first<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.330> can

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
want to just part the first you can

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.240 
want to just part the first you can
actually<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.200> skin<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.650> dog<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
actually see the skin on the dog and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.330 
actually see the skin on the dog and
then<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> squeeze<00:01:19.340> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
then you just want to squeeze the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.340 
then you just want to squeeze the
product<00:01:20.759> onto<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> skin

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
product onto the skin

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
product onto the skin
my<00:01:22.680> technique<00:01:23.070> tends<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.640> also<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.060> move

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
my technique tends to be also to move

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.260 
my technique tends to be also to move
down<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> little<00:01:24.689> further<00:01:25.070> again<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.400> into<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
down a little further again get into the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.480 
down a little further again get into the
in<00:01:27.659> past<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> fur<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> skin<00:01:29.130> squeeze<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
in past the fur on to the skin squeeze a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.999 
in past the fur on to the skin squeeze a
little<00:01:29.610> bit<00:01:29.759> more<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.380> even<00:01:31.590> apply<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
little bit more and we can even apply a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.800 
little bit more and we can even apply a
little<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.460> down<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> base<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.540> tail

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
little bit down at the base of the tail

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.880 
little bit down at the base of the tail
which<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.710> usually<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> really<00:01:35.520> bad<00:01:36.180> flea<00:01:36.600> spot

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
which is usually a really bad flea spot

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.020 
which is usually a really bad flea spot
until<00:01:37.890> we're<00:01:38.009> completely<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
until we're completely out of the
