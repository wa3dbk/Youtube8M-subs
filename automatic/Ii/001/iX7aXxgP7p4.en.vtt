00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:13.249
 Hi everybody, Domingo, these are Pietro. 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.499
 here to make another video for you guys 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.840
 and this time I'll show you a tutorial for 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.400
 How do you buy at the mall? 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.099
 we know that the shop network is not 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.480
 still available in Brazil but with this 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.880
 help I'm going to give you, you'll be able to 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.070
 otherwise it is no problem 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.859
 So you can see I'm in the region. 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.629
 Brazil and he is saying that the 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.980
 shopping is not yet available on 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.670
 your country 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.670
 so the first step is for you to change 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.800
 brazil region to canada because 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.870
 canada because it allows 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.699
 you are buy with any cep without 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.079
 no problem because if you put 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.489
 region of the United States when you 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.989
 was to confirm your brain 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.269
 he says that the transaction was not 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.469
 completed and there is still value in your 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:02.960
 card which is worse and only then is 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.519
 discounted and nintendo do this 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.650
 possible simply to hold the 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:13.299
 value so here is you come here may 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.299
 change residence to canada 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:27.710
 done you come back and you will 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.470
 realize that your your your user 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.390
 is without internet because the nintendo grandson 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.610
 because he is registered on the internet 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.690
 common and when you register and ask 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.160
 a region 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.150
 I do not know if they noticed waiting in a 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.550
 region and you boot SÃ£o Paulo is Brazil 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.430
 So how have you moved from region to 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.990
 Canada, that state was never 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.180
