00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.780

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.230
 a well-known game we talk about the great 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.380

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.109

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.090

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.580
 he was a child fan of pokémon games 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.910
 I had all the condition but I was missing 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.460
 1 red fire edition one day in the store 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.010
 of crazy games I saw it but I only had 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.320
 written with red fire pokemon marker 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.500
 I asked the Lord of the store how much 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.170
 it was worth it and this guy told me this game we 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.510
 sold a lady but told us that nobody 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.270
 I had to buy it because it's like a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.000
 relic but if you want we'll give it to you 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.370

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.100
 game I put it in my game boy advance and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.050
 I started playing happily I had chosen to 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.480
 charm under as initial pokemon and 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.360
 continue with my adventure until I entered 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.239
 the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.790
 what a serious mistake I had already evolved 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.890
 to samander the charm the lion and after 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.660
 analyze when I entered the cave of 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.670
 gillette I realized that it was a 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.580
 irritating place there was bit let's by 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.100
 everywhere was such an addictive game that 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.800
 I could stop playing since I was 5 hours 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.680
 playing but suddenly at 6 o'clock 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.750
 game with 6 minutes and 6 seconds the 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.630
 led test turned reddish 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.030
 and I found a pipeline and in the end what 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.010
 I won but a little scared I put myself 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.040
 repellent and I ran out of the cave 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.200
 I said when the repellent was finished and now 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.330
 I was outside the cave I found 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.430
 with a peeling but fighting against him 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.220
 I realized that my exit had not 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.800
 changed he had a kind of char manel 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.930
 in her tummy as if she were pregnant 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.780
 something scared I beat the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.060
 bichi and continue with my adventure then 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.970

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.520

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.830
 I had black eyes and when I beat 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.800

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.009
 this blood and I got a message that 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.259
 said you should not have bought this game and I 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.320
 appeared reed is evolving 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.200
 but I said how can it evolve if 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.960

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.630
 abomination was a reddish tinge with 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.330
 red routines and black eyes then 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.400

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.260

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.410

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.890
 he did not believe it until the evolution of 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.920
 sanitat left the game boy and ate 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.740

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.720

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.239
 there they took me to the psychologist and here 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.310
