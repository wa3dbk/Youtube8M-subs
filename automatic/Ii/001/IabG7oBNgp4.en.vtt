little circle in there just to show a
bit<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.379> light<00:00:17.570> now<00:00:18.570> another<00:00:18.930> thing<00:00:19.050> I've

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
bit of light now another thing I've

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.570 
bit of light now another thing I've
noticed<00:00:20.240> from<00:00:21.240> studying<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.930> sort<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.289> style

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
noticed from studying this sort of style

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.150 
noticed from studying this sort of style
is<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.359> older<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.080> character<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
is that the older the character is the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.000 
is that the older the character is the
smaller<00:00:26.519> their<00:00:26.910> eyes<00:00:27.150> are<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:28.410> if<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.769> see

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
smaller their eyes are so if you can see

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.450 
smaller their eyes are so if you can see
sonic<00:00:29.460> had<00:00:29.910> fairly<00:00:30.750> small<00:00:31.080> eyes<00:00:31.340> where<00:00:32.340> our

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
sonic had fairly small eyes where our

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.530 
sonic had fairly small eyes where our
tails<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.649> comparison<00:00:34.649> are<00:00:35.309> quite<00:00:35.520> large<00:00:35.760> in

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
tails in comparison are quite large in

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.299 
tails in comparison are quite large in
his<00:00:36.750> head<00:00:37.340> again<00:00:38.340> Amy<00:00:39.320> very<00:00:40.320> big<00:00:41.070> eyes

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
his head again Amy very big eyes

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.910 
his head again Amy very big eyes
compared<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.360> shadows<00:00:42.780> which<00:00:43.559> are<00:00:43.680> quite

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
compared to shadows which are quite

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.270 
compared to shadows which are quite
small<00:00:44.960> so<00:00:45.960> depending<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.680> age<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.129> your

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
small so depending on the age of your

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:58.920 
small so depending on the age of your
character<00:00:48.530> you<00:00:49.530> want<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.950> make<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:54.300> eyes

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.280 

reflect<00:00:59.830> the<00:01:00.100> age<00:01:00.720> all<00:01:01.720> right<00:01:01.900> and<00:01:02.080> I<00:01:02.260> just

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
reflect the age all right and I just

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.670 
reflect the age all right and I just
find<00:01:02.740> that<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:03.160> do<00:01:03.570> draw<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.629> little<00:01:04.930> circle

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
find that to do draw the little circle

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.810 
find that to do draw the little circle
of<00:01:06.120> light<00:01:07.120> shine<00:01:07.450> in<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.050> ice<00:01:08.170> last<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.520> then

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
of light shine in the ice last and then

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.200 
of light shine in the ice last and then
draw<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.920> people<00:01:12.430> just<00:01:13.030> underneath<00:01:13.540> it<00:01:13.780> just

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
draw the people just underneath it just

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.600 
draw the people just underneath it just
like<00:01:16.210> that

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
like that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.210 
like that
all<00:01:18.610> right<00:01:18.729> so<00:01:18.970> that's<00:01:19.710> pretty<00:01:20.710> much<00:01:20.830> a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
all right so that's pretty much a

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.170 
all right so that's pretty much a
general<00:01:21.810> body<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:24.280> this<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:24.670> could<00:01:24.850> go<00:01:25.000> on

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
general body for this you could go on

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.350 
general body for this you could go on
and<00:01:25.869> add<00:01:26.440> anything<00:01:26.770> that<00:01:27.190> you<00:01:27.670> sort<00:01:27.970> of<00:01:28.090> want

males but whatever character in the
drawing<00:02:21.209> I've<00:02:22.209> noticed<00:02:22.720> they<00:02:22.900> all<00:02:23.049> seem<00:02:23.350> to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
drawing I've noticed they all seem to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.670 
drawing I've noticed they all seem to
have<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:24.190> different<00:02:24.700> sort<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.230> shape<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:28.680> try

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
have a different sort of shape so try

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.650 
have a different sort of shape so try
not<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:30.010> make<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.610> if<00:02:30.730> you're<00:02:30.880> drawing<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.180> banjo

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
not to make it if you're drawing a banjo

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.750 
not to make it if you're drawing a banjo
to<00:02:31.900> try<00:02:32.110> not<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.410> make<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.709> too<00:02:32.739> similar<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.489> an

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
to try not to make it too similar to an

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.520 
to try not to make it too similar to an
official<00:02:34.209> character<00:02:36.269> for<00:02:37.269> that<00:02:37.299> purpose<00:02:37.989> I'm

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
official character for that purpose I'm

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.150 
official character for that purpose I'm
just<00:02:38.890> going<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.250> draw<00:02:40.049> sort<00:02:41.049> of<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> ring<00:02:41.590> shape

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
just going to draw sort of a ring shape

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.270

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.900 

then<00:02:46.270> depending<00:02:46.510> on<00:02:46.990> his<00:02:47.290> species<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:48.700> want

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
then depending on his species you want

in<00:07:01.390> and<00:07:01.770> at<00:07:02.770> least<00:07:03.040> identify<00:07:03.910> you<00:07:03.970> didn't

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
in and at least identify you didn't

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.570 
in and at least identify you didn't
later<00:07:04.450> add<00:07:04.720> in<00:07:04.990> at<00:07:05.800> the<00:07:05.920> pencil<00:07:06.340> stage

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
later add in at the pencil stage

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.460 
later add in at the pencil stage
sometimes<00:07:07.120> I<00:07:07.240> find<00:07:07.450> it<00:07:07.570> a<00:07:07.630> bit<00:07:07.660> easier<00:07:08.200> to<00:07:08.230> do

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
sometimes I find it a bit easier to do

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.000 
sometimes I find it a bit easier to do
that<00:07:08.620> because<00:07:09.480> just<00:07:10.480> keep<00:07:11.080> on<00:07:11.260> going<00:07:11.530> over<00:07:11.860> and

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.010 
that because just keep on going over and

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.600 
that because just keep on going over and
over<00:07:12.250> with<00:07:12.400> pencils<00:07:12.880> can<00:07:13.030> make<00:07:13.270> it<00:07:13.450> quite<00:07:14.610> hard

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.610 
over with pencils can make it quite hard

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.840 
over with pencils can make it quite hard
to<00:07:16.320> make<00:07:17.320> out<00:07:17.530> the<00:07:18.010> features<00:07:18.490> that<00:07:18.640> you<00:07:18.730> want

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:18.850 
to make out the features that you want

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.520 
to make out the features that you want
to<00:07:19.030> keep<00:07:21.510> so<00:07:22.510> I've<00:07:22.630> just<00:07:22.660> gone<00:07:22.930> over<00:07:22.990> him<00:07:23.380> with

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:23.530 
to keep so I've just gone over him with

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.420 
to keep so I've just gone over him with
ink<00:07:23.760> and<00:07:24.760> he<00:07:25.120> really<00:07:25.390> stands<00:07:25.690> out<00:07:25.990> now<00:07:26.170> and<00:07:26.800> so

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.430 
ink and he really stands out now and so

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.940 
ink and he really stands out now and so
I<00:07:27.700> just<00:07:28.270> leave<00:07:28.420> him<00:07:28.600> to<00:07:28.630> dry<00:07:28.870> and<00:07:29.620> then<00:07:29.800> I'll

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:31.950 
I just leave him to dry and then I'll

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.060 
I just leave him to dry and then I'll
erase<00:07:32.950> the<00:07:33.790> pencil<00:07:33.970> lines<00:07:34.270> and<00:07:34.860> once<00:07:35.860> that's

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.070 
erase the pencil lines and once that's

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.450 
erase the pencil lines and once that's
done<00:07:36.750> you<00:07:37.750> can<00:07:37.780> color<00:07:38.170> them<00:07:38.320> in<00:07:38.500> however<00:07:39.160> you

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:39.460 
done you can color them in however you

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.440 
done you can color them in however you
want<00:07:39.700> and<00:07:41.010> you<00:07:42.010> can<00:07:42.040> use<00:07:42.280> pencils<00:07:42.820> you<00:07:43.120> can<00:07:43.180> use

felt<00:07:46.330> tip<00:07:46.540> pen<00:07:46.840> I<00:07:47.520> personally<00:07:48.520> like<00:07:49.170> scanning

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.170 
felt tip pen I personally like scanning

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.190 
felt tip pen I personally like scanning
them<00:07:50.410> into<00:07:50.620> my<00:07:50.740> computer<00:07:51.220> and<00:07:52.080> coloring<00:07:53.080> them

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:53.200 
them into my computer and coloring them

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.860 
them into my computer and coloring them
in<00:07:53.350> with<00:07:54.070> either<00:07:54.250> gift<00:07:54.760> shop<00:07:55.030> or<00:07:55.330> paint<00:07:55.630> shop

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:55.870 
in with either gift shop or paint shop

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.610 
in with either gift shop or paint shop
and<00:07:57.630> hopefully<00:07:58.630> I'll<00:07:58.960> be<00:07:59.080> doing<00:07:59.350> a<00:07:59.440> tutorial

00:07:59.610 --> 00:07:59.620 
and hopefully I'll be doing a tutorial

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.090 
and hopefully I'll be doing a tutorial
on<00:08:00.220> how<00:08:00.400> to<00:08:00.430> and<00:08:01.000> do<00:08:01.990> that<00:08:02.170> at<00:08:02.440> a<00:08:02.500> later<00:08:02.740> date

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:03.100 
on how to and do that at a later date

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.600 
on how to and do that at a later date
but<00:08:03.600> that's<00:08:04.600> just<00:08:04.960> sort<00:08:05.140> of<00:08:05.230> a<00:08:05.320> generic<00:08:05.650> sonic

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:06.610 
but that's just sort of a generic sonic

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.010 
but that's just sort of a generic sonic
character<00:08:08.700> if<00:08:09.700> you'd<00:08:09.880> like<00:08:10.030> me<00:08:10.720> to<00:08:10.750> do

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.020 
character if you'd like me to do

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.190 
character if you'd like me to do
tutorials<00:08:11.470> on<00:08:11.860> sort
