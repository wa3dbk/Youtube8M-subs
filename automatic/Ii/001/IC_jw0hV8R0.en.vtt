00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:07.240
 what do people wave about everything like 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.970
 welcome to this first one is almost with 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.580
 clavero book with chlorine how the fuck what 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.620
 means good if you notice that if the 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.200
 micro are many super different is 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.359
 because I had to use better 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.460
 said the microphone of the series styles 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.010
 of the headphones because it breaks my 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.779
 standing microphone so I'll be coming soon 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.039
 to buy a condenser microphone 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.430
 first clarified a couple of little things that 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:37.120
 because he plays a map of 1.6 of a and 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.100
 in this case that is bkz gold that brings me 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.260
 some memories and one you are not 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.200
 incredible does not mean that I'm going to play 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.690
 in my ex psa bledo what the fuck is 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.670
 1.6 because they always ask me then 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.170
 well let's see with the map happened to me 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.140
 we talked, we talked a little bit about 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.190
 little things 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.559
 First 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.440
 as you know on Friday Mick 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.350
 last week I said explicitly that 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.860
 I was going to upload a video of cc.oo booth 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.860
 what happened I searched on voice maps and 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.190
 cc.oo and they are very bad did not show any 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.590
 the sample for nothing 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.940
 so good that then said good 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.610
 because it was not 1.6 and play booth 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.550
 only the maps he played when I 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.910
 played and have a bit of that nostalgia 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.340
 to step up a bit of 61.6 that 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.390
 As you know, I do not upload any more guides and everything 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.340
 that's because he died at a competitive level 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.920
 but to have a lot of good fun 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.490
 go up a little bit and 1.6 of what would be 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.870
 this the little map of a house and then 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.910
 What I wanted is for you to improve in 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.910
 description the maps you like the most 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.220
 of booth or a and that are not very 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.070
 difficult because you already know that I 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.520
 I'm a little house that only lj does not come out 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.130
 in fart so good that wants to bring 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.680
 a little that that 1.6 nothing serious already 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.580
 I said is for fun and a little while 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.660
 when shed 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.650
 not to do more guides and all that 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.950
 because if it is not clear in case 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.800
 doubts and good nothing that's what you 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.820
 I wanted to warn before the whole map that 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.690
 we are when I told him that here 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.910
 it's world pop it's amazing how much 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.000
 what was this map when I was just 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.760
 just he is beginning to play plays with 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.680
 some friends and I fall rise sincerely 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.769
 I love 40 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.540
 so well this is the first map of 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.060
 next week it's going to be the one 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.340
 you recommend me that I do not know if the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.739
 What are the most likes, so check if 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.060
 for example for comments and see 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.920
 Good thing I put the map that you gave 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.840
 like to give a little hand up the 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.760
 comment of that boy then I go 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.799
 seeing that you would like the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.510
 next Wednesday no stadiums in a 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.030
 come up on Wednesday I hope we can 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.660
 uploading them up followed to have more 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.120
 content 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.920
 in the channel because nowadays we are 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.520
 with guidance on Mondays and Fridays 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.100
 mick on Friday so good 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.600
 we will be what I am 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.880
 counting I want to buy a microphone 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.170
 capacitor that is capacitor is a 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.750
 microphone that is used to record in 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.180
 home studios to record 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.330
 instruments or voices or make podcasts 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.220
 so you know what podcast and podcast is 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.080
 is simply doing an online radio or 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.730
 something like that just to see the 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.970
 microphone and I could use the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.970
 true 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.580
 the truth would see me very well because of 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.270
 pass the generic microphone with which 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.730
 I was recording taping guide 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.900
 Monday and then it had to be golden 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.900
 in the car and I fell like a bitch 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.220
 so decent 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.900
 and good and all this is a mess that good 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.370
 is if you save you save time and you 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.230
 increases quality by buying microphone on 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.150
 condenser that 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.890
 They were recommending me for the page 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.019
 and I asked some some me 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.450
 recommended in sant submit the samsung 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.030
 very small meteor my judgment microphone 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.280
 well, it seems pretty pretty good 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.360
 I saw a couple of sound tests after me 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.300
 I found out that you were punched and also tns 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.850
 what more then recommended me the blues 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.190
 set and it can be or something like that 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.570
 microphone they make it in europe I think so 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.580
 what 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.970
 I doubt that it is in mercadolibre and if this 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.030
 free market to come out an egg 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.440
 the truth I know if I go for that and I was 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.760
 seeing other microphones that I 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.040
 They also recommended that they are quite 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.380
 good ones that are not so expensive and neither 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.450
 they are the great thing but they are condenser 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.620
 so I'll obviously have a lot 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.360
 better sound quality which is what 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.740
 I want to do, I 'll go investing 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.110
 little bit in the channel for me still away 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.110
 is my mom my most hated enemy 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.919
 is the whore who gave birth 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.470
 well the microphone is the first one after 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.450
 I finish the pc they always ask me 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.740
 you have a pc in which I throw you how much 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.600
 I knew if here in that second I have a 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.820
 good pc sincerely the only thing 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.400
 rescatable on my pc is the video plate 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.620
 the rest has gone down and the source the rest 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.710
 it's pretty old 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.150
 today 4 minutes 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.370
 already 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.350
 the video plate good in the most affable of 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.760
 that old source except for the 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.460
 source that I want to change everything 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.550
 little bit of love 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.259
 and everything that would be presence if 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.419
 I want to see that despite now 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.090
 go to the description go to the link of 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.520
 tweets that is from where to the stream 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.430
 they go down and this says my pc and it appears 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.930
 all the hardware that I use I do not think 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.220
 nothing else quite cortito video 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.080

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.270
 short content that they can see and that 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.819
 do not leave time so nothing else 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.520
 leave a like if you want more booth with 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:53.009

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.910
