it's<00:00:41.739> a<00:00:41.800> bit<00:00:41.950> late<00:00:42.100> in<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.309> season<00:00:42.520> I<00:00:42.640> probably

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
it's a bit late in the season I probably

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.569 
it's a bit late in the season I probably
should<00:00:43.030> have<00:00:43.090> done<00:00:43.149> this<00:00:43.360> a<00:00:43.540> few<00:00:43.600> weeks<00:00:43.870> ago

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
should have done this a few weeks ago

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.410 
should have done this a few weeks ago
considering<00:00:45.579> now<00:00:45.670> that<00:00:45.879> it's<00:00:46.000> like<00:00:46.180> you<00:00:46.329> know

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
considering now that it's like you know

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.090 
considering now that it's like you know
freezing<00:00:46.930> temperatures<00:00:47.350> it's<00:00:47.590> like<00:00:47.739> 32

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
freezing temperatures it's like 32

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.340 
freezing temperatures it's like 32
degrees<00:00:48.489> right<00:00:48.670> now<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.840> you<00:00:49.960> know<00:00:50.140> who<00:00:50.289> knows

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
degrees right now but you know who knows

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.470 
degrees right now but you know who knows
maybe<00:00:50.680> we'll<00:00:50.800> come<00:00:50.950> out<00:00:51.100> one<00:00:51.309> solid<00:00:51.789> chunk<00:00:52.059> so

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
maybe we'll come out one solid chunk so

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.020 
maybe we'll come out one solid chunk so
let's<00:00:52.660> see<00:00:52.780> what<00:00:52.809> we<00:00:52.989> get<00:00:53.789> alright<00:00:54.789> so<00:00:54.910> I<00:00:54.969> got

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
let's see what we get alright so I got

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.319 
let's see what we get alright so I got
the<00:00:55.300> plug<00:00:55.600> off<00:00:55.840> had<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.559> use<00:00:56.710> a<00:00:56.739> bit<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.039> a<00:00:57.329> have

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
the plug off had to use a bit of a have

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.810 
the plug off had to use a bit of a have
a<00:00:58.480> wrench<00:00:58.719> on<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:59.050> bottom<00:00:59.379> here<00:00:59.620> and<00:01:00.520> nothing

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
a wrench on the bottom here and nothing

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.639 
a wrench on the bottom here and nothing
came<00:01:01.180> out<00:01:01.420> so<00:01:01.930> I<00:01:01.989> guess<00:01:02.109> I'm<00:01:02.289> gonna<00:01:02.410> have<00:01:02.500> to

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
came out so I guess I'm gonna have to

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.280 
came out so I guess I'm gonna have to
push<00:01:03.129> it<00:01:03.160> down<00:01:03.460> from<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:03.969> top<00:01:04.210> so<00:01:05.049> you<00:01:05.080> got<00:01:05.229> to

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
push it down from the top so you got to

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.990 
push it down from the top so you got to
go<00:01:05.409> get<00:01:05.560> like<00:01:05.650> a<00:01:05.710> little<00:01:05.830> pipe<00:01:06.189> or<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.460> doll<00:01:06.970> or

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
go get like a little pipe or a doll or

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.910 
go get like a little pipe or a doll or
something<00:01:07.330> push<00:01:08.049> it<00:01:08.200> down<00:01:08.320> we'll<00:01:08.590> see<00:01:08.710> what<00:01:08.830> we

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
something push it down we'll see what we

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.280 
something push it down we'll see what we
get<00:01:09.010> well<00:01:09.310> I<00:01:09.340> waited<00:01:10.000> too<00:01:10.030> long<00:01:10.390> it's<00:01:11.049> all

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
get well I waited too long it's all

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.140 
get well I waited too long it's all
frozen<00:01:11.619> down<00:01:12.040> here<00:01:12.430> at<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.580> bottom<00:01:12.670> so<00:01:13.890> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
frozen down here at the bottom so I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.249 
frozen down here at the bottom so I
gotta<00:01:16.150> let<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.420> fall<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.659> little<00:01:16.840> bit<00:01:17.080> be<00:01:17.229> a

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
gotta let it fall a little bit be a

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.109 
gotta let it fall a little bit be a
little<00:01:17.290> warmer<00:01:17.710> temperature<00:01:18.159> you<00:01:18.820> can<00:01:18.939> see

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
little warmer temperature you can see

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.920 
little warmer temperature you can see
though<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.299> do<00:01:19.659> my<00:01:19.840> own<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:22.000> little<00:01:22.540> seal<00:01:22.810> that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
though that do my own a little seal that

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.740 
though that do my own a little seal that
I<00:01:22.990> had<00:01:23.200> around<00:01:23.909> kind<00:01:24.909> of<00:01:24.939> cracked<00:01:25.240> off<00:01:25.450> it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
I had around kind of cracked off it

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.539 
I had around kind of cracked off it
doesn't<00:01:26.020> like<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.259> cold<00:01:26.409> too<00:01:26.619> much<00:01:26.799> but<00:01:27.369> this

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
doesn't like the cold too much but this

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:28.890 
doesn't like the cold too much but this
is<00:01:27.729> some<00:01:27.909> of<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.090> stuff<00:01:28.299> that<00:01:28.330> I<00:01:28.509> chipped<00:01:28.720> out

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
is some of the stuff that I chipped out

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.710 
is some of the stuff that I chipped out
there<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.460> all<00:01:30.610> nice<00:01:30.820> worm<00:01:31.119> casting

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
there and that is all nice worm casting

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.109 
there and that is all nice worm casting
compost<00:01:32.200> so<00:01:32.650> I<00:01:32.710> think<00:01:33.009> I<00:01:33.189> think<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.729> idea<00:01:33.820> is

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
compost so I think I think the idea is

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.010 
compost so I think I think the idea is
that<00:01:34.299> it<00:01:34.930> worked<00:01:35.170> pretty<00:01:35.350> well<00:01:35.619> if<00:01:36.340> you<00:01:36.670> if<00:01:37.329> you

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
that it worked pretty well if you if you

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.730 
that it worked pretty well if you if you
clean<00:01:38.259> the<00:01:38.380> pipe<00:01:38.590> out<00:01:38.939> before<00:01:39.939> it<00:01:40.090> freezes

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
clean the pipe out before it freezes

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.950 
clean the pipe out before it freezes
which<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:41.890> did<00:01:42.070> not<00:01:42.250> I'm<00:01:42.430> sorely<00:01:43.240> behind<00:01:43.689> on

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
which I did not I'm sorely behind on

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.700 
which I did not I'm sorely behind on
everything<00:01:44.140> here

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.980 

alright<00:01:48.370> guys<00:01:48.549> so<00:01:48.760> we're<00:01:48.880> about<00:01:49.030> um<00:01:49.270> maybe

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you can see there's a it's all broken up

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.880 
you can see there's a it's all broken up
there's<00:02:03.759> a<00:02:03.850> tag<00:02:04.150> in<00:02:04.390> there<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:05.560> there's<00:02:05.740> still

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
there's a tag in there and there's still

there's a tag in there and there's still
a<00:02:05.920> few<00:02:06.159> worms<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:06.610> there<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:08.500> this<00:02:08.679> stuff<00:02:08.860> is

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
a few worms in there but this stuff is

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.610 
a few worms in there but this stuff is
all<00:02:09.239> ready<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.390> roll<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:10.959> could<00:02:11.110> use<00:02:11.260> this<00:02:11.410> as

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
all ready to roll you could use this as

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.210 
all ready to roll you could use this as
a<00:02:11.760> compost<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.870> whenever<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.260> really<00:02:15.010> didn't

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
a compost and whenever I really didn't

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.510 
a compost and whenever I really didn't
have<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.430> whole<00:02:15.730> lot<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:16.330> stuff<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.310> tube

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
have a whole lot of stuff in the tube

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.460 
have a whole lot of stuff in the tube
this<00:02:18.970> year<00:02:19.239> because<00:02:19.420> mainly<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:19.810> put<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.200> into

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
this year because mainly I put it into

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.160 
this year because mainly I put it into
the<00:02:20.650> actual<00:02:21.640> compost<00:02:22.209> bins<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.810> things<00:02:23.019> like

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
the actual compost bins and things like

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.699 
the actual compost bins and things like
that<00:02:23.230> but<00:02:23.670> next<00:02:24.670> year<00:02:24.910> what<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.060> plan<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.360> do<00:02:25.630> is

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
that but next year what I plan to do is

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.729 
that but next year what I plan to do is
I'll<00:02:26.709> be<00:02:27.100> putting<00:02:27.340> all<00:02:27.459> my<00:02:27.489> juicing<00:02:28.380> pulp<00:02:29.380> into

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
I'll be putting all my juicing pulp into

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.690 
I'll be putting all my juicing pulp into
this<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.700> in<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.930> spring<00:02:32.200> I'll<00:02:33.070> fire<00:02:33.519> it<00:02:33.550> up

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
this and in the spring I'll fire it up

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.640 
this and in the spring I'll fire it up
with<00:02:33.850> about<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.060> thousand<00:02:34.600> worms<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.530> can

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
with about a thousand worms and you can

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.100 
with about a thousand worms and you can
see<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:36.100> still<00:02:37.000> got<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> few<00:02:37.330> little<00:02:37.450> worms<00:02:37.750> in

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
see I still got a few little worms in

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.380 
see I still got a few little worms in
there<00:02:38.380> they're<00:02:39.310> not<00:02:39.519> I<00:02:39.880> don't<00:02:40.030> think<00:02:40.330> that

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
there they're not I don't think that

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.690 
there they're not I don't think that
they're<00:02:40.600> going<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.810> survive<00:02:41.170> honestly<00:02:41.800> the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
they're going to survive honestly the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.440 
they're going to survive honestly the
winner<00:02:43.110> just<00:02:44.110> because<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:45.190> dirt<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.670> above

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
winner just because the dirt is above

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.479 
winner just because the dirt is above
the<00:02:46.480> ground<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.230> it'll<00:02:47.980> probably<00:02:48.160> freeze

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
the ground and it'll probably freeze

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.759 
the ground and it'll probably freeze
solid<00:02:48.730> all<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.060> way<00:02:49.180> through<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:50.350> but<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
solid all the way through so but in the

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.410 
solid all the way through so but in the
springtime<00:02:51.040> listed<00:02:51.519> thaws<00:02:51.730> out<00:02:51.940> it'll<00:02:52.329> be

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
springtime listed thaws out it'll be

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.449 
springtime listed thaws out it'll be
ready<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.750> roll<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.709> i<00:02:53.860> think<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.130> worms<00:02:54.310> are

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
ready to roll and i think the worms are

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.850 
ready to roll and i think the worms are
about<00:02:54.640> twenty<00:02:54.910> thirty<00:02:55.120> bucks<00:02:55.360> so<00:02:56.140> pretty

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
about twenty thirty bucks so pretty

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.819 
about twenty thirty bucks so pretty
decent<00:02:57.190> investment<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:57.790> they<00:02:58.630> did<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.870> did<00:02:59.799> a

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
decent investment and they did a did a

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.470 
decent investment and they did a did a
good<00:03:00.010> job<00:03:00.070> compost<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:00.910> all<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.150> stuff<00:03:01.239> down

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
good job compost and all that stuff down

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.449 
good job compost and all that stuff down
so<00:03:01.810> that's<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.620> benefit<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.010> having<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.310> worm

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
so that's the benefit of having the worm

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.430 
so that's the benefit of having the worm
casting<00:03:04.230> calm<00:03:05.230> poster<00:03:05.680> tube<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.760> middle

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
casting calm poster tube in the middle

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.979 
casting calm poster tube in the middle
this<00:03:08.440> is<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:09.070> four<00:03:09.280> inch<00:03:09.430> tube<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:10.810> could

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
this is the the four inch tube you could

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.440 
this is the the four inch tube you could
use<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.200> six-inch<00:03:11.829> someone<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.820> posted<00:03:13.180> up<00:03:13.269> on

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
use a six-inch someone you posted up on

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.680 
use a six-inch someone you posted up on
on<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.829> original<00:03:15.250> build<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.970> comment<00:03:16.570> about

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
on the original build a comment about

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.370 
on the original build a comment about
checking<00:03:17.230> with<00:03:17.380> plumbing<00:03:18.010> supplies<00:03:18.660> or<00:03:19.660> like

electricians and things like that you

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.460 
electricians and things like that you
may<00:03:22.000> have<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.329> work<00:03:22.360> with<00:03:22.660> PVC<00:03:22.989> they<00:03:23.260> may<00:03:23.410> have

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
may have to work with PVC they may have

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.890 
may have to work with PVC they may have
scraps<00:03:23.860> left<00:03:24.130> over<00:03:24.340> that's<00:03:25.329> a<00:03:25.450> definitely<00:03:25.810> a

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
scraps left over that's a definitely a

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.720 
scraps left over that's a definitely a
great<00:03:26.110> option<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.769> get<00:03:27.459> a<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:28.660> know<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.810> cheap

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
great option to get a you know a cheap

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.870 
great option to get a you know a cheap
you<00:03:30.730> know<00:03:30.930> pipe<00:03:31.930> for<00:03:32.859> your<00:03:32.980> needs<00:03:33.190> if<00:03:33.579> you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
you know pipe for your needs if you

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.050 
you know pipe for your needs if you
choose<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.329> do<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.930> then<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:36.060> hardware

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
choose to do that and then the hardware

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.880 
choose to do that and then the hardware
the<00:03:37.269> little<00:03:37.780> top<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.620> screw<00:03:39.340> in<00:03:40.739> thing<00:03:41.739> at

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
the little top and the screw in thing at

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.000 
the little top and the screw in thing at
the<00:03:42.010> bottom<00:03:42.190> here<00:03:43.049> those<00:03:44.049> are<00:03:44.260> pretty<00:03:44.410> pretty

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
the bottom here those are pretty pretty

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.069 
the bottom here those are pretty pretty
cheap<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:46.090> pipe<00:03:46.299> is<00:03:46.480> what's<00:03:46.720> expensive

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
cheap so the pipe is what's expensive

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.650 
cheap so the pipe is what's expensive
especially<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:48.010> six-inch<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:49.209> if<00:03:49.359> you<00:03:49.480> have

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
especially the six-inch so if you have

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.479 
especially the six-inch so if you have
an<00:03:49.780> opportunity<00:03:50.140> try<00:03:50.829> that<00:03:51.010> out<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.340> maybe

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
an opportunity try that out and maybe

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.900 
an opportunity try that out and maybe
you'll<00:03:51.670> get<00:03:51.850> a<00:03:52.329> good<00:03:53.109> option<00:03:53.579> so<00:03:54.579> there<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.790> go

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
you'll get a good option so there you go
