one<00:00:54.110> of<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.290> things<00:00:54.500> that<00:00:54.650> Larry<00:00:54.860> does<00:00:55.040> really

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
one of the things that Larry does really

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.100 
one of the things that Larry does really
well<00:00:55.370> is<00:00:55.640> make<00:00:55.940> these<00:00:56.180> multi-layered

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
well is make these multi-layered

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.440 
well is make these multi-layered
characters<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:57.830> I<00:00:57.860> think<00:00:58.070> for<00:00:58.400> just<00:00:59.300> the

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
characters and I think for just the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.660 
characters and I think for just the
story<00:00:59.780> in<00:00:59.930> general<00:01:00.410> it's<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:00.860> follows<00:01:01.400> the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
story in general it's it follows the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.570 
story in general it's it follows the
codes<00:01:01.880> essential<00:01:02.360> for<00:01:03.020> film<00:01:03.380> plot<00:01:03.710> lines<00:01:04.010> but

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
codes essential for film plot lines but

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.760 
codes essential for film plot lines but
the<00:01:05.120> characters<00:01:05.660> are<00:01:05.870> so<00:01:06.140> unique<00:01:06.500> in

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
the characters are so unique in

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.510 
the characters are so unique in
themselves<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.760> think<00:01:08.360> that's<00:01:08.510> very<00:01:08.600> cool

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
themselves and I think that's very cool

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.560 
themselves and I think that's very cool
this<00:01:10.520> was<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.820> right<00:01:10.940> thing<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.180> do

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
this was the right thing to do

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.859 
this was the right thing to do
what<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:13.310> know<00:01:13.430> getting<00:01:13.880> everyone<00:01:14.720> together

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
what you know getting everyone together

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.500 
what you know getting everyone together

future<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:41.020> I<00:04:41.919> think<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.580> um<00:04:42.960> once<00:04:43.960> people

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
future and I think that um once people

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.820 
future and I think that um once people
see<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:45.400> potential<00:04:45.790> behind<00:04:46.150> it<00:04:46.510> of<00:04:47.260> getting

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
see the potential behind it of getting

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.000 
see the potential behind it of getting
to<00:04:48.160> interact<00:04:48.490> with<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.540> drama<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.860> you're
