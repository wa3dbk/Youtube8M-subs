00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.020 
resemble you can attach your character
to<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.330> base<00:01:13.159> like<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.549> when<00:01:14.729> I'm<00:01:14.850> drawing

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
to a base like and when I'm drawing

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.030 
to a base like and when I'm drawing
aerial<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.689> mean<00:01:15.930> she's<00:01:16.080> not<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> human<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.920> this

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
aerial I mean she's not a human in this

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.060 
aerial I mean she's not a human in this
picture<00:01:17.689> but<00:01:18.689> she's<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.930> mermaid<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.890> half<00:01:20.040> a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
picture but she's a mermaid but half a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.580 
picture but she's a mermaid but half a
verse<00:01:20.369> human<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> base<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.350> start

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
verse human so I have a base to start

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.219 
verse human so I have a base to start
off<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> first<00:01:24.600> thing<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.020> is

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
off with and so the first thing to do is

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.899 
off with and so the first thing to do is
to<00:01:25.439> go<00:01:25.590> back<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> original<00:01:26.130> anatomy<00:01:26.880> of

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
to go back to the original anatomy of

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.069 
to go back to the original anatomy of
what<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.600> base<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.970> go<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.570> look<00:01:30.600> at

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
what that base is so I go and I look at

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.679 
what that base is so I go and I look at
how<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:32.159> human<00:01:32.280> torso<00:01:32.640> from<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.540> belly

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
how the human torso from the belly

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.590 
how the human torso from the belly
button<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:34.110> how<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.920> works<00:01:35.240> how<00:01:36.240> things<00:01:36.479> are

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
button up how it works how things are

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.240 
button up how it works how things are
connected<00:01:36.810> even<00:01:37.439> though<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.799> might<00:01:37.920> not<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.220> in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
now a lot of people say I'm tracing is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.230 
now a lot of people say I'm tracing is
bad<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:36.830> isn't<00:02:37.190> actually<00:02:37.310> it's<00:02:37.850> not<00:02:38.060> bad

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
bad it isn't actually it's not bad

bad it isn't actually it's not bad
what's<00:02:38.450> bad<00:02:38.690> about<00:02:38.720> tracing<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.440> if<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:39.650> trace

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
what's bad about tracing is if you trace

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.710 
what's bad about tracing is if you trace
something<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.430> then<00:02:40.520> you<00:02:40.580> say<00:02:40.760> look<00:02:41.450> at<00:02:41.600> the

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
something and then you say look at the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.380 
something and then you say look at the
picture<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.170> drew<00:02:42.290> all<00:02:42.530> by<00:02:42.680> myself<00:02:43.390> because

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
picture I drew all by myself because

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.880 
picture I drew all by myself because
it's<00:02:44.510> not<00:02:44.630> your<00:02:44.780> pictures<00:02:45.110> of<00:02:45.290> tracing<00:02:45.710> at<00:02:45.800> the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
it's not your pictures of tracing at the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.680 
it's not your pictures of tracing at the
copy<00:02:46.100> that's<00:02:46.880> some<00:02:47.030> analysis

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
copy that's some analysis

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.290 
copy that's some analysis
what's<00:02:48.020> good<00:02:48.350> about<00:02:48.380> tracing<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:50.000> then

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
what's good about tracing is you then

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.580 
what's good about tracing is you then
learn<00:02:50.630> how<00:02:50.660> those<00:02:51.260> lines<00:02:51.590> flow<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:53.440> get<00:02:54.440> some

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
as reference because it just breaks the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.790 
as reference because it just breaks the
characters<00:03:16.790> down<00:03:17.000> into<00:03:17.780> their<00:03:18.140> simple<00:03:18.560> shapes

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
characters down into their simple shapes

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.320 
characters down into their simple shapes
so<00:03:19.370> if<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.520> have<00:03:19.610> coloring<00:03:19.880> books<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.180> those

so if you have coloring books of those

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.690 
so if you have coloring books of those
characters<00:03:20.720> check<00:03:21.530> take<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.920> look<00:03:22.130> at<00:03:22.190> those<00:03:22.370> up

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
characters check take a look at those up

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.120 
characters check take a look at those up
close<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.420> trace<00:03:24.020> them<00:03:24.290> or<00:03:24.500> draw<00:03:24.680> next<00:03:24.920> to

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
them try to recreate imitation is the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.640 
them try to recreate imitation is the

little style and take and you can fight
it<00:05:15.050> or<00:05:15.169> embrace<00:05:15.349> it<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:15.860> I<00:05:15.919> say<00:05:16.129> embrace<00:05:16.430> it

it or embrace it and I say embrace it
the<00:05:16.759> last<00:05:17.000> step<00:05:17.330> is<00:05:17.569> to<00:05:17.900> not<00:05:18.050> give<00:05:18.289> up<00:05:18.439> when

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
the last step is to not give up when

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.409 
the last step is to not give up when
you're<00:05:19.009> being<00:05:19.189> children<00:05:19.550> to<00:05:19.729> draw<00:05:19.909> character

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
you're being children to draw character

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.029 
you're being children to draw character
ya<00:05:20.840> may<00:05:21.080> just<00:05:21.319> not<00:05:21.409> turn<00:05:21.650> out<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.919> way<00:05:21.949> you

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
ya may just not turn out the way you

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.249 
ya may just not turn out the way you
want<00:05:22.400> to<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:22.909> don't<00:05:22.939> give<00:05:23.180> up<00:05:23.330> on<00:05:23.509> it<00:05:23.539> I<00:05:23.840> did

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
want to and don't give up on it I did

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:25.869 
want to and don't give up on it I did
this<00:05:24.379> picture<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.710> Pocahontas<00:05:24.979> and<00:05:25.310> tell<00:05:25.789> you

this picture of Pocahontas and tell you
the<00:05:26.000> truth<00:05:26.150> when<00:05:26.330> I<00:05:26.360> first<00:05:26.779> started<00:05:27.139> it<00:05:27.289> I

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
the truth when I first started it I

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.309 
the truth when I first started it I
hadn't<00:05:27.949> drawn<00:05:28.099> a<00:05:28.129> lot<00:05:28.310> of<00:05:28.370> Pocahontas<00:05:28.669> before

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
hadn't drawn a lot of Pocahontas before

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.499 
hadn't drawn a lot of Pocahontas before
and<00:05:30.319> so<00:05:30.589> when<00:05:30.680> I<00:05:30.710> started<00:05:30.979> drawing<00:05:31.190> pareja<00:05:31.729> and

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
and so when I started drawing pareja and

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.680 
and so when I started drawing pareja and
I<00:05:32.569> almost<00:05:32.810> decided<00:05:33.650> just<00:05:34.129> to<00:05:34.699> toss<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.330> paper

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
I almost decided just to toss the paper

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.680 
I almost decided just to toss the paper
and<00:05:36.310> forget<00:05:37.310> about<00:05:37.339> it<00:05:37.490> but<00:05:38.270> I<00:05:38.300> thought<00:05:38.449> no<00:05:38.629> I'm

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
and forget about it but I thought no I'm

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.119 
and forget about it but I thought no I'm
gonna<00:05:38.810> persevere<00:05:39.259> and<00:05:39.440> see<00:05:39.620> how<00:05:39.800> well<00:05:39.979> I<00:05:40.009> can

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:40.129 
gonna persevere and see how well I can

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:41.980 
gonna persevere and see how well I can
turn<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:40.460> out<00:05:40.610> and<00:05:40.819> so<00:05:41.270> I<00:05:41.300> kept<00:05:41.509> working<00:05:41.690> with
