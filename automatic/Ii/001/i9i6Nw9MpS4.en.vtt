00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.720
 hi and welcome to my channel afp 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.940
 today I am going to present to you 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.019
 how to change your cache 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.269
 bird there is not a lot of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.949
 people who do this kind of videos 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.590
 so I told myself why 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.210
 not do it would be interesting so 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.550
 here I leave you with following the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.560
 video 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.720
 so I have draws holidays I I 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.850
 rinse and and rio doing 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.630
 especially unlike them too so 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.930
 we will attack step 1 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:43.079
 so that's actually putting the do 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.890
 so less in the background I escape the fight 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.800
 yesterday I'm going paperweight since 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.010
 I was not actually grid 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.260
 put litter so no 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.809
 so I put two slices of paper 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:05.150
 sopalin can join the newspaper no 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:12.780
 so that's my first step is made 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:13.920
 annoyance bonus that I know it 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.540
 means he is happy question 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.360
 sir was leaving my brief I you 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.330
 leave with the continuation that is made of 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.119
 step 2 so so step 2 is from 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.159
 give food so if you do not read the 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.280
 same grain besides they are less 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.500
 alright so it's the same he even mac 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.869
 to room wins it there are more because 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.049
 that when we saw giving the seeds to 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.110
 the pet store she gave to is there 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.540
 so it's giving him food 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.810
 so it's really important that he has 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.060
 a diet with bananas 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.969
 dried chilli because it makes him 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.320
 talk about sunflower seeds but he 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.829
 do not give too much because otherwise 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.729
 it blocks the cold and it reduces its 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.860
 life expectancy 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:10.090
 So here I fulfill all that is 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.040
 I will find you after step 3 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.660
 it's actually giving him a good drink 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.030
 can be part of the stage for sorry 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.250
 let's generate cd yes it 'll be part of 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.120
 step 2 but I decided the stage 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.940
 transparent 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.440
 so in fact I'm mixing but of 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.440
 hot water but like hot water 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.360
 it comes out a little tepid and ben me this 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.750
 I'm doing is that I read bah 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.930
 a lot and after I'm called others 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.230
 believers see January up to the dregs in 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.230
 love 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.299
 here and therefore low price
