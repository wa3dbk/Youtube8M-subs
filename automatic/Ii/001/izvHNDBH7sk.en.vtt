it<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> Disney<00:00:33.780> character<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:35.219> won't<00:00:35.399> see

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
it is a Disney character so we won't see

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.930 
it is a Disney character so we won't see
his<00:00:35.640> butt<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.000> much<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:37.430> yeah<00:00:38.430> it's

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
his butt that much this yeah it's

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.549 
his butt that much this yeah it's
actually<00:00:39.149> not<00:00:39.480> plated<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:39.930> anything<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
actually not plated with anything it is

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.380 
actually not plated with anything it is
the<00:00:40.890> plastic<00:00:41.399> underneath<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the plastic underneath so it is a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.060 
the plastic underneath so it is a
possibility<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.200> we<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.620> keep<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.920> in

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
possibility that we have to keep that in

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.440 
possibility that we have to keep that in
there<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> might<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.640> able<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.879> sever<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.329> oh

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
there and I might be able to sever it oh

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.590 
there and I might be able to sever it oh
yeah<00:00:48.719> yeah<00:00:48.930> yeah<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.329> will

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
yeah yeah yeah and then just it it will

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.250 
yeah yeah yeah and then just it it will
not<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> resistance<00:00:52.590> anymore

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
not have the resistance anymore

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.600 
not have the resistance anymore
resistance<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.410> futile<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:56.250> we're<00:00:56.430> trying

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
resistance is futile what we're trying

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.750 
resistance is futile what we're trying
to<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.270> take<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.809> very<00:00:58.350> impressive<00:00:59.100> gonzo
