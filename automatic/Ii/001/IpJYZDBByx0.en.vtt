00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
time at all times but no I can't how do

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.560 
time at all times but no I can't how do
I<00:05:50.350> think<00:05:50.590> this<00:05:51.520> out<00:05:51.820> as<00:05:52.060> I<00:05:52.150> have<00:05:52.270> a<00:05:52.300> hundred

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
I think this out as I have a hundred

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.969 
I think this out as I have a hundred
percent<00:05:52.630> which<00:05:53.470> gives<00:05:53.680> me<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:54.120> 160<00:05:55.120> shoe<00:05:55.300> and

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
percent which gives me a 160 shoe and

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.100 
percent which gives me a 160 shoe and
wait<00:05:56.979> no<00:05:57.100> I<00:05:57.130> can<00:05:57.630> because<00:05:58.630> I<00:05:58.660> have<00:05:58.810> a<00:05:58.870> hundred

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
wait no I can because I have a hundred

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.760 
wait no I can because I have a hundred
percent<00:05:59.200> and<00:05:59.800> I<00:05:59.919> have<00:06:00.010> a<00:06:00.070> 50-percent<00:06:00.750> yay<00:06:02.669> I

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
percent and I have a 50-percent yay I

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.129 
percent and I have a 50-percent yay I
was<00:06:05.770> really<00:06:06.070> really<00:06:06.190> k

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.800 

so<00:06:11.139> they<00:06:11.259> get<00:06:11.349> built<00:06:11.560> one<00:06:11.770> at<00:06:11.889> a<00:06:11.949> time<00:06:12.689> at<00:06:13.689> all

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
so they get built one at a time at all

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.600 
so they get built one at a time at all
times<00:06:15.360> x<00:06:16.360> 10<00:06:16.659> I<00:06:16.870> have<00:06:17.740> completed<00:06:18.129> Isaac

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
times x 10 I have completed Isaac

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.279 
times x 10 I have completed Isaac
Newton's<00:06:18.939> college<00:06:19.330> but<00:06:19.689> I<00:06:19.719> do<00:06:19.840> not<00:06:20.139> get

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
Newton's college but I do not get

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:21.839 
Newton's college but I do not get
anything<00:06:20.560> for<00:06:20.830> it<00:06:20.919> because<00:06:21.099> I<00:06:21.280> think<00:06:21.669> that's

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:21.849 
anything for it because I think that's

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:26.640 
anything for it because I think that's
broken<00:06:22.560> so<00:06:23.560> I<00:06:24.479> video<00:06:25.479> wise<00:06:25.719> not<00:06:25.990> like<00:06:26.319> bonus

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
broken so I video wise not like bonus

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.839 
broken so I video wise not like bonus
wise<00:06:26.830> i<00:06:27.039> actually<00:06:27.280> build<00:06:27.400> that<00:06:27.490> for<00:06:27.669> a<00:06:27.699> reason

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:27.849 
wise i actually build that for a reason

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:35.520 
wise i actually build that for a reason
yay<00:06:28.710> so<00:06:30.960> next<00:06:31.960> time<00:06:32.400> we<00:06:33.400> actually<00:06:33.580> prepare<00:06:34.530> for

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
yay so next time we actually prepare for

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:41.399 
yay so next time we actually prepare for
the<00:06:35.830> war<00:06:36.270> I<00:06:37.270> guess<00:06:39.479> I'm<00:06:40.479> still<00:06:40.690> war<00:06:40.990> with<00:06:41.169> both

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409 
the war I guess I'm still war with both

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.420 
the war I guess I'm still war with both
of<00:06:41.440> them<00:06:41.860> I<00:06:42.509> fleet<00:06:43.509> as<00:06:43.719> mighty<00:06:44.069> but<00:06:45.069> I<00:06:45.280> am

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
of them I fleet as mighty but I am

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.119 
of them I fleet as mighty but I am
mightier<00:06:46.020> because<00:06:47.020> I<00:06:47.050> am<00:06:47.379> head<00:06:47.650> of<00:06:47.680> military

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:48.129 
mightier because I am head of military

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:53.399 
mightier because I am head of military
operations<00:06:49.560> so<00:06:50.560> um<00:06:51.599> we<00:06:52.599> thought<00:06:52.810> I<00:06:52.840> like<00:06:53.080> 10

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:53.409 
operations so um we thought I like 10

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:55.920 
operations so um we thought I like 10
seconds<00:06:53.710> but<00:06:54.400> i<00:06:54.430> think<00:06:54.849> i'm<00:06:55.000> going<00:06:55.240> to<00:06:55.419> cut<00:06:55.690> the

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
seconds but i think i'm going to cut the

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.199 
seconds but i think i'm going to cut the
commentary<00:06:56.469> off<00:06:56.680> here<00:06:58.199> later
