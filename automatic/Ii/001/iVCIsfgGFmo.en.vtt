 commented that it does not represent playstation 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.409
 not necessarily the future of 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.780
 playstation 3 and playstation sorry 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:51.629
 playstation 3 or playstation 4 or 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.059
 any of its consoles the channel of 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.489
 physical distribution or consumption 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.729
 physical remains relevant to 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.650
 sonic and it will continue to be 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.620
 lacks playstation girlfriend you know the 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.530
 new game streaming service 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.850
 game cloud cloud gaming for 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.970
 playstation consoles and others 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.510
 devices was the news bomb of 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.520
 yesterday in 2014 and opened a path 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.230
 new to the distribution of content in 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.800
 the front of the sun and you know 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.230
 many users have thought that good 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.450
 all part of leaving this new 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.950
 generation of consoles because they talked about 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.320
 that these same things not to the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.860
 playstation 4 in the xbox one outside alone 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.620
 of digital format and that has been talked about and 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.400
 it has been rumored very much right 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.140
 Microsoft a few days ago recognized that 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.750
 they simply raised a console 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.190
 digital but I with reading one of the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.400
 responsible for sony computer 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.470
 entertainment america wanted to point out 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.330
 that this new approach does not 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.730
 necessarily implies the path that 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.980
 will follow the playstation consoles in 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.940
 the future what happens with a 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.070
 hypothetical play station 5 that says and 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.530
 as it is informed I will start to be 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.750
 conceived very soon is still by 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.790
 see neither they themselves do not know in addition 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.280
 from just remember that the channel 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.820
 traditional distribution will continue and continues 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.380
 being fundamental among your plans in 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.320
 his own words to the computation of the 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.420
 videogames playstation does not have big 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.860
 benefits because it has and allows you 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.990
 play instantly 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.240
 solving one of the problems of the 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.600
 industry what we have to solve 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.180
 and we have it done is by 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.490
 example start the download path 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.890
 progressive that place 14 is doing 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.600
 many progress and now with playstation 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.160
 move we get people to play 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.080
 instantaneously regardless of 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.630
 if you're in a playstation in a 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.510
 conventional television on the tablet or 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.940
 in a telephone truth is that I already 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.880
 I said yesterday and I think they are and the 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.400
 biggest problem is the connection of 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.310
 Internet that we have each user in 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.340
 our house and that's going to depend on that 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.290
 that you already know zone has explained me 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.750
 I think he has done it obligatorily and 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.520
 he has done very well since they do not go 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.130
 to abandon the physical format because no 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.660
 they are interested in this for the pasta 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.239
 because they know they would lose all their 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.580
 business and the world is not prepared 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.970
 as we know it today we 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.440
 the players for the format 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.200
 exclusively digital you already know how 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.730
 always informing the last 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.730
 see you in the next
