errands<00:04:45.539> I<00:04:45.780> understand<00:04:46.470> that<00:04:46.729> example<00:04:47.729> our

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
errands I understand that example our

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.270 
errands I understand that example our
parents<00:04:48.150> are<00:04:48.300> amazing<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:48.930> i<00:04:49.740> may<00:04:49.889> get<00:04:50.039> one

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
parents are amazing and i may get one

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.060 
parents are amazing and i may get one
group<00:04:50.610> eventually<00:04:50.940> but<00:04:51.539> i<00:04:51.930> really<00:04:52.530> prefer<00:04:52.680> the

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
group eventually but i really prefer the

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.480 
group eventually but i really prefer the
Knights<00:04:53.250> exemplar<00:04:54.710> just<00:04:55.710> because<00:04:56.039> they<00:04:56.340> have

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
Knights exemplar just because they have

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.300 
Knights exemplar just because they have
way<00:04:56.820> more<00:04:56.849> hitting<00:04:57.360> power<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:58.250> though<00:04:59.250> you

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
way more hitting power and though you

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.279 
way more hitting power and though you
could<00:04:59.669> argue<00:04:59.849> it<00:05:00.120> both<00:05:00.330> ways<00:05:00.570> seeing<00:05:00.930> as<00:05:01.110> the

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
could argue it both ways seeing as the

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.260 
could argue it both ways seeing as the
errands<00:05:01.889> have<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.190> crossbow<00:05:02.639> and<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.030> sword

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
errands have the crossbow and the sword

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.029 
errands have the crossbow and the sword
and<00:05:03.509> they<00:05:04.050> do<00:05:04.110> have<00:05:04.229> i<00:05:04.620> believe<00:05:04.800> they<00:05:04.889> have<00:05:05.009> a

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
and they do have i believe they have a
