00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.510
 In general , of course they recommend completely 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.450
 disassemble the system block that is to 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.210

 I grew my own experience 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.700
 just gently wipe the feeling not 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.890
 it was necessary to disassemble anything because 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.290
 but there are people who are allowed 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.670

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.440

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.410
 We are waiting for all the thoughts 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.280

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:49.810

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.150
 more looking at how you will have a computer 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:26.280
