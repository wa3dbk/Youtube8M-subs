example which is an old vest I made some
years<00:00:20.250> ago<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.880> knitted<00:00:21.720> around<00:00:22.440> this<00:00:22.710> corner

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
years ago I knitted around this corner

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.960 
years ago I knitted around this corner
then<00:00:24.330> around<00:00:24.990> here<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.680> made<00:00:26.340> another<00:00:26.640> turn

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
then around here and made another turn

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.500 
then around here and made another turn
here<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.600> up<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.620> so<00:00:29.460> let's<00:00:29.700> see<00:00:30.150> how<00:00:30.330> this

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
here and up here so let's see how this

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.930 
here and up here so let's see how this
is<00:00:30.720> done<00:00:31.050> it's<00:00:31.350> especially<00:00:31.830> good<00:00:32.279> for<00:00:32.340> button

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
is done it's especially good for button

bands<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.219> technique<00:00:35.730> you're<00:00:36.030> going

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
bands to do this technique you're going

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.989 
bands to do this technique you're going
to<00:00:36.420> need<00:00:36.629> ribber<00:00:36.899> weights<00:00:37.280> in<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.460> couple<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:38.999 
to need ribber weights in a couple of

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:42.799 
to need ribber weights in a couple of
sizes<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.940> you're<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.179> to<00:00:42.300> need<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> edge

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
sizes and you're going to need the edge

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.489 
sizes and you're going to need the edge
Wade<00:00:43.260> holders<00:00:43.800> I've<00:00:44.039> got<00:00:44.280> two<00:00:44.609> of<00:00:44.760> them<00:00:44.940> here

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:45.499 
Wade holders I've got two of them here

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:48.169 
Wade holders I've got two of them here
there<00:00:46.499> are<00:00:46.589> sometimes<00:00:46.859> called<00:00:47.339> seven<00:00:47.969> Wade

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
there are sometimes called seven Wade

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.059 
there are sometimes called seven Wade
holders<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.230> they're<00:00:49.440> shaped<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
holders because they're shaped like a

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:57.469 
holders because they're shaped like a
seven<00:00:54.589> to<00:00:55.589> demonstrate<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.429> technique<00:00:57.089> I'm

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
seven to demonstrate this technique I'm

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.869 
seven to demonstrate this technique I'm
using<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.140> bulky<00:00:58.559> machine<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.339> I've

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
using the bulky machine and I've

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.669 
using the bulky machine and I've
threaded<00:01:00.179> it<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:00.839> some<00:01:01.050> worsted<00:01:01.499> weight

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
threaded it up with some worsted weight

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.919 
threaded it up with some worsted weight
yarn<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.309> it'll<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.579> big<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.179> easy<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
yarn so it'll be big and easy for you to

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.310 
yarn so it'll be big and easy for you to

ribbing<00:01:29.280> now<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.509> need<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.899> set<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> carriages

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
ribbing now I need to set the carriages

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.980 
ribbing now I need to set the carriages
correctly<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.359> to<00:01:33.630> work<00:01:34.070> on<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.750> main

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
here over so that it is on H that will

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.310 
here over so that it is on H that will
give<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.850> your<00:01:44.880> short<00:01:45.390> row<00:01:45.600> setting<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.289> that

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
give you your short row setting so that

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.800 
give you your short row setting so that
it<00:01:46.590> slips<00:01:47.039> when<00:01:47.399> you're<00:01:47.609> holding<00:01:48.210> some<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
it slips when you're holding some of the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.289 
it slips when you're holding some of the
needles<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.679> doesn't<00:01:50.100> knit<00:01:50.280> them<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.609> just<00:01:50.640> runs

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
needles it doesn't knit them I just runs

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.929 
needles it doesn't knit them I just runs
the<00:01:51.509> yarn<00:01:51.719> over<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.200> ignores<00:01:52.560> them<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the yarn over and ignores them on the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.319 
the yarn over and ignores them on the
river<00:01:54.179> it<00:01:54.630> has<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> one<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.280> two<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
river it has a one and a two on the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.779 
river it has a one and a two on the
outside<00:01:57.380> edge<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.799> little<00:01:59.159> metal<00:01:59.399> lever

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
outside edge and a little metal lever

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.260 
outside edge and a little metal lever
and<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:01.350> put<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.740> lever<00:02:02.039> down<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.060> one

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
and you put that lever down on the one

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.760 
and you put that lever down on the one
now<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.659> have<00:02:03.929> to<00:02:04.109> do<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.499> both<00:02:04.710> sides

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
now you have to do it on both sides

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.080 
now you have to do it on both sides
there's<00:02:05.549> one<00:02:05.759> over<00:02:05.909> here<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:07.130> set<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.399> way<00:02:08.670> it

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
there's one over here to set that way it

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.350 
there's one over here to set that way it
will<00:02:09.330> ignore<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.229> held<00:02:10.500> needles<00:02:11.160> now<00:02:12.060> let's

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
will ignore the held needles now let's

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.199 
will ignore the held needles now let's
begin<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.780> actual<00:02:13.440> turn<00:02:13.950> I've<00:02:14.310> done<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> number

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
begin the actual turn I've done a number

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.510

can<00:06:53.040> I'm<00:06:54.030> also<00:06:54.390> going<00:06:54.780> to<00:06:54.840> reach<00:06:55.050> between<00:06:55.470> the

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
can I'm also going to reach between the

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.010 
can I'm also going to reach between the
beds<00:06:55.800> and<00:06:56.130> put<00:06:56.370> a<00:06:56.400> small<00:06:56.760> weight<00:06:56.970> on<00:06:57.150> yet<00:06:57.390> at

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
beds and put a small weight on yet at

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.170 
beds and put a small weight on yet at
this<00:06:58.230> point<00:06:58.530> I<00:06:58.680> do<00:06:59.010> have<00:06:59.250> a<00:06:59.280> lot<00:06:59.550> of<00:06:59.580> weight<00:06:59.910> on

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.040 
we have now normally I would bind this

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.180 
we have now normally I would bind this
off<00:07:14.280> but<00:07:14.580> I'm<00:07:14.820> going<00:07:15.150> to<00:07:15.210> just<00:07:15.480> drop<00:07:15.780> it<00:07:16.020> off

look<00:07:26.100> at<00:07:26.250> this<00:07:26.370> terrific<00:07:27.090> looking<00:07:27.300> bed<00:07:27.870> in<00:07:28.290> the

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 
look at this terrific looking bed in the

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.130 
look at this terrific looking bed in the
ribbing<00:07:28.890> this<00:07:29.550> looks<00:07:29.820> good<00:07:30.090> on<00:07:30.390> both<00:07:30.510> sides

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.140 
ribbing this looks good on both sides

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.460 
ribbing this looks good on both sides
because<00:07:31.830> I<00:07:32.070> was<00:07:32.340> careful<00:07:32.850> to<00:07:32.880> wrap<00:07:33.270> so<00:07:34.110> either

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470 
because I was careful to wrap so either

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.040 
because I was careful to wrap so either
side<00:07:34.890> could<00:07:35.190> be<00:07:35.340> the<00:07:35.490> right<00:07:35.700> side<00:07:36.060> think<00:07:36.870> of

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.050 
side could be the right side think of

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.270 
side could be the right side think of
all<00:07:37.200> the<00:07:37.350> things<00:07:37.590> you<00:07:37.770> could<00:07:37.950> do<00:07:38.070> with<00:07:38.250> that

could go around a blanket you can use it

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.250 
could go around a blanket you can use it
