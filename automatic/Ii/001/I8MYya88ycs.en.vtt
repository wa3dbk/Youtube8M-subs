00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.300 
it it may not look look nice but I want
the<00:02:21.780> viewers<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.230> understand<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> little<00:02:22.860> bit<00:02:23.070> I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
the viewers to understand a little bit I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.390 
the viewers to understand a little bit I
thought<00:02:23.730> issues<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.450> think<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:26.010> main<00:02:26.190> problem

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
thought issues I think the main problem

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.700 
thought issues I think the main problem
was<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.510> area<00:02:27.870> where<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.500> year

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
was that this area where the year

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.880 
was that this area where the year
normally<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:30.000> full<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.870> scars<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.740> have

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
normally is is full of scars and I have

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.640 
normally is is full of scars and I have
a<00:02:31.920> very<00:02:32.100> short<00:02:32.490> time<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:33.030> bring<00:02:33.840> out<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.350> scars

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
a very short time to bring out the scars

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.650 
a very short time to bring out the scars
and<00:02:35.040> give<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.670> ear<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.120> normal<00:02:36.510> position

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
and give the ear in a normal position

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.020 
and give the ear in a normal position
that<00:02:37.620> year<00:02:37.800> have<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.160> be<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> little<00:02:38.550> bit<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:38.910> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
that year have to be a little bit in the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.550 
that year have to be a little bit in the
front<00:02:39.330> but<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:40.500> have<00:02:40.650> no<00:02:40.800> time<00:02:41.070> we<00:02:41.340> have<00:02:41.460> only<00:02:41.730> i

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
front but we have no time we have only i

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.160 
front but we have no time we have only i
think<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.709> was<00:02:43.890> around<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.790> month<00:02:45.000> they<00:02:45.360> was<00:02:45.630> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
think it was around a month they was the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.600 
think it was around a month they was the
other<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.440> slovakia<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.280> here<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.580> a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
other in slovakia so the here is a

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.660 
other in slovakia so the here is a
little<00:02:47.910> bit<00:02:48.110> backwards<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:50.190> was<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
little bit backwards and this was the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.780 
little bit backwards and this was the
only<00:02:50.700> chance<00:02:51.330> he<00:02:51.720> used<00:02:52.650> here<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.070> flap<00:02:53.370> from

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
only chance he used here a flap from

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.170 
only chance he used here a flap from
from<00:02:54.240> this<00:02:54.420> part<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.900> head<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.740> I<00:02:56.550> have<00:02:56.790> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
from this part of head and I have the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.410 
from this part of head and I have the
only<00:02:57.510> chance<00:02:57.950> use<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> flap<00:02:59.490> from<00:02:59.880> here<00:03:00.270> and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
only chance use a flap from here and

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.310 
only chance use a flap from here and
cover<00:03:01.970> prosthesis<00:03:02.970> which<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.959> from<00:03:04.230> a

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
cover prosthesis which is from a

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.040 
cover prosthesis which is from a
biomaterial<00:03:05.300> produced<00:03:06.300> in<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.630> united

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
biomaterial produced in the united

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.370 
biomaterial produced in the united
states<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.300> chance<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.110> flap

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
states and the the chance that the flap

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.560 
states and the the chance that the flap
is<00:03:11.220> living<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:12.320> much<00:03:13.320> more<00:03:13.650> smaller<00:03:14.459> than<00:03:14.910> this

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
is living is much more smaller than this

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.160 
is living is much more smaller than this
flat<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.060> did<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.390> first<00:03:18.600> operation

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
flat so you did the first operation

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.960 
flat so you did the first operation

do I want to create the lower part of

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.930 
do I want to create the lower part of
the<00:03:37.860> year<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:39.780> was<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:40.049> short<00:03:40.830> operation<00:03:41.760> in

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
local anesthesia so no general

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.509 
local anesthesia so no general
anesthesia<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:45.450> first<00:03:45.720> operation<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:46.950> it

in bratislava in the university hospital
where<00:03:59.459> I'm<00:03:59.580> working<00:04:00.290> this<00:04:01.290> second<00:04:01.650> operation

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
where I'm working this second operation

where I'm working this second operation
do<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:02.970> think<00:04:03.180> this<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.600> going<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.870> be<00:04:03.959> the

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
do you think this is going to be the

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.070 
do you think this is going to be the
final<00:04:04.350> one<00:04:04.440> worried<00:04:04.739> will<00:04:05.160> he<00:04:05.340> need<00:04:05.519> more<00:04:06.080> we

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
final one worried will he need more we

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.670 
final one worried will he need more we
are<00:04:07.200> limited<00:04:07.820> because<00:04:08.820> we<00:04:09.480> have<00:04:09.780> in<00:04:10.470> the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
are limited because we have in the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.009 
are limited because we have in the
normal<00:04:11.070> region<00:04:11.519> where<00:04:11.760> we<00:04:11.910> can<00:04:12.180> where<00:04:12.720> I<00:04:12.750> can

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
normal region where we can where I can

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.920 
normal region where we can where I can
do<00:04:13.200> something<00:04:13.500> there<00:04:14.400> are<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.970> lot<00:04:15.420> of<00:04:15.450> scars

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
do something there are a lot of scars

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.960 
do something there are a lot of scars
and<00:04:16.229> these<00:04:16.680> scars<00:04:17.180> limits

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
and these scars limits

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.140 
and these scars limits
the<00:04:19.540> next<00:04:20.049> procedures<00:04:20.560> what<00:04:20.799> we<00:04:21.040> can<00:04:21.250> maybe<00:04:21.730> do

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
the next procedures what we can maybe do

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.760 
the next procedures what we can maybe do
but<00:04:22.420> I<00:04:22.720> think<00:04:23.200> we<00:04:23.770> can<00:04:23.800> no<00:04:24.130> more<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:25.680> do<00:04:26.680> you

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
but I think we can no more to do you

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.370 
but I think we can no more to do you
think<00:04:27.010> you'll<00:04:27.160> ever<00:04:27.460> look<00:04:27.910> like<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.570> normal<00:04:29.050> air

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
think you'll ever look like a normal air
