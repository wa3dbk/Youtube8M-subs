 soon, however, to our correspondents 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.540
 still managed to talk with the authors 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.370
 some games were the first to be caught 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.730
 the developers of the mystical thriller order 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.210

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.660
 centuries 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.000
 kind of historical authenticity 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.940
 speech does not go Galahad and his colleagues 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.309

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.510
 paranormal abilities they instantly 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.460
 heal wounds and slow down time 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.649
 thanks to the mysterious black water 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.509
 these gentlemen are shooting not only at people 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.399
 but their rather creepy beasts are not 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.390
 really want to meet in the dark 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:13.789
 London lane would not say that in 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.890
 the game has a lot of scary moments but there are 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.840
 episodes when the hero is alone 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.840
 and all kinds of horrors rush at him 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.460
 having played enough at night watch 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.250

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.130
 part so the players have no problem 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.350
 united in clubs 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.100

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.880
 We have such high months 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.880
 detail requirements 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.010

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.590

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.650
 each country has 11 tracks and 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.720
 In addition, 55 times and each will be 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.000
 changing weather conditions dynamically and 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.400
 time of day and to make realistic 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.170
 the starry sky developers checked with 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.690
 data of the American space 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.520
 agencies beating a few races we 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.440
 set off to the rag planet 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.080
 little men and met with the authors 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.080
 little big planet 3 people missing 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.220
 in the new part we introduced three friends 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.870
 our hero 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.940
 they discover brand new ones 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.330
 Opportunities for passing levels 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.340
 for example from juice moving and fast it 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.360
 affects not only your playing style but also 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.560
 on creativity 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.990
 we were assured that the third part 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.390
 all created level players will appear 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.790
 from previous little big planet level 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.530
 of these for a second almost 9 million 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.880
 as we increased the depth of the scenery 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.770
 you can do for example 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.930
 a test game or a game in which 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.930
 characters shoot at the screen from the back 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.159

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.810
