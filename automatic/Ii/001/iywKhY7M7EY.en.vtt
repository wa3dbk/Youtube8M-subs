00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.940
 hello my name is Roma rhythm 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.190
 today I will cook pork in 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.270
 sweet and sour sauce with banana pods 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.270
 beans nuts in cache 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.950
 before you start cooking i will take 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.470
 pickled pork in this case I 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.300
 took me a carb cut it thin 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.210
 straws about symmetry of course on 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:36.390
 half a centimeter this way they did not invent 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.650
 i will take a soy sauce pinch of cinnamon 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.680
 this will be enough to 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.830
 get with an Asian slant taste and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.090
 a pinch of cinnamon komi giving it spicy 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.330
 interestingly expressive taste 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.989
 pork so i will and mix 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.750
 while the pork is marinating I'll heat 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.570
 cooking oil for it I took 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.920
 a small saucepan and already prepared 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.329
 vegetable oil amount approximately 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.710
 grams 400 500 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.239
 it will be enough for that 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.119
 fry pork mass of me practically 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.229
 heated up heated it over medium heat 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.440
 pork me example marinated 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.090
 about 10 minutes is sufficient for this 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.479
 in order to 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.719
 the meat has absorbed all the tastes I will take you 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:24.250
 common potato starch and pork 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:27.100
 I roll potato starch and back 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.869
 send pork in a plate to 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:36.939
 excess starch did not get butter and so 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.979
 fry pork during roasting 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.679
 potato starch create a kind 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.039
 such a shell that does not give out juice 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.049
 from meat is thus preserved 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.179
 urgency persists all taste heave 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.860
 rizzi and carried which 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.860
 whose help is about to wave 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.510
 fry better piecemeal so that the meat does not 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.530
 burned out so you had time to pull out and 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.610
 previous pieces 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.800
 fry literally 30 to 20 to 30 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.060
 seconds how ready to understand what 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.370

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.500

 so pork and fried well here 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.310
 the result should be essentially and 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.880

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.200
