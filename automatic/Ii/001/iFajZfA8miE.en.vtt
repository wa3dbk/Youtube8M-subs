horizon we don't have any real off-road
areas<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.600> can't<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.140> put<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.430> can't

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
areas you can't really put a you can't

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.219 
areas you can't really put a you can't
really<00:01:41.759> put<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> test<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.079> can

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
really put it to a test all you can

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.920 
really put it to a test all you can
really<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:44.850> some<00:01:45.180> truck<00:01:45.509> racing

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
really do is do like some truck racing

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.690 
really do is do like some truck racing
or<00:01:46.049> like<00:01:46.200> some<00:01:46.380> SUV<00:01:46.799> racing<00:01:47.220> with<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.549> and

or like some SUV racing with it and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.399 
or like some SUV racing with it and
that's<00:01:48.299> basically<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.930> because<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.229> can't

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
that's basically it because you can't

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.600 
that's basically it because you can't
really<00:01:49.500> test<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> Range<00:01:50.310> Rovers

off-roading<00:01:51.210> abilities<00:01:51.689> because<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.020> you're

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
off-roading abilities because all you're

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.109 
off-roading abilities because all you're
really<00:01:52.229> doing<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.829> crossing<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.939> I

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
really doing is just crossing like I

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:54.810
