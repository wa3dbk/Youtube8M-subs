00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.780
 apple itself calls it a hobby project 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.430
 is not a fully-fledged project 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.329
 apple is totally devoured then comes 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.980

 it all works seamlessly on its own 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.229
 this app is motivating design 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.850
 children's work a piece of cake 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.829
 well why is the appletv so handy 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.750
 device because I just really effortlessly 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.220
 works and we noticed that as soon as it 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.110
 device has just been installed once on 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.549
 you can also just be in a group with 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.170
 your own app all that then you immediately see 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.880
 your favorite movies too, but you can too 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.950
 start streaming right now because you are 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.060
 logged in via apple pie that do need 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.920
 not all new payment information 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.750
 that they all introduce things and 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.610
 he can immediately buy or rent films from 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.560
 away whatever you wind and that they really whole 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.030
 Also handy news is that you also yes 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.780
 entire library is synced as you 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.219
 want that 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.020
 and if you had films yourself 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.969
 downloaded and want to stream then you must 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.740
 you can import this via 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.759
 itunes on your laptop for that bus 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.170
 stream to your apple tv 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.090
 that is perhaps the biggest disadvantage 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.549
 from this device you can not just 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.590
