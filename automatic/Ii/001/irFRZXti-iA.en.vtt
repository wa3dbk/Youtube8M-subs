this lesson is on to seven this is a

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.380 
this lesson is on to seven this is a
quick<00:00:05.069> lesson<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.549> guys<00:00:05.700> were<00:00:05.879> multiplying

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
quick lesson you guys were multiplying

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.900 
quick lesson you guys were multiplying
using<00:00:06.839> partial<00:00:07.109> products<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:08.340> by<00:00:08.519> now<00:00:08.670> you're

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
using partial products so by now you're

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.370 
using partial products so by now you're
getting<00:00:09.090> used<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.330> your<00:00:09.450> new<00:00:09.510> textbook<00:00:09.990> and

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
getting used to your new textbook and

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.930 
getting used to your new textbook and
and<00:00:10.650> hopefully<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.490> having<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.759> good<00:00:11.880> time

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
with your new teacher and they're doing

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.049 
with your new teacher and they're doing
a<00:00:13.469> good<00:00:13.620> job<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:14.009> your<00:00:14.070> class<00:00:14.309> I'm<00:00:14.610> sure<00:00:14.639> they

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
a good job in your class I'm sure they

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.500 
a good job in your class I'm sure they
are<00:00:15.289> let's<00:00:16.289> go<00:00:16.440> ahead<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.710> begin<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.070> guys<00:00:17.220> so

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
are let's go ahead and begin you guys so

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.300 
are let's go ahead and begin you guys so
the<00:00:18.510> common<00:00:18.840> core<00:00:19.080> strand<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.189> we're

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
the common core strand is here we're

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.599 
the common core strand is here we're
gonna<00:00:21.590> it's<00:00:22.590> right<00:00:22.800> above<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.279> teachers

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
gonna it's right above for the teachers

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.490 
gonna it's right above for the teachers
right<00:00:23.760> there<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:24.930> use<00:00:25.140> place

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
right there so how can we use place

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.580 
right there so how can we use place
value<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.220> partial<00:00:26.640> products<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:28.170> multiply

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
value and partial products to multiply

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.740 
value and partial products to multiply
by<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.220> digit<00:00:29.460> number<00:00:30.000> okay<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.449> that's

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
by a one digit number okay so that's

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.030 
by a one digit number okay so that's
what<00:00:30.840> we're<00:00:30.960> gonna<00:00:31.050> do<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.410> multiply<00:00:31.560> one

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
what we're gonna do is multiply one

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.380 
what we're gonna do is multiply one
digit<00:00:32.369> numbers<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.850> we're<00:00:32.969> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> use<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
digit numbers and we're going to use a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.520 
digit numbers and we're going to use a
place<00:00:33.899> value<00:00:33.930> here<00:00:34.739> okay<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.760> we're<00:00:35.910> gonna

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
place value here okay and we're gonna

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.350 
place value here okay and we're gonna
expand<00:00:37.530> our<00:00:37.710> number<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> quick

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
expand our number so this is a quick

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.470 
expand our number so this is a quick
lesson<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.960> use<00:00:40.920> place<00:00:41.340> value<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.059> partial

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
lesson so use place value and partial

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.369 
lesson so use place value and partial
products<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.140> multiply<00:00:43.620> 8<00:00:43.950> times<00:00:44.989> 183<00:00:45.989> okay

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
products to multiply 8 times 183 okay

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.250 
products to multiply 8 times 183 okay
well<00:00:46.590> let's<00:00:46.770> first<00:00:47.070> estimate<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.300> guys

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
well let's first estimate this you guys

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
well let's first estimate this you guys
to<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> nearest<00:00:49.950> hundred<00:00:50.460> okay<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:50.850> one

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
to the nearest hundred okay so one

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.209 
to the nearest hundred okay so one
hundred<00:00:51.480> eighty<00:00:51.750> three<00:00:52.079> rounds<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> two

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
hundred eighty three rounds up to two

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.100 
hundred eighty three rounds up to two
hundred<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.820> closer<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.210> two<00:00:54.570> hundred<00:00:54.780> do

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
hundred it's closer to two hundred do

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.010 
hundred it's closer to two hundred do
this<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.430> hundred<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.719> eight

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
this then it is to one hundred so eight

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.680 
this then it is to one hundred so eight
times<00:00:58.649> two<00:00:59.010> hundred<00:00:59.280> well<00:00:59.730> eight<00:00:59.940> times<00:01:00.390> two

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
times two hundred well eight times two

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.599 
times two hundred well eight times two
is<00:01:00.719> sixteen<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.920> there's<00:01:02.129> hundreds

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
is sixteen and then there's hundreds

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.210 
is sixteen and then there's hundreds
right<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.420> sixteen<00:01:04.229> hundred<00:01:04.860> or

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
right here so it's sixteen hundred or

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.700 
right here so it's sixteen hundred or
sixteen<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.240> those<00:01:06.450> two<00:01:06.720> zeros<00:01:07.140> right<00:01:07.439> there

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
sixteen with those two zeros right there

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.640 
sixteen with those two zeros right there
okay<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:08.939> thousand<00:01:09.570> six<00:01:09.930> hundred<00:01:10.080> right

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
okay so one thousand six hundred right

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.560 
okay so one thousand six hundred right
there<00:01:10.920> okay<00:01:11.250> eight<00:01:11.700> times<00:01:12.060> two<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.299> sixteen

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
there okay eight times two is sixteen

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.510 
there okay eight times two is sixteen
then<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.229> these<00:01:13.409> two<00:01:13.650> zeros<00:01:13.860> remember<00:01:14.340> that

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
then what these two zeros remember that

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.510 
then what these two zeros remember that
okay<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> since<00:01:15.600> two<00:01:16.170> hundred<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.860> larger

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
okay and since two hundred is larger

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.440 
okay and since two hundred is larger
than<00:01:18.080> 183<00:01:19.080> then<00:01:19.970> 1600<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
than 183 then 1600 is going to be a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.719 
than 183 then 1600 is going to be a
little<00:01:21.689> bit<00:01:21.900> larger<00:01:22.380> than<00:01:22.409> whatever<00:01:23.280> eight

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
little bit larger than whatever eight

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.429 
little bit larger than whatever eight
times<00:01:24.500> 183<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.650> okay<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.820> go<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.450> I'm

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
times 183 is okay here we go so here I'm

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.580 
times 183 is okay here we go so here I'm
gonna<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:29.280> drew<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.030> box<00:01:30.750> right<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.560> I

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
gonna I just drew a box right here so I

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.850 
gonna I just drew a box right here so I
here's<00:01:32.220> my<00:01:32.400> 100<00:01:32.759> plus<00:01:33.570> 80<00:01:33.869> plus<00:01:34.140> three

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
here's my 100 plus 80 plus three

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.850 
here's my 100 plus 80 plus three
remember<00:01:35.390> 183<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> hundred<00:01:36.990> plus<00:01:37.350> 80<00:01:37.680> plus

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
remember 183 is a hundred plus 80 plus

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.580 
remember 183 is a hundred plus 80 plus
three<00:01:38.549> okay<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.869> separate<00:01:40.320> them<00:01:40.409> up

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
three okay so if we separate them up

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.499 
three okay so if we separate them up
into<00:01:40.770> rectangles<00:01:41.549> right<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.030> got<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.360> I

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
into rectangles right here I got it I

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.440 
into rectangles right here I got it I
have<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> rectangle<00:01:43.290> eight<00:01:43.829> by<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> hundred<00:01:44.790> here

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
have a rectangle eight by a hundred here

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.960 
have a rectangle eight by a hundred here
I<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> rectangle<00:01:45.960> eight<00:01:46.560> by<00:01:47.009> 80<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.880> then

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
I have a rectangle eight by 80 and then

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.510 
I have a rectangle eight by 80 and then
here<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.420> another<00:01:49.409> rectangle<00:01:50.009> eight<00:01:50.189> by

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
here we have another rectangle eight by

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.760 
here we have another rectangle eight by
three<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.210> there's<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:51.659> hundred<00:01:52.110> eighty<00:01:52.409> three

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
three so there's my hundred eighty three

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.920 
three so there's my hundred eighty three
up<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:53.310> okay<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.240> we're<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.570> go<00:01:54.720> ahead

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
up there okay so we're going to go ahead

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.950 
up there okay so we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:55.020> multiply<00:01:55.340> 183<00:01:56.340> times<00:01:56.579> eight<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.299> here

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
and multiply 183 times eight and here

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.920 
and multiply 183 times eight and here
the<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.130> eight<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.329> eight<00:02:00.570> right<00:02:00.899> here

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the the eight and this eight right here

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.139 
the the eight and this eight right here
and<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.219> 100's<00:02:03.030> are

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
and this one for the 100's are

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.850 
and this one for the 100's are
highlighted<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.930> blue<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.530> we're<00:02:04.680> going<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
highlighted in blue so we're going to

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.399 
highlighted in blue so we're going to
multiply<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:06.270> hundreds<00:02:06.810> okay<00:02:07.170> we're<00:02:07.290> going

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
multiply the hundreds okay we're going

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.830 
multiply the hundreds okay we're going
to<00:02:07.500> multiply<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.860> number<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.700> eight<00:02:09.270> times

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
to multiply this number so eight times

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.390 
to multiply this number so eight times
100<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.920> eight<00:02:11.370> hundred

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
100 is eight hundred

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.979 
100 is eight hundred
okay<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:12.819> I'm<00:02:13.030> gonna<00:02:13.120> go<00:02:13.299> ahead<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.540> shade

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and shade

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.070 
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and shade
this<00:02:14.709> rectangle<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.549> for<00:02:15.879> 800<00:02:16.599> right<00:02:16.840> there

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
this rectangle in for 800 right there

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.860 
this rectangle in for 800 right there
okay<00:02:17.610> easy<00:02:18.610> enough<00:02:19.030> alright<00:02:19.330> then<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.599> next

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
okay easy enough alright then the next

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.949 
okay easy enough alright then the next
thing<00:02:20.019> we're<00:02:20.170> gonna<00:02:20.319> do<00:02:20.560> alright<00:02:21.340> is<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:22.420> we're

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
thing we're gonna do alright is is we're

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.559 
thing we're gonna do alright is is we're
going<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.140> multiply<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:24.489> tens<00:02:24.819> now<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.420> is

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
going to multiply the tens now this is

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.270 
going to multiply the tens now this is
in<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.900> tens<00:02:26.200> right<00:02:26.530> here<00:02:26.799> so<00:02:26.980> we're<00:02:27.129> going<00:02:27.220> to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
in the tens right here so we're going to

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.449 
in the tens right here so we're going to
multiply<00:02:27.400> eight<00:02:28.000> times<00:02:28.840> eight<00:02:29.200> tens<00:02:29.920> okay

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
multiply eight times eight tens okay

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.600 
multiply eight times eight tens okay
well<00:02:30.700> 8<00:02:30.909> times<00:02:31.360> 8<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.599> 64<00:02:32.159> so<00:02:33.159> that's<00:02:33.370> gonna<00:02:33.519> be

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
well 8 times 8 is 64 so that's gonna be

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.500 
well 8 times 8 is 64 so that's gonna be
64<00:02:34.510> tens<00:02:34.959> all<00:02:35.349> right<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:36.069> 64<00:02:36.670> tens<00:02:37.030> it's<00:02:37.360> gonna

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
64 tens all right so 64 tens it's gonna

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.910 
64 tens all right so 64 tens it's gonna
be<00:02:37.950> 640<00:02:38.950> right<00:02:39.159> there<00:02:39.400> here's<00:02:39.970> my<00:02:40.209> 64<00:02:41.140> Tim's

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
be 640 right there here's my 64 Tim's

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.740 
be 640 right there here's my 64 Tim's
right<00:02:42.310> there<00:02:42.549> it<00:02:42.640> ends<00:02:42.849> in<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.060> zero<00:02:43.329> okay<00:02:43.720> so

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
right there it ends in a zero okay so

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.710 
right there it ends in a zero okay so
I've<00:02:44.019> shaded<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.530> one<00:02:44.769> this<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.489> 64<00:02:46.120> tens<00:02:46.450> all

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
I've shaded this one this is 64 tens all

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.210 
I've shaded this one this is 64 tens all
right<00:02:46.840> I'm<00:02:46.959> getting<00:02:47.109> down<00:02:47.379> kind<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.739> low<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.190> I

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
right I'm getting down kind of low so I

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.339 
right I'm getting down kind of low so I
moved<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:48.670> up<00:02:48.790> right<00:02:49.060> there<00:02:49.299> ok<00:02:49.959> now<00:02:49.989> we're

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
moved it up right there ok now we're

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.789 
moved it up right there ok now we're
going<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.500> multiply<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:52.450> ones<00:02:52.750> now<00:02:53.109> the<00:02:53.170> 3<00:02:53.680> is

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
going to multiply the ones now the 3 is

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.610 
going to multiply the ones now the 3 is
in<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:54.069> ones<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:54.910> 8<00:02:55.209> times<00:02:55.780> 3<00:02:56.079> is<00:02:56.319> going<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.560> be

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
in the ones so 8 times 3 is going to be

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.199 
in the ones so 8 times 3 is going to be
24<00:02:57.430> ones

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
24 ones

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.680 
24 ones
okay<00:02:58.810> so<00:02:59.010> 24<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.129> gonna<00:03:00.310> go<00:03:00.519> right<00:03:00.760> here<00:03:00.790> all

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
okay so 24 is gonna go right here all

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.869 
okay so 24 is gonna go right here all
right<00:03:01.900> okay<00:03:02.829> in<00:03:02.980> there<00:03:03.099> so<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.280> see<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.579> dead

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
right okay in there so I see the dead

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.580 
right okay in there so I see the dead
end<00:03:04.090> up<00:03:04.269> there<00:03:04.450> so<00:03:04.690> now<00:03:04.870> what<00:03:05.140> we're<00:03:05.290> gonna<00:03:05.379> do

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
end up there so now what we're gonna do

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.830 
end up there so now what we're gonna do
is<00:03:05.739> add<00:03:05.950> all<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.700> partial<00:03:07.180> products

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
is add all the partial products

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.390 
is add all the partial products
okay<00:03:08.530> so<00:03:08.590> 800<00:03:09.040> plus<00:03:09.750> 640<00:03:10.750> plus<00:03:10.989> 24<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.829> right

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
okay so 800 plus 640 plus 24 is right

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.589 
okay so 800 plus 640 plus 24 is right
here<00:03:12.640> 800<00:03:13.269> plus<00:03:13.480> 640<00:03:14.230> plus<00:03:14.470> 24<00:03:15.040> 4<00:03:15.849> plus<00:03:16.120> 0<00:03:16.150> plus

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
here 800 plus 640 plus 24 4 plus 0 plus

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.740 
here 800 plus 640 plus 24 4 plus 0 plus
0<00:03:16.900> there's<00:03:17.290> 4<00:03:17.680> right<00:03:17.919> there<00:03:17.950> 4<00:03:18.940> plus<00:03:19.269> 2<00:03:19.540> is<00:03:19.569> 6

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
0 there's 4 right there 4 plus 2 is 6

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.830 
0 there's 4 right there 4 plus 2 is 6
and<00:03:20.380> then<00:03:21.069> finally<00:03:21.549> 8<00:03:21.760> plus<00:03:22.090> 6<00:03:22.299> is<00:03:22.540> 14<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:24.840> 1464

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
and then finally 8 plus 6 is 14 so 1464

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.330 
and then finally 8 plus 6 is 14 so 1464
so<00:03:26.200> let's<00:03:26.410> go<00:03:26.769> ahead<00:03:26.919> and<00:03:27.010> answer<00:03:27.130> the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
so let's go ahead and answer the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.140 
so let's go ahead and answer the
question<00:03:27.790> here<00:03:28.060> okay<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:28.980> eight<00:03:29.980> times<00:03:30.900> 183<00:03:31.900> is

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
question here okay so eight times 183 is

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.509 
question here okay so eight times 183 is
1464<00:03:34.150> remember<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.169> guys<00:03:35.349> our<00:03:35.799> estimate<00:03:36.340> was

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
1464 remember you guys our estimate was

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.369 
1464 remember you guys our estimate was
1600<00:03:37.419> so<00:03:37.599> we<00:03:37.750> knew<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.930> was<00:03:38.019> going<00:03:38.169> to<00:03:38.230> be<00:03:38.349> a

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
1600 so we knew it was going to be a

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.259 
1600 so we knew it was going to be a
little<00:03:38.560> bit<00:03:38.769> less<00:03:38.950> than<00:03:39.099> that<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.819> that<00:03:40.000> seems

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
little bit less than that and that seems

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.150 
little bit less than that and that seems
like<00:03:40.389> a<00:03:40.510> reasonable<00:03:40.870> answer<00:03:41.590> right<00:03:41.919> there

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
like a reasonable answer right there

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.439 
like a reasonable answer right there
because<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.519> is<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.669> little<00:03:42.879> bit<00:03:43.090> less<00:03:43.269> than

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
because it is a little bit less than

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.409 
because it is a little bit less than
1600<00:03:44.260> okay<00:03:44.799> explain<00:03:45.160> how<00:03:45.370> we<00:03:45.849> could<00:03:46.030> use<00:03:46.060> the

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
1600 okay explain how we could use the

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.920 
1600 okay explain how we could use the
distributive<00:03:46.840> property<00:03:47.109> to<00:03:47.560> find<00:03:47.829> six<00:03:48.310> times

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
distributive property to find six times

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.879 
distributive property to find six times
328<00:03:49.930> okay<00:03:50.410> well<00:03:50.949> we<00:03:51.160> can<00:03:51.310> expand<00:03:52.079> 328<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.290> 300

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
328 okay well we can expand 328 to 300

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.069 
328 okay well we can expand 328 to 300
plus<00:03:54.129> 20<00:03:54.519> plus<00:03:54.549> 8<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.299> then<00:03:55.750> we<00:03:55.900> can

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
plus 20 plus 8 and then we can

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.449 
plus 20 plus 8 and then we can
distribute<00:03:56.530> through<00:03:57.010> six<00:03:57.340> times<00:03:57.989> 306<00:03:58.989> times

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
distribute through six times 306 times

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.349 
distribute through six times 306 times
26<00:04:00.459> times<00:04:00.639> 8<00:04:01.150> ok<00:04:01.660> 6<00:04:01.989> times<00:04:02.290> 3<00:04:02.620> is<00:04:02.889> 18<00:04:03.459> so<00:04:03.760> an<00:04:03.879> 18

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
26 times 8 ok 6 times 3 is 18 so an 18

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.860 
26 times 8 ok 6 times 3 is 18 so an 18
with<00:04:04.569> two<00:04:04.810> zeros<00:04:05.260> 6<00:04:06.160> times<00:04:06.459> 2<00:04:06.790> is<00:04:06.819> 12<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:07.599> 12

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
with two zeros 6 times 2 is 12 so 12

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.699 
with two zeros 6 times 2 is 12 so 12
with<00:04:08.290> one<00:04:08.319> 0<00:04:08.919> finally<00:04:09.730> 6<00:04:10.030> times<00:04:10.299> 8<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.569> 48<00:04:10.750> so<00:04:11.560> we

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
with one 0 finally 6 times 8 is 48 so we

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.099 
with one 0 finally 6 times 8 is 48 so we
we<00:04:12.190> can<00:04:12.400> get<00:04:12.549> that<00:04:13.120> right<00:04:13.389> there<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.900> then

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
we can get that right there and then

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.930 
we can get that right there and then
when<00:04:14.260> we<00:04:14.410> add<00:04:14.560> all<00:04:14.949> those<00:04:15.160> up<00:04:15.220> we<00:04:15.699> get<00:04:17.459> 1968<00:04:18.459> ok

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
when we add all those up we get 1968 ok

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.390 
when we add all those up we get 1968 ok
easy<00:04:19.449> enough<00:04:19.900> if<00:04:20.139> you<00:04:20.229> just<00:04:20.440> expand<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.250> out

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
easy enough if you just expand it out

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.310 
easy enough if you just expand it out
and<00:04:21.669> then<00:04:22.120> use<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.570> distributive<00:04:23.020> property

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
and then use the distributive property

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.619 
and then use the distributive property
going<00:04:23.979> through<00:04:24.340> right<00:04:24.580> there<00:04:24.849> okay

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:25.629 
going through right there okay

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:28.390 
going through right there okay
all<00:04:26.629> right<00:04:26.780> so<00:04:26.900> use<00:04:27.110> place<00:04:27.439> value<00:04:27.889> and<00:04:27.919> partial

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
all right so use place value and partial

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.179 
all right so use place value and partial
products<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:30.110> multiply<00:04:30.620> 3<00:04:31.069> times<00:04:32.349> 4567<00:04:33.349> okay

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:34.189 
products to multiply 3 times 4567 okay

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:36.879 
products to multiply 3 times 4567 okay
this<00:04:34.460> would<00:04:34.669> round<00:04:34.939> up<00:04:35.150> it's<00:04:35.360> closer<00:04:35.659> to<00:04:35.889> 5,000

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
this would round up it's closer to 5,000

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.709 
this would round up it's closer to 5,000
so<00:04:37.009> we're<00:04:37.129> going<00:04:37.219> to<00:04:37.280> estimate<00:04:38.210> you<00:04:38.539> guys

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:38.719 
so we're going to estimate you guys

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.890 
so we're going to estimate you guys
let's<00:04:39.050> met<00:04:39.259> multiply<00:04:39.710> 3<00:04:40.039> times<00:04:40.180> 5,000<00:04:41.180> well<00:04:41.629> 3

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
let's met multiply 3 times 5,000 well 3

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.350 
let's met multiply 3 times 5,000 well 3
times<00:04:42.169> 5<00:04:42.409> is<00:04:42.439> 15<00:04:42.889> so<00:04:43.520> I'm<00:04:43.610> going<00:04:43.729> to<00:04:43.789> add<00:04:43.939> three

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
times 5 is 15 so I'm going to add three

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.029 
times 5 is 15 so I'm going to add three
zeros<00:04:44.389> to<00:04:44.900> bet<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.229> it's<00:04:45.560> going<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.770> make<00:04:45.889> it

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
zeros to bet that it's going to make it

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.520 
zeros to bet that it's going to make it
15<00:04:46.520> thousand<00:04:47.030> right<00:04:47.210> there<00:04:47.449> and<00:04:47.659> since<00:04:48.289> five

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
15 thousand right there and since five

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.209 
15 thousand right there and since five
thousand<00:04:49.069> is<00:04:49.129> bigger<00:04:49.370> than<00:04:50.319> 4567<00:04:51.319> it's<00:04:52.009> going

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:52.219 
thousand is bigger than 4567 it's going

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:53.800 
thousand is bigger than 4567 it's going
to<00:04:52.280> be<00:04:52.370> less<00:04:52.669> than<00:04:52.699> this<00:04:53.090> right<00:04:53.360> here<00:04:53.569> a<00:04:53.599> little

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
to be less than this right here a little

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.629 
to be less than this right here a little
bit<00:04:54.020> less<00:04:54.259> than<00:04:54.439> this<00:04:54.590> okay<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.370> let's<00:04:55.520> go

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
bit less than this okay so let's go

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.820 
bit less than this okay so let's go
ahead<00:04:55.669> and<00:04:55.909> multiply<00:04:55.969> the<00:04:56.270> 3<00:04:56.810> times<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:57.500> four

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
ahead and multiply the 3 times the four

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.730 
ahead and multiply the 3 times the four
thousands<00:04:58.669> right<00:04:58.849> there<00:04:59.150> okay<00:04:59.509> so<00:04:59.569> 3<00:05:00.379> times<00:05:00.560> 4

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
thousands right there okay so 3 times 4

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.279 
thousands right there okay so 3 times 4
thousands<00:05:01.460> is<00:05:01.550> 12,000<00:05:02.539> so<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.719> have<00:05:02.960> three

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
thousands is 12,000 so I have three

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.050 
thousands is 12,000 so I have three
zeroes<00:05:03.620> for<00:05:03.800> my<00:05:03.919> thousands<00:05:04.460> right<00:05:04.639> here

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
zeroes for my thousands right here

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.300 
zeroes for my thousands right here
now<00:05:05.509> we're<00:05:05.750> going<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:05.930> multiply<00:05:06.050> 3<00:05:06.710> times<00:05:06.740> the

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
now we're going to multiply 3 times the

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.390 
now we're going to multiply 3 times the
500<00:05:08.000> right<00:05:08.270> here<00:05:08.509> 3<00:05:09.110> times<00:05:09.319> the<00:05:09.560> 5<00:05:09.800> hundreds<00:05:10.250> is

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
500 right here 3 times the 5 hundreds is

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.760 
500 right here 3 times the 5 hundreds is
going<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.669> be<00:05:10.759> 15<00:05:11.300> hundreds<00:05:11.780> right<00:05:11.990> there<00:05:12.229> okay

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
going to be 15 hundreds right there okay

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.100 
going to be 15 hundreds right there okay
now<00:05:13.490> we're<00:05:13.639> going<00:05:13.729> to<00:05:13.789> multiply<00:05:13.909> 3<00:05:14.509> times<00:05:14.539> the

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
now we're going to multiply 3 times the

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.279 
now we're going to multiply 3 times the
6<00:05:15.500> tens<00:05:16.069> right<00:05:16.520> there<00:05:16.789> the<00:05:17.360> 6<00:05:17.629> is<00:05:17.779> in<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.050> 10

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
6 tens right there the 6 is in the 10

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.969 
6 tens right there the 6 is in the 10
spot<00:05:18.620> so<00:05:19.190> it's<00:05:19.340> 3<00:05:19.610> times<00:05:19.639> 6<00:05:20.569> tens<00:05:20.870> is<00:05:21.110> 18:10

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
spot so it's 3 times 6 tens is 18:10

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.129 
spot so it's 3 times 6 tens is 18:10
ends<00:05:22.219> up<00:05:22.370> a<00:05:22.550> sub<00:05:22.789> 18<00:05:23.270> with<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.629> zero<00:05:23.870> right

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
ends up a sub 18 with the zero right

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:24.429 
ends up a sub 18 with the zero right
there

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
there

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.820 
there
finally<00:05:25.189> 3<00:05:25.550> times<00:05:25.849> the<00:05:26.060> 7<00:05:26.449> ones<00:05:26.689> 3<00:05:27.080> times<00:05:27.349> 2<00:05:27.469> 7

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
finally 3 times the 7 ones 3 times 2 7

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.570 
finally 3 times the 7 ones 3 times 2 7
ones<00:05:28.009> as<00:05:28.219> 21<00:05:28.610> ones<00:05:29.050> okay<00:05:30.080> so<00:05:31.069> now<00:05:31.279> we're<00:05:31.490> going

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
ones as 21 ones okay so now we're going

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.369 
ones as 21 ones okay so now we're going
to<00:05:31.639> go<00:05:31.819> ahead<00:05:31.909> and<00:05:32.150> add<00:05:32.389> all<00:05:32.810> those<00:05:32.990> partial

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:33.379 
to go ahead and add all those partial

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.140 
to go ahead and add all those partial
products<00:05:34.039> up<00:05:34.219> right<00:05:34.460> there<00:05:34.699> so<00:05:34.909> let's<00:05:34.940> go

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
products up right there so let's go

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.240 
products up right there so let's go
ahead<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:35.479> add<00:05:35.779> 1<00:05:36.110> plus<00:05:36.349> all<00:05:36.560> these<00:05:36.740> zeros<00:05:37.069> is

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
ahead and add 1 plus all these zeros is

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.990 
ahead and add 1 plus all these zeros is
1<00:05:37.550> 2<00:05:38.389> plus<00:05:38.690> 8<00:05:38.960> is<00:05:39.259> 10<00:05:39.650> so<00:05:40.009> I'll<00:05:40.099> put<00:05:40.279> a<00:05:40.310> 0<00:05:40.729> right

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
1 2 plus 8 is 10 so I'll put a 0 right

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.570 
1 2 plus 8 is 10 so I'll put a 0 right
here<00:05:41.029> and<00:05:41.389> carry<00:05:41.629> the<00:05:41.810> 1<00:05:42.050> right<00:05:42.379> here<00:05:42.409> so<00:05:43.250> 1

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
here and carry the 1 right here so 1

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.469 
here and carry the 1 right here so 1
plus<00:05:43.879> 0<00:05:44.210> plus<00:05:44.419> 5<00:05:44.810> plus<00:05:45.199> 1<00:05:45.319> is<00:05:45.500> 7<00:05:46.069> and<00:05:46.430> then<00:05:47.180> no

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
plus 0 plus 5 plus 1 is 7 and then no

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.930 
plus 0 plus 5 plus 1 is 7 and then no
carry<00:05:47.810> so<00:05:48.110> 2<00:05:48.169> plus<00:05:48.589> 1<00:05:48.800> is<00:05:48.830> 3<00:05:49.250> and<00:05:49.279> then<00:05:49.520> finally

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
carry so 2 plus 1 is 3 and then finally

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.869 
carry so 2 plus 1 is 3 and then finally
plus<00:05:50.180> 1<00:05:50.449> ok<00:05:50.810> so<00:05:50.870> I<00:05:51.050> get<00:05:51.379> them<00:05:51.650> we<00:05:52.639> get<00:05:52.870> 1,000

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:54.879 
plus 1 ok so I get them we get 1,000

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:57.790 
plus 1 ok so I get them we get 1,000
13,700<00:05:55.879> 1<00:05:56.150> ok<00:05:56.539> is<00:05:56.750> that<00:05:56.900> reasonable<00:05:57.500> with<00:05:57.650> our

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
13,700 1 ok is that reasonable with our

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.430 
13,700 1 ok is that reasonable with our
rekha<00:05:58.000> estimation<00:05:59.000> yeah<00:05:59.569> it<00:05:59.839> is<00:06:00.020> because<00:06:00.319> the

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
rekha estimation yeah it is because the

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.510 
rekha estimation yeah it is because the
remember<00:06:00.740> we<00:06:00.830> said<00:06:01.039> it<00:06:01.099> was<00:06:01.219> going<00:06:01.310> to<00:06:01.370> be<00:06:01.490> a
