00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.430 

still<00:01:39.910> need<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.240> do<00:01:40.390> some<00:01:40.420> work<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.170> tiles

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440

around<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.160> gas<00:01:42.490> station<00:01:43.260> like<00:01:44.260> to<00:01:44.440> get

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
around the gas station like to get

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.480 
around the gas station like to get
enough<00:01:45.190> dark<00:01:45.790> gray<00:01:46.060> tiles<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.720> kind<00:01:46.990> of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
enough dark gray tiles to kind of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.640 
enough dark gray tiles to kind of
separate<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.760> parking<00:01:49.210> lot<00:01:49.500> from<00:01:50.500> the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
separate the parking lot from the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.710 
separate the parking lot from the
sidewalk<00:01:51.190> so<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:51.910> doesn't<00:01:52.180> all<00:01:52.270> just<00:01:52.540> go

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
sidewalk so it doesn't all just go

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.370 
sidewalk so it doesn't all just go
together<00:01:52.870> like<00:01:53.260> it<00:01:53.440> is<00:01:53.560> right<00:01:53.770> there<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:55.380> I

together like it is right there and I

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.230 
together like it is right there and I
just<00:01:56.620> put<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.890> City<00:01:57.160> Museum<00:01:57.340> here<00:01:57.910> basically

and the the couple cars parked there I

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.960 
and the the couple cars parked there I
was<00:02:32.560> think<00:02:32.710> about<00:02:32.740> getting<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.340> city<00:02:33.880> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
was think about getting the city a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.950 
was think about getting the city a
garage<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.870> putting<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.230> there<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.780> found

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
garage and putting it there and I found

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.010 
garage and putting it there and I found
a<00:02:38.260> way<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.530> use<00:02:39.310> up<00:02:39.340> my<00:02:39.700> rounds<00:02:39.970> as<00:02:40.420> made<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.690> turn

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
a way to use up my rounds as made a turn

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.949 
a way to use up my rounds as made a turn
around<00:02:41.200> here<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.510> eventually<00:02:43.510> I'm<00:02:43.630> gonna<00:02:43.810> get

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
around here and eventually I'm gonna get

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.680 
around here and eventually I'm gonna get
the<00:02:44.400> city<00:02:45.400> corner<00:02:45.790> set<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.150> put<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.420> statue

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
right there in the middle of that and

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.750 
right there in the middle of that and
I've<00:02:50.920> got<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.310> airport<00:02:51.790> up<00:02:51.910> here<00:02:53.550> wasn't<00:02:54.550> as

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
I've got the airport up here wasn't as

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.670 
I've got the airport up here wasn't as
near<00:02:55.300> as<00:02:55.330> much<00:02:55.570> room<00:02:55.959> with<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.320> know<00:02:56.380> you

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
near as much room with you know you

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.080 
near as much room with you know you
always<00:02:56.890> run<00:02:57.100> out<00:02:57.130> of<00:02:57.280> room<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.640> got<00:02:57.790> one<00:02:57.970> extra

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
always run out of room I got one extra

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.090 
always run out of room I got one extra
flying<00:02:58.540> over<00:02:58.780> here<00:02:58.930> but<00:02:59.200> they<00:02:59.830> said<00:03:00.070> that

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
flying over here but they said that

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.330 
flying over here but they said that
Airport<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:01.530> airplanes<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.709> takes<00:03:03.100> up<00:03:03.310> the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
Airport that airplanes that takes up the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.290 
Airport that airplanes that takes up the
whole<00:03:03.459> airport

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.010 

but<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.140> does<00:03:11.320> look<00:03:11.470> good<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.910> then<00:03:13.810> I'm

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
but it does look good and then I'm

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.680 
but it does look good and then I'm
really<00:03:14.320> not<00:03:14.650> done<00:03:14.920> over<00:03:15.280> here<00:03:15.550> obviously<00:03:15.880> but

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
really not done over here obviously but

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.040 
really not done over here obviously but
I'll<00:03:17.170> show<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:17.440> what<00:03:17.620> I've<00:03:17.940> kind<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.570> idea

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
I'll show you what I've kind of the idea

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.510 
I'll show you what I've kind of the idea
of<00:03:20.140> what's<00:03:20.410> going<00:03:20.680> on<00:03:20.800> over<00:03:20.980> here<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.340> know<00:03:21.790> that

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
of what's going on over here I know that

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.770 
of what's going on over here I know that
Coast<00:03:24.520> Guard<00:03:24.790> boat<00:03:25.000> doesn't<00:03:25.240> look<00:03:25.540> right

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
Coast Guard boat doesn't look right

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.860 
Coast Guard boat doesn't look right
there<00:03:26.050> so<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.530> don't<00:03:26.680> have<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:26.980> tell<00:03:27.130> me<00:03:27.280> that

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
there so you don't have to tell me that

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.450 
there so you don't have to tell me that
now<00:03:28.870> this<00:03:29.500> is<00:03:29.560> what<00:03:29.830> I'm<00:03:29.920> thinking<00:03:29.980> is<00:03:30.430> just

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
now this is what I'm thinking is just

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.420 
now this is what I'm thinking is just
moving<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.330> beach<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:31.960> have<00:03:32.170> here<00:03:32.560> and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
moving this beach that I have here and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.790 
moving this beach that I have here and
just<00:03:33.460> put<00:03:34.180> more<00:03:34.360> water<00:03:34.660> there<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:35.530> they're

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
just put more water there and they're

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.530 
just put more water there and they're
just<00:03:36.010> putting<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:36.670> beach<00:03:36.880> back<00:03:37.150> their<00:03:37.360> words

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
just putting that beach back their words

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.010 
just putting that beach back their words
would<00:03:37.900> just<00:03:38.520> basically<00:03:39.520> to<00:03:39.790> give<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.630> ocean<00:03:40.990> a

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
would just basically to give the ocean a

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.440 
would just basically to give the ocean a
little<00:03:41.290> bit<00:03:41.410> more<00:03:41.590> depth<00:03:42.070> so<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:43.000> can<00:03:43.270> have

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
little bit more depth so that I can have

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.450 
little bit more depth so that I can have
my<00:03:43.660> Coast<00:03:43.900> Guard<00:03:44.140> boat<00:03:44.350> over<00:03:44.650> on<00:03:44.710> this<00:03:44.920> end<00:03:45.220> and

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
my Coast Guard boat over on this end and

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.360 
my Coast Guard boat over on this end and
maybe<00:03:46.180> even<00:03:46.390> turn<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.840> lighthouse<00:03:47.290> around<00:03:48.190> a

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
maybe even turn the lighthouse around a

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.500 
maybe even turn the lighthouse around a
little<00:03:48.550> bit<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:50.500> that's<00:03:50.770> basically<00:03:51.240> how<00:03:52.240> it's

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
little bit but that's basically how it's

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.890 
little bit but that's basically how it's
coming<00:03:52.750> out<00:03:53.020> I<00:03:56.730> say<00:03:57.730> make<00:03:58.030> it<00:03:58.150> back<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.720> get<00:03:58.870> a

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
coming out I say make it back and get a

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.390 
coming out I say make it back and get a
better<00:03:59.470> view<00:03:59.860> of<00:03:59.890> it<00:04:00.100> here<00:04:04.890> I'll<00:04:05.890> go<00:04:06.070> ahead<00:04:06.190> and

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
better view of it here I'll go ahead and

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.160 
better view of it here I'll go ahead and
run<00:04:06.520> the<00:04:06.700> Train<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:07.300> you<00:04:07.360> can<00:04:07.570> see<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.840> here's

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
run the Train so you can see it here's

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.710 
run the Train so you can see it here's
the<00:04:08.230> park<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.200> back<00:04:11.440> side<00:04:11.740> of<00:04:11.770> this

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.550 

alright<00:04:16.720> let's<00:04:16.930> go<00:04:17.049> ahead<00:04:17.080> and<00:04:17.290> turn<00:04:17.380> the

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
alright let's go ahead and turn the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.140 
alright let's go ahead and turn the
train<00:04:17.770> on<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.130> see<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.370> do<00:04:18.520> a<00:04:18.549> couple<00:04:18.940> circles

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
train on and see it do a couple circles

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:57.150 
train on and see it do a couple circles
around

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.920 

so<00:04:58.160> that's<00:04:58.310> basically<00:04:58.520> it<00:04:59.120> I<00:04:59.300> got<00:04:59.510> the<00:04:59.630> train
