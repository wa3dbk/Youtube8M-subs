00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
alright guys today I'm gonna show you

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.980 
alright guys today I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.810> make<00:00:04.080> an<00:00:04.259> independent<00:00:05.990> monorail

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
how to make an independent monorail

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.290 
how to make an independent monorail
vehicle<00:00:07.589> basically<00:00:08.130> like<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.340> train<00:00:08.849> all<00:00:09.120> it

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
vehicle basically like a train all it

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.850 
vehicle basically like a train all it
you<00:00:09.450> need<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.660> build<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.349> track<00:00:10.620> and

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
you need to build is the track and

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.560 
you need to build is the track and
that's<00:00:10.920> very<00:00:11.219> simple<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:11.969> here<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.269> go<00:00:12.450> on

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
that's very simple so here we go on

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.599 
that's very simple so here we go on
Miche<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:13.160> monorail<00:00:15.830> okay<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.190> start

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
Miche a monorail okay so you start

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.529 
Miche a monorail okay so you start
you're<00:00:18.180> gonna<00:00:18.240> need<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:19.560> place<00:00:19.910> one<00:00:20.910> redstone

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
you're gonna need to place one redstone

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.099 
you're gonna need to place one redstone
repeater<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:22.519> and<00:00:24.680> one<00:00:25.680> right<00:00:25.859> here<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
repeater here and one right here and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.779 
repeater here and one right here and
then<00:00:28.109> you're<00:00:28.470> gonna<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.980> two<00:00:29.279> blocks<00:00:29.519> there

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
then you're gonna have two blocks there

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.810 
then you're gonna have two blocks there
and<00:00:30.349> bake<00:00:31.349> basically<00:00:32.009> make<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.399> opposite

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and bake basically make it the opposite

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.620 
and bake basically make it the opposite
of<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.239> was<00:00:33.890> just<00:00:34.890> no<00:00:35.219> delay<00:00:35.520> or<00:00:36.360> one

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
of what that was just no delay or one

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.479 
of what that was just no delay or one
tick<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:36.930> delay<00:00:37.170> rather<00:00:37.440> put<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.040> here<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
tick up delay rather put it here and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.470 
tick up delay rather put it here and
then<00:00:39.090> there<00:00:39.360> put<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> full<00:00:40.140> delay<00:00:41.329> just<00:00:42.329> like

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
then there put a full delay just like

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.470 
then there put a full delay just like
that<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.340> then<00:00:44.340> right<00:00:44.550> there<00:00:44.850> where<00:00:45.360> they

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
that and then right there where they

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.410 
that and then right there where they
intersect<00:00:45.899> place<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.860> redstone<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.239> one

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
intersect place one redstone on this one

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.160 
intersect place one redstone on this one
though<00:00:48.539> you're<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.870> want<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.020> put

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
though you're going to want to put

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.479 
though you're going to want to put
another<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.309> pack<00:00:51.239> them<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.629> I

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
another one and just pack them here I

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.810 
another one and just pack them here I
build<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.550> pulse<00:00:53.789> generator<00:00:56.750> don't<00:00:57.750> mind<00:00:58.079> those

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
build a pulse generator don't mind those

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.549 
build a pulse generator don't mind those
just<00:00:59.820> build<00:01:00.180> yourself<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> nice<00:01:00.930> little<00:01:01.170> pulse

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
just build yourself a nice little pulse

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.770 
just build yourself a nice little pulse
generator<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:03.350> stick<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> piston<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:06.000> let's

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
generator here stick a piston and let's

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780 
generator here stick a piston and let's
see<00:01:07.049> that'll<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:07.619> eight<00:01:07.890> ticks<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.490> delay

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
see that'll be eight ticks of delay

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:22.609 
see that'll be eight ticks of delay
sorry<00:01:09.299> um<00:01:15.080> here's<00:01:17.930> four<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:20.479> then<00:01:21.479> eight<00:01:22.290> tips

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
sorry um here's four and then eight tips

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.260 
sorry um here's four and then eight tips
there<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.450> then<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.659> redstone<00:01:24.840> torch<00:01:25.259> here

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
there and then one redstone torch here

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.630 
there and then one redstone torch here
connect<00:01:27.270> them<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.890> place<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.130> block<00:01:32.369> there

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
connect them and place one block there

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.170 
connect them and place one block there
and<00:01:33.680> there's<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.759> take<00:01:35.970> one

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and there's that and you take one

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.640 
and there's that and you take one
redstone<00:01:36.570> torch<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.960> put<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.229> top<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.409> each

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
redstone torch and put it on top of each

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.910 
redstone torch and put it on top of each
of<00:01:37.829> those<00:01:38.119> now<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.450> next<00:01:39.659> part<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> lot

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
of those now this next part is a lot

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160 
of those now this next part is a lot
trickier<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> part<00:01:43.049> we

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
trickier this is going to be the part we

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.569 
trickier this is going to be the part we
need<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.409> build<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> monorail<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.399> that

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
need to build the monorail going that

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.560 
need to build the monorail going that
way<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.079> gonna<00:01:46.229> take<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.740> while<00:01:47.570> it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
way and it's gonna take a while it's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.440 
way and it's gonna take a while it's
going<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.869> really<00:01:49.350> hard<00:01:49.560> because<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:51.240> just

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
going to be really hard because you just

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.819 
going to be really hard because you just
have<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.659> keep<00:01:51.750> going<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.259> forever<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
have to keep going and going forever and

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.069 
have to keep going and going forever and
it<00:01:52.920> doesn't<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:54.420> doesn't<00:01:54.689> take<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:54.899> long

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
it doesn't it it doesn't take that long

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.649 
it doesn't it it doesn't take that long
or<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.310> takes<00:01:56.490> doesn't<00:01:57.060> take<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.270> long<00:01:57.329> so

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
or it takes doesn't take that long so

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.050 
or it takes doesn't take that long so
it's<00:01:57.780> gonna<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.100> need<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> lot<00:01:59.490> built<00:01:59.729> so

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
it's gonna be you need a lot built so

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.620 
it's gonna be you need a lot built so
let's<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:01.520> there's<00:02:02.520> one<00:02:02.939> you're<00:02:03.329> gonna<00:02:03.450> use

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
let's do there's one you're gonna use

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.990 
let's do there's one you're gonna use
worldedit<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.409> because<00:02:05.310> that's<00:02:05.729> how<00:02:05.939> you

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
worldedit here because that's how you

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.080 
worldedit here because that's how you
will<00:02:06.390> copy<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.869> paste<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.799> whole<00:02:08.129> region<00:02:08.520> or

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
will copy and paste this whole region or

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.550 
will copy and paste this whole region or
this<00:02:09.420> whole

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.000 

first<00:02:13.560> position<00:02:14.190> -<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:16.170> I'm<00:02:16.410> gonna<00:02:16.590> stand

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
first position - and I'm gonna stand

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.070 
first position - and I'm gonna stand
right<00:02:17.190> here<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:20.660> say<00:02:22.940> copy<00:02:23.940> then<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.660> go<00:02:24.810> here

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
right here and say copy then I go here

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:39.470 
right here and say copy then I go here
it's<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:26.780> paste<00:02:33.980> go<00:02:34.980> right<00:02:35.160> here<00:02:38.240> just<00:02:39.240> keep

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
it's a paste go right here just keep

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.520 
it's a paste go right here just keep
clicking<00:02:39.750> paise<00:02:44.840> that'll<00:02:45.840> be<00:02:45.960> enough<00:02:46.230> for<00:02:46.470> our

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
clicking paise that'll be enough for our

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.230 
clicking paise that'll be enough for our
purposes<00:02:47.100> right<00:02:47.160> now<00:02:48.170> let's<00:02:49.170> take<00:02:49.620> one<00:02:50.370> piston

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
purposes right now let's take one piston

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.330 
purposes right now let's take one piston
it'll<00:02:51.540> poop<00:02:52.260> out<00:02:52.530> like<00:02:52.800> that

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
it'll poop out like that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.690 
it'll poop out like that
you<00:02:54.090> can<00:02:54.530> grab<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:56.600> sticky<00:02:57.600> one<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.490> place<00:02:59.490> it

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
you can grab a sticky one and place it

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:07.240 
you can grab a sticky one and place it
backwards<00:03:02.270> you<00:03:03.270> can<00:03:03.420> get<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.750> too

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.590 

there<00:03:08.250> now<00:03:08.670> it's<00:03:08.850> backwards

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
there now it's backwards

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.620 
there now it's backwards
and<00:03:10.230> then<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.160> gotta<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.790> start<00:03:12.240> up<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
and then I gotta do is start up the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.979 
and then I gotta do is start up the
pulse<00:03:12.900> generator<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.740> watch<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:15.270> goes

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
pulse generator and watch and it goes

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.009 
pulse generator and watch and it goes
and<00:03:16.200> goes<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.680> goes<00:03:16.830> one<00:03:17.220> two<00:03:17.519> one<00:03:18.120> two<00:03:18.150> one<00:03:18.660> two

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
and goes it goes one two one two one two

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.660 
and goes it goes one two one two one two
one<00:03:19.500> two<00:03:20.430> one<00:03:20.940> two<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.800> then<00:03:22.800> it<00:03:22.980> stops<00:03:23.280> and

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
one two one two and then it stops and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.620 
one two one two and then it stops and
that's<00:03:24.239> how<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.050> works<00:03:25.200> very<00:03:25.500> simply<00:03:25.940> now

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.600 

let's<00:03:30.630> quickly<00:03:30.930> go<00:03:31.410> over<00:03:31.769> here<00:03:32.010> here's<00:03:32.430> our

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
let's quickly go over here here's our

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.729 
let's quickly go over here here's our
smaller<00:03:33.180> one<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.630> then<00:03:33.690> this<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.260> huge<00:03:34.560> one

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
smaller one and then this is a huge one

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.070 
smaller one and then this is a huge one
that<00:03:34.769> goes<00:03:35.070> out<00:03:35.340> there<00:03:35.610> for<00:03:35.910> several<00:03:36.720> many

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
that goes out there for several many

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.060 
that goes out there for several many
hundreds<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.680> miles<00:03:38.510> for<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> long<00:03:39.810> time<00:03:40.140> so

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
hundreds of miles for a long time so

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.880 
hundreds of miles for a long time so
let's<00:03:41.280> build<00:03:41.459> ourselves<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.970> quick<00:03:42.180> little

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
let's build ourselves a quick little

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.320 
let's build ourselves a quick little
train<00:03:43.890> here<00:03:44.280> one<00:03:44.820> two<00:03:45.030> three<00:03:46.850> then<00:03:47.850> we'll<00:03:48.120> take

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
train here one two three then we'll take

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.120 
train here one two three then we'll take
some<00:03:48.500> sticky<00:03:49.500> piston<00:03:51.110> let's<00:03:52.110> get<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.530> block

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:02.030 

we'll<00:03:56.130> put<00:03:57.680> here<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:01.080> we'll<00:04:01.320> get<00:04:01.470> another

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
we'll put here and we'll get another

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.090 
we'll put here and we'll get another
just<00:04:02.970> gotta<00:04:03.209> make<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.660> pattern<00:04:04.080> of<00:04:04.530> one

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
just gotta make that pattern of one

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.580 
just gotta make that pattern of one
sticky<00:04:06.260> then<00:04:07.970> one<00:04:08.970> sticky<00:04:09.360> then<00:04:09.630> we're<00:04:09.810> normal

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.289 

one<00:04:13.590> normal<00:04:13.890> then<00:04:14.040> one<00:04:14.190> sticky<00:04:14.580> sticky<00:04:15.060> goes

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
one normal then one sticky sticky goes

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.380 
one normal then one sticky sticky goes
in<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.750> front<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.169> all<00:04:16.410> goes<00:04:16.650> in<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.890> back

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
in the front and all goes in the back

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.150 
in the front and all goes in the back
oops

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.120 

and<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:22.120> just<00:04:22.390> start<00:04:23.230> up<00:04:23.410> your<00:04:23.680> pulse

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
and you just start up your pulse

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.900 
and you just start up your pulse
generator<00:04:25.860> well<00:04:26.860> let's<00:04:27.250> build<00:04:27.520> some<00:04:27.880> walls

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
generator well let's build some walls

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.490 
generator well let's build some walls
around<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:28.780> thing<00:04:29.200> so<00:04:29.770> it'll<00:04:30.040> hold<00:04:30.250> us<00:04:30.460> in

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
around this thing so it'll hold us in

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.610 
around this thing so it'll hold us in
there<00:04:32.500> then<00:04:33.190> just<00:04:33.400> start<00:04:33.850> it<00:04:33.940> up<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.620> you're

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
there then just start it up and you're

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.950 
there then just start it up and you're
just<00:04:35.770> sitting<00:04:36.010> here<00:04:36.810> something's<00:04:37.810> not

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
just sitting here something's not

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.510 
just sitting here something's not
working<00:04:38.550> there<00:04:39.550> we<00:04:39.730> go<00:04:39.850> like<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.540> and<00:04:41.520> then

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
working there we go like that and then

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.300 
working there we go like that and then
it<00:04:42.610> just<00:04:42.790> goes<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.390> goes<00:04:43.750> and<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:44.140> can<00:04:44.380> do<00:04:45.160> all

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
it just goes and goes and you can do all

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.690 
it just goes and goes and you can do all
sorts<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.820> crazy<00:04:45.970> stuff<00:04:46.510> with<00:04:46.720> this<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:48.490> can

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
sorts of crazy stuff with this you can

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.950 
sorts of crazy stuff with this you can
modify<00:04:49.450> it<00:04:49.630> however<00:04:49.750> you<00:04:50.170> want<00:04:51.060> obviously<00:04:52.060> if

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
modify it however you want obviously if

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.510 
modify it however you want obviously if
you<00:04:54.000> have<00:04:55.000> a<00:04:55.030> low<00:04:55.870> quality<00:04:56.350> ish<00:04:56.770> machine<00:04:57.250> that

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
you have a low quality ish machine that

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.710 
you have a low quality ish machine that
will<00:04:57.640> lag<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:57.940> lot<00:04:59.910> for<00:05:00.910> some<00:05:01.120> reason<00:05:01.540> that

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
will lag a lot for some reason that

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.390 
will lag a lot for some reason that
one's<00:05:01.900> behind<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.380> rest<00:05:02.590> which<00:05:02.860> is<00:05:03.010> really

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
one's behind the rest which is really

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.970 
one's behind the rest which is really
weird<00:05:03.580> actually<00:05:04.300> didn't<00:05:05.290> do<00:05:05.380> that<00:05:05.560> last<00:05:05.800> time

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
weird actually didn't do that last time

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.480 
weird actually didn't do that last time
but<00:05:07.170> heck<00:05:08.170> it<00:05:08.380> still<00:05:08.620> gets<00:05:08.800> you<00:05:08.950> going<00:05:09.310> where

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
but heck it still gets you going where

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.370 
but heck it still gets you going where
you're<00:05:09.640> going<00:05:09.940> to<00:05:10.180> so<00:05:10.570> and<00:05:11.490> as<00:05:12.490> you<00:05:12.670> can<00:05:12.850> see

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
you're going to so and as you can see

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.770 
you're going to so and as you can see
this<00:05:14.380> sucker<00:05:14.740> goes<00:05:15.100> on<00:05:15.370> for<00:05:15.730> miles<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:16.480> miles

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
this sucker goes on for miles and miles

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.700 
this sucker goes on for miles and miles
and<00:05:17.080> miles<00:05:18.480> past<00:05:19.480> chunks<00:05:20.170> that<00:05:20.200> are<00:05:20.470> loaded

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
and miles past chunks that are loaded

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.150 
and miles past chunks that are loaded
into<00:05:21.160> the<00:05:21.610> unloaded<00:05:22.210> chunks<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.930> it<00:05:23.920> just

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
into the unloaded chunks and it just

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.350 
into the unloaded chunks and it just
keeps<00:05:24.490> on<00:05:24.700> going<00:05:24.970> until<00:05:25.450> about<00:05:25.960> here<00:05:27.360> exactly

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
keeps on going until about here exactly

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.270 
keeps on going until about here exactly
there<00:05:28.570> but<00:05:28.960> anyway<00:05:29.200> just<00:05:29.350> keep<00:05:29.770> going<00:05:30.130> and

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
there but anyway just keep going and

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.090 
there but anyway just keep going and
going<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:30.760> going<00:05:31.290> you<00:05:32.290> eventually<00:05:32.530> find<00:05:32.740> your
