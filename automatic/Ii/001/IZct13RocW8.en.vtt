 know not to err so as not to make mistakes 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.270
 in the morning when they are in front of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.369
 mirror when they have to go out and have 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.100
 to choose or between the striped shirt the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.099
 smooth checkered when they make more mistakes 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.920
 you gentlemen when you dress up 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.289
 sport or when they wear suits 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.230
 let's share a note with a 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.070
 specialist in men's fashion and a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.190
 image advisor for men 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.350
 [Music] 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.210
 men know the necessary tips 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.730
 so as not to be wrong when it comes to 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.920
 dress up what are the secrets that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.589
 they have to know to look elegant 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.720
 beyond the lifestyle the weight or the 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.789
 height 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.129
 [Music] 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.670
 to dress elegantly in a suit 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.759
 tie and shirt is perfectly 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.189
 dressed but the biggest mistakes the 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.590
 we see with casual clothes with the day to 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.259
 day the ideal waist is the one that corresponds 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.530
 with the body and that is very tight 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.600
 or that the man himself is very loose 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.170
 he has to learn to let go a little 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.220
 but have rules a little clearer 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.319
 for example that a vertical line 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.289
 it tends to thin the body so 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:36.090
 both a shirt with finite lines or 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:39.899
 a polo shirt will be long 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.570
 better in a large body with more lines 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.430
 finite 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.270
 [Music] 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.420
 although the notched the notch is 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.250
 present a few seasons ago but what 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.620
 that you have to keep in mind that it's not going to 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.520
 stop all types of bodies in the person 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.470
 which is robust is going to feel very 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.729
 tight and it will not look elegant now 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.860
 is very day to wear the shirts with 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.050
 White collar is therefore an option 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.920
 to incorporate a nice color near the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.290
 face and wear a white shirt and top 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.060
 a dark bag or playing with the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.709
 combinations but not dressing by 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.380
 full example of white when the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.810
 Body cables are the key colors 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.239
 at the time of dressing that disguise the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.580
 kilos of more the dark colors are the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:34.350
 ideal black blue gray there is a rule 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.420
 fixed that without going to insurance by 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.730
 example a straight jean will not fail in 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.340
 nobody is going to look good in a 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.650
 more chubby person as a person 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.480
 thin knowing a lot outside and is 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.580
 coming here says the use of accessories 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.409
 you did not see us as you women or 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.450
 be not for changing a belt we are with 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.360
 a totally different look but it brings 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.090
 a lot and gives a touch of important style 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.640
 [Music] 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.459
 the clothes if it comes is the first contact 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.010
 what we have with the other person plays 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.129
 care too much skin 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.180
 hair hands also to ride smoke 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:17.099
 as in perfumes today the closing of 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.099
 a trade a set of dress 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.750
 and the moon image advisor where 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.420
 he talked about the importance of buying 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.459
 with intelligence attention there is no 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.739
 buy a shirt that does not match with 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.480
 nothing but look for clothes that can be 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.640
 exchange this also happens with the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.930
 women for example spoke of the stripes 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.870
 verticals that stylize and is not for 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.380
 take it into account of course that the 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.209
 paintings do not widen and when 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.280
 dressing is good you have to have 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.580
 care, especially with the 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.950
 Adriaan and tailored combinations look 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.989
 when you enter two vertical stripes 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.000
 is towards the body without the greco and 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.310
 I perfume in point that you say clear 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.970
 it's not just about clothes 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.450
 but to be tidy nails well the 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.670
 hair a good perfume always seduces and 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.989
 Women do not leave much but also 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.580
 in you every time I always 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.269
 I associate the horizontal stripes look to 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.269
 pepe biondi 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.160
 the marine wave is used but it is not for 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.919
 all the attention is not for everyone is not 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.020
 what fashion is not uncomfortable that is 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.850
 a story is a saying that said my 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.210
 grandfather but yes many times uncomfortable and 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.250
 a lot because it has to look good no no 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.010
 because because it is used or because it is put on 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:46.570
 a model is for everyone if we do not go to 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.550
 put a new ground and you will 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.950
 equivocan - adriÃ¡n at the time of putting 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.010
 a suit because it's classic because it's 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:59.250
 everything as preestablished that at the time 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.250
 to get dressed is for many thanks
