00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 mafia 3 gta san andreas 92 villa in 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:16.320
 Minecraft copied the same in the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:18.029
 playoffs i have a really good one 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.580
 business for you and no cardboard box 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.170
 psp says no mum 43 could 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.420
 have been announced 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.890
 yes, it could also be the environment 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.949
 only an error is because one 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.080
 online retailer play.com the title 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.110
 now listed for ps4 and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 Export country for pc not and there considered 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.590
 one moment now and one 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.180
 it is now speculated that there is a mistake 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.910
 it's a fake or could it really be 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.110
 that the title then really appears 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.550
 and of course currently in the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.039
 Development is located in science publishers 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.270
 and developer unfortunately still exists 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.309
 no information and also the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.530
 description of mafia 3 ends so on 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.390
 little to the description of mafia 2 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.699
 and also the cover that I'm here right now 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.140
 objected see that works yes 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.300
 bit pixelated he like a placeholder 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.640
 the three hours being relative again 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.799
 you need to be detailed 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.339
 Let's have a look at your own picture 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.049
 do 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.369
 I do not want to promise you too much 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.659
 Do not hope too much but do it 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.640
 would of course be super cool if now 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.380
 prevented again 43 announced 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.120
 But would I think it's 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.490
 just what do you mean 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.050
 come in pretty hot just after 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.210
 I just talked about three here 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.340
 I have actually just announced 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.120
 partly from the side grant 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.950
 gta san andreas 2 officially announced 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.110
 Rockstar games has been that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.820
 However, the problem is that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.500
 grant is partly a 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.050
 satire side like for example the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.980
 postillon and a lot of media too 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.780
 many people here probably 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.700
 also just that have actually 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.840
 believed and via twitter has the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.610
 whole also incredibly fast 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.460
 spread and I wanted you now 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.350
 Just show how fast that is 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.780
 can go how does such ends 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.660
 So messages that are naturally fake 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.250
 or the extra yes so now structured 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.930
 have been duped by the people 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.780
 to lead as they then turn over 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.830
 social social media pages spread 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.480
 like twitter or 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.010
 facebook because if you go now 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.080
 Well, rockstar games does not think so 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.200
 is just the next 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.780
 version to gta 5 so for the xbox the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.440
 ps4 released and then you announce 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.660
 not easy 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.680
 sentry s2 on but just like that 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.660
 I found information very interesting 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.090
 and should I perhaps a 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.680
 a little closer look at such pages 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.700
 and a source is looking a bit better 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.260
 do not always research everything the same 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.840
 believe what it is on the internet exactly 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.110
 like mafia 3 if this is a 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.430
 fake is yes I 'm last but did 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.370
 reported about that the good 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.790
 markus notch persson the founder and the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.989
 inventor of minecraft and of course that 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.090
 developer studio that now one 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.520
 microsoft has been sold a whole 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.459
 worth a visit in Beverly Hills 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.350
 bought from 70 million dollars and 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.570
 Of course what do you do as a minecraft 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.000
 player when you hear something you clearly 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.500
 builds this villa simply in scale 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.180
 one to one and within 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.430
 less hours that has now 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.890
 the dual youtuber liked boeree 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.709
 and really has all the detail 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.570
 Looked at the house and reconstructed exactly 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.489
 also a video created that can 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.870
 you look here very interesting 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.390
 and I think it's cool 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.220
 the minecraft creator tree gets it 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.080
 or buy a house and this house 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.400
 then looks for in his game copied 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.400
 that is minecraft put 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.310
 That was the last news for the weekend 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.720
 and of course you have a nice one 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.890
 Have a nice evening and a weekend 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:36.390
 to the next year clearly 4 3 against 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.390
 andreas 32 45
