00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.210
 knows 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.450
 very good because today is these days that 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:24.880
 I'm going to a second to record a video 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.550
 to say that I can not record a video 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.780
 seems to go because of luck together 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.820
 caught under the canvas bag 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.910
 it seems a bit contradictory but it is 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.640
 A) Yes 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.410
 and now I'm going to explain it to you in a 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.280
 second 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.280
 I'm already preparing 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.090
 for this tree 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.760
 because I'm doing a tensioner for 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.680
 this tree because I want to get down from these 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.830
 branches here a little 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.550
 and this is a much less technical 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.350
 Stressful 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.420
 to speak all the branches down 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.310
 Now I just have to put a couple 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.270
 of points there we are going to put there again 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.760
 I just have to download them from a couple of 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.560
 points and end of the case 750 fixed how 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.570
 is this elm we are already at the end of 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.340
 February and see how the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.650
 oven like me in soft suit and white 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.159
 today you see here it lacks a branch that 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.159
 we are going to do it 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.590
 You see this elm is perfect but the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.689
 apex I chafes them because they fell 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.729
 them man or last year and neither 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.829
 flat neither bald like a man 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.649
 I know then I have to sprout from here 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.179
 to make pencils in conditions and 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:44.270
 here he has always lacked some branches and 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.270
 let's put these and others here 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.130
 here and we're going to leave it to have 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.810
 perfect a bun or perfect because 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.149
 I'm working at the same this something 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.649
 first because he needs it and second 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.209
 because he will be one of the protagonists 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.170
 of the next video of the school of 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:05.370
 bonsai online teas techniques 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.400
 today creation and repair of a newspaper 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.520
 Chinese scissors under my house 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.110
 very good 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.170
 then let's see 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.140
 how 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.590
 they usually say I have good news and 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.590
 a bad 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.690
 any is first 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.110
 the bad the bad bad 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.510
 Hello 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.920
 The bad news is that I told you that today I was going to 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.400
 record the video of the bonsai school 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.400
 on-line 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.460
 creation and repair of a mari but 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.090
 I'm not going to do it today because I'm not going to 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:00.450
 do today for the good news good and 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.550
 the good news is that I normally 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.990
 the videos something improvised but this one 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.940
 it seems a very important video then 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.220
 I want to make it very elaborate 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.190
 so 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.320
 the good news is that we are going to make a 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.140
 video of creation and repair of bari 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.140
 very long very elaborate 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.910
 so much so that I'm going to do it in two 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.290
 parts I'm going to make a video of the 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.290
 online bonsai school that is going to be 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.010
 creating a snow and I'm going to make another 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.490
 video 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.830
 of the dance school and online 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.770
 what will be repairing a snow and 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.060
 everything is going to be very graphic and if I do not go 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.180
 to do today what I could be doing 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.090
 is doing this and other things is because 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.420
 what 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.970
 I want to do it too 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.300
 and I want to do it so well 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.530
 what am I going to expect this weekend 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.280
 I have to do some transplants 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.740
 great and so I'm going to show you the barí 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.910
 in its essence I will teach you the 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.190
 technique of placing a wood or something 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.930
 flat under the ice cube so that the 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.600
 Root system come out flat and leave 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.600
 perfect then let's wait until 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.240
 weekends to have the video what 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.220
 best possible and most 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.870
 documented possible these of the 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.820
 wire tensioners in the trees 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.260
 expired as in this case the best is 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.230
 do it when he is naked because 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.810
 so we see better and we do not hurt branches 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.340
 new 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.440
 I do it very carefully the fixed 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.639
 and here about two three four five or six 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.009
 little leaves that load me 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.979
 no that does not pose any risk to the 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.550
 tree but but good too I would be 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.070
 more comfortable 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.910
 to see well 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.910
 mass 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:01.200
 so then 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.270
 the bad news 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.780
 is that we are not going to have the video today 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.020
 if not the weekend the good news 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.550
 is that the video is going to be much more 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.550
 complete and much better than it would have 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.890
 been done today to get out of the 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.420
 step and here you do not do things for 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.310
 get out of the way here things are done 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.310
 good or not done 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.750
 so with this tensor already put 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.160
 it is perfect this little tree has fixed 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.620
 that the branch has gone down and has won 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.919
 very much because this branch had to lower 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.680
 a little bit and ricky tim nothing more like that and already 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.900
 something is perfect perfect this is a 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.830
 tree of those who have been with me for more years 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.699
 and I love this tree is a tree 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.699
 good inside that is a tree 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.059
 look at the branch that has 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:06:01.370
 and everything is a something that takes work that 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:06:04.569
 I've been working for so many years so 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.149
 with this something I say goodbye 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.919
 morning wanted to do a transplant not me 

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:11.159
 the substrate has arrived because the 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.479
 sebastián fernández the acebuche takes a 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:16.449
 a grama inquired of web grade of 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.830
 coarse grains to make it the most 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.110
 big before you see how the 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.629
 herbs around the fertilizer do not come out 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.009
 the rest of the flowerpot always come out 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:25.959
 surrounding the fertilizer because they have a 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.969
 overfeeding that to herbs 

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:29.949
 it becomes magnificent I now grew up 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:31.169
 the women there are as bad 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:33.240
 herbs 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.639
 well that's what I said this morning 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.289
 I wanted to do a transplant but I'm not going to 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.300
 power unless it comes in the afternoon 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.650
 I can come in the afternoon tomorrow video 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.540
 of the transplant but the video will be 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:47.110
 the late evening opened 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.400
 a hug 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.569
 delighted the video of those of 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.830
 various 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.830
 and until the next video
