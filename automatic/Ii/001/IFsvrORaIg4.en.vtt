00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.030 
during removal as well getting the film
off<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.000> easier<00:02:50.300> because<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.020> film's<00:02:51.230> lock<00:02:51.380> so

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
off is easier because the film's lock so

we actually demonstrate their tensile

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.940 
we actually demonstrate their tensile
strength<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.840> put<00:02:56.990> a<00:02:57.020> small<00:02:57.290> piece<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:57.560> the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
film near this is unprinted and then

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.480 
film near this is unprinted and then
laminated<00:03:00.350> so<00:03:00.830> what<00:03:00.980> I'm<00:03:01.070> going<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.250> do<00:03:01.370> is

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
laminated so what I'm going to do is

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.240 
laminated so what I'm going to do is
just<00:03:01.610> remove<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.030> liner<00:03:02.180> from<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:03.250> I'm

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
just remove the liner from this I'm

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.460 
just remove the liner from this I'm
going<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.520> use<00:03:04.640> this<00:03:04.850> to<00:03:05.630> actually<00:03:05.810> get<00:03:06.170> inside

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
going to use this to actually get inside

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.180 
going to use this to actually get inside
a<00:03:06.500> pencil<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:12.290> what's<00:03:12.710> going<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:12.920> give<00:03:13.040> me<00:03:13.130> a

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
a pencil and what's going to give me a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.680 
a pencil and what's going to give me a
hand<00:03:13.370> with<00:03:13.520> this<00:03:13.580> what<00:03:14.210> we're<00:03:14.300> going<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.450> do<00:03:14.570> is

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
hand with this what we're going to do is

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.320 
hand with this what we're going to do is
we<00:03:14.840> read<00:03:15.110> both<00:03:15.290> sides<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.770> still<00:03:16.300> get<00:03:17.300> a

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
we read both sides and still get a

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.820 
we read both sides and still get a
really<00:03:17.690> good<00:03:17.840> hand<00:03:18.110> grip<00:03:18.260> on<00:03:18.380> this<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.620> what<00:03:18.739> we

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
really good hand grip on this is what we

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.410 
really good hand grip on this is what we
don't<00:03:18.980> try<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.160> do<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.550> we're<00:03:19.940> gonna<00:03:20.030> pull<00:03:20.300> this

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
don't try to do is we're gonna pull this

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.960 
don't try to do is we're gonna pull this
the<00:03:20.600> elements<00:03:20.900> in<00:03:21.020> we're<00:03:21.200> actually<00:03:21.350> standing

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
the elements in we're actually standing

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.729 
the elements in we're actually standing
over<00:03:22.970> full<00:03:23.450> power<00:03:24.670> now<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.870> probably<00:03:27.260> realize

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
over full power now you probably realize

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:28.449 
over full power now you probably realize
it<00:03:27.920> by<00:03:28.040> now

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
it by now

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.880 
it by now
I'm<00:03:28.670> going<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.090> filming<00:03:29.390> of<00:03:29.510> God<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.770> can

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
I'm going on filming of God so you can

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.500 
I'm going on filming of God so you can
see<00:03:34.010> that<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.340> took<00:03:34.520> an<00:03:34.670> enormous<00:03:34.940> amount<00:03:35.390> of

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
see that it took an enormous amount of

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.750 
see that it took an enormous amount of
full<00:03:35.720> force<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.350> actually<00:03:36.770> split<00:03:37.280> that<00:03:37.550> piece

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
full force to actually split that piece

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.449 
full force to actually split that piece
of<00:03:37.880> film<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:39.110> that<00:03:39.290> has<00:03:39.590> some<00:03:39.860> real<00:03:40.040> benefits

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
of film and that has some real benefits

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.100 
of film and that has some real benefits
when<00:03:40.610> you're<00:03:40.730> handling<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.180> film<00:03:41.450> it's<00:03:41.870> far

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
when you're handling the film it's far

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.420 
when you're handling the film it's far
less<00:03:42.140> likely<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.620> snap<00:03:42.860> in<00:03:43.010> your<00:03:43.040> hands<00:03:43.310> as

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
less likely to snap in your hands as

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.520 
less likely to snap in your hands as
you're<00:03:43.670> working<00:03:43.820> field<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.360> apply<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.989> also

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
you're working field to apply and also

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.470 
you're working field to apply and also
means<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.830> removal<00:03:46.280> is<00:03:46.340> again<00:03:46.880> is<00:03:47.030> easier

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
means the removal is again is easier

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.870 
means the removal is again is easier
