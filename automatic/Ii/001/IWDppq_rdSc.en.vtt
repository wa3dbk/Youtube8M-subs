white end for the spin from that point

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.549 
white end for the spin from that point
on<00:00:50.370> you'll<00:00:50.549> take<00:00:50.729> a<00:00:50.850> wide<00:00:51.149> loop<00:00:51.600> bringing<00:00:52.319> into

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
on you'll take a wide loop bringing into

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.770 
on you'll take a wide loop bringing into
a<00:00:52.620> small<00:00:53.010> loop<00:00:53.339> and<00:00:53.670> leave<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.089> the<00:00:54.269> small<00:00:54.539> loop

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
a small loop and leave it the small loop

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
that just to be a basic turn ladies you

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.049 
that just to be a basic turn ladies you
can<00:00:58.889> set<00:00:59.069> the<00:00:59.190> foot<00:00:59.339> on<00:00:59.459> the<00:00:59.549> ground<00:00:59.670> walk

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
can set the foot on the ground walk

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.000 
can set the foot on the ground walk
straight<00:01:00.359> backwards<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.929> the<00:01:01.079> pattern<00:01:01.319> so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
straight backwards out of the pattern so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.549 
straight backwards out of the pattern so
if<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.249> lowered<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.670> sheet<00:01:02.909> back<00:01:03.149> out<00:01:03.559> reconnect

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
if I lowered it sheet back out reconnect

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.719 
if I lowered it sheet back out reconnect
at<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> end<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.070> move<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.460> start

something else she could have walked
forward<00:01:07.350> she<00:01:07.650> could<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.890> stayed<00:01:08.040> where<00:01:08.220> she

one-legged turn and then off I go

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.480 
one-legged turn and then off I go
exactly<00:01:54.870> one<00:01:55.409> note<00:01:55.650> on<00:01:55.800> that<00:01:55.830> for<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> leaders

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
exactly one note on that for the leaders

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.399 
exactly one note on that for the leaders
is<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:56.940> do<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.120> fast<00:01:57.510> prep<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
is you can do a fast prep just not a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590 
is you can do a fast prep just not a
fast<00:01:58.740> spin<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.760> you<00:01:59.790> can<00:02:00.120> actually<00:02:00.270> set<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
fast spin so you can actually set the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.360 
fast spin so you can actually set the
layer<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.050> fast<00:02:01.380> breath<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.010> then<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.250> get

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
layer to do fast breath but then you get

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.980 
layer to do fast breath but then you get
a<00:02:02.400> letter<00:02:02.640> start<00:02:03.120> to<00:02:03.240> turn<00:02:03.390> before<00:02:03.540> you

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
a letter start to turn before you

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.810 
a letter start to turn before you
Lupin<00:02:04.320> ahead<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.070> could<00:02:05.250> actually<00:02:05.369> see<00:02:05.670> my

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
Lupin ahead so you could actually see my

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.180 
Lupin ahead so you could actually see my
hand<00:02:06.060> come<00:02:06.299> back<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.049> almost<00:02:07.350> slowdown<00:02:08.009> in

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
hand come back and almost slowdown in

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.680 
hand come back and almost slowdown in
midair<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.300> pick<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.539> back<00:02:09.569> up

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
midair and it's going to pick it back up

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.570 
midair and it's going to pick it back up
again<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.140> there<00:02:10.349> was<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.590> rhythm<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.340> makes

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
again and there was that rhythm it makes

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.070 
again and there was that rhythm it makes
that<00:02:11.700> turn<00:02:11.880> Gregor<00:02:12.180> Kenny<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.630> you<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.900> good

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
that turn Gregor Kenny if you have good

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.360 
that turn Gregor Kenny if you have good
balance<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.560> feel<00:02:13.770> like<00:02:13.890> she's<00:02:14.099> been<00:02:14.310> in

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
balance you feel like she's been in

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.580 
balance you feel like she's been in
pretty<00:02:14.580> good<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.209> several<00:02:15.569> times<00:02:15.750> if

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
pretty good you can go several times if

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.690 
pretty good you can go several times if
you<00:02:16.739> feel<00:02:16.980> like<00:02:17.099> there's<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.340> little<00:02:17.430> bit<00:02:17.550> of

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
you feel like there's a little bit of

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.010 
you feel like there's a little bit of
tension<00:02:17.880> like<00:02:18.120> she's<00:02:18.270> hanging<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.900> your

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
tension like she's hanging on to your

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.720 
tension like she's hanging on to your
hand<00:02:19.230> then<00:02:19.680> probably<00:02:20.069> two<00:02:20.190> turns<00:02:20.459> will<00:02:20.640> be

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
hand then probably two turns will be

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.100 
hand then probably two turns will be
enough<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.150> get<00:02:21.300> what<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.480> want<00:02:21.750> out<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.930> this

back<00:02:42.660> out<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.959> other<00:02:43.140> side<00:02:43.380> or<00:02:43.680> she'll<00:02:44.430> rock

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
back out the other side or she'll rock

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.120 
back out the other side or she'll rock
it<00:02:45.060> under<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.660> I'll<00:02:45.870> bring<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.319> around<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
it under and I'll bring it around the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.890 
it under and I'll bring it around the
other<00:02:47.280> side<00:02:47.580> which<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.760> really<00:02:47.910> slick<00:02:48.569> looking

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
other side which is really slick looking

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.140 
other side which is really slick looking
and<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.980> we'll<00:02:50.459> do<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.670> for<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.880> couple<00:02:51.030> of

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
and so we'll do that for a couple of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.880 
and so we'll do that for a couple of
angles<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.720> first<00:02:51.930> one<00:02:52.080> obviously<00:02:52.380> don't<00:02:52.799> we

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
angles the first one obviously don't we

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.250 
angles the first one obviously don't we
just<00:02:53.069> did<00:02:53.220> she<00:02:53.790> comes<00:02:54.060> up<00:02:54.269> makes<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.080> two

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
just did she comes up makes the two

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.039 
just did she comes up makes the two
turns<00:02:55.620> as<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.670> hand<00:02:56.880> comes<00:02:57.120> down<00:02:57.180> she<00:02:57.840> goes

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
turns as the hand comes down she goes

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.900 
turns as the hand comes down she goes
through<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.680> keep<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.069> counter<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.760> are

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
through it I keep a counter to the are

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.240 
through it I keep a counter to the are
all<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.330> time<00:03:00.569> so<00:03:01.080> my<00:03:01.260> body<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:01.860> opposition

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
all the time so my body is in opposition

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.949 
all the time so my body is in opposition
to<00:03:02.670> keep<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:02.940> connection<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.480> makes<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.810> feel

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
to keep the connection it makes it feel

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.570 
to keep the connection it makes it feel
really<00:03:04.170> good<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.500> her<00:03:04.650> otherwise<00:03:05.220> she's<00:03:05.430> going

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
really good to her otherwise she's going

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.009 
really good to her otherwise she's going
to<00:03:05.640> feel<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:05.880> little<00:03:06.030> dead<00:03:06.330> space<00:03:06.630> village

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
to feel this little dead space village

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.930 
to feel this little dead space village
she's<00:03:07.170> falling<00:03:07.530> over<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.340> let's<00:03:08.549> take<00:03:08.700> that

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
she's falling over so let's take that

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.400 
she's falling over so let's take that
from<00:03:09.150> an<00:03:09.239> angle<00:03:09.450> coming<00:03:09.720> right<00:03:09.900> at<00:03:10.049> you<00:03:10.200> sue<00:03:10.350> to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
from an angle coming right at you sue to

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.360 
from an angle coming right at you sue to
see<00:03:10.620> all<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.829> positions

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
see all the positions

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.729 
see all the positions
she<00:03:11.880> walks<00:03:12.120> in<00:03:12.299> one<00:03:12.540> two<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> put<00:03:13.260> her<00:03:13.320> out<00:03:13.470> on<00:03:13.650> a

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
she walks in one two I put her out on a

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.280 
she walks in one two I put her out on a
foot<00:03:13.920> on<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.220> three<00:03:14.519> take<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.239> hand<00:03:15.450> up<00:03:15.720> give

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
foot on the three take the hand up give

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.360 
foot on the three take the hand up give
her<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.500> spin<00:03:16.829> lead

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
her the spin lead

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.340 
her the spin lead
she<00:03:17.850> puts<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.269> foot<00:03:18.450> through<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.109> then<00:03:19.290> at

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
she puts the foot through and then at

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.620 
she puts the foot through and then at
this<00:03:19.440> point<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.799> lean<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.190> my<00:03:20.340> right<00:03:20.609> come<00:03:21.420> back

over towards my left side keeping away

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.580 
over towards my left side keeping away
from<00:03:23.340> her<00:03:23.670> bringing<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.780> hand<00:03:25.049> around<00:03:25.350> and

inside role pass or any kind of basic so

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.490 
inside role pass or any kind of basic so
it's<00:03:29.579> more<00:03:29.730> full<00:03:30.000> speed<00:03:30.299> she's<00:03:30.989> taking<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.380> up

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
working the body on the circle and now

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.270 
working the body on the circle and now
we<00:03:36.630> go<00:03:36.989> on<00:03:37.200> my<00:03:37.440> favorites<00:03:37.799> pretty<00:03:38.040> cool

another<00:03:38.970> one<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.180> do<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.540> quite<00:03:39.720> clever<00:03:39.989> it's

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
another one you do is quite clever it's

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.690 
another one you do is quite clever it's
kind<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.560> nice<00:03:40.709> but<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.069> have<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.340> look<00:03:41.519> for

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
kind of nice but you have to look for

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.640 
kind of nice but you have to look for
the<00:03:41.760> targets<00:03:42.120> for<00:03:42.269> this<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.510> work<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.959> target

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
the targets for this to work the target

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.979 
the targets for this to work the target
meaning<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:44.430> guy<00:03:44.579> we're<00:03:45.510> kind<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.810> target

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
meaning the guy we're kind of a target

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.780 
meaning the guy we're kind of a target
so<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> lot<00:03:46.859> of<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:47.010> guys<00:03:47.190> when<00:03:47.459> they<00:03:47.519> do<00:03:47.639> this

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
so a lot of the guys when they do this

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.400 
so a lot of the guys when they do this
turn<00:03:48.000> expect<00:03:48.450> away<00:03:48.690> from<00:03:48.870> union<00:03:49.109> put<00:03:49.260> your

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
turn expect away from union put your

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.840 
turn expect away from union put your
feet<00:03:49.560> together<00:03:49.739> if<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.340> happens<00:03:50.730> this

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
feet together if that happens this

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.920 
feet together if that happens this
pattern<00:03:51.269> is<00:03:51.329> not<00:03:51.480> going<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.720> be<00:03:51.780> real

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
pattern is not going to be real

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.690 
pattern is not going to be real
comfortable<00:03:52.290> if<00:03:52.889> they<00:03:52.920> leave<00:03:53.310> your<00:03:53.489> legs

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
comfortable if they leave your legs

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.879 
comfortable if they leave your legs
apart<00:03:53.910> they're<00:03:54.420> leaving<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.840> target<00:03:55.139> if<00:03:55.799> I

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
apart they're leaving the target if I

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.470 
apart they're leaving the target if I
step<00:03:56.190> out<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.519> my<00:03:56.670> left<00:03:56.880> foot<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.209> leave<00:03:57.389> my

step out to my left foot I leave my

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.090 
step out to my left foot I leave my
right<00:03:57.690> foot<00:03:57.900> extended<00:03:58.380> she'll<00:03:58.530> do<00:03:58.650> her<00:03:58.680> turns

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
right foot extended she'll do her turns

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.099 
right foot extended she'll do her turns
at<00:03:59.880> the<00:03:59.970> end<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.329> turn<00:04:00.600> she's<00:04:00.900> going<00:04:01.049> to

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
at the end of the turn she's going to

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.930 
at the end of the turn she's going to
connect<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.709> side<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.069> my<00:04:02.130> letter<00:04:02.370> now

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
connect to the side of my letter now

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.220 
connect to the side of my letter now
when<00:04:03.090> she<00:04:03.209> makes<00:04:03.420> that<00:04:03.569> connection<00:04:03.870> she's<00:04:04.109> not

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
when she makes that connection she's not

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.470 
when she makes that connection she's not
kicking<00:04:04.560> me<00:04:04.739> she's<00:04:05.130> absorbing<00:04:05.549> so<00:04:06.299> she's

again that one would connects their leg
is<00:04:33.460> one<00:04:33.820> two<00:04:34.420> she<00:04:34.930> brings<00:04:35.200> it<00:04:35.320> up<00:04:35.410> mix<00:04:35.980> the

is one two she brings it up mix the

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.180 
is one two she brings it up mix the

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
turns finds the leg boom turns it right

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.550 
turns finds the leg boom turns it right
back<00:04:39.430> around<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.910> out<00:04:40.150> you<00:04:40.360> go<00:04:40.390> one<00:04:40.960> two<00:04:41.230> three

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
back around and out you go one two three

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.740 
back around and out you go one two three
big<00:04:42.160> key<00:04:42.430> there<00:04:42.730> she's<00:04:43.030> connecting<00:04:43.540> right

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
big key there she's connecting right

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.570 
big key there she's connecting right
behind<00:04:44.080> my<00:04:44.230> knee<00:04:44.290> so<00:04:44.890> that<00:04:45.100> would<00:04:45.250> actually

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
behind my knee so that would actually

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.580 
behind my knee so that would actually
bend<00:04:45.940> my<00:04:46.120> knee<00:04:46.180> if<00:04:46.570> you<00:04:46.630> go<00:04:46.870> down<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.380> calf

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
bend my knee if you go down to the calf

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.320 
bend my knee if you go down to the calf
or<00:04:47.830> up<00:04:47.950> on<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.190> thigh<00:04:48.340> that's<00:04:48.700> like<00:04:48.820> I<00:04:48.940> get<00:04:49.210> it

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
or up on the thigh that's like I get it

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.670 
or up on the thigh that's like I get it
so<00:04:49.390> it's<00:04:49.510> going<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.690> be<00:04:49.750> kind<00:04:49.960> of<00:04:50.020> abrupt<00:04:50.410> stop

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
so it's going to be kind of abrupt stop

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.040 
so it's going to be kind of abrupt stop
but<00:04:51.280> by<00:04:51.430> putting<00:04:51.790> it<00:04:51.850> there<00:04:52.090> I<00:04:52.150> can<00:04:52.390> cushion<00:04:52.780> a

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
but by putting it there I can cushion a

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.840 
but by putting it there I can cushion a
need<00:04:53.260> to<00:04:53.740> actually<00:04:54.010> help<00:04:54.160> winder<00:04:54.580> up<00:04:54.670> to

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
need to actually help winder up to

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.380 
need to actually help winder up to
spinner

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
spinner

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.970 
spinner
so<00:04:55.510> I'm<00:04:55.600> spinning<00:04:55.930> it<00:04:55.990> with<00:04:56.110> my<00:04:56.200> hand<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:56.680> my
