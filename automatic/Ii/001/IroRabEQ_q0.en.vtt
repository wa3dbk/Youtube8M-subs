 Here is the small parking lot, where one can park 

00:00:06.077 --> 00:00:12.308
 when going on expeditions to Sangstrup Klint. 

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:22.177
 Behind the cliff in the distance, just visible through the fog, 

00:00:22.177 --> 00:00:26.065
 is Karlby Klint, another cliff and other place to park. 

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:31.390

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.937
 where Sangstrup Klint starts right here.
