00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.670
 in this tutorial we will see how fast and effective it is to correct with photos 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.720
 study 9 the most common errors due to incorrect positioning of the camera 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.599
 at the time of shooting 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.059
 let's take the first example, double-click and enter the editors 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.349
 when we take a picture with a very wide horizon line it is a lot 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.839
 difficult then these lines will be perfectly horizontal 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.130
 chillin help the horizon level tool of photostudio we click 

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:31.319
 icon 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:37.180
 and a guideline appears, just place the guideline exactly 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.720
 where our horizon is 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.579
 click on apply and the image of automatically corrected 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.660
 another widespread case 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.720
 is what happens when we photograph buildings 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.460
 if the camera is not exactly parallel to the surface 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.460
 of the building this will be elusive upwards 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.620
 in this case we use the collinearity tool 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.780
 the prince the same we take our reference line repositions 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.480
 grindstone 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.480
 on two sides we know should be parallel 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.880
 we click again on apply or with the right mouse button 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.430
 and the image will automatically appear 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.820
 transformed 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.820
 excess part files thematically cut out 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.110
 the last example we will see is that of flat surfaces 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.810
 also in this case if the machine is not positioned correctly 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.970
 we will have a strong perspective effect we can correct this problem with 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.700
 the perspective tool 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.840
 the prince always the same we position the corners of ours 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.400
 driving angle 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.750
 on four corners of what should be a flat surface 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.270
 it's right-clicking again 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.020
 our image will be corrected
