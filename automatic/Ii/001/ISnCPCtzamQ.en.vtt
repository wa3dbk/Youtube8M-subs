 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:30.060
 tutorial today we're going to talk about crampons 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.820
 the great paul is an element together with the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.239
 essential ice ax for safety 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.879
 in snowy terrain first question to know 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.220
 choose the great pon suitable for the type 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.140
 of boot that we are using not all 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.820
 all crampons are valid for all 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.030
 boots things we have to have in 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.190
 account there are boots that are flexible there 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.470
 others for example as is this case the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.680
 or where in this case that both are 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.390
 totally rigid but we can observe 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.120
 that some have a few or some 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.739
 marks ahead that others do not have 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.270
 in front and behind and there are other 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.470
 totally rigid therefore what 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.350
 first question that we have to have 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.810
 in account is in the case of boots that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.270
 have flexibility either because they are 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.910
 totally flexible or semi flexible or 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.770
 semi rigid we will have to use 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.530
 always great you have mobility 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.960
 that is, they are modular and have 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.220
 movement if you do not have this movement 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.610
 and we use crampons 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.800
 do not have movement that is rigid is 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.380
 there will be fatigue in the flexion area 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.930
 and in the end it will break but there is something more 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.140
 there is also the choice of this great 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.050
 paul referred to the type of closure that 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.120
 have we would have the classic or more 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.680
 polyvalent is valid for all types for 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.320
 almost every type of boot that is the 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.390
 straps here for example a flexible 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.540
 without any problem 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.730
 would close we could use another one for 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.740
 rigid example a little more technical 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.360
 exactly the same and exactly the same 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.950
 with the other two for example we would have 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.930
 then another type of closures that would be the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.820
 semiautomatic here we see as I said 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.800
 before the footrest of the front 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.860
 where you see the toe cap and a closure 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.810
 quick block lock in this no 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.590
 we could put this for a matter of 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.590
 that does not have behind 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.190
 the special or specific support that the 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.020
 manufacturer has designed for him 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.470
 I would place the front and 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.570
 directly a click is what closes it 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.430
 and then we would have finally we would have 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.100
 the automatic where we see that it has 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.140
 in front of this arch and the area of â€‹â€‹closed 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.270
 of closing ahead we could not 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.980
 use it on a boot that does not have 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.720
 the arc marked for example and we have 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.980
 have to go to a more technical boot like 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.810
 example this type or the crossing 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.659
 burst would go placed in front and 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.170
 exactly the same in front would close 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:53.599
 we already know the great little we need 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.120
 the next thing will be to adjust it to the size 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.670
 of our boot for example for this 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.610
 we usually find several systems 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.680
 according to brands 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.740
 recommended way or the one we tell you 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.860
 that is much more versatile is the one 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.630
 simply with the gesture of lifting 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.010
 a little pin that you have you can 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.530
 increase or decrease the size without any 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.320
 problem there are others like for example this 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.940
 kind that they already need tools 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.730
 special in this case from here to a 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.220
 screwdriver adjustment errors this 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.550
 will mean that the size is not the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.560
 correct we have closed it so much that it has 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.110
 the bar stood out for the part of 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.300
 back this is dangerous because it can 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.810
 hit the rock or in a movement 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.510
 and make us jump the heel of the floor 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.150
 and therefore lose the placement 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.970
 correct heel on snow yes 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.890
 this would have to stay like that would have to 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.310
 cut it but remember if we cut it 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.020
 we lose the great sizing on the other 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.180
 adjustments that we have left 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.560
 excessively long that is to say it is very 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.260
 adjusted our size is in our 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.209
 boot is too big for this 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.180
 kind of great pon we can never leave it 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.700
 in the last or last but one hole 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.780
 adjustment should always remain at least 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.389
 between 2 and 3 separation holes in 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.220
 this case the maximum adjustment that 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.530
 we should have is still advisable 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.610
 it would be this that exceeds minimum two 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.620
 holes would still be somewhat tight 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.930
 we put the boot in this flexible case 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.039
 we place it in front and place it 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:36.039
 behind so that when you put the boot 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:39.699
 we can lift it without it being too big 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:41.259
 put in the case of automatic adjustment 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.300
 and semi-automatic 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.669
 here we have correctly placed 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.560
 as they should be in terms of 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.630
 length of each in each of the 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.919
 boot - type cases within 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.020
 automatic that has something in front 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.690
 we will have to press forward 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.810
 the bow that we see that it fits well and 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.880
 includes well within the brand's 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.349
 what it has and behind it brings you to 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.750
 adjusted in this case to the borders 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:07.240
 although it is possible that in some cases 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.550
 like this great paul has no borders and 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.510
 therefore not normal that makes us stop 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.980
 to mark it at any time can be 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.130
 come back that means that 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.010
 is set incorrectly so 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.200
 we will both have to adjust in terms of 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.800
 the length with the pin so that 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.330
 stay as 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.759
 it should be correctly 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.560
 would be in that position we also have or 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:35.500
 we have in rear blockers 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.080
 a rosquita that is adjustment 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.879
 micrometer this is important to have it 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.740
 account since the heights of the 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:44.020
 heels we in all cases the same 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.780
 of the boots we also have other types 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.690
 of adjustments that would be so much to move 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.569
 the bow that is in front metallic and 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.000
 also for the back and for 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:57.129
 last join the great paul to the boot 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.139
 remember that the big one put the last 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.270
 item that is put on the boot the 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:04.389
 gaiter or the boot cover would go underneath 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.419
 of the great pon in this case we are going to 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:09.759
 need the tape we take it and you 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.159
 we will remove the retreats or the sad ones that 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.949
 can be created would go first to the 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:16.990
 part of the leading derailleur that 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:21.280
 we have or adjustment that we have in the part 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.740
 ahead we pass it and adjust now the 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.780
 next that we have would be the one of the 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.650
 heel counter just where from where 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.710
 we have started from the inside out 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.380
 exactly the same 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.070
 we are since then so much friction does not 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.280
 they will allow it 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:41.180
 and finally they would go over part 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.699
 upper part of the instep would enter 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.729
 buckle that are normally closing 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:49.009
 fast here on this site we would give the 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:50.750
 last adjustment issues we have to 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:54.020
 keep in mind the buckle is always going to 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:57.590
 stay on the outside of the body 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.780
 since the villa could be hooked with 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.449
 him or the side tip of the other great 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.990
 put and you also have to take into account 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:07.580
 that the crampons are left or 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.919
 rights just like the boots so 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.420
 as long as it will be placed the same 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.520
 great put in the same boot 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.400
 the excess tape should never be 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.530
 less than about 810 centimeters 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.510
 if there is such a long leftover we will have 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:25.290
 to finish it off and if it remains excessively 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:27.780
 long then we will have to cut it never 

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:30.690
 there should be left over hanging since 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.640
 they can trip us up 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.030
 to adjust them and learn to place them 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.610
 in your house or in a quiet place never 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:41.280
 you have to hurry to the place where we are going to 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.020
 use them when you put them on when 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.700
 we think we should have the 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.250
 posts is already too late so 

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.750
 so much is better to anticipate and also 

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.090
 as a recommendation all crampons 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.790
 they must carry what is called the old 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.260
 or the anti fire to take them without them as 

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.090
 is the case of this that we have here at 

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:00.480
 side means that they can be done 

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:04.670
 fires of ice and therefore they make 

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:08.070
 the tips are not effective and remember 

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:10.430
 help us make the mountains more 

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.430
 secure
