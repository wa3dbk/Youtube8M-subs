rushing enemies and doing things like

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.500 
rushing enemies and doing things like
that<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:54.949> know<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.760> can<00:00:55.940> only<00:00:56.000> take<00:00:56.269> two<00:00:56.300> or

someone shoots you the first instinct is

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.380 
someone shoots you the first instinct is
to<00:01:00.289> get<00:01:00.679> behind<00:01:00.980> some<00:01:01.160> cover<00:01:01.399> it<00:01:01.550> it<00:01:02.179> really

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
to get behind some cover it it really

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.240 
to get behind some cover it it really
feeds<00:01:02.690> into<00:01:02.899> that<00:01:03.199> intense<00:01:03.649> feeling<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:04.160> we

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
feeds into that intense feeling that we

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.190 
feeds into that intense feeling that we
really<00:01:04.519> want<00:01:04.699> from<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.150> gun<00:01:05.870> combat

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
really want from the gun combat

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.580 
really want from the gun combat
experience<00:01:07.120> and<00:01:08.120> what<00:01:08.210> he<00:01:08.330> said<00:01:08.570> we<00:01:09.290> spent<00:01:09.500> a

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
experience and what he said we spent a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.840 
experience and what he said we spent a
lot<00:01:09.620> of<00:01:09.800> time<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.190> effort<00:01:10.310> on<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.640> cover

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
lot of time and effort on the cover

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.460 
lot of time and effort on the cover
system<00:01:11.090> because<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.659> player<00:01:11.900> will<00:01:12.140> spend<00:01:12.350> a

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
system because the player will spend a

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.830 
system because the player will spend a
lot<00:01:12.620> of<00:01:12.650> time<00:01:12.770> using<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:13.490> but<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.480> have<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:14.750> be

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
lot of time using it but you have to be

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.690 
lot of time using it but you have to be
careful<00:01:15.050> because<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.680> cover<00:01:15.920> can<00:01:16.159> often<00:01:16.610> be

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
careful because the cover can often be

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.640 
careful because the cover can often be
easily<00:01:17.090> destroyed<00:01:17.600> so<00:01:18.020> if<00:01:18.110> you're<00:01:18.230> hiding

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
easily destroyed so if you're hiding

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.020 
easily destroyed so if you're hiding
behind<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:19.010> fence<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.580> starts<00:01:19.939> to

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
behind a fence and it starts to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.870 
behind a fence and it starts to
disintegrate<00:01:20.180> it's<00:01:21.049> time<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:21.470> move<00:01:21.619> elsewhere

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
disintegrate it's time to move elsewhere

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.280 
disintegrate it's time to move elsewhere
just<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.030> car<00:01:23.270> physical<00:01:23.869> this

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
just the car physical this

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.080 
just the car physical this
destructibility<00:01:24.920> was<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.310> big<00:01:25.520> thing<00:01:25.759> for<00:01:25.790> us

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
destructibility was a big thing for us

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.730 
destructibility was a big thing for us
we<00:01:26.270> wanted<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.540> fill<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.960> whole<00:01:27.110> city<00:01:27.439> with<00:01:27.710> a

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
we wanted to fill the whole city with a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.649 
we wanted to fill the whole city with a

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
so the player felt that they could

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.110 
so the player felt that they could
pretty<00:01:31.159> much<00:01:31.250> destroy<00:01:31.820> anything

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
brutal so it's a very simple system

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.270 
brutal so it's a very simple system
using<00:02:04.080> two<00:02:04.260> buttons<00:02:04.620> you<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:04.950> form<00:02:05.130> these

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
using two buttons you have form these

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.310 
using two buttons you have form these
either<00:02:05.520> hard<00:02:06.090> punches<00:02:06.510> are<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.750> punches<00:02:07.170> and

either hard punches are like punches and
then<00:02:07.410> using<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.800> combination<00:02:07.980> of<00:02:08.369> these<00:02:08.550> you

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
then using a combination of these you

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.790 
then using a combination of these you
put<00:02:09.240> on<00:02:09.360> these<00:02:09.450> finishing<00:02:09.899> moves<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.440> coolest

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
thing is these finishing moves are sort

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.030 
thing is these finishing moves are sort
of<00:02:12.120> context<00:02:12.570> sensitive<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.590> where<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.890> are
