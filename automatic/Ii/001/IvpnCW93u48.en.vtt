00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.420
 well then again we are going to make another 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.800
 standard air training 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.460
 to have life fully mind 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.460
 cleansed 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.059
 we are going to hit him 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.059
 20 shots 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.439
 if we keep there 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.439
 the score around 350 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.060
 this afternoon I will go to buy 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.030
 wood paint already to make well the 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.360
 white butt that this is not seen from 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.360
 of chewing gum 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.380
 still good 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.310
 I see one for black is unforgivable 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.450
 one out of black is 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.450
 identical fucking whore 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.870
 and the circulation would have been very good 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.900
 good if he had not gone away the 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.180
 black because this was the 10th wait for the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.930
 10 this is a new interior 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.850
 this is a 6 what remedy this suv almost 9 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 but it's an 8 but the rump does very 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.180
 good and this is gone or I find out 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.640
 where did he go 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.640
 then you see it is the best grouping 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.260
 the penalty is everything that goes outside 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.260
 of the black no 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.310
 his would be everything that went out 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.340
 of 9 but not at that level has not yet 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.340
 arrived 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.850
 and yet the new faith is thrown in 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.850
 competition 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.450
 so good note 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.200
 the last two have been very good 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.820
 in addition to fast very good has not been 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.980
 moved nothing but there has been a patch it 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.680
 He did not go low 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.739
 the issue of the look in fact there is 20 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.010
 even so, the circulation has been different 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.010
 10 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.470
 this 9 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.180
 18 18 and 18 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.690
 Yes, good 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.690
 if it were not for this letter 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.690
 we would be right at nine on average 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.170
 now yes that good 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:01.440
 the hair 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.440
 same signed signature based on competition 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.880
 if we go back a little we make a couple of 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.980
 travels 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.980
 and we are going back to 66 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.110
 and 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.640
 first shot has been very bad that 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.990
 normally only throw fatal first shot 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.700
 and as it goes well 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.110
 but there was a bad shot in this way in 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.030
 the output the black with which you have to 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.980
 to be 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.750
 happy 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.750
 well , we see it again 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:56.300
 has dropped another 10 almost 210 is that they are 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.170
 Nine to here is a pair of eights and 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.170
 nothing for now 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.700
 I regret well later if it was not 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.760
 for this then almost the average 9 then what 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.430
 I'm going to count well go 12 go 15 good 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.299
 I'm going to throw other 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.299
 in commas 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.280
 this time we are going to tell me in the points 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:23.950
 I believe that the moment goes for 1 547 a 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.950
 thing house 347 something like that 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.220
 to throw the systems 5 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.310
 and we count the score 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.960
 Y 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.850
 good to have the black 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.880
 so it could be that almost to good I do not 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.980
 do not know where they will have given 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.280
 ie good as well but is 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.970
 of the black I already 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.970
 I'm happy 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.570
 Well well well well well 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.710
 how good this would be the result of 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.180
 Diana 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.190
 let's count the points here you lose 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.920
 456 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.920
 7-8 9-10 11-12 13-14 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:32.360
 6 7 and 8 19 20 21 22 23 and 24 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:36.370
 24 multiplied it by 2 because he had the 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.940
 half would be 48 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:46.530
 48 we are talking about 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:46.530
 Well, motherfucker a 352 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.249
 in a competition it would be a 352 and 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.080
 would have been second in the community 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:56.550
 of madrid in the last one of regional 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.180
 counting on this 6 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:04.710
 so very very well 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:06.930
 I repeat 552 352 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.760
 but the grouping all within the 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.760
 eight of nine only escapes from this one 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.600
 cool 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.980
 Looking forward to the competition 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.630
 so you can see that I'm in 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:24.590
 trainings around 350 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.590
 and that's it
