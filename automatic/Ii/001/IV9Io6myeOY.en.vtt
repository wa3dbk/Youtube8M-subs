00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
flows down the groove in the needle this

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.540 
flows down the groove in the needle this
is<00:01:05.150> important<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:06.830> make<00:01:07.010> this<00:01:07.250> stitching

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
is important to make this stitching

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.520

easier<00:01:09.190> stitching<00:01:10.190> is<00:01:10.340> quite<00:01:10.610> easy<00:01:11.200> just<00:01:12.200> push

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
easier stitching is quite easy just push

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.430 
easier stitching is quite easy just push
it<00:01:12.740> through<00:01:12.910> the<00:01:13.910> material<00:01:14.480> as<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.810> see<00:01:15.080> and

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
it through the material as you see and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.930 
it through the material as you see and
then<00:01:16.630> pull<00:01:17.630> out<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.840> length<00:01:18.229> of<00:01:18.410> thread

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
then pull out a length of thread

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.310 
then pull out a length of thread
depending<00:01:19.940> on<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.270> distance<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:20.960> want<00:01:21.140> to

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
depending on the distance you want to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.820 
depending on the distance you want to
sew

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
sew

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.090

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
if you're going to sew say 12 inches

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.900 
if you're going to sew say 12 inches
then<00:01:25.790> pull<00:01:26.270> out<00:01:26.300> about<00:01:27.010> 14<00:01:28.010> inches<00:01:28.040> of<00:01:28.610> thread

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
then pull out about 14 inches of thread

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.550 
then pull out about 14 inches of thread
now<00:01:31.910> take<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.510> needle<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.050> push<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.530> through

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
now take the needle and push it through

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.210 
now take the needle and push it through
the<00:01:34.040> next<00:01:34.250> hole<00:01:34.780> back<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:35.990> up<00:01:36.140> slightly<00:01:36.650> and

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
the next hole back it up slightly and

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.990 
the next hole back it up slightly and
you'll<00:01:38.060> see<00:01:38.330> it<00:01:38.450> forms<00:01:38.900> a<00:01:39.050> loop<00:01:39.580> take<00:01:40.580> one<00:01:40.910> of

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
you'll see it forms a loop take one of

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.290 
you'll see it forms a loop take one of
the<00:01:41.060> other<00:01:41.270> end<00:01:41.660> of<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:43.190> thread<00:01:43.220> through<00:01:44.119> the

the other end of the thread through the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.770 
the other end of the thread through the
loop<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:44.840> pull<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:46.130> needle<00:01:46.160> back<00:01:46.700> forming<00:01:47.690> a

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
loop and pull the needle back forming a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.889 
loop and pull the needle back forming a
lock<00:01:48.050> stitch<00:01:49.600> go<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.929> next<00:01:51.200> hole<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:53.570> do

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
lock stitch go to the next hole and do

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.260 
lock stitch go to the next hole and do
the<00:01:54.110> same<00:01:54.410> thing<00:01:54.770> with<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.789> end<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:56.149> the

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
the same thing with the end of the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.210 
the same thing with the end of the
thread<00:01:56.570> through<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.050> loop

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.960 

pull<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:04.000> back<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.600> create<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.290> lockstitch

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
pull it back and create the lockstitch

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.050 
pull it back and create the lockstitch
you<00:02:06.970> will<00:02:07.120> continue<00:02:07.570> this<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:09.550> whole<00:02:09.729> length

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
you will continue this the whole length

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.570 
you will continue this the whole length
of<00:02:10.620> the<00:02:11.620> distance<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.820> be<00:02:13.180> stitched
