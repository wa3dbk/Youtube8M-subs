00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.160 

so<00:01:52.120> this<00:01:52.300> time<00:01:52.480> you<00:01:52.630> aside<00:01:52.840> from<00:01:53.020> 76<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.990> then

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
so this time you aside from 76 and then

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.350 
so this time you aside from 76 and then
you<00:01:56.290> go<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.800> bar<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.790> ninth<00:01:58.030> on<00:01:58.450> top<00:01:59.020> three

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you go and bar the ninth on top three

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.560 
you go and bar the ninth on top three
looks<00:02:01.360> just<00:02:01.510> like<00:02:01.660> this

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.680 

the<00:02:05.050> look<00:02:05.230> on<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.560> bar<00:02:05.770> on<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.980> nice<00:02:06.130> stream<00:02:06.690> in

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
the look on you bar on a nice stream in

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.620 
the look on you bar on a nice stream in
addition<00:02:08.280> say<00:02:09.280> their<00:02:09.430> numbers<00:02:09.670> are<00:02:09.790> not<00:02:09.910> hi-c

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
addition say their numbers are not hi-c

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:19.410 
addition say their numbers are not hi-c
stream<00:02:10.870> so<00:02:14.580> 1214<00:02:15.580> well<00:02:17.490> we'll<00:02:18.490> start<00:02:18.910> from<00:02:19.120> 11

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
stream so 1214 well we'll start from 11

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.590 
stream so 1214 well we'll start from 11
to<00:02:19.450> 12<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.770> then<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.880> next<00:02:22.150> one<00:02:22.270> is<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.570> just

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
to 12 and then the next one is you just

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:43.309 
to 12 and then the next one is you just
repeat<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.170> first

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.979 

and<00:02:44.319> then<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.550> think<00:02:45.760> under<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.510> last<00:02:46.690> time

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
and then I think under the last time

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:58.550 
and then I think under the last time
after<00:02:47.769> this<00:02:48.190> I'll<00:02:48.760> show<00:02:48.819> you<00:02:49.150> what<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.390> do

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.350 

right<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.730> on<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.240> last<00:03:00.420> one<00:03:00.720> we<00:03:00.900> go

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.430 

and<00:03:03.720> on<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.050> sixth<00:03:04.350> one<00:03:04.880> after<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:07.260> go

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
and on the sixth one after this you go

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.420 
and on the sixth one after this you go
back<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.310> last<00:03:09.000> one<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.980> then<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.250> put<00:03:11.400> a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
back to the last one and then you put a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.730 
back to the last one and then you put a
six-month<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.570> repeat<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.960> intro<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:16.560> then

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
six-month you repeat the intro and then

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.970 
six-month you repeat the intro and then
goes<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.160> verse<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.720> verse<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.680> palm

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
goes to the verse the verse is you palm

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.730 
goes to the verse the verse is you palm
you<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.310> top<00:03:20.490> three

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
you the top three

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:30.440 
you the top three
those<00:03:23.810> five<00:03:24.810> times<00:03:25.820> and<00:03:26.820> then<00:03:27.450> open

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450
