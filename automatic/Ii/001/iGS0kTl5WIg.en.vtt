00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.540
 the offensive force of the america and the 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.210
 powerful style towards the front of 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.610
 matosas has not square at all in the 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.009
 team that has left gaps very 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.590
 important in the defense and that now 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:17.440
 has to cover urgently in 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.029
 this group we get along pretty well and 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.880
 we can say things in front there 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.490
 a particular I approach the teacher and I 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.800
 I commented because good one feels a 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.570
 little bit unprotected when when 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.760
 we went through the whole attack sometimes 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.660
 see that we only have two or three 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.360
 defend and good one complicates a 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.640
 little what he had planned, not what 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.250
 we understood very well as we attacked 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.500
 we had to go down to defend is the 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.739
 Last past we had more men 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.140
 recovery brand man and me 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.510
 I think that also plays a very important role 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.629
 very important however for bassinet 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.180
 muñoz the forms are set aside in a 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.539
 moment of transition that you have in the 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.030
 coapa team in america that wins is 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.710
 which I prefer I do not care how to have 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.360
 the ability to score goals in front 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.070
 but at the same time find the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.200
 balance to defend ourselves well and not 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.030
 receive that is what we are 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.040
 looking we have three matches with 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.580
 gustavo matosas go three matches that 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.860
 has then directed us such a change 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.290
 radical can not see so fast I think 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.750
 that this is a process I do see a 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.630
 improvement in the team from the moment in 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.530
 the one in which the new coaching staff 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.780
 took command of it to this date and 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.270
 about the match against Puebla 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.090
 recognizes the image that cuauhtemoc has 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.320
 white in the americanista hobby 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.640
 Cuauhtémoc has great respect in 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.530
 this institution the same hobby 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.930
 Americanist have the opportunity to see 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.439
 to your team in the Aztec stadium and 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.420
 same time to see an idol 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.950
 americanista although bring another t-shirt 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.020
 but see it still on the court that does not 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.579
 the whole game of Puebla goes through the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.320
 feet of cuauhtémoc have players 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.240
 important to the alústiza front is one of 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.909
 they 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.549
 also how I fear it is not to make a headline 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.850
 has not entered on the other hand the 74 in the 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.890
 two parties 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.550
 but it stays with me if they question it or 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.650
 they talk about time 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.230
 I do not think Paul would accept the question 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.810
 little at the moment he talks about not 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.400
 we are very offensive but here is 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.830
 happening not to abide in where we touch 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.320
 that maybe we do not understand it is that 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.970
 example what of this central 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.590
 aguilar is used to mohamed 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.150
 back already comes and understands 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.020
 also perfectly well that 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.310
 I bring from tijuana to for the america and 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.690
 they were also used to that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.130
 playing with two contentions they had one 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.470
 at times three state line 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.480
 given and a little and now it's not the famous 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.550
 give me shelter as vertigo was 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.380
 vertigo of killed stopped those that will be 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.160
 to accustom or you will have to look at 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.350
 June the defenses that suit you 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.620
 because now you see neither nacho 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.930
 gonzález ni jonny magallón at the time 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.220
 will be the big centrals 3 that I 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.750
 nothing that has united is something has weighed 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.520
 of goat is the same and he knew how to take 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.810
 I ask you to come with my 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.760
 Outside friends outings or not 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.150
 are the centrals if I did not try the average 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.540
 court 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.830
 pellerano pellerano at 32 33 years old 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.180
 they have is not to meet the 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.280
 functions that in lion well the rooster 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.280
 Vázquez and the cock just moves you all 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.359
 America of soccer you asked for 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.340
 a very tough internal grid this man 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.739
 is almost almost seeing him return to the 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.909
 era of mohamed as you say if 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.829
 you want to talk about what you 're asking for almost 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:55.310
 almost come back from the head of 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.510
 command and neither time and it says that everything 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.790
 it is questionable that it is questionable 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.540
 because like because in the second game 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.540
 tell you that 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.269
 talk more about this accommodation that I seek 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.489
 it can not 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.280
 and I think it 's insecure in a dressing room 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.620
 where there are so many egos can be given 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.720
 there is the grid that renault or not 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.280
 is exempt from one another but what 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.590
 good that in questions to your technician I 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.470
 it seems publicly 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.470
 it seems to me that now they say and if not 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:39.290
 here where we are I say of the court 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:44.380
 there is a dress code but if thou 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:47.449
 questions is not costing us now 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.550
 Dancing people very close Antonio Mohamed 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.750
 he was the champion with the lencho he was already 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.460
 champion with the america 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.460
 If someone esteemed Antonio Mohamed 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.690
 to stay pablo aguilar del císter 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.060
 that's the theory that I give them alberto 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.290
 Castilian that theory that as a 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:16.900
 axis is not with up with with televisa 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:19.039
 too many more friends we want to talk about 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.389
 of the awakening of chivas 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.770
 footballingly speaking you 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.880

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.770
 and here they want to talk but when yes 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.570

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.950

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:40.459
 the suggestion if you arrive at 4 o'clock
