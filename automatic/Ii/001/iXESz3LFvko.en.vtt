00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
the drawings in a ship constructor

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.749 
the drawings in a ship constructor
project<00:00:12.330> into<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> tree<00:00:13.049> structure<00:00:13.469> at<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.580> top

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
project into a tree structure at the top

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.519 
project into a tree structure at the top
of<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.969> tree<00:00:15.210> we<00:00:15.389> have<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.690> project<00:00:15.929> itself

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
of the tree we have the project itself

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.890 
of the tree we have the project itself
or<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.949> hull<00:00:17.180> within<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> whole<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:18.869> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
or the hull within the whole we have a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.990 
or the hull within the whole we have a
number<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.320> units<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.550> think<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.850> each

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
number of units you can think of each

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.820 
number of units you can think of each
unit<00:00:21.300> as<00:00:21.570> being<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.990> block<00:00:22.289> or<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> major

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
unit as being a block or a major

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.519 
unit as being a block or a major
assembly<00:00:23.570> within<00:00:24.570> each<00:00:24.840> unit<00:00:25.230> we<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
assembly within each unit we have a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.929 
assembly within each unit we have a
number<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.890> different<00:00:26.070> disciplines

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
number of different disciplines

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.700 
number of different disciplines
so<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.779> structured<00:00:28.289> drawings

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
so we have structured drawings

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.980 
so we have structured drawings
distributed<00:00:29.460> systems<00:00:29.880> drawings<00:00:30.420> equipment

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
distributed systems drawings equipment

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.380 
distributed systems drawings equipment
drawings<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
drawings and so on you can see on the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.600 
drawings and so on you can see on the
right<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.630> within<00:00:34.230> structure<00:00:34.980> drawings<00:00:35.460> are

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
right that within structure drawings are

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.770 
right that within structure drawings are
arranged<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.180> two<00:00:36.300> directories

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
arranged in two directories

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.319 
arranged in two directories
automatically<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.399> frame<00:00:38.700> drawings

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
automatically so we have frame drawings

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.330 
automatically so we have frame drawings
longitudinal<00:00:40.050> bulkhead<00:00:40.469> deck<00:00:40.739> drawings<00:00:41.219> and

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
longitudinal bulkhead deck drawings and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.400 
longitudinal bulkhead deck drawings and
so<00:00:41.550> forth<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.090> then<00:00:42.660> within<00:00:42.840> each<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.110> those

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
so forth and then within each of those

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.920 
so forth and then within each of those
systems<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.730> individual<00:00:45.300> model

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
systems we have the individual model

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.860 
systems we have the individual model
drawings<00:00:46.670> within<00:00:47.670> distributed<00:00:48.239> systems<00:00:48.629> we

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
drawings within distributed systems we

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.560 
drawings within distributed systems we
have<00:00:49.050> pipe<00:00:49.289> drawings<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.879> do<00:00:51.300> pipe

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
have pipe drawings so we can do pipe

we<00:04:10.470> can<00:04:10.590> go<00:04:10.710> down<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.160> pipe<00:04:11.520> drawing<00:04:11.940> and

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
we can go down to a pipe drawing and

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.120 
we can go down to a pipe drawing and
open<00:04:12.840> up<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.200> drawing<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:16.530> pipe<00:04:16.770> drawing

can xref in other equipment drawings for

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.610 
can xref in other equipment drawings for
defining<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.450> starting<00:04:21.930> points<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.380> pipes

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
defining the starting points of pipes

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.770 
defining the starting points of pipes
and<00:04:22.979> then<00:04:23.430> if<00:04:23.580> we<00:04:23.729> zoom<00:04:23.970> in<00:04:24.120> for<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.360> closer<00:04:24.630> look

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
and then if we zoom in for a closer look

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.810 
and then if we zoom in for a closer look
we<00:04:25.080> can<00:04:25.260> see<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.680> all<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.950> our<00:04:26.070> pipe<00:04:26.340> modeling

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
we can see that all of our pipe modeling

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.140 
we can see that all of our pipe modeling
can

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
can

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.030 
can
take<00:04:27.240> place<00:04:27.479> in<00:04:27.690> destroying<00:04:28.169> so<00:04:28.860> that

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
take place in destroying so that

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.340 
take place in destroying so that

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
and so forth again we can use the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.640 
and so forth again we can use the

and nest smaller parts later if we zoom

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.189 
and nest smaller parts later if we zoom

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
we take a look at an individual profile

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.700 
we take a look at an individual profile
plot<00:06:11.430> we<00:06:12.030> can<00:06:12.180> see<00:06:12.240> that<00:06:12.659> each<00:06:12.810> profile<00:06:13.409> is

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
plot we can see that each profile is

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.570 
plot we can see that each profile is
automatically<00:06:14.669> dimensioned<00:06:15.620> and<00:06:16.620> other

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
automatically dimensioned and other

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.430 
automatically dimensioned and other
information<00:06:17.940> such<00:06:18.599> as<00:06:18.659> the<00:06:19.020> end<00:06:19.169> cut

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.640 
treatment or be applied to the profile
is<00:06:21.960> automatically<00:06:22.919> included<00:06:23.460> on<00:06:23.610> the<00:06:23.760> drawing

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
is automatically included on the drawing

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.260 
is automatically included on the drawing
so<00:06:25.650> let's<00:06:25.860> finish<00:06:26.039> up<00:06:26.280> by<00:06:26.490> going<00:06:26.699> back<00:06:27.000> to

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
so let's finish up by going back to

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.029 
so let's finish up by going back to
where<00:06:27.539> we<00:06:27.659> started<00:06:27.690> which<00:06:28.289> is<00:06:28.470> at<00:06:28.620> the<00:06:28.740> unit
