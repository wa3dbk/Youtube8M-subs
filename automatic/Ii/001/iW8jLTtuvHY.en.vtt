00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.100 
time as I've gone through my career I
realized<00:02:34.970> at<00:02:35.150> some<00:02:35.180> point<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:35.750> needed<00:02:36.019> to

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
realized at some point I needed to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.380 
realized at some point I needed to
retire<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.800> I<00:02:37.640> wanted<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.910> go<00:02:38.030> on<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.330> do

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
retire and I wanted to go on and do

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.590 
retire and I wanted to go on and do
other<00:02:38.510> things<00:02:39.280> things<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.489> philanthropy<00:02:41.030> and

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
other things things in philanthropy and

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.660 
other things things in philanthropy and
doing<00:02:42.380> more<00:02:42.530> experimental<00:02:43.100> kind<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.370> films

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
doing more experimental kind of films

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.000 
doing more experimental kind of films
but<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:43.970> couldn't<00:02:44.390> really<00:02:44.510> drag<00:02:45.440> my<00:02:45.620> company

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
but I couldn't really drag my company

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.420 
but I couldn't really drag my company
into<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:47.840> felt<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.650> was<00:02:48.769> time<00:02:48.980> for<00:02:49.040> me

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
into that and I felt it was time for me

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.150 
into that and I felt it was time for me
to<00:02:50.080> start<00:02:51.080> thinking<00:02:51.380> about<00:02:51.530> retiring<00:02:51.950> and

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160

good solid home for the company and the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.060 
good solid home for the company and the
first<00:03:27.410> place<00:03:28.040> i<00:03:28.220> thought<00:03:28.459> was<00:03:29.049> disney<00:03:30.070> they're

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
first place i thought was disney they're

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.720 
first place i thought was disney they're
large<00:03:31.340> enough<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.540> match<00:03:33.320> of<00:03:33.739> what<00:03:34.700> our

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
large enough and the match of what our

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.120 
large enough and the match of what our
two<00:03:34.970> companies<00:03:35.180> are<00:03:35.660> is<00:03:35.930> just<00:03:36.769> perfect

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
two companies are is just perfect

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.860 
two companies are is just perfect

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
because we're like a mini disney we have

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.660 
because we're like a mini disney we have
the<00:03:38.959> same<00:03:39.200> kind<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.620> operations<00:03:40.220> we<00:03:40.370> do<00:03:40.519> the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
the same kind of operations we do the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.490 
the same kind of operations we do the
same<00:03:40.880> kind<00:03:41.090> of<00:03:41.209> thing<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.720> I've<00:03:42.200> worked<00:03:42.350> with

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
same kind of thing and I've worked with

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.130

Disney<00:03:42.950> over<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.730> years<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.239> know<00:03:44.299> how

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
Disney over the years and I know how

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.199 
Disney over the years and I know how
they<00:03:45.319> operate<00:03:45.350> so<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.340> was<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.549> perfect<00:03:47.030> match

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
they operate so it was a perfect match

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.800 
they operate so it was a perfect match
of<00:03:47.569> two<00:03:48.139> companies<00:03:48.590> that<00:03:48.769> are<00:03:49.810> constructed

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
of two companies that are constructed

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.199 
of two companies that are constructed
similarly<00:03:51.350> do<00:03:52.069> the<00:03:52.220> same<00:03:52.430> kind<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:52.819> product
