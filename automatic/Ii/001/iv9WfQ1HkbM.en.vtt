 politics tells you not to use products 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.160
 then industrialized if you 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.800
 preferably if you want to eat calabresa 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.890

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:30.610
 excess of fat that just by seeing me 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:33.750
