audio<00:01:51.689> tower<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.470> then<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> higher<00:01:53.280> video

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
audio tower and then like a higher video

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.510 
audio tower and then like a higher video
base<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.329> hire<00:01:54.780> smaller<00:01:55.259> video<00:01:55.710> base<00:01:56.009> as<00:01:56.280> well

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
base you hire smaller video base as well

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.940 
base you hire smaller video base as well
and<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:57.119> also<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> little

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
and then also one like this but a little

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.649 
and then also one like this but a little
bit<00:01:59.040> narrower<00:01:59.520> correct<00:02:00.240> if<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.509> have<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
bit narrower correct if you have a
