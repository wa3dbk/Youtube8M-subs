00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:36.660

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:31.139

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.340
 This is not so good for me 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.269
 although my life is regenerating 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:47.120
 again and there is something with it 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:47.120

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.940
 cars

 you have weapons shop but the weapons are 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.230
 quite expensive logistics that no money so 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.310
 do not recover so fast 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.730
 Why do I turn around though? 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.730

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.040
 okay okay 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.220
 against almost dead but still alive 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.970
 I am waiting now until I live my life 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:38.900
 regenerated and of course one 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.669
 that alone is the only thing that really remained 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.039
 that was not wise that was not 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:48.289
 busy yes I think it is coming 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:55.340

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:58.720

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.720

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.730
 I think so realistic now 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.210
 but somehow it feels that way too 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.210

 I almost belonged dead in a convertible 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.690
