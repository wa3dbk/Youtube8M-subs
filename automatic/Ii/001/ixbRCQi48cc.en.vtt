00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
was any movement so I had to be really

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.789 
was any movement so I had to be really

some parts that are definitely supposed

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.780

to<00:04:00.350> be<00:04:00.410> armor<00:04:00.859> there's<00:04:01.280> this<00:04:01.459> really

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
to be armor there's this really

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.879
