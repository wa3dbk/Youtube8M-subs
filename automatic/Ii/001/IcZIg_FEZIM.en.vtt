00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.780
 this time I'm going to solve some 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.030
 doubts that you have about how 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.099
 I draw what colors I use and all that 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.960
 kind of things and well let's know 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.009
 before which is your favorite brand of 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.829
 good colors my favorite brand 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.680
 really if it's a famous brand to what 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:30.050
 better many do not know her but this is 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.450
 which has many many creamy colors 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.810
 and if the truth really lasts 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.520
 ok I think between 300 the second 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.220
 question is how to illuminate your drawings 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.820
 when I did not illuminate it normally as 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.820
 others do it 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.710
 Well the third question is how he added 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.420
 light and shadow to my drawings good alone 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.020
 there are many already know but they 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.020
 needs to 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.420
 what kind of drawings do you do well I think 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.070
 already in the past video that already has a lot 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.590
 time that I recorded it to teach them to 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.930
 make some drawings whether these 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.549
 drawings but I've made new ones from 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.670
 a series that I like a lot I like 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.720
 much the cartoon the truth I'm not 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.720
 josema fan 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.100
 the truth 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.380
 but I prefer in cartoons 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.360
 that are over there they just told me that 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.490
 it's called anime those those casinos the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.430
 I do because I do not like to follow 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.409
 in this I think I will make a video about 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.170
 nothing else the drawings because the truth if 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.869
 I already have enough cough and good I hope that 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:58.039
 about the truth and felt the question is 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.340
 what colors you recommend good if 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.720
 they refer to that they are just beginning to 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.509
 coloring, I would recommend that you 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.929
 will buy these kinds of colors are few 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:13.629
 but they have are and also the truth 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.989
 there is one that comes with double color of the 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.120
 so expensive but they are good you can 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.370
 use for school or to do 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.590
 your drawings but if you really want 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.120
 do very very good drawing and that 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.370
 I recommend these I think they come as 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.769
 five shades of red and five of 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.389
