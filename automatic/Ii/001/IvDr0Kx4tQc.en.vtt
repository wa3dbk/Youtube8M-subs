00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.389
 you can win a race without performing 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.100
 a shot on goal in 90 minutes 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.200
 the answer is yes because it is precisely the 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.820
 case of grottaglie matera runs the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.740
 twenty-fifth minute of the first half 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.180
 when botticini probably 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.369
 intimidated by the presence of a 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.679
 attacking opponent with this clumsy 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.080
 intervention sends the ball behind 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.269
 maraglino causing golf or better 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.880
 the own goal match that is worth the three points 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.829
 of the leaders matera on the ground of the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.010
 willing grotesque undeservedly 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.870
 more touring in front of the leaders 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.610
 the three points to the matera then and the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.649
 applause for the grottaglie but not 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.780
 produce points and by effect of 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.070
 results from the other fields away the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 cosco team from the immediate 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.969
 pursuers 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.519
 strong part of the matera, however, that holds 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.620
 only possession and intimidation 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.289
 opponents in the first 7 8 minutes of 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.219
 race more for awe than for 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.199
 actions produced 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.609
 the first shot in the mirror indeed 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.100
 reaches the ninth and is branded 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.379
 grottagliese and fumai that kicks 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.360
 directly on punishment but his 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.300
 run ends weakly in your arms 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.520
 of bifulco the grottaglie that must do to 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.050
 less than priest and sanna disqualified is done 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.540
 see the eighteenth with a beautiful one 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.460
 Pisan combined action formulated with 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.350
 the latter who downloads a shot from 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.260
 sixteen meters that shaves the pole 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.180
 at the 22nd we see for the first time the 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.460
 matera with cart that runs away on 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.560
 left wing but arrived at the time of 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.650
 cross hits badly and the action fades 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.200
 three minutes later the game goal e 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.500
 verses to cross from the right maraglino not 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.810
 intervenes botticini pressed sends 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.640
 the ball at the bottom of the bag and the own goal 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.100
 which will then be decisive for the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.990
 the grotesque victory of the Lucanians 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.660
 does not fit and reacts within two 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.390
 minutes before the 32nd with formuso e 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.700
 then he tries to create the 34th 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.530
 problems with the leaders but training 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.320
 lucana is saved in both 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.540
 circumstances at the fortieth tries 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.580
 Pisan on the left sector spins away 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.780
 but his tense cross ends his 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.070
 race in the arms of the extreme 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.170
 opponent defender 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.000
 you go to the locker room with the matera in 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.520
 advantage for a zero network 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.290
 in the second half after 60 seconds it was never there 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.069
 try on a free kick but his 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.930
 shooting is deflected by the barrier 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.579
 at the tenth minute things seem 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.950
 get well for the trained training 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.510
 a pettinicchio botticini anticipates 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.340
 cart that slips and ends up 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.569
 against the handrail that delimits the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.670
 locker room tunnel 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.409
 the reaction of the soccer player from Matera is 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.420
 in this football that is seen very well 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.370
 by the referee who draws the card 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.189
 red direct and sends it prematurely in 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.900
 changing rooms for a man but 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.090
 underneath a grosgrain net could 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.829
 take advantage of the situation but five 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.349
 minutes later it was never sinned 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.819
 of naivety mowing from behind a 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.650
 Lucan footballer 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.659
 the referee is there in two steps and with the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.790
 direct red restores parity 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.379
 numerical on the playing field 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.419
 shortly after half an hour twice 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.129
 the grottaglie makes as many run 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.840
 chills at the Materan rearguard 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.510
 albano on two occasions close 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.760
 over time it hits but the goalkeeper does 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.219
 save first by finding the challenge between the 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.840
 arms and then intercepting the ball 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.819
 diverting it to the corner at 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.069
 thirty-fourth counterattack of the Lucanians 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.109
 con dos santos that appears before 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.019
 maraglino but the grottagliese defense yes 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.819
 saves the owners in extremis on the 38th 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.159
 of home fail to finalize one 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.650
 goal ball with de toma that probably 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.959
 sin of altruism and finally the last 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.209
 the start of the race still gives him the 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.829
 captain but on defense that yes 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.620
 immola slipping in on 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.959
 straw-colored saving the capitulation in the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.090
 final convulse also moves forward 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.139
 maraglino but its presence in the area of 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.370
 rigor does not produce the effects 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.269
 desired 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.939
 even if the extreme defender 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.919
 grottagliese tries entering also a 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.870
 contact with the opposing goalkeeper and it is 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.939
 precisely from this contact that animates them 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.129
 they overheat and immediately after 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.590
 triple locking whistle is recorded 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.419
 also the expulsion of the goalkeeper from Matera 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.150
 the race ends with 5 minutes of recovery 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:00.340
 and with the matera that despite the good 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.719
 grottaglie test can find i 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.719
 three points with minimum effort
