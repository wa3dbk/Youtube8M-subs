collect<00:01:42.180> insects<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:43.020> catch<00:01:43.500> fish<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
collect insects to catch fish in and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.179 
collect insects to catch fish in and
take<00:01:44.189> them<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> museum<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.210> sort<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.320> at<00:01:47.130> a

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
take them to the museum to sort of at a

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.100 
take them to the museum to sort of at a
collection<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.479> different<00:01:48.780> creatures

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
collection of the different creatures

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.440 
collection of the different creatures
they<00:01:49.259> found<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:50.280> particular<00:01:50.670> insects<00:01:51.240> in

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
they found now particular insects in

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.960 
they found now particular insects in
particular<00:01:51.750> fish<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:53.250> particular<00:01:53.549> things

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
particular fish and particular things

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.030 
particular fish and particular things
are<00:01:54.270> only<00:01:54.450> available<00:01:54.689> at<00:01:55.259> particular<00:01:55.590> times<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
are only available at particular times a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.039 
are only available at particular times a
day<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.360> want<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.689> get<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.840> full

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
day and so if you want to get a full

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.450 
day and so if you want to get a full
collection<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.590> insects<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.950> maybe<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
collection of insects you maybe have to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.219 
collection of insects you maybe have to
get<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.700> late<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:00.420> night<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:00.659> early<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.140> the

morning or play in certain seasons so

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.569 
morning or play in certain seasons so
it's<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.530> game<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.799> will<00:02:04.890> unfold<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.549> a

it's a game that will unfold and have a
long<00:02:05.759> life<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.240> them<00:02:06.360> because<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.750> way<00:02:06.899> it

crossing new leaf has some new features

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.940 
crossing new leaf has some new features
it<00:02:12.959> brings<00:02:13.290> back<00:02:13.349> all<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.739> sort

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it brings back all the sort

in<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.780> previous<00:02:15.959> games<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.650> he<00:02:16.709> starts<00:02:16.980> on

the<00:02:17.099> gamecube<00:02:17.610> came<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> wii<00:02:18.660> was<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
the gamecube came to the wii was on the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.229 
the gamecube came to the wii was on the
d/s<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.250> my<00:02:20.310> daughter<00:02:20.519> played<00:02:20.790> quite<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.030> bit

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
d/s and my daughter played quite a bit

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.860 
d/s and my daughter played quite a bit
of<00:02:21.530> wild<00:02:22.530> world<00:02:22.940> animal<00:02:23.940> crossing<00:02:24.090> on<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.720> DS

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
of wild world animal crossing on the DS

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.770 
of wild world animal crossing on the DS
and<00:02:25.290> now<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.160> 3ds<00:02:26.459> but<00:02:27.269> this<00:02:27.420> isn't<00:02:27.629> some

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
and now on the 3ds but this isn't some

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.390 
and now on the 3ds but this isn't some
differences<00:02:28.200> as<00:02:28.379> well<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:28.769> this<00:02:28.860> time<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.280> get

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
differences as well so this time you get

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.220 
differences as well so this time you get
to<00:02:29.430> play<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.819> mayor<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.330> rather<00:02:31.019> than<00:02:31.170> having

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
to play the mayor so rather than having

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.440 
to play the mayor so rather than having
a<00:02:31.560> mayor<00:02:31.709> character<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.310> visit<00:02:32.819> and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
a mayor character that you visit and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.210 
a mayor character that you visit and
tells<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.840> what<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:33.989> do<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.470> now<00:02:34.680> play<00:02:35.010> that

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
tells you what to do you now play that

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.130 
tells you what to do you now play that
role<00:02:35.430> which<00:02:35.910> means<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.630> adds<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.870> little<00:02:36.989> bit

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
role which means it adds a little bit

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.509 
role which means it adds a little bit
more<00:02:37.319> of<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> sort<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.769> through<00:02:38.069> line<00:02:38.099> or<00:02:38.459> a

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
more of a sort of a through line or a

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.089 
more of a sort of a through line or a
story<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.269> game<00:02:39.560> it's<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.680> game<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.920> seems

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
story in the game it's a game that seems

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.039 
story in the game it's a game that seems
to<00:02:41.190> appeal<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.880> wider<00:02:42.180> range<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:42.630> our<00:02:42.750> family

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
to appeal to a wider range in our family

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.619 
to appeal to a wider range in our family
so<00:02:43.200> whereas<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:43.650> often<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.890> boys<00:02:44.160> playing

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629
