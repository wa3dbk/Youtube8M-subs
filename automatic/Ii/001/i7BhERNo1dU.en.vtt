00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.259 

lately<00:00:23.189> I've<00:00:23.279> been<00:00:23.369> using<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.760> little<00:00:23.910> trick

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
lately I've been using this little trick

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.460 
lately I've been using this little trick
which<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.660> take<00:00:24.869> one<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.140> these<00:00:25.199> cheap

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
which is to take one of these cheap

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.300 
which is to take one of these cheap
metal<00:00:25.800> paint<00:00:26.340> brushes<00:00:27.320> with<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> little<00:00:28.590> oil<00:00:29.099> on

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
metal paint brushes with a little oil on

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.659 
metal paint brushes with a little oil on
it<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> really<00:00:30.179> good<00:00:30.529> way<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.560> oil<00:00:32.279> stuff

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it it's a really good way to oil stuff

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.400 
it it's a really good way to oil stuff
up<00:00:32.880> without<00:00:33.090> making<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.540> huge<00:00:33.780> mess<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
up without making a huge mess and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.549 
up without making a huge mess and
getting<00:00:34.680> oil<00:00:34.800> everywhere<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.309> don't<00:00:35.460> want<00:00:35.640> it

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.950 

go<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.710> good<00:00:43.860> coating<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.520> it's

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
go to a good coating so that it's

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.510 
go to a good coating so that it's
protected<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.469> also<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.039> lube<00:00:47.250> because

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
protected and also so it's lube because

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.920 
protected and also so it's lube because
this<00:00:47.700> stuff<00:00:47.940> kind<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.210> touches<00:00:48.570> some<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
this stuff kind of touches some of the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.560 
this stuff kind of touches some of the
stuff<00:00:49.170> underneath<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:50.000> well<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.300> touch

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
stuff underneath that well it can touch

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.100 
stuff underneath that well it can touch
some<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:53.930> control<00:00:54.930> arm

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
some of the like as this control arm

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.549 
some of the like as this control arm
runs<00:00:55.440> over<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.770> top<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.699> throttle<00:00:57.030> plate

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
runs over the top of this throttle plate

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.540 
runs over the top of this throttle plate
they<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.710> touch<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:59.190> bit<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.520> don't

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
they can touch a little bit you don't

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.580 
they can touch a little bit you don't
want<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.000> find<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.840> I'm<00:01:00.899> sure<00:01:00.930> he's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
want to find it so I'm sure he's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.350 
want to find it so I'm sure he's
thoroughly<00:01:01.859> moved<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:09.330> I

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
thoroughly moved so you can see that I

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.210 
thoroughly moved so you can see that I
chose<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.990> use<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.590> whole<00:01:10.860> lot<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
chose to use this whole lot of the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.460 
chose to use this whole lot of the
throttle<00:01:11.580> linkage<00:01:11.670> -<00:01:12.330> I've<00:01:12.540> now<00:01:12.720> tried<00:01:15.470> tried

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
throttle linkage - I've now tried tried

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.260 
throttle linkage - I've now tried tried
this<00:01:17.009> hole<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.229> this<00:01:19.229> hole<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:20.090> this<00:01:21.090> one

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
this hole and this hole now this one

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.969 
this hole and this hole now this one
worked<00:01:21.479> pretty<00:01:21.630> good<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.650> able<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
worked pretty good but I was not able to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.130 
worked pretty good but I was not able to
push<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.400> open<00:01:23.520> enough<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.240> my<00:01:24.360> top<00:01:24.600> rpms

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
push it open enough and so my top rpms

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.960 
push it open enough and so my top rpms
just<00:01:25.470> seemed<00:01:25.680> low<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.460> didn't<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
just seemed low I didn't have a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
just seemed low I didn't have a
tachometer<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.680> seemed<00:01:28.860> local

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
tachometer but they just seemed local

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.039 
tachometer but they just seemed local
for<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.790> type<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> engine<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
for this type of engine it just it

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.690 
for this type of engine it just it
sounded<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.650> was<00:01:31.740> running<00:01:32.040> too<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.579> know

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
sounded like it was running too you know

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.240 
sounded like it was running too you know
hard<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> explain<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:35.130> not

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
hard to explain but it just was not

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.190 
hard to explain but it just was not
running<00:01:35.549> very<00:01:35.579> hard<00:01:35.909> running<00:01:36.630> smooth<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
running very hard running smooth and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.080 
running very hard running smooth and
nice<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.040> couldn't<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.430> rpms<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:38.970> of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
nice but just I couldn't get rpms out of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.940 
nice but just I couldn't get rpms out of
it<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:40.020> pushes<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.530> open<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.829> little

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it this one pushes it open a little

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.340 
it this one pushes it open a little
further<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.750> don't<00:01:42.810> think<00:01:43.110> I've<00:01:43.200> tried

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
further and I don't think I've tried

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.480 
further and I don't think I've tried
this<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.829> yet<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.220> looks<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:46.280> well<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
this one yet and it looks like well a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.889 
this one yet and it looks like well a
pro<00:01:47.850> maybe<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.299> tell<00:01:48.420> us<00:01:48.509> which<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:48.780> it

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
pro maybe you can tell us which one it

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.870 
pro maybe you can tell us which one it
was<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.200> meant<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.470> use<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.520> that's<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
was really meant to use but that's the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609 
was really meant to use but that's the
one<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.420> I've<00:01:51.810> tested<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.439> little

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
one it's in now I've tested it a little

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.469 
one it's in now I've tested it a little
bit<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:52.950> my<00:01:53.070> fingers<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.729> seems<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> open

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
bit with my fingers and it seems to open

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.859 
bit with my fingers and it seems to open
and<00:01:54.630> close<00:01:54.810> pretty<00:01:55.200> well<00:01:55.430> so<00:01:56.430> my<00:01:56.640> next<00:01:56.909> job<00:01:57.149> is

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
and close pretty well so my next job is

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.300 
and close pretty well so my next job is
to<00:01:58.229> put<00:01:59.299> the<00:02:00.299> throttle<00:02:00.570> plate<00:02:00.899> back<00:02:01.259> on

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
to put the throttle plate back on

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.510 
to put the throttle plate back on
you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:04.549> am<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:07.369> oil<00:02:08.369> up

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
you can see that I am going to oil up

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.010 
you can see that I am going to oil up
underneath<00:02:08.880> there<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> little<00:02:09.450> bit<00:02:09.599> because<00:02:09.869> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
underneath there a little bit because I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.449 
underneath there a little bit because I
haven't<00:02:10.259> done<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.410> yet<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:11.160> I'm<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
haven't done that yet so I'm going to

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.239 
haven't done that yet so I'm going to
turn<00:02:11.580> off<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> video<00:02:11.970> now
