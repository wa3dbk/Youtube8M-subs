00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.869
 they call me lippi hernández andrés I think 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.939
 that the moment where it started to be marked 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.369
 a bit like the profile of what I am 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.260
 Now is when I started working more 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.790
 like all the postmodern dance when 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.259
 started to interest me in techniques that did not 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.789
 they were related to the techniques 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.270
 that at that time they were working 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.330
 more like classical graham cunningham and such 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.100
 and I threw myself more towards the alexander technique 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.580
 chosen the shiatsu and from there 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.340
 there was like a break with the dance a 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.589
 little stipulated and from there began 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.170
 to sprout all the movement work and 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:50.589
 such and has gone like passing times of 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.409
 feel very choreographer to feel very 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.850
 pedagogue to feel very researcher and 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.550
 Now I'm in a place where I think 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.590
 in reality everything is the same 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.540
 I have gone through many facets about everything 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.960
 facets that are related to the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.600
 management 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.090
 with creating in a place with founding a 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.610
 place with believing in certain structures 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.909
 with believing in certain ways that 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.619
 they needed to cover certain spaces or 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.159
 certain ideologies that were still around 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.619
 work so I'm a co-founder of the 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.710
 boiler with all my partners my friends 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.320
 and my travel companions a year ago 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.649
 that I'm not in the boiler 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.960
 as a partner or anything but for me it has been 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.020
 also a great school understand the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.090
 diversity of options not of the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.340
 dance but of life understand the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.790
 diversity of life found and create a 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.860
 place 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.840
 and work simply with ideology 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 to believe that there were certain places and 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.990
 certain structures that were by 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.590
 do and that we put something to 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.590
 what happened 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.950
 and I decided to enter the classroom without being 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.130
 accompanied by nobody or by a 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.979
 dramatist nor by a friend nor lights nor 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.560
 nothing and with the idea of ​​trying to clarify 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.060
 me aesthetically and at creation level 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.060
 what was I doing 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.790
 I understood what it is that interests me 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.349
 because I'm interested in how to transmit it to 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.140
 who would transmit what would be the 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.390
 profile what are the works and 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.980
 profiles of my work and there has come 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.810
 a new job that would be a little more 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.549
 everything that I am developing after 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.840
 of the research work that is a bit 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.840
 as a tutor 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.280
 is that sometimes when we enter a 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.290
 long professional life and we started to 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.620
 do many jobs sometimes we have 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.610
 forgotten why we came to this job 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.350
 there is only one issue I am interested in 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.980
 beauty 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.800
 the harmony that is to understand the beauty 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.540
 like balance does not what beauty 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.970
 means to you it's just the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.260
 contemplation beautiful encounter how 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.300
 someone may like a heart 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.800
 beating blood on the floor like 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.920
 it can be a sunrise or we do not speak 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.660
 of aesthetic patterns but of reaching 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.660
 what illuminates your soul for you
