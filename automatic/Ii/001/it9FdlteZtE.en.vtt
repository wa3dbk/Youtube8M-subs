00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
hi in this particular question we are

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.550 
hi in this particular question we are
given<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.660> length<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> diagonals

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
given that the length of the diagonals

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.529 
given that the length of the diagonals
DF<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.460> G<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.880> C<00:00:18.119> e<00:00:18.230> form<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.490> triangle<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:21.300> first

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
DF a G and C e form a triangle so first

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.359 
DF a G and C e form a triangle so first
of<00:00:21.720> all<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.050> need<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.320> understand<00:00:22.769> how<00:00:23.340> much

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
of all we need to understand how much

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.170 
of all we need to understand how much
will<00:00:23.730> be<00:00:23.880> DF<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.539> G<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.080> C<00:00:25.470> E<00:00:25.500> all<00:00:26.340> these<00:00:26.880> are

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
will be DF a G and C E all these are

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.200 
will be DF a G and C E all these are
body<00:00:27.750> diagonals<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.500> cube<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.910> side<00:00:30.179> of

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
body diagonals of the cube if a side of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.470 
body diagonals of the cube if a side of
the<00:00:30.480> cube<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.250> then<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.579> body<00:00:32.820> diagonals<00:00:33.180> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the cube is a then the body diagonals of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.069 
the cube is a then the body diagonals of
a<00:00:33.630> cube<00:00:33.870> are<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.469> be<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.739> root<00:00:35.430> 3<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.690> let's

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
a cube are going to be a root 3 so let's

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.360 
a cube are going to be a root 3 so let's
say<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.510> equilateral<00:00:39.510> triangle

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
say this is the equilateral triangle

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.700 
say this is the equilateral triangle
which<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.520> form<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.660> will<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.140> sides<00:00:43.379> of

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
which I form that will have the sides of

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.889 
which I form that will have the sides of
a<00:00:44.809> root<00:00:45.809> 3<00:00:46.430> now<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.670> am<00:00:47.760> putting<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.480> circle<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:49.379> it

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
a root 3 now I am putting a circle on it

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.930 
a root 3 now I am putting a circle on it
please<00:00:51.899> excuse<00:00:52.350> my<00:00:52.530> bad<00:00:52.770> drawing<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.789> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
please excuse my bad drawing but this is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.020 
please excuse my bad drawing but this is
the<00:00:54.120> idea<00:00:54.649> now<00:00:55.649> what<00:00:55.920> will<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> radius<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the idea now what will be the radius of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.510 
the idea now what will be the radius of
this<00:00:57.149> circle<00:00:57.649> let's<00:00:58.649> say<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> radius<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.399> this

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
this circle let's say the radius of this

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.390 
this circle let's say the radius of this
circle<00:00:59.730> is<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:01.520> then<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:03.449> angle<00:01:03.660> will<00:01:04.409> be<00:01:04.439> 120

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
circle is I then this angle will be 120

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.750 
circle is I then this angle will be 120
degree<00:01:06.320> because<00:01:07.320> 360<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.010> being<00:01:08.220> divided<00:01:08.490> in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
degree because 360 is being divided in

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.600 
degree because 360 is being divided in
three<00:01:09.060> equal<00:01:09.390> parts<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.860> 120<00:01:11.250> this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
three equal parts here this is 120 this

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.289 
three equal parts here this is 120 this
is<00:01:11.760> also<00:01:12.090> 120<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.710> look<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.880> smaller

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
is also 120 so if look at the smaller

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.920 
is also 120 so if look at the smaller
triangle<00:01:15.689> let<00:01:16.170> me<00:01:16.320> call<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.770> something<00:01:17.070> P<00:01:17.930> Q

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
triangle let me call this something P Q

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.230 
triangle let me call this something P Q
R<00:01:20.030> if<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.150> consider<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.080> central<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.979> o

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
R if you consider and this central is o

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.450 
R if you consider and this central is o
if<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.420> consider<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.990> triangle<00:01:25.200> OPR<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.250> has

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
if you consider the triangle OPR it has

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.940 
if you consider the triangle OPR it has
two<00:01:26.700> sides<00:01:27.000> as<00:01:27.270> R<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> angles<00:01:28.680> has

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
two sides as R and one of the angles has

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.300 
two sides as R and one of the angles has
120<00:01:29.549> degree<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.689> what<00:01:31.560> will<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> third

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
120 degree then what will be the third

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.670 
120 degree then what will be the third
side<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.270> third<00:01:33.540> side<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.140> case<00:01:34.409> comes

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
side the third side in this case comes

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.190 
side the third side in this case comes
out<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:35.070> our<00:01:35.310> root<00:01:36.000> three<00:01:36.270> when<00:01:36.630> two<00:01:36.780> sides<00:01:36.960> are

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
out as our root three when two sides are

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.700 
out as our root three when two sides are
R<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.770> central<00:01:38.310> angle<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.670> 120<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.710> our

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
R and the central angle is 120 and our

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.889 
R and the central angle is 120 and our
root<00:01:40.920> three<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.369> know<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.700> equal<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.360> root<00:01:42.630> 3

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
root three we know is equal to a root 3

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.889 
root three we know is equal to a root 3
which<00:01:43.680> essentially<00:01:44.220> means<00:01:44.369> R<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:45.000> equal<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> a
