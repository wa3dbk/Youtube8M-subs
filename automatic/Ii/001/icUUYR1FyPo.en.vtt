00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.500
 gt5 video online and in this case os 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.330
 I bring an informative video that 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.770
 surely you are interested and good guys 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.469
 Well, in this video, I basically come to 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.969
 talk about a new possible tlc that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.099
 they are going to put in gt5 now not good in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.120
 this case would be version 1.17 already 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.279
 you know that today we are in the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.550
 update 1.16 so next 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.630
 dlc is supposed to be version 1.17 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.330
 forecasted is the case it seems that in 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.710
 about two hours has been discovered good 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.090
 is a hacker has discovered different 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.650
 new files that have been included in gt5 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.990
 online that rockstar forgiveness has included 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.279
 in gt5 online then well then these 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.930
 hidden files I guess you'll have 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.860
 an image in the description and such and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.930
 well then in these hidden files 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.430
 as I say that they have included it in gt5 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.129
 online a few hours ago is worth it right now 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.690
 We are September 23 because it is 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.010
 image is included on September 22 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.809
 it makes itself one is recording 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.149
 this pretty late and such then good 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.920
 because the case has contracted like new 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.180
 hidden files that have achieved a 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.890
 hacker it arcade entered the archives 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.360
 hidden from the game then well then 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.219
 that these hidden files appear that 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.930
 including rockstar in gt5 online 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.699
 does nothing a few hours ago or so 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.940
 good in state hidden file we can 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.100
 find a possible date that would be the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.420
 date on which the next one will come 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.570
 dlc not good 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.110
 that is, the date is the date on which 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.840
 has included what is all the material 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.490
 17 would now miss the date of when 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.290
 they are going to publish what I mean with everything 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.640
 this well since you already know that rockstar 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.560
 when he sees me when he goes to put a dlc 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.119
 For example, imagine that rockstar 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.399
 wants to put a dlc next Tuesday 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.380
 because they do not catch and just the 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.149
 next Tuesday they put the tlc and point and 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.530
 they put it in the game files no no 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.470
 what they do is that a few days 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.720
 before how to say it they take the material what 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.130
 put in gta 5 online they try it for 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.020
 retro eat them what this one I do not know how 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.580
 say it and then when they pass 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.500
 days that that material is already inside 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.750
 of the game then they already publish that 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.399
 material for everyone not then 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.720
 well, it seems to me that it has been found 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.799
 in these files a kind of 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.690
 upload from files because one way 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.610
 as I say in the plan that they have put 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.080
 a new material of freedom 5 read by 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.250
 say it somehow then good 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.869
 well in this image to leave in the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.899
 description I guess we can see that 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.610
 a date appears in which it tells us 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.440
 2014 afterwards it looks like a 0-9 bar 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.330
 of was another bar and it appears 22 that 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.579
 they are still supposed to be the date 22 of 9 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.840
 of 2014 that is as I say today we are at 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.120
 23 of 9 2014 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.640
 just yesterday and that date would be in the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.099
 which rock will be involved in that 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.870
 new material of the new dt in gt5 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.760
 online then well then as I say 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.900
 we could say that the material is already 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.640
 of the new uses put into the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.530
 game and now the only thing that would be missing 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.690
 would be to see when they are going to publish 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.160
 when they can publish it, I do not 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.780
 I want to say nothing but tomorrow is Tuesday 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.519
 tomorrow is good today when I say 'no 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.890
 I tell you that on September 23 because 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.209
 it's tuesday then good really today 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.620
 it's Tuesday so you know what 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.780
 times printed on Tuesday but I 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.610
 I honestly think it would be very 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.530
 anticipated just today 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.060
 so I would put my hand on the fire 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.010
 that would be already for next week 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.360
 so good basically it's something that 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.220
 want to comment on this file 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.900
 hidden that your put in gt5 online 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.160
 and as I say it has put us in a 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.510
 hour and basically what it tells us in 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.310
 these hidden files is that it has 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.510
 put a new material in gt5 online and 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.980
 nothing, basically, we have to 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.810
 be waiting to see when they publish 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.010
 all this new material there is an attic 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.060
 well basically everything as I say already 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.440
 You know how to leave the team but if you have 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.760

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.760
