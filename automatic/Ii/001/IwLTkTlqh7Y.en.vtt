00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.100
 Oh 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.940
 hi how about friends from the android area 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.330
 in this first video of this new 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.379
 section we are going to learn something new 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.119
 let's learn how to share 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.039
 our internet our computer with 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.660
 our android cell phone for that 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.180
 we need a program and the program 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.560
 call the best spot I'll leave it in the 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.260
 description of the video so that you 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.410
 download it once we have the 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.689
 program let's do the following 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.510
 first let's disable the wifi from 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.390
 our android cell phone 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.820
 and then we started to open the program 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.860
 we will execute it as administrator 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.989
 we look at no because we do not want 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.280
 update the program if you 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.160
 they want to update the update 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.160
 we put a network number a password 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:01.620
 let's change the area connection 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.620
 here we are going to give in start 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:12.020
 ok we give you here to accept 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.850
 and we wait for a guy to come out 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.850
 notification 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.909
 once the warning is no longer 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.100
 notification we minimize 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.110
 and now if we see our cell phone 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.170
 android 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.509
 I would come the first part with the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.680
 program our computer we proceed 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.560
 Android connection 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.890
 activate what it means here we go the 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.890
 Wifi 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.980
 and this is going to come out to us as a list of 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.120
 networks we have to see which one is 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:55.010
 we have created and lost password and 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.109
 we put the password we have once 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.929
 be already 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:03.020
 introduced the password we give in fact 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.539
 we see without connecting 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.069
 and now, as you can see, it's going to come out 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:13.330
 there in the network obtaining direction and 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.330
 it's automatically left over
