00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
to you no one can build in here unless

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.109 
to you no one can build in here unless
you're<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.020> co-host<00:01:43.740> or<00:01:44.100> greater<00:01:44.400> so<00:01:45.000> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
you're like a co-host or greater so you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.789 
you're like a co-host or greater so you
actually<00:01:45.299> have<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.810> leave<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.229> bond<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
actually have to leave this bond and

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.060 
actually have to leave this bond and
we'll<00:01:46.979> tell<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.250> when<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.670> leave<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.090> fun

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
we'll tell you when you leave this fun

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.190 
we'll tell you when you leave this fun
so<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.240> actually<00:01:51.450> build<00:01:51.810> I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so right here you can actually build I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.870 
so right here you can actually build I
think<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.890> actually<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.310> break<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
think you can actually they break that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.830 
think you can actually they break that
and<00:01:54.030> take<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.830> I'm<00:01:55.830> going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> fix<00:01:56.220> that

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
and take that but I'm going to fix that

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.370 
and take that but I'm going to fix that
so<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.619> basically<00:01:59.039> our<00:01:59.670> legit<00:02:00.240> world<00:02:00.539> we
