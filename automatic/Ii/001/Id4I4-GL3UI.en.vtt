thanks to the huge rubber on this car
but<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:38.000> also<00:02:38.209> means<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.020> brakes<00:02:39.380> are<00:02:39.650> super

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
but it also means the brakes are super

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.440 
but it also means the brakes are super
super<00:02:40.190> strong<00:02:40.580> too<00:02:40.850> there's<00:02:41.060> an<00:02:41.120> up<00:02:41.240> grip

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
super strong too there's an up grip

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.300 
super strong too there's an up grip
there<00:02:41.660> we've<00:02:41.930> got<00:02:41.959> big<00:02:42.440> enough<00:02:42.620> discs<00:02:43.100> that

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
there we've got big enough discs that

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.120 
there we've got big enough discs that
these<00:02:43.520> things<00:02:43.730> will<00:02:44.090> stop<00:02:44.480> very<00:02:45.200> very<00:02:45.800> hard

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
these things will stop very very hard

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
these things will stop very very hard
