if it catches like one person it's a
nice<00:00:25.769> way<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:25.980> start<00:00:26.130> off<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.269> game<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.720> this

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
nice way to start off the game but this

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.500 
nice way to start off the game but this
time<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.380> get<00:00:28.650> nobody<00:00:29.310> looks<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.000> guard<00:00:30.269> dudes

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510

already<00:00:30.750> rushed<00:00:30.960> rushing<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.470> their<00:00:31.619> spawn<00:00:32.239> so

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
already rushed rushing in their spawn so

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.220 
already rushed rushing in their spawn so
I<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.390> like<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.570> know<00:00:33.660> what<00:00:33.780> fine<00:00:33.960> I'm<00:00:34.140> gonna

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
I was like you know what fine I'm gonna

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.319 
I was like you know what fine I'm gonna
rush<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.559> their<00:00:34.680> spot<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.160> don't<00:00:35.610> know<00:00:35.670> why<00:00:36.300> I

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
rush in their spot I don't know why I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.069 
rush in their spot I don't know why I
did<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.969> it<00:00:38.969> looks<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.480> spawns

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
did this and it looks like the spawns

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.889 
did this and it looks like the spawns
kind<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.379> already<00:00:40.530> moved<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.610> little<00:00:41.670> bit<00:00:41.899> okay

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
kind of already moved a little bit okay

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.030 
kind of already moved a little bit okay
so<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.079> only<00:00:43.290> got<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.500> kill<00:00:43.829> from<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
so I only got one kill from the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.500 
so I only got one kill from the
beginning<00:00:44.370> how<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.000> see<00:00:45.120> all<00:00:45.239> those<00:00:45.329> guys

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
beginning how do you see all those guys

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.010 
beginning how do you see all those guys
at<00:00:45.719> spawn<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.079> behind<00:00:46.530> C<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> I'm<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:48.870> well

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
at spawn right behind C so I'm like well

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.750 
at spawn right behind C so I'm like well
I<00:00:49.079> might<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.410> well<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.770> use<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> gel<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.460> again

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
I might as well just use a gel and again

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.100 
I might as well just use a gel and again
down<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> C<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> really<00:00:51.660> bad<00:00:51.840> spot

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
down to C but this is a really bad spot

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.959 
down to C but this is a really bad spot
to<00:00:52.140> stand<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.770> get<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.370> front<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.699> window

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
to stand I get in front of the window

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.220 
to stand I get in front of the window
there's<00:00:54.270> always<00:00:54.420> people<00:00:54.600> looking<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.960> snipe

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
there's always people looking to snipe

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.369 
there's always people looking to snipe
you<00:00:55.399> from<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> windows<00:00:56.820> side<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:58.350> I

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
you from the windows side but but I

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
you from the windows side but but I
think<00:00:58.649> things<00:00:58.859> escalate<00:00:59.370> pretty<00:00:59.640> quickly

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
think things escalate pretty quickly

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
think things escalate pretty quickly
this<00:01:00.750> game<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.590> there's<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
this game as you can see there's a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.470 
this game as you can see there's a
triple<00:01:02.340> right<00:01:02.489> there<00:01:02.640> from<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> jail<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.359> so

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
triple right there from the jail and so

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.899 
triple right there from the jail and so
it<00:01:03.899> ended<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.110> paying<00:01:04.320> off<00:01:04.519> it's<00:01:05.519> kind<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.790> like

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
it ended up paying off it's kind of like

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.359 
it ended up paying off it's kind of like
a<00:01:05.939> revenge<00:01:06.210> killing<00:01:06.710> some<00:01:07.710> sense<00:01:07.920> because<00:01:08.159> I

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
a revenge killing some sense because I

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.800

just<00:03:04.550> insane<00:03:05.470> sometimes<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.830> never<00:03:06.980> know

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
just insane sometimes you never know

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.200 
just insane sometimes you never know
what's<00:03:07.610> gonna<00:03:07.700> happen<00:03:07.790> if<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.090> have<00:03:08.180> a

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
what's gonna happen if you have a

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.380 
what's gonna happen if you have a
well-placed<00:03:08.750> Harrier<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:10.940> just<00:03:11.120> really

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
well-placed Harrier and it's just really

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.000 
well-placed Harrier and it's just really
like<00:03:11.600> spawn<00:03:11.960> trapping<00:03:12.260> him<00:03:12.470> then<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.740> really

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
like spawn trapping him then it really

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.670 
like spawn trapping him then it really
works<00:03:13.220> well<00:03:13.430> but<00:03:13.690> they<00:03:14.690> shot<00:03:14.900> down<00:03:15.050> my<00:03:15.170> ac-130

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680
