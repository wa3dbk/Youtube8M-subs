occasion we're going to keep it simple
now<00:00:11.199> remember<00:00:11.709> when<00:00:11.889> juicing<00:00:12.369> you<00:00:12.910> can<00:00:13.119> use

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
didn't even clog up the system which can

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.630 
didn't even clog up the system which can
