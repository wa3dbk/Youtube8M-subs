00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.870
 when we talk about ultrasound all the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.190
 world immediately thinks a follow-up of 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.690
 pregnancy but today this 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.179
 technology is used so 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.190
 current in cardiology also is expected 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.200
 do 14 may the cardiac raffy cog to 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.670
 laval hospital this year and after this 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.520
 review your heart does not have a lot of 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.680
 secrets for the nature cardiologist or 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.050
 is only 32 years old he suffers from 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.550
 heart palpitations this strange of 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.029
 sensations that we have lately in the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.769
 chest 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:36.840
 when you feel your heart beat 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:38.070
 abnormally palpitations the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.350
 first time you had an ultrasound 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.270
 palpitations can be caused 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.590
 by hundreds of factors and are only 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.020
 not necessarily dangerous 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.420
 imaging allows cardiologists to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.500
 to make a diagnosis without injection and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.629
 without harmful rays 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.430
 the museum of cairo 1 which cattle that these 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.989
 pc with each beat so if they 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.120
 had made a heart attack this area 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.829
 the other side would not move as well 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.840
 even the silent infarctions that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.149
 account for 15% of heart attacks 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.750
 no longer escapes the eye exercised by 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.549
 cardiologists 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.270
 we see them especially infarcts 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.280
 home of silent 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.170
 diabetic patients among others in 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.509
 generally believes that an infarction causes 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.250
 an excruciating pain in the chest pain 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.710
 that radiates into braille in the 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.549
 blow gold there are infarcts that are not 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.319
 not classic 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.719
 a lot of people who are going to spend their 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.869
 infertile at home thinking it's 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.319
 indigestion digests badly for others 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.600
 reasons 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.429
 an infarction little passed unnoticed at the 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.860
 woman whose symptoms are different 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.630
 of those men who often go 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.759
 put on the back of the fatigue of the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.130
 spread in the same way the ultrasound 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.530
 measure the degree of severity 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.759
 of an infarct the arteries that 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.310
 feed the heart it was a little 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.229
 it's like a tree trunk large 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.390
 and small branches but there is the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.770
 the biggest everything depends on one who 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.899
 is the artery is reached the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.729
 ultrasound specialists also sees 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.890
 any sign of inflammation inflection 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.439
 heart envelope the exam allows 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.259
 also to see if the 80 heart 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.369
 fuissÃ© small flap that regulates the 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.950
 blood circulation 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.869
 we see the greens claim before the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.879
 cap of still send high school that aubry 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.470
 which closes with every beat the imagery 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.200
 can finally understand why 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.569
 the condition of a patient is deteriorating 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.940
 the doctor sÃ©bastien bergeron what we 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.290
 the discovery of mass within the 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.859
 heart chambers what's called the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.329
 real left 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.340
 the cardiac ultrasound laboratory 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.290
 of laval hospital is the most important 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.870
 in quebec and one of the biggest in 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.870
 canada 13 may review this kind have 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.630
 been carried out in 2005-2006 in accordance with 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.549
 do a thousand more in 2006 2007 be 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.680
 nearly 40 a day in this alone 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.670
 laboratory 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.139
 this wide the rest of your record 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.849
 tomorrow at parades of problems of 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.470
 heart rate yes we take you 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.260
 tomorrow in one of the largest centers 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.720
 telemetry in canada where two 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.109
 nurses monitor 24 hours a day 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.750
 the electrocardiogram of 64 patients and 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.810
 we give you an overview right away 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.810
 m 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.310
 the 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.050
 the blade is gone so I realize 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.420
 that his lighter not normal at this moment 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.150
 there what we do we call the 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.370
 department we do not know but this 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.130
 magnitude works on electricity then 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.120
 the patient here is a disorder 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.310
 of electricity that is to say that 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.780
 electricity to stop it suddenly who 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.780
 made him 25 years old
