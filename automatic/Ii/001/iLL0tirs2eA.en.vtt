00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the liberation mission won't appear if

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.160 
the liberation mission won't appear if
you<00:01:35.820> travel<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.390> fast<00:01:36.630> travel<00:01:36.869> which<00:01:37.140> is

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you travel to the fast travel which is

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.380 
you travel to the fast travel which is
kind<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.470> annoying<00:01:37.670> but<00:01:38.670> anyway<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.150> time

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
kind of annoying but anyway it's time

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.359 
kind of annoying but anyway it's time
for<00:01:39.630> another<00:01:39.750> conscription<00:01:40.710> thing<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.189> think

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
for another conscription thing I think

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.310 
for another conscription thing I think
that's<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> third<00:01:41.820> one<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.150> two<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:43.110> free

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
that's the third one one two to free

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.510 
that's the third one one two to free
those<00:01:43.439> guys<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.890> there<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.189> three<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.490> of

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
those guys in there we go three out of

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.490 
those guys in there we go three out of
three<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.600> then<00:01:45.689> I'm<00:01:45.810> heading<00:01:46.049> back<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
three and then I'm heading back to the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.889 
three and then I'm heading back to the
fast<00:01:46.740> travel<00:01:46.979> point<00:01:47.280> there<00:01:47.759> where<00:01:48.570> we'll<00:01:48.750> find

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
fast travel point there where we'll find

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.780 
fast travel point there where we'll find
another<00:01:49.049> captain<00:01:49.649> general<00:01:50.070> dude<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.579> gotta

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.999 
another captain general dude you gotta
shoot<00:01:51.000> off<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> horse<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.799> see

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
shoot off the horse so and you can see

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.530 
shoot off the horse so and you can see
here<00:01:53.250> if<00:01:53.340> people<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.909> doing<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.360> they

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
here if people see you doing it they

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.740 
here if people see you doing it they
will<00:01:54.750> get<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.500> riled<00:01:56.360> but<00:01:57.360> they're

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
will get kind of riled but they're

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.260 
will get kind of riled but they're
mostly<00:01:58.680> around<00:01:59.009> Boston<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.700> seems<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.149> be

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
mostly around Boston it seems to be

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.030 
mostly around Boston it seems to be
low-level<00:02:00.750> grunts<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.860> kill

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
low-level grunts so you can just kill

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.340 
low-level grunts so you can just kill
Street<00:02:02.310> more<00:02:02.570> anyway<00:02:03.570> from<00:02:03.719> there<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.110> am

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
Street more anyway from there I am

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.440 
Street more anyway from there I am
picking<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.040> south<00:02:05.729> all<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.240> doesn't

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
picking this one south all that doesn't

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.880 
picking this one south all that doesn't
really<00:02:06.570> matter<00:02:06.780> both<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.200> them<00:02:07.320> are<00:02:07.469> valid<00:02:07.560> for

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
really matter both of them are valid for

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.320 
really matter both of them are valid for
the<00:02:08.759> last<00:02:09.060> military

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
the last military

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.520 
the last military
so<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.480> shoot<00:02:12.630> him<00:02:12.780> off<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.020> horse<00:02:13.140> again

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so just shoot him off the horse again

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.080 
so just shoot him off the horse again
and<00:02:13.740> that's<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.130> lot<00:02:14.340> then<00:02:14.550> it's<00:02:14.700> time<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.910> visit

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and that's a lot then it's time to visit

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.610 
and that's a lot then it's time to visit
the<00:02:15.240> district<00:02:15.630> contact<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.290> you'll<00:02:16.470> notice

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
the district contact and you'll notice

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.710

the<00:02:16.830> icons<00:02:17.220> changed<00:02:17.640> indicating<00:02:18.240> that<00:02:18.270> it's

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the icons changed indicating that it's

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.980 
the icons changed indicating that it's
time<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.410> do<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.710> liberation<00:02:20.190> mission<00:02:20.990> and

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.220 
time to do the liberation mission and
this<00:02:22.350> one<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.740> think<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.160> marksman<00:02:23.670> one<00:02:24.170> um

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.740 
this one I think is the marksman one um
so<00:02:25.620> head<00:02:26.130> your<00:02:26.430> way<00:02:26.490> down<00:02:27.210> there<00:02:27.480> I'm<00:02:27.600> going<00:02:27.690> to

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.000 
anyway the assassins will go to town but
before<00:03:07.290> they<00:03:07.380> get<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.560> chance<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.800> kill

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
before they get a chance to kill

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.080 
before they get a chance to kill
everyone<00:03:08.220> you'll<00:03:08.430> get<00:03:08.550> a<00:03:08.580> little<00:03:08.730> cutscene

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
everyone you'll get a little cutscene

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.750 
everyone you'll get a little cutscene
there<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:10.110> there<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.440> go<00:03:10.590> that's<00:03:11.250> your<00:03:11.340> third

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
there and there you go that's your third

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.880 
there and there you go that's your third
assassin<00:03:12.420> recruit<00:03:12.750> or<00:03:12.900> perhaps<00:03:13.410> your<00:03:13.560> second

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
assassin recruit or perhaps your second

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.280 
assassin recruit or perhaps your second
moment<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:15.390> get<00:03:15.510> your<00:03:15.600> first<00:03:15.870> one<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.200> just

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
moment to get your first one you just

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.660 
moment to get your first one you just
play<00:03:16.530> through<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.830> story<00:03:16.890> mission<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.489> if<00:03:17.580> you

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
play through the story mission so if you

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.460 
play through the story mission so if you
haven't<00:03:17.910> found<00:03:18.090> them<00:03:18.239> yet<00:03:18.269> that's<00:03:18.660> why<00:03:19.200> I

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
haven't found them yet that's why I

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.710 
haven't found them yet that's why I
think<00:03:19.860> it's<00:03:20.160> sequence<00:03:20.549> five<00:03:20.820> maybe<00:03:21.360> sequence

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
think it's sequence five maybe sequence

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.100 
think it's sequence five maybe sequence
six<00:03:22.250> anyway<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.430> hope<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:24.120> was<00:03:24.239> useful<00:03:24.269> let<00:03:25.019> me

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
six anyway I hope that was useful let me

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.390 
six anyway I hope that was useful let me
