00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
camp straps that come with it but I

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.940 
camp straps that come with it but I
could<00:02:53.300> put<00:02:53.480> an<00:02:53.570> additional<00:02:54.110> cam<00:02:54.380> strap<00:02:54.770> around

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.910 
could put an additional cam strap around
this<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.700> create<00:02:56.000> even<00:02:56.210> more<00:02:56.270> gear<00:02:57.020> storage<00:02:57.470> as

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
this to create even more gear storage as

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.560 
this to create even more gear storage as
you<00:02:58.070> take<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.340> look<00:02:58.610> at<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.850> very<00:02:59.090> front<00:02:59.330> of

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
you take a look at the very front of

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.240 
you take a look at the very front of
this<00:02:59.690> very<00:03:00.290> buoyant<00:03:00.710> thick<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.070> has<00:03:01.100> a

this very buoyant thick it has a
piercing<00:03:01.790> bow<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.450> will<00:03:02.600> cut<00:03:02.990> through<00:03:03.260> the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
piercing bow so it will cut through the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.890 
piercing bow so it will cut through the
water<00:03:03.650> but<00:03:04.340> also<00:03:04.520> it's<00:03:04.940> thick<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.450> stable

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
water but also it's thick and stable

little<00:03:14.150> bit<00:03:14.270> more<00:03:14.480> pronounced<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:15.530> that

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
little bit more pronounced so that

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.610 
little bit more pronounced so that
paddlers<00:03:16.370> are<00:03:16.610> more<00:03:17.270> stable<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:17.990> lowers<00:03:18.440> their

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
paddlers are more stable it lowers their

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.530 
paddlers are more stable it lowers their
center<00:03:18.980> gravity<00:03:19.190> center<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:19.820> gravity<00:03:20.210> the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
center gravity center of gravity the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.420 
center gravity center of gravity the
other<00:03:20.690> thing<00:03:20.960> it<00:03:21.080> does<00:03:21.260> is<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.680> allows<00:03:22.070> you<00:03:22.310> to

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
other thing it does is it allows you to

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.000 
other thing it does is it allows you to
load<00:03:22.670> gear<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.240> strap<00:03:23.630> it<00:03:23.810> down<00:03:23.840> with<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.770> cam

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
load gear and strap it down with the cam

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.160 
load gear and strap it down with the cam
strap<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.490> put<00:03:25.640> it<00:03:25.730> on<00:03:25.850> then<00:03:26.300> I<00:03:26.360> can<00:03:26.390> torque<00:03:26.930> this

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
strap I put it on then I can torque this

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.530 
strap I put it on then I can torque this
down<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.800> really<00:03:28.190> pull<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.580> tight<00:03:28.850> we<00:03:29.360> don't

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
down and really pull it tight we don't

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.360 
down and really pull it tight we don't
have<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:29.900> these<00:03:30.110> little<00:03:30.320> plastic<00:03:30.710> fittings

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
have just these little plastic fittings

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
board now as we move further back again

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.420 
board now as we move further back again
we<00:03:38.390> move<00:03:38.570> into<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:39.020> recess<00:03:39.650> deck<00:03:39.980> which

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
we move into the recess deck which

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.640 
we move into the recess deck which
offers<00:03:40.880> stability<00:03:41.090> also<00:03:41.810> allows<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:42.380> water

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
offers stability also allows that water

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.590 
offers stability also allows that water
to<00:03:42.890> run<00:03:43.040> out<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.520> we<00:03:43.580> put<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:43.880> full<00:03:44.180> traction

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
to run out and we put a full traction

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.870 
to run out and we put a full traction
pad<00:03:45.110> throughout<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.800> entire<00:03:46.100> board<00:03:46.430> this<00:03:46.820> is

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
pad throughout the entire board this is

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.910 
pad throughout the entire board this is
very<00:03:47.180> soft<00:03:47.540> on<00:03:47.810> your<00:03:47.990> feet<00:03:48.200> comfortable<00:03:48.770> so

very soft on your feet comfortable so

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.890 
very soft on your feet comfortable so
that<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.160> can<00:03:49.280> stand<00:03:49.520> out<00:03:49.760> there<00:03:50.000> all<00:03:50.180> day<00:03:50.420> if

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
that you can stand out there all day if

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.199 
that you can stand out there all day if
you<00:03:51.050> take<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.320> knee<00:03:51.620> if<00:03:51.860> you<00:03:51.890> sit<00:03:52.340> on<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.550> if<00:03:53.030> you

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
you take a knee if you sit on it if you

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.910 
you take a knee if you sit on it if you
fall<00:03:53.510> on<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:53.959> it's<00:03:54.110> like<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.260> nice<00:03:54.770> little

fall on it it's like a nice little

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.430 
fall on it it's like a nice little
safety<00:03:55.310> mat<00:03:55.640> to<00:03:55.880> land<00:03:56.120> on<00:03:56.360> another<00:03:57.080> thing<00:03:57.320> that

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
safety mat to land on another thing that

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.990 
safety mat to land on another thing that
you'll<00:03:57.560> notice<00:03:57.740> on<00:03:58.070> this<00:03:58.220> board<00:03:58.550> as<00:03:58.700> we<00:03:58.820> move

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
you'll notice on this board as we move

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.540 
you'll notice on this board as we move
further<00:03:59.240> back<00:03:59.360> on<00:03:59.810> these<00:04:00.380> rolled<00:04:00.740> edges<00:04:01.010> has

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
further back on these rolled edges has

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.010 
further back on these rolled edges has
that<00:04:01.760> not<00:04:01.970> only<00:04:02.120> does<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:02.480> offer<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.870> little

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
that not only does it offer it a little

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.080 
that not only does it offer it a little
bit<00:04:03.170> more<00:04:03.350> stability<00:04:03.560> but<00:04:04.459> I<00:04:04.520> had<00:04:04.850> found

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
bit more stability but I had found

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.420 
bit more stability but I had found
during<00:04:05.300> the<00:04:05.480> testing<00:04:06.020> that<00:04:06.470> if<00:04:06.590> I<00:04:06.709> set<00:04:06.980> my<00:04:07.130> pole

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
during the testing that if I set my pole

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.730 
during the testing that if I set my pole
down<00:04:07.700> whether<00:04:08.300> I'm<00:04:08.570> retying<00:04:09.110> something<00:04:09.620> or

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
down whether I'm retying something or

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.440 
down whether I'm retying something or
not<00:04:09.860> paying<00:04:10.130> attention<00:04:10.280> but<00:04:10.820> this<00:04:11.240> thing

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
not paying attention but this thing

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.080 
not paying attention but this thing
starts<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.990> tip<00:04:12.380> back<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:12.920> forth<00:04:13.190> your<00:04:13.790> pole
