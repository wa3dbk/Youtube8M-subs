00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.019
 Today I bring you this recipe for sponge cake 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:30.130
 lemon I hope you like it and nothing to be 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.590
 so you should take up subscribe 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.550
 whatever you want, leave it to me 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:42.980
 down here is worth now every next 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:47.780
 ingredients 3 eggs a lemon yogurt 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:52.100
 butter for the flour mold 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.140
 oil and baking powder 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.680
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.589
 turn the oven to 180 degrees with heat 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.079
 at the bottom only and then 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.180
 We are going to prepare the mold by giving it a 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.509
 layer of butter or margarine and 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.710
 then sprinkling flour so it does not 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:16.780
 stick on the cake 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.780
 we started beating the eggs 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.549
 - 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.330
 i 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.149
 and three 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.950
 then add the yogurt 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.950
 lemon 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.990
 the second patio 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.230
 we add two measures of sugar yogurt 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.510
 what do we have for stores 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:36.050
 Now let's add the little flour to 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.840
 little three measures of the yogurt container if 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.480
 we want to make chocolate because 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.780
 we put two measures of flour and one 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.780
 Tail measure cao a 'pure cocoa dream 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.920
 let's go adding the little flour to 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.480
 little bit 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:04:00.250
 and also the envelope of yeast 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.320
 so leave me terms and with you 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.350
 once we have added all the 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.040
 flour and the yeast sachet 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.430
 What we do is throw half a container of 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.410
 yogurt with a sunflower oil or 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.410
 olive me in my case I prefer sunflower 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.480
 we miss it 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.320
 and we keep beating 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.460
 to integrate it 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.990
 and then what we have left is to throw it out 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.320
 in the mold 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.380
 so let me 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.990
 and now we see each other once it has already 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.740
 added the oil well let's proceed 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.720
 to throw it in the mold 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.639
 me in my case chosen this mold of 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.180
 crown but you can put the one you want 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.990
 although that is 24 centimeters 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.650
 diameter 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.979
 do not ask me why 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.910
 but I tried it once in a 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.880
 half of 22 centimeters 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.340
 and on the outside it was well done but 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:15.080
 inside it was raw 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.080
 so nothing we miss 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.060
 we go well with a tongue 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.060
 to not leave us more in the mold 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.410
 and then but we put the 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.410
 true 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.409
 to which we already have it in the mold and what 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.269
 we put in the oven 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:48.269
 at 180 degrees 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.560
 in the middle part with heat down just 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.560
 for 35 minutes 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:05.880
 and meanwhile we can go scrubbing 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:10.620
 picking up the house or whatever you want 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.250
 I in my case will make the food in 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.250
 time 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:25.040
 Sorry he did not let me 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:28.950
 watch continues more 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:31.500
 and now let's see if it is already 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.590
 for the look that I have, I think so 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.560
 but of all the ways to 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.830
 check it 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.370
 we puncture with a knitting needle or with 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:46.650
 a skewer stick and look if it is 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.560
 clean in this case yes 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.830
 Thus 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.639
 the cake is already 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.719
 we take it out 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.719
 we let it rest 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:07.780
 when it's cold, we unmold it and 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:11.800
 we put in a dish to know 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:15.370
 I hope you liked it and nothing to be 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.650
 well no little finger up share it and 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.680
 subscribe if you want 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.949
 so nothing until the next one not the 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.949
 let say
