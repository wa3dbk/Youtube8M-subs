four o'clock position and one at a nine
o'clock<00:00:25.410> position<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.760> just<00:00:27.000> -<00:00:27.119> Phillips

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
o'clock position so I just - Phillips

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.140 
o'clock position so I just - Phillips
head<00:00:27.660> self<00:00:27.990> tapping<00:00:28.230> screws<00:00:28.880> let<00:00:29.880> me<00:00:29.970> get

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
head self tapping screws let me get

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:55.190 
head self tapping screws let me get
those<00:00:30.300> out

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.709 

and<00:00:56.200> then<00:00:56.379> you<00:00:56.469> can<00:00:56.620> grab<00:00:56.770> this<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.600> take<00:00:58.600> that

and then you can grab this and take that
out<00:00:58.840> so<00:00:58.870> there's<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.320> three<00:00:59.620> holes<00:00:59.890> about<00:01:00.250> it

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
out so there's the three holes about it

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.479 
out so there's the three holes about it
in<00:01:00.550> one<00:01:00.850> two<00:01:01.629> three<00:01:02.140> this<00:01:02.800> one<00:01:03.100> here<00:01:03.340> is<00:01:03.460> your

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
in one two three this one here is your

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.700 
in one two three this one here is your
adjustment<00:01:04.180> screw<00:01:04.510> so<00:01:04.960> this<00:01:05.170> is<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.440> one<00:01:05.590> you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
adjustment screw so this is the one you

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.740 
adjustment screw so this is the one you
can<00:01:05.890> adjust<00:01:06.280> for<00:01:06.580> how<00:01:06.760> much<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.300> fog<00:01:07.509> light

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
can adjust for how much the fog light

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.740 
can adjust for how much the fog light
assembly<00:01:08.380> points<00:01:08.770> up<00:01:08.920> or<00:01:09.130> down<00:01:09.570> okay

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
assembly points up or down okay

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.300 
assembly points up or down okay
so<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.200> next<00:01:11.380> thing<00:01:11.500> you've<00:01:11.680> got<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:11.890> do<00:01:12.280> now

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
so the next thing you've got to do now

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.030 
so the next thing you've got to do now
is<00:01:12.670> these<00:01:12.850> two<00:01:13.270> clips<00:01:13.810> here<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.380> actually<00:01:15.009> a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
is these two clips here is actually a

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.639 
is these two clips here is actually a
rotating<00:01:15.790> ring<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.600> you<00:01:16.690> need<00:01:16.869> to<00:01:16.990> rotate<00:01:17.170> so

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
rotating ring that you need to rotate so

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.109 
rotating ring that you need to rotate so
that<00:01:17.680> it<00:01:17.920> goes<00:01:18.009> up<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.369> groove<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.790> slides

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
that it goes up the groove and slides

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.600 
that it goes up the groove and slides
out<00:01:19.390> so<00:01:19.690> you<00:01:19.750> spin<00:01:20.409> it<00:01:20.500> like<00:01:20.530> this<00:01:20.830> and<00:01:21.250> that

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
out so you spin it like this and that

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.580 
out so you spin it like this and that
allows<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.210> pull<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.540> assembly<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:23.470> let

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
allows you to pull that assembly so let

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.930 
allows you to pull that assembly so let
me<00:01:23.649> just<00:01:23.800> show<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:23.979> this<00:01:24.159> little<00:01:24.340> clip<00:01:24.640> on<00:01:24.850> the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
me just show you this little clip on the

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.649 
me just show you this little clip on the
outside

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
outside

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.790 
outside
spins<00:01:26.619> relative<00:01:27.539> like<00:01:28.539> that<00:01:28.750> okay<00:01:29.259> so<00:01:29.619> here's

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
spins relative like that okay so here's

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.690 
spins relative like that okay so here's
the<00:01:29.860> bulb<00:01:30.160> it's<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.850> halogen<00:01:31.149> h7<00:01:31.960> bulb<00:01:32.679> you<00:01:33.520> just

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
the bulb it's a halogen h7 bulb you just

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.029 
the bulb it's a halogen h7 bulb you just
pull<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:34.000> out<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.450> it's<00:01:34.990> got<00:01:35.229> two<00:01:35.470> clips<00:01:35.860> on

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
pull it out and it's got two clips on

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.100 
pull it out and it's got two clips on
the<00:01:36.190> back<00:01:36.369> there<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:37.119> when<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:37.390> replace<00:01:37.780> the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
the back there so when you replace the

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.109 
the back there so when you replace the
new<00:01:38.320> bulb<00:01:38.590> be<00:01:38.800> careful<00:01:39.280> not<00:01:39.550> to<00:01:39.789> touch<00:01:40.090> the

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
new bulb be careful not to touch the

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.529 
new bulb be careful not to touch the
glass<00:01:40.710> filament<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:41.860> just<00:01:42.039> push<00:01:42.220> it<00:01:42.369> in<00:01:42.520> use<00:01:43.509> a

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
glass filament so just push it in use a

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.090 
glass filament so just push it in use a
bit<00:01:43.720> of<00:01:43.810> material<00:01:43.990> or<00:01:44.440> something<00:01:44.740> but<00:01:44.890> try<00:01:45.070> not

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
bit of material or something but try not

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.190 
bit of material or something but try not
to<00:01:45.280> touch<00:01:45.610> that<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.659> you'll<00:01:46.780> see<00:01:46.960> that<00:01:47.080> this

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
to touch that and you'll see that this

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.230 
to touch that and you'll see that this
is<00:01:47.259> two<00:01:47.800> pins<00:01:48.070> at<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.280> top<00:01:48.369> that<00:01:48.700> denote<00:01:49.030> where

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
is two pins at the top that denote where

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.590 
is two pins at the top that denote where
the<00:01:49.360> top<00:01:49.570> of<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.780> bulb<00:01:49.990> goes<00:01:50.670> okay<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:51.940> then

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
the top of the bulb goes okay and then

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.809 
the top of the bulb goes okay and then
get<00:01:53.319> your<00:01:53.440> new<00:01:53.710> now<00:01:53.890> what<00:01:54.039> I<00:01:54.069> did<00:01:54.340> on<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.580> one

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
get your new now what I did on this one

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.120 
get your new now what I did on this one
was<00:01:54.970> I<00:01:55.060> did<00:01:55.270> put<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.479> bit<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.659> wd-40<00:01:56.470> around<00:01:56.890> this

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
was I did put a bit of wd-40 around this

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.510 
was I did put a bit of wd-40 around this
ring<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.810> that<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:59.140> does<00:01:59.320> move<00:01:59.619> freely<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.310> may

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
ring so that it does move freely you may

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.090 
ring so that it does move freely you may
need<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.880> do<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.509> then<00:02:02.200> put<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.710> on<00:02:02.829> you
