is<00:00:18.230> me<00:00:18.440> 25<00:00:19.039> every<00:00:19.369> day<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:20.090> we're<00:00:20.300> here<00:00:20.449> to<00:00:20.630> try

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
is me 25 every day and we're here to try

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.040 
is me 25 every day and we're here to try
so<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.800> first<00:00:22.010> rumored<00:00:22.520> problem<00:00:23.000> is<00:00:23.210> a<00:00:23.240> jutsu

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
so the first rumored problem is a jutsu

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.290 
so the first rumored problem is a jutsu
Valerie<00:00:24.710> how<00:00:24.950> this<00:00:25.220> means<00:00:25.520> that<00:00:25.670> I<00:00:25.820> around

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
Valerie how this means that I around

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.359 
Valerie how this means that I around
this<00:00:26.539> point<00:00:27.020> in<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:27.350> track<00:00:27.620> one<00:00:27.920> of<00:00:28.010> the<00:00:28.100> cars

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
this point in the track one of the cars

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.540 
this point in the track one of the cars
would<00:00:28.610> evolve<00:00:28.910> when<00:00:29.570> that<00:00:29.990> went<00:00:30.680> down<00:00:30.800> at<00:00:31.430> one

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
would evolve when that went down at one

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.490 
would evolve when that went down at one
of<00:00:31.670> the<00:00:31.760> inversions<00:00:32.329> and<00:00:32.539> as<00:00:32.870> it<00:00:33.050> came<00:00:33.230> up

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
of the inversions and as it came up

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.900 
of the inversions and as it came up
trying<00:00:33.980> to<00:00:34.100> complete<00:00:34.340> on<00:00:34.489> an<00:00:34.579> inversion

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
trying to complete on an inversion

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.229 
trying to complete on an inversion
likely<00:00:35.809> that<00:00:35.930> inversion<00:00:36.320> just<00:00:36.949> there<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.969> car

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
likely that inversion just there the car

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.389 
likely that inversion just there the car
went<00:00:38.659> down<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.230> stationary<00:00:39.829> and<00:00:40.010> then<00:00:40.370> a

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
went down in the stationary and then a

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.939 
went down in the stationary and then a
rescue<00:00:40.999> operation<00:00:41.030> has<00:00:41.870> to<00:00:41.989> take<00:00:42.140> place<00:00:42.319> with

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
rescue operation has to take place with

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.369 
rescue operation has to take place with
a<00:00:43.069> crane<00:00:43.399> put<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:43.789> lot<00:00:44.179> of<00:00:44.210> trash<00:00:44.659> and<00:00:44.960> it<00:00:45.140> seems

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
a crane put a lot of trash and it seems

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.750 
a crane put a lot of trash and it seems
that<00:00:45.469> they've<00:00:45.679> been<00:00:45.890> out<00:00:46.039> having<00:00:46.339> normal<00:00:46.670> or

cows walk this book sweeping up the
queue<00:00:48.739> lining<00:00:49.039> they<00:00:49.190> are<00:00:49.670> also<00:00:49.850> your<00:00:50.120> yellow

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
queue lining they are also your yellow

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.119 
queue lining they are also your yellow
paper<00:00:50.719> bag<00:00:50.989> around<00:00:51.229> you<00:00:51.499> can't<00:00:51.769> figure<00:00:52.010> out

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
paper bag around you can't figure out

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.969 
paper bag around you can't figure out
what<00:00:52.969> it<00:00:52.999> is<00:00:53.210> looks<00:00:53.690> like<00:00:53.960> they're<00:00:54.229> typing<00:00:54.530> is

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
what it is looks like they're typing is

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.200 
what it is looks like they're typing is
you<00:00:55.129> want<00:00:55.339> make<00:00:55.519> sure<00:00:55.550> it's<00:00:55.789> not<00:00:55.909> on<00:00:56.089> the

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
you want make sure it's not on the

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.000 
you want make sure it's not on the
construction<00:00:56.449> site<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.409> ready<00:00:57.679> to<00:00:57.889> open

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
construction site and ready to open

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.420 
construction site and ready to open
hopefully<00:00:58.549> next<00:00:58.940> few<00:00:59.239> days

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
hopefully next few days

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.060 
hopefully next few days
so<00:01:01.060> we<00:01:01.270> just<00:01:01.480> spoke<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:01.750> an<00:01:02.020> on-site<00:01:02.470> mechanic

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
so we just spoke to an on-site mechanic

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.770 
so we just spoke to an on-site mechanic
and<00:01:03.220> apart<00:01:03.490> from<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.790> three<00:01:04.089> problems<00:01:04.449> I

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
and apart from the three problems I

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.650 
and apart from the three problems I
explained<00:01:05.170> he<00:01:05.650> told<00:01:05.950> us<00:01:06.160> a<00:01:06.240> on-site<00:01:07.240> senior

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
explained he told us a on-site senior

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.480 
explained he told us a on-site senior
mechanic<00:01:08.110> over<00:01:08.260> the<00:01:08.590> smile<00:01:08.890> I<00:01:08.920> told<00:01:09.250> us<00:01:09.370> that

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
mechanic over the smile I told us that

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.150 
mechanic over the smile I told us that
hopefully<00:01:10.450> he<00:01:11.050> will<00:01:11.260> be<00:01:11.440> going<00:01:11.590> on<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.980> right

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
hopefully he will be going on the right

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.800 
hopefully he will be going on the right
in<00:01:12.400> two<00:01:12.580> days<00:01:12.790> us<00:01:13.030> than<00:01:13.180> he's<00:01:13.360> been<00:01:13.390> on<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.660> 8th

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
in two days us than he's been on the 8th

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.180 
in two days us than he's been on the 8th
he<00:01:13.900> said<00:01:14.110> he'll<00:01:14.260> be<00:01:14.410> gone<00:01:14.530> on<00:01:14.710> in<00:01:14.740> two<00:01:14.979> days

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
he said he'll be gone on in two days

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.310 
he said he'll be gone on in two days
when<00:01:15.670> they<00:01:15.820> finished<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.420> second<00:01:16.990> round<00:01:17.200> of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
when they finished the second round of

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.040 
when they finished the second round of
testing<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:17.950> he<00:01:18.370> said<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.240> second

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
testing and he said that the second

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.230 
testing and he said that the second
delay<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.440> teething<00:01:20.740> problems<00:01:21.490> would<00:01:21.940> you<00:01:22.090> to

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
delay the teething problems would you to

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.140 
delay the teething problems would you to
censor<00:01:22.810> censor<00:01:23.470> board's<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:24.670> that's<00:01:24.850> false

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
censor censor board's so that's false

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.390 
censor censor board's so that's false

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
looking at the census their sense is

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.210 
looking at the census their sense is
just<00:01:43.450> under<00:01:43.720> there<00:01:43.899> you<00:01:44.020> can<00:01:44.140> see<00:01:44.350> just<00:01:44.590> on<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
just under there you can see just on the

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.859 
just under there you can see just on the
dirt<00:01:45.399> where<00:01:45.640> all<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.880> workers<00:01:46.119> were<00:01:46.360> before

dirt where all the workers were before

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.680 
dirt where all the workers were before
he<00:01:47.619> also<00:01:47.770> said<00:01:48.160> that<00:01:48.220> there<00:01:48.520> was<00:01:48.640> some<00:01:49.090> smaller

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690
