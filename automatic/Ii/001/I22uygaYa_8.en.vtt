half<00:00:44.980> pop<00:00:45.980> back<00:00:46.160> inside<00:00:46.520> that's<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:46.970> good<00:00:47.150> break

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.610 

to<00:00:53.210> be<00:00:53.270> honest<00:00:53.480> it's<00:00:53.810> disappointing<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.350> see

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
to be honest it's disappointing to see

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.680

England<00:00:55.010> make<00:00:55.160> a<00:00:55.190> break<00:00:55.430> like<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.090> so

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
England make a break like that and so

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.760 
England make a break like that and so
early<00:00:57.050> because<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.320> girls<00:00:57.530> would<00:00:57.620> have<00:00:57.650> been

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
early because the girls would have been

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.410 
early because the girls would have been
very<00:00:58.040> aware<00:00:58.160> of<00:00:58.430> that<00:00:58.520> inside<00:00:58.880> ball<00:00:59.090> they<00:00:59.270> did

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
very aware of that inside ball they did

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.479 
very aware of that inside ball they did
a<00:00:59.450> lot<00:00:59.630> against<00:00:59.989> Italy<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.800> it<00:01:01.040> they<00:01:01.340> should

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
a lot against Italy and it they should

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.830 
a lot against Italy and it they should
have<00:01:01.610> been<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:02.000> hostile<00:01:02.329> on<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.510> inside

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
have been the hostile on the inside

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.120 
have been the hostile on the inside
should<00:01:03.020> have<00:01:03.110> been<00:01:03.230> wide<00:01:03.560> awake<00:01:03.800> to<00:01:03.980> that

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.130 
should have been wide awake to that

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.620 
should have been wide awake to that
particularly<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:04.640> early<00:01:05.119> in<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.300> game<00:01:05.330> when

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630
