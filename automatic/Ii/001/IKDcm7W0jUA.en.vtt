00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.110
 for me 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.820
 the place that we wanted to celebrate my 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 birthday was a surprise just like 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.650
 what we would do so he decided to be 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.420
 for clothes that were very comfortable I chose 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.280
 some pants so thin 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.280
 a super basic shirt 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.630
 and a hat with which I could give 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.630
 that touch to such a simple look 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.630
 also to complement what use 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.090
 these booties that are super flashy and 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.620
 as no planes find there where it is 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.199
 each item in the information box 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.420
 with the makeup he will do the basics and 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.770
 fundamental to fact apply this 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.150
 I try because I knew I was going 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.190
 be all day out there I wanted you not to 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.910
 I would shine and applied it on 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.910
 everything in the area 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.420
 then applied my base of 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.090
 Makeup you already know that in the feixa 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.280
 mobile I love because it covers very very 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.390
 little but given a tone to the skin very 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.390
 healthy and very juicy 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.530
 we went to corrector and pencil as always 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.970
 in dark circles and then in some 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.970
 markit assurances you have 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.939
 in my eyes, the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.880
 apply my mascara because it is 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.289
 much more comfortable I feel and I do not know new 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.460
 I wanted to be around all day 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.460
 take care of my makeup 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.230
 and to make sure that I 'm not going to 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.360
 leave no shine apply a few towns 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.530
 matificantes also as before I did with 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.530
 the prebase in the t zone 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.260
 also apply a little bit of 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.790
 bronzer to contour colors mode 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.640
 and apply it to the cheeks as well 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.710
 in the temple 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.080
 and then with your eyebrows you know that 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.330
 I never change first he applied my pencil 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.230
 of eyebrows to fill them and finally 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.230
 the fixed with a gel 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.680
 at the last moment I decided that I wanted 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.720
 give a little light to the face and I did 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.580
 with this illuminator in this case liquid 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.770
 because there seems to be a lot more 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.930
 natural that applies as always the high 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.690
 of the cheekbone in the nasal septum and the arch of 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.340
 cupid and to continue with the line of 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.990
 rest of makeup for the lips 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.270
 I also decided something very subtle that 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.100
 practically not noticed and what I did 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.320
 it was with the marker to outline a little 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.940
 the lips for after combining them and 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.120
 not to notice the cut but at the same time 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.160
 you mark me a little pencil and as a last 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.380
 touch apply is what brings the lip 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.670
 that has a little color to give that 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.670
 more red tone to the lips 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.150
 with him but the first thing I did was 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.820
 finish that carmelo because I had it 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.320
 let it dry while in 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.810
 the city and I still have a little 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.350
 wet so I gave him the last thing I'm 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.350
 with the dryer 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.000
 Once I had it dry what I did 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.340
 was to give it a little bit of shape with the 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.780
 tenacity but let's nothing to sharpen it 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.940
 I've been left with some waves that seemed 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.610
 almost like they were very natural because 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.200
 they make me very fast without catching 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.480
 make sections in the hair simply 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.220
 taking strands and giving me a little 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.800
 having the tenacity super short time 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.459
 in the hair up a little to give it 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.459
 volume and texture 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.500
 this was the result that stayed with me 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.270
 I say it seems that I almost had not 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.070
 done nothing but hey gave me a little 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.020
 of volume and texture the hair and so 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.610
 changed from not wearing them without Felix and 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.260
 as a final touch I wanted to put this 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.810
 hat because the rest of the water was 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.820
 super simple now that you leave with everything 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.360
 what I did in my life surprise of 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.360
 birthday 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.100
 i 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.139
 but 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.360
 to 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:18.580
 I think he's yours 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.889
 or
