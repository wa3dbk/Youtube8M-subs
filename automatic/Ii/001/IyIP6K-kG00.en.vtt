00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
in very wet soil so that was a good sign

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.260 
in very wet soil so that was a good sign

problem<00:01:12.300> with<00:01:12.390> her<00:01:12.539> is<00:01:12.690> she's<00:01:13.110> not<00:01:13.320> very<00:01:13.440> good

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
problem with her is she's not very good

relationship going I made a different

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.140 
relationship going I made a different
nest<00:02:43.980> here<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.610> know<00:02:45.600> Bob<00:02:46.020> whites<00:02:46.290> are<00:02:46.500> very<00:02:46.710> shy

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
nest here I know Bob whites are very shy

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.350 
nest here I know Bob whites are very shy
so<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.180> made<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.630> nest<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.260> has<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.850> feeling

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
so I made a nest so it has the feeling

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.020 
so I made a nest so it has the feeling
of<00:02:51.450> being<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.410> grassland<00:02:52.860> somewhere<00:02:53.459> so

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
of being in the grassland somewhere so

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.120 
of being in the grassland somewhere so
he<00:02:54.180> can<00:02:54.330> go<00:02:54.510> away<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.720> hide<00:02:55.080> in<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.980> long

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
he can go away and hide in the long

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.680 
he can go away and hide in the long
grass<00:02:56.280> when<00:02:56.640> he<00:02:56.730> feels<00:02:56.970> threatened<00:02:57.420> at<00:02:57.540> all

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
grass when he feels threatened at all

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.710 
grass when he feels threatened at all
nice<00:02:58.580> he's<00:02:59.580> learning<00:02:59.940> he's<00:03:00.060> great<00:03:00.330> he<00:03:00.570> also

because<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.290> was<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.860> bit<00:03:08.010> worried<00:03:08.220> about<00:03:08.280> that

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
because I was a bit worried about that

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.620 
because I was a bit worried about that
because<00:03:08.670> I've<00:03:08.880> had<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> problem<00:03:09.209> with<00:03:09.420> quail

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
because I've had a problem with quail

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.030 
because I've had a problem with quail
before<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.110> they<00:03:10.170> get<00:03:10.320> stuck<00:03:10.739> in<00:03:10.770> these

before and they get stuck in these

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.000 
before and they get stuck in these
feathers<00:03:11.489> but<00:03:12.030> because<00:03:12.900> she's<00:03:13.140> quite<00:03:13.620> lightly

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
feathers but because she's quite lightly

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.090 
feathers but because she's quite lightly
feathered<00:03:15.410> there's<00:03:16.410> no<00:03:16.560> problem<00:03:16.860> with<00:03:16.890> that

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.830 

when<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.110> think<00:04:34.350> about<00:04:34.410> it<00:04:34.890> but<00:04:35.780> these<00:04:36.780> are

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
when you think about it but these are

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.330 
when you think about it but these are
two<00:04:37.320> completely<00:04:37.650> different<00:04:37.710> species<00:04:38.160> of

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
two completely different species of

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.180 
two completely different species of
burden<00:04:38.760> yet<00:04:38.940> they<00:04:39.540> take<00:04:40.140> to<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:40.410> others<00:04:40.980> so

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
burden yet they take to it others so

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.370 
burden yet they take to it others so
quickly<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.480> fact<00:04:42.690> is<00:04:42.840> they<00:04:42.990> must<00:04:43.170> speak

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
quickly and the fact is they must speak

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.360 
quickly and the fact is they must speak
a<00:04:43.500> different<00:04:43.620> language<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.520> yet<00:04:45.420> already

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
a different language and yet already

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.200 
a different language and yet already
they<00:04:47.370> can<00:04:47.550> communicate<00:04:47.990> my<00:04:48.990> reason<00:04:49.410> for

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
they can communicate my reason for

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.870 
they can communicate my reason for
having<00:04:51.210> bobwhite<00:04:51.840> was<00:04:52.260> that<00:04:52.770> they<00:04:53.310> seem<00:04:53.640> to<00:04:53.670> be

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
having bobwhite was that they seem to be

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.290 
having bobwhite was that they seem to be
nearer<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.420> the<00:04:54.540> wild<00:04:54.960> bird<00:04:55.230> and<00:04:56.040> they<00:04:56.760> do<00:04:56.820> pair

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
nearer to the wild bird and they do pair

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.410 
nearer to the wild bird and they do pair
off<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:58.320> my<00:04:58.470> hope<00:04:58.740> was<00:04:59.010> that<00:04:59.460> I<00:05:00.060> would<00:05:00.210> get<00:05:00.360> a

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
off and my hope was that I would get a

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.030 
off and my hope was that I would get a
couple<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:00.990> then<00:05:01.170> they<00:05:01.410> will<00:05:01.590> be<00:05:01.740> able<00:05:01.830> to

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
couple and then they will be able to

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.480 
couple and then they will be able to
raise<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.460> quail<00:05:02.790> themselves

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
raise you the quail themselves

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.680 
raise you the quail themselves
unfortunately<00:05:05.490> with<00:05:05.640> only<00:05:05.820> one<00:05:06.150> hatching<00:05:06.570> and

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
unfortunately with only one hatching and

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.440 
unfortunately with only one hatching and
I<00:05:06.720> think<00:05:07.230> I'm<00:05:07.500> right<00:05:07.800> in<00:05:07.830> saying<00:05:08.270> this<00:05:09.270> is<00:05:09.330> a

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
I think I'm right in saying this is a

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.010 
I think I'm right in saying this is a
male<00:05:09.750> because<00:05:10.080> of<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:11.700> black<00:05:11.970> line<00:05:12.600> and

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
male because of the the black line and

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.990
