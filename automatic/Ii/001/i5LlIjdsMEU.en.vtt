around the branch take to the tip branch

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:09.100 
around the branch take to the tip branch
bring<00:00:59.539> a<00:00:59.929> strand<00:01:02.649> to<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:03.679> center<00:01:07.899> so<00:01:08.899> it's

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
the center of the tree is because I

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.870 
the center of the tree is because I
really<00:01:17.780> like<00:01:18.079> the<00:01:18.259> three-dimensional<00:01:19.219> look
