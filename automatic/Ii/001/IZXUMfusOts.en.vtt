00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
of offset by the fact that this is a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.710 
of offset by the fact that this is a
pretty<00:00:16.710> thick<00:00:17.010> case<00:00:17.430> despite<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.390> bulk<00:00:18.570> this

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
pretty thick case despite the bulk this

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.300 
pretty thick case despite the bulk this
is<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:19.109> favorite<00:00:19.500> iPhone<00:00:19.830> cases<00:00:20.070> that

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
is one of my favorite iPhone cases that

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.130 
is one of my favorite iPhone cases that
I've<00:00:20.430> used<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:20.850> far<00:00:21.119> because<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.600> how<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.900> feels

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
I've used so far because of how it feels

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.900 
I've used so far because of how it feels
the<00:00:22.710> ballistic<00:00:23.130> urban<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.550> makes<00:00:23.760> my

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
the ballistic urban that makes my

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.000 
the ballistic urban that makes my
iPhones<00:00:24.330> feel<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.900> tanks<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.529> literally<00:00:25.980> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
iPhones feel like tanks it's literally a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.189 
iPhones feel like tanks it's literally a
block<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.609> rubber<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.300> encases<00:00:27.660> your<00:00:27.930> entire

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
block of rubber that encases your entire

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.630 
block of rubber that encases your entire
device<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.800> think<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.220> good<00:00:29.369> compromise

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
device I think it's a good compromise

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.310 
device I think it's a good compromise
between<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.179> really<00:00:30.480> slim<00:00:30.779> case<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
between a really slim case like the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
between a really slim case like the
spigen<00:00:31.650> slim<00:00:31.920> Armour<00:00:32.189> or<00:00:32.309> something<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.669> is

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
spigen slim Armour or something that is

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.549 
spigen slim Armour or something that is
actually<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> tank<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.230> griffin

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
actually like a tank like the griffin

so<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.480> mobile<00:00:57.750> reviews<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.230> base<00:00:58.500> our

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
so that mobile reviews we base our

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.619 
so that mobile reviews we base our
reviews<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.190> actual<00:00:59.609> usage<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.149> we<00:01:00.239> try<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.480> use

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
reviews on actual usage so we try to use

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.540 
reviews on actual usage so we try to use
our<00:01:00.870> cases<00:01:01.320> before<00:01:01.680> actually<00:01:01.980> reviewing<00:01:02.430> them

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
our cases before actually reviewing them

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.410 
our cases before actually reviewing them
some<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> things<00:01:03.000> we've<00:01:03.149> done<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
some of the things we've done with the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.670 
some of the things we've done with the
ballistic<00:01:03.750> urbanite<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.199> kind<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.439> check

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
ballistic urbanite it's kind of check

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.830 
ballistic urbanite it's kind of check
how<00:01:04.920> scratch<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.970> back<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> cases

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
how scratch about the back of the cases

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.050 
how scratch about the back of the cases
on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.020> ground<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.619> well<00:01:08.159> as<00:01:08.369> speaking<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
on the ground as well as speaking of the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.940 
on the ground as well as speaking of the
ground<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.360> dropped<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.780> from<00:01:09.930> 6<00:01:10.229> feet<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.799> this

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
ground we dropped it from 6 feet so this

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.280 
ground we dropped it from 6 feet so this
ballistic<00:01:11.490> urban<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.299> has<00:01:12.479> had<00:01:12.689> some<00:01:12.900> intimate

ballistic urban it has had some intimate
moments<00:01:13.650> with<00:01:13.710> concrete<00:01:14.310> now<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.790> know<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.119> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
moments with concrete now I know that I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.969 
moments with concrete now I know that I
physically<00:01:15.659> only<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.320> iPhone<00:01:16.619> 6<00:01:16.860> plus

kind of make everything a little bit
bigger<00:01:56.130> they're<00:01:56.549> probably<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:56.969> provides

iPhone 6 and 6 pluses are very slick and

slim devices the cases are generally a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.410 
slim devices the cases are generally a
slick<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.409> slim<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.310> most<00:02:08.640> cases<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.030> wouldn't

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
slick and slim but most cases I wouldn't

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.690 
slick and slim but most cases I wouldn't
try<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.569> do<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.020> with<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.920> something

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
try to do this with this is something

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.600 
try to do this with this is something
nuts

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
nuts

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.400 
nuts
recommend<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.420> with<00:02:13.570> a<00:02:13.600> lot<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:13.840> other<00:02:14.110> cases

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
recommend it with a lot of other cases

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.320 
recommend it with a lot of other cases
but<00:02:14.770> these<00:02:15.010> bumpers<00:02:15.400> provide<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.790> little<00:02:16.120> bit

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
but these bumpers provide a little bit

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.060 
but these bumpers provide a little bit
more<00:02:16.510> texture<00:02:16.870> increases<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.530> hand<00:02:17.680> ability

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
more texture increases the hand ability

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.650 
more texture increases the hand ability
of<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.220> case<00:02:18.400> which<00:02:18.580> is<00:02:18.700> nice<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.450> what<00:02:19.510> do<00:02:19.600> you

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
of the case which is nice so what do you

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.060 
of the case which is nice so what do you
guys<00:02:19.750> think<00:02:19.810> would<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.170> guys<00:02:20.320> be<00:02:20.530> annoyed<00:02:20.860> by

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
guys think would you guys be annoyed by

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.070 
guys think would you guys be annoyed by
these<00:02:21.220> extra<00:02:21.790> bumps<00:02:22.150> or<00:02:22.330> do<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.840> think

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
these extra bumps or do you think

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.960 
these extra bumps or do you think
they're<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.290> good<00:02:23.440> idea<00:02:23.710> again<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.130> like<00:02:24.340> them<00:02:24.550> so

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
they're a good idea again I like them so

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.160 
they're a good idea again I like them so
those<00:02:25.120> are<00:02:25.270> kind<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.540> two<00:02:25.810> standout

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
those are kind of the two standout

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.960 
those are kind of the two standout
things<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.680> this<00:02:26.890> case<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.400> will<00:02:27.550> talk<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.790> little

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
things of this case I will talk a little

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.610 
things of this case I will talk a little
bit<00:02:28.180> more<00:02:28.330> about<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.600> other<00:02:28.750> details<00:02:29.320> but<00:02:29.560> if

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
bit more about the other details but if

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.870 
bit more about the other details but if
you<00:02:29.710> want<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.890> complete<00:02:30.010> blow-by-blow<00:02:30.610> or

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
you want a complete blow-by-blow or

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.850 
you want a complete blow-by-blow or
complete<00:02:31.330> breakdown<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.990> do<00:02:32.410> check<00:02:32.590> out<00:02:32.710> the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
complete breakdown I do check out the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.290 
complete breakdown I do check out the
review<00:02:33.130> table<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.520> we<00:02:33.640> have<00:02:33.820> on<00:02:33.970> our<00:02:34.060> website

review table that we have on our website
I'm<00:02:35.110> going<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.350> take<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> next<00:02:35.740> few<00:02:35.830> minutes

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
I'm going to take the next few minutes

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.530 
I'm going to take the next few minutes
talk<00:02:36.220> about<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.490> installation<00:02:36.970> process<00:02:37.180> as

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
talk about the installation process as

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.000 
talk about the installation process as
well<00:02:37.720> as<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.050> screen<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.590> dust<00:02:38.830> protection

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
well as the screen and dust protection

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.820 
well as the screen and dust protection
and<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:40.060> handling<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.020> functionality<00:02:41.740> of

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
and the handling and functionality of

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.860 
and the handling and functionality of
your<00:02:41.860> iPhone<00:02:42.250> inside<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.730> case<00:02:42.910> in<00:02:43.420> terms<00:02:43.690> of

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
your iPhone inside the case in terms of

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.330 
your iPhone inside the case in terms of
installation<00:02:44.170> this<00:02:44.500> case<00:02:44.740> is<00:02:44.890> pretty<00:02:45.130> rigid

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
installation this case is pretty rigid

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.860 
installation this case is pretty rigid
so<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.730> takes<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.030> little<00:02:46.120> bit<00:02:46.240> more<00:02:46.450> effort<00:02:46.600> to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870
