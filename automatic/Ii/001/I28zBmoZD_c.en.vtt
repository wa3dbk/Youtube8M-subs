00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.760
 today I'm going to introduce you to the spy bucket a 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.590
 model that comes to expand the range of 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.120
 Italian brand products in 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.920
 our country and it's going to compete 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.170
 directly with three French firms 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.570
 but they offer products from 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.240
 local manufacturing I'm talking about the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.859
 billet turner the citroën berlingo and the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.650
 segment leader that is the renault 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.449
 Kangoo the cube is characterized by a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.269
 really controversial design and 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.250
 original you may like it or not but there is no 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.620
 doubts that draws attention the days that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.960
 we had it people turn their heads to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.850
 see them because it's really very eye-catching 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.040
 I propose that today in news about 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.500
 wheels let's test well in detail the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.400
 family or multipurpose version of 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.400
 this and acts 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.500
 up with a high level of equipment 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.550
 although with a single engine option the 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.800
 master to 1.4 out of 73 horsepower the 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.740
 same drive used by the partner 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.720
 Patagonian his box in the manual of 5 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.770
 marches that responds with agility and 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.570
 precision 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.970
 one characteristic is that it has the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.970
 first too short and both 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.820
 following longer the cube feels 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.820
 very comfortable in urban transit where 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.550
 it brings out a good torque in low 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.100
 turns and shows soft answers and 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.860
 even with an appreciable elasticity 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.259
 but by counterpart it decreases 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.360
 quite its performance at high 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.030
 speeds when going to the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.190
 let's say that because it is a 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.039
 small engine you have to have patience in 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.140
 the route since it's pretty lazy and 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.420
 regulate a little the acceleration if not 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.970
 we want to have surprises in the consumption 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.000
 since the producer must work with 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.900
 a body that does not shine 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.970
 aerodynamically 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.160
 the good turning radius and smoothness and 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.320
 Direction accuracy makes it 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.420
 very nice to wear it in the city 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.180
 where it really moves with joy 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.180
 in general it moves with a commendable 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.520
 ride comfort only interrupted in 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.040
 determined soil since it's something else 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.780
 durito and jumping that his rivals with 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.780
 some bounce on the cobblestones 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.730
 although for us this model is 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.460
 all a novelty the cube is marketed 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.850
 in Europe since 2008 and it's already been 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.490
 sold more than 60 thousand units in this 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.620
 case we are testing a version with a 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.500
 traditional and classic color as is the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.230
 however the supply gray color 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.930
 that offers look at our country is 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.710
 really very attractive they have orange 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.980
 green blue colored let's say colors that 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.490
 further highlight this daring figure and 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.490
 attractive 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.270
 It is a vehicle with a personal design and 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.489
 controversial of that there is no doubt you can 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.520
 like it or not is totally subjective 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.890
 but it can not be denied that it is original 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.140
 it attracts attention breaks the molds and if 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.090
 well on the first impression it turns out 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.700
 something strange after several glances 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.459
 becomes sympathetic and innovative by 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.560
 another part is particularly elevated what 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.540
 that besides being peculiar is safe 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.030
 because it leaves the optics safe 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.769
 minor touches without doubt those are the 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.290
 more striking details of this vehicle 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.640
 that has the interior space as a 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.410
 great ally 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.900
 doors inside exhibits a sober design 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.030
 simple and functional we can not 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.700
 criticize the visibility since the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.920
 parantes interfere in the vision the 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.750
 Access to the rear sector is practical 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.610
 thanks to the advantage of the forces 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.430
 natural sliding ones 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.870
 very soft but a detail to have in 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.510
 account is that the rear windows 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.760
 can not be lowered but barely 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.860
 they open in a tilting way as for 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.140
 comfort incorporates air conditioning 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.480
 electric pack steering wheel adjustable 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.990
 height and depth radio am / fm 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.450
 I met m 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.250
 is among others the eco drive is the 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.140
 element that distinguishes it from its rivals 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.880
 he is dealing with a system that advises 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.130
 regarding the most efficient way of 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.610
 driving either by consumption or by 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.610
 issue 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.490
 we review the technical sheet of this 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.920
 version 1.4 dynamic has an engine 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.620
 naftero of a situation of landero 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.540
 transversal with four cylinders and eight 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.250
 valves one thousand cubic capacity 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.620
 three hundred sixty cubic centimeters 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.770
 and a power of 73 horsepower 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.620
 at 5200 revolutions per minute with a 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.270
 torque from 118 newton meters to 2600 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.460
 revolutions per minute all this 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.040
 mechanics is associated with a manual box 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.590
 5 speed has a speed 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.560
 maximum of 153 kilometers per hour a 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.830
 Acceleration from 0 to 100 in 15 5 seconds 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.290
 and the consumptions have a urban of 81 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.810
 liters per 100 kilometers another extra 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.510
 urban area of ​​5.4 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.690
 and an average consumption of 6 2 liters each 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:22.470
 100 kilometers has 195 tires

 bars 55 16-inch wheels a weight 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.990
 of thousand 180 kilos and a capacity of trunk 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.760
 of 650 liters and a capacity of 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.760
