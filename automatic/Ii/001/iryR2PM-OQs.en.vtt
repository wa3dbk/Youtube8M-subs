one<00:00:58.149> of<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.420> things<00:00:58.720> that<00:00:58.899> I've<00:00:59.290> had<00:00:59.770> an

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
one of the things that I've had an

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.040 
one of the things that I've had an
opportunity<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.520> do<00:01:00.820> with<00:01:01.059> this<00:01:01.210> telescope<00:01:01.450> is

opportunity to do with this telescope is

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.310 
opportunity to do with this telescope is
to<00:01:02.829> observe<00:01:03.219> quasar<00:01:03.820> host<00:01:04.030> galaxies<00:01:04.630> so<00:01:05.140> these

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
to observe quasar host galaxies so these

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.620 
to observe quasar host galaxies so these
are<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.590> galaxies<00:01:06.369> where<00:01:06.820> supermassive

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
are the galaxies where supermassive

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.590 
are the galaxies where supermassive
black<00:01:08.050> holes<00:01:08.460> live<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.790> this<00:01:10.420> are

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
black holes live and this are

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.660 
black holes live and this are
supermassive<00:01:10.990> black<00:01:11.290> holes<00:01:11.530> that<00:01:11.950> are<00:01:11.979> active

supermassive black holes that are active
what<00:01:13.210> we<00:01:13.360> mean<00:01:13.540> by<00:01:13.570> active<00:01:14.050> is<00:01:14.200> that<00:01:14.350> they're

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
what we mean by active is that they're

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.770 
what we mean by active is that they're
accreting<00:01:15.009> matter<00:01:15.039> and<00:01:15.580> because<00:01:16.539> there<00:01:16.690> are

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
accreting matter and because there are

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.050 
accreting matter and because there are
creating<00:01:17.140> mattered<00:01:17.610> some<00:01:18.610> of<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.880> energy

be<00:02:46.819> the<00:02:47.269> way<00:02:47.420> they<00:02:47.450> are<00:02:47.720> today<00:02:48.069> when<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:49.250> do

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
be the way they are today when you do

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.729 
be the way they are today when you do
research<00:02:49.940> in<00:02:50.120> astronomy<00:02:50.290> you're<00:02:51.290> actually

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
research in astronomy you're actually

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.550 
research in astronomy you're actually
bringing<00:02:52.700> new<00:02:53.090> knowledge<00:02:53.330> into<00:02:54.049> humanity

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
bringing new knowledge into humanity

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.069 
bringing new knowledge into humanity
things<00:02:55.519> that<00:02:55.820> nobody<00:02:56.209> had<00:02:56.570> ever<00:02:56.720> seen<00:02:57.019> before

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
things that nobody knew before you're

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.530

you're<00:03:01.010> you're<00:03:01.489> making<00:03:01.820> history<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.359> that

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
you're you're making history in that

you're you're making history in that
sense<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.530> when<00:03:03.859> I<00:03:03.890> give<00:03:04.190> students<00:03:04.730> the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
sense so when I give students the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.210 
sense so when I give students the
opportunity<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.480> do<00:03:05.750> research<00:03:06.070> they<00:03:07.070> are

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
opportunity to do research they are

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.540 
opportunity to do research they are
