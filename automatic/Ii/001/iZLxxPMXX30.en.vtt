00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello everybody it's me judge 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.520
 economy it's been a while since I have not 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.290
 made of video so here I am going to do 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.660
 this video a bit in express because 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.950
 that he actually wanted to make a video 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.900
 that's how I had a breakdown 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.360
 of the internet in fact there have been storms 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.379
 there was the storm there there were even some 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.359
 tornadoes in my area 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.580
 this is killing us so it tells you so 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.910
 I did not have internet for two 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.160
 weeks of the coup I did not see finally I 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.910
 seen after everyone the lego boxes 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.669
 star wars 2013 I not find it there 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.050
 are really good and daxon are not 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.210
 terrible are they actually managed 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.059
 on the figures but the vehicles 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.100
 are not terrible finally brief if you 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.280
 want to talk about savenay on skype 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.530
 we 'll talk about it tell you what I think 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.780
 after a long time than those finally 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.550
 short so it's a rock 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.379
 finally these two modes so at mocks 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.110
 on a black skin and make fun of 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.879
 mustafar so start with the one that 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.460
 I like it the least so the moc on the vise 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.739
 black for that on the scale of a real 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.629
 character that I do not like in fact I 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.390
 I have normally eaten the black star 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.640
 why the high enough dub still there 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.670
 see a lot of little things like that but 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.090
 I did she wanted to do 70 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.100
 good but too bad there are so it's very 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.070
 very very detailed very 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.350
 really small and retail more 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.780
 early so we have little controller by 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.259
 example we really have small details 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.659
 the crime really a little trick we have 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.780
 generators there is one 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.939
 a missile launcher here is a train 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.040
 whole nothing but missile launcher what here 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.310
 we have a big turn so it was 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.759
 a bit the basis of the mode it was thanks to 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.049
 why I wanted to make fun here 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.630
 the lanes inside the turret I 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.659
 do not leave you in hd and or 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.880
 almost that slab way I 'm going to you 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.610
 destroy so tear him off so if 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.409
 the interior is actually a good driver 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.030
 at first I wanted to do I had done 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.219
 a system to be able to put someone 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.659
 who holds no but I did not have this 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.399
 room to make a cockpit everything is or 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.380
 no I really had the idea in mind 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.580
 as I made this so 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.940
 I said to myself too bad I want to do the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.019
 the commands here are so I do not think 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.950
 that there is much to present 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.200
 go to the block of mustafar so 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.890
 This is the scene where the Emperor of covers 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.870
 burned anakin so with both claude 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.170
 schopp behind here a gateway that 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.950
 rides with his doctors droids next 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:40.380
 from rant not afraid aarschot hall 3 here 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.160
 we have the cpe is called mustapha nothing 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.380
 gentleman 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.610
 in short the people there who are on the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.599
 plates like that flying and who 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.730
 get the ball so we see it happens 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.470
 species of those and then we see the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.319
 lava that drips a little below tec 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.099
 is over at terminals two to 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.590
 on it so I write watteau 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:05.700
 then we see you below that I 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.280
 see a basic piece that we were going 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.680
 pay who supports the blacks his share 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.239
 wait more then to have isolated I 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.540
 a little lost the hand because there is 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.560
 long time I have not that videos 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.120
 on the other hand I did I'm fine 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.260
 amused and I did a lot of construction 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.420
 so here we actually have windows of 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.760
 floor to ceiling windows and actually when there is a 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.920
 eruption with the moon strong eruptions 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.950
 that's protective panels that 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.150
 folds and here it protects the windows 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.180
 even if it's books that resist 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.739
 heat is not left to the lava 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.060
 here so the catwalk going down 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.060
 then blah 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.280
 where we come here are barriers 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.400
 to guide the path that he brings here 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.440
 attack 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.200
 so we arrive in the room where anakin to 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.380
 everyone the wat tambor convoy of 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.740
 indes listening 1,2 of the droids equality 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.910
 droid droid we see orders from the 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.380
 everything to handle the power 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.990
 so that's the orders that will be 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.640
 destroyed so the base to perth in 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.870
 shield so this part the year is 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.670
 not above the laddh bar 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.360
 so not cool in the local language 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.450
 and save the table so we drink only at 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.850
 click around the pipes 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.720
 crates so here I like that word 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.710
 it's pretty good 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.320
 except that it's pretty similar 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.340
 other stuff to show you but I 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.230
 wanted to show in another video 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.110
 which shows a little thing that I have 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.210
 does that nothing to see that star wars is 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.720
 the group of muse in lego locution the 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.010

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.820
 a little sore throat
