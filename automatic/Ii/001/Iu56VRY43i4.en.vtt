00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.150
 how are dear friends welcome to 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.590
 A new chapter by Juan Pedro TV Les 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.210
 I tell you that we are happy and very 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.920
 grateful with the number of visits 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.990
 I like it in the comments and all 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.270
 It is always grateful and it makes us very very 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.540
 ok but without drawing a lot of people 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.400
 on the street that the world is divided like this 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.630
 is the smart people who are the ones 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.580
 is on youtube watching videos in this 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.930
 moment and there are people who do not have that 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.190
 luck and that is suddenly on the street 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.140
 who thinks that the only way to 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.390
 Learn to have fun or learn is the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.120
 television so we decided to go to 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.100
 present to these people the existence 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.390
 of channel 8 the only problem is that one 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.339
 I said walking down the street and saw a 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.379
 truck as a delegate that had 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.929
 information from a picture of the pigeon 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.940
 daniel valenzuela on his son program 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.989
 imagine that nervous out there and 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.390
 unfortunately we do not have that 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.640
 budget but if we have ideas and 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.100
 desire to do something different 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.780
 let's start for our device 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.340
 advertising and today we are going to 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.670
 need a portal of this style 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.390
 a polerón or any jacket that 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.190
 let's not use maybe 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.170
 A sheet of paper 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.170
 a cardboard and glue 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.240
 first we place the carrier and stops in 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.330
 the table and we folded the paper a little bit 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.940
 smaller than the center space 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.140
 then we cut the paper size of the 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.140
 back of the polerón 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:40.590
 we cut and seal the portal we place 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.979
 glue around the ipad port 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.799
 Then it is attached inside the portal 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.189
 polerón and we are ready to go to 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.189
 prove it 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.820
 we are already in the place of 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.729
 facts and we have our beloved polerón 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.130
 with the portal and because we put it 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.180
 we have our ipad with the video that 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.560
 we need 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.539
 we were editing a promotional video 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.880
 of channel 8 that we are going to place here 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.080
 helmet for safety and our bought 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.360
 so you can see how 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.739
 it works I'm going to place it inside the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.940
 polerón that is also very simple 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.790
 because being located back there 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.310
 simply drop and appear by 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.090
 the other side 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.720
 the ipad in its correct position if I 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.120
 I'm going to put the polerón 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.980
 let's give play to our advertising 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.390
 and let's see if it turns out and more people 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.380
 you have the possibility to know that in 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.710
 the 8 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.710
 cl 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.959

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.209

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.380

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.090
