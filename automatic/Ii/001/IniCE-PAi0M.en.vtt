usually one my skin basically gets
drained<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.420> its<00:00:06.750> radiance<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.560> glow<00:00:07.620> my<00:00:08.340> skin

really much of a blush type person and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.789 
really much of a blush type person and
the<00:01:03.420> reason<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.899> because<00:01:04.080> my<00:01:04.229> face<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.470> so
