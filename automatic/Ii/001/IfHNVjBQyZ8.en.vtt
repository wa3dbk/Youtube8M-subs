00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hi everyone! Welcome to another video. 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.290
 Classroom teacher andré 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.290
 Today I'm going to teach you five tips for 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.590
 to lower the temperature of your computer 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.809
 ok the first tip is the following if 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.170
 possible leave your computer 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.090
 on the table away from the floor 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.300
 Closer Your Computer 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.539
 Your office was not even on the floor. 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.210
 the less the ventilation and more dust 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.480
 will accumulate inside it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.790
 so if you have a table and if possible 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.960
 Can you leave your office? 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.260
 your computer 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.820
 on the table next to the monitor is 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.370
 better will have an average will have a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.899
 greater air circulation and will enter - 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.430
 dust 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.840
 The second tip is the following does not leave the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:59.480
 your computer is near the windows where 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.879
 the sun he hit has had hiv cases in 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.040
 offices and homes of people who 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.189
 computer it is near the window 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.580
 where the sun is shining and when the window is 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.810
 open without blind routine the sun and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.900
 debate about the source of the computer ends 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.540
 increasing the temperature of 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.259
 function of the computer source 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.400
 this can cause a problem and in the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.979
 your computer 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.770
 The third tip is for you to change the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.720
 thermal paste of your processor 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:40.320
 then do this maintenance is the folder 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.700
 thermal if you make the exchange of it you 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.549
 there may be one to two years arrived 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.770
 There's always something to worry about. 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.619
 anyway people who leave up to three years 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.200
 however it depends a lot on the use of the temperature 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.100
 that contemplates will receive pipe she goes 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.500
 being petrified the fourth tip to 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.189
 you do a cleaning on the cullers 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.810
 you have is the processor's 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.929
 font cabinet 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.250
 you can use a brush or air 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.440
 for those who have is the computer itself 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.190
 picasa leave a student of mine to say that 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.230
 his father was driving at the gas station and 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.880
 used the car tire filling business 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.160
 to clean your computer 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.650
 I know if it was true but I gave a lot 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.530
 laughter when he told me this 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.510
 The fifth and last tip is you enter the 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.060
 bios in the setup of your computer and 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.410
 search there for the hardware monitor option 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.620
 is power hardware prpc eto'o status for 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.959
 check the temperature and rotation of 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.239
 Process cooler will search temperature 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.350
 Motherboard Processor Motherboard 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.900
 she stays on average is between 40 and 50 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.570
 degrees and depending on the processor of 40 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.480
 at 60 degrees and the culé depends a lot on the 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.989
 type of cure an average of 2,000 have 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.230
 cooler that's 3 thousand anyway you need 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.600
 manufacturer's model for 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.370
 to know any temperature 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.870
 the equipment it works then they are 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.670
 five tips 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.760
 there are many times in your home you may be 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:21.470
 This is happening in the case of the first 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.570
 tip is to take your computer to let 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.940
 on the table leave very close to the 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.670
 floor in the second case of the window then 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.820
 there are things that often happen with 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.769
 But we do not even touch it. 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.380
 hour later when the problem is you 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.930
 think you find out that it was 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.940
 what caused the problem your 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.090
 computer or the temperature is 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.560
 Thank you so much for your attention. 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.660
 I did not like to help the channel. 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.310

 participates leaving the comment there I
