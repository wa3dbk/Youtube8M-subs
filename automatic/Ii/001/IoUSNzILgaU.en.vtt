jittery<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.300> recruiting<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.140> they

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
jittery is the recruiting and they

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
jittery is the recruiting and they
haven't<00:00:31.529> exploded<00:00:31.980> yet<00:00:32.489> which<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.030> good

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
haven't exploded yet which is a good

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.319 
haven't exploded yet which is a good
thing<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.320> these<00:00:34.730> battery<00:00:35.730> box<00:00:35.880> are<00:00:36.059> filling

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
thing and these battery box are filling

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.350 
thing and these battery box are filling
up<00:00:36.420> pretty<00:00:37.410> slowly<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.460> I'm<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.059> still

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
up pretty slowly what I'm it but still

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.060 
up pretty slowly what I'm it but still
filling<00:00:39.629> up<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.730> I<00:00:41.730> decided<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:43.290> want

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
filling up and I decided that I want

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.279 
filling up and I decided that I want
some<00:00:44.250> wind<00:00:44.399> turbines<00:00:44.910> they're<00:00:45.750> also<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
some wind turbines they're also on the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.000 
some wind turbines they're also on the
game<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.890> far<00:00:47.510> if<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.660> show<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.930> all<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.440> forms

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
game so far if I show you all the forms

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.910 
game so far if I show you all the forms
and<00:00:50.370> different<00:00:50.489> things<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.210> power<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.920> it'll

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and different things of power and it'll

and different things of power and it'll
help<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.430> along<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.600> you'll<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.870> able<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
help you along but and you'll be able to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.869 
help you along but and you'll be able to
get<00:00:55.289> more<00:00:55.410> energy<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.980> more<00:00:56.070> power<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.820> few

get more energy and more power a few
machines<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.230> yeah<00:00:58.410> today<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.850> show

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
machines so yeah today I'm going to show

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.450 
machines so yeah today I'm going to show
you<00:01:00.059> how<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> make<00:01:01.050> wind<00:01:01.379> turbines<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.219> make

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
you how to make wind turbines to make

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.649 
you how to make wind turbines to make
the<00:01:02.579> wind<00:01:02.730> turbine<00:01:03.680> you<00:01:04.680> need<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:06.390> energy

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the wind turbine you need to energy

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.890 
the wind turbine you need to energy
tablets<00:01:06.840> which<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:10.670> three<00:01:11.670> gold<00:01:11.939> fallouts

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
tablets which are three gold fallouts

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.899 
tablets which are three gold fallouts
down<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.710> enriched<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.280> lie<00:01:14.460> which<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
down and to enriched a lie which you

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.350 
down and to enriched a lie which you
mate<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> redstone<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:17.150> then<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
mate with I in a redstone and then a

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.030 
mate with I in a redstone and then a
control<00:01:18.869> circuit<00:01:20.060> which<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.920> enriched<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
control circuit which is enriched a

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.590 
control circuit which is enriched a
light<00:01:23.280> surrounded<00:01:24.060> by<00:01:24.210> ahs<00:01:24.720> minium<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:27.360> also

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
light surrounded by ahs minium you also

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.980 
light surrounded by ahs minium you also
need<00:01:27.780> an<00:01:27.990> enriched<00:01:28.439> ally<00:01:29.000> in<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.329> center<00:01:30.960> of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
need an enriched ally in the center of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.300 
need an enriched ally in the center of
the<00:01:31.290> turbine<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:33.320> three<00:01:34.320> oz<00:01:34.590> minium

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the turbine and then three oz minium

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.050 
the turbine and then three oz minium
Inga's<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.210> i'll<00:01:36.329> show<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.540> how<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.659> make<00:01:36.750> it

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.969 

so<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.150> say<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.360> make<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.020> stick<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
so they say you make it a stick the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.080 
so they say you make it a stick the
energy<00:01:44.670> tablets<00:01:44.850> either<00:01:45.659> side<00:01:46.490> then<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
energy tablets either side then the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.620 
energy tablets either side then the
three<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:51.079> what<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.170> call<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:53.000> osmium<00:01:54.000> inga

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
three a what you call it and osmium inga

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.969 
three a what you call it and osmium inga
it's<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.840> key<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.259> forget<00:01:55.500> i<00:01:55.619> also<00:01:55.799> look

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
it's a key I just forget i also look

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.630 
it's a key I just forget i also look
like<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> platinum<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.090> because<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.689> gym<00:01:58.640> what

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
like a platinum so because the gym what

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.980 
like a platinum so because the gym what
used<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.030> obviously<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.689> used<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> be

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
used to be obviously it used to be

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.280 
used to be obviously it used to be
platinum<00:02:01.219> so<00:02:02.219> confused<00:02:02.729> me<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> bit<00:02:03.140> yeah<00:02:04.140> this

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
platinum so confused me a bit yeah this

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.749 
platinum so confused me a bit yeah this
is<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> wind<00:02:04.649> turbine<00:02:04.799> where<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.460> still<00:02:05.640> looks

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
is a wind turbine where it still looks

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.760 
is a wind turbine where it still looks
cool<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:05.969> my<00:02:06.119> hand<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:07.200> yeah<00:02:07.350> i<00:02:07.560> was<00:02:07.740> thinking

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
cool in my hand so yeah i was thinking

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.130 
cool in my hand so yeah i was thinking
the<00:02:08.520> reason<00:02:08.759> why<00:02:08.849> i<00:02:08.879> decided<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.840> make<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the reason why i decided to make the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.570 
the reason why i decided to make the
wind<00:02:10.319> turbines<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.950> episode<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.489> because

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
wind turbines this episode is because

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.540 
wind turbines this episode is because
this<00:02:12.970> old<00:02:13.210> generate<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> cool<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.350> all<00:02:14.550> this

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
advanced old generator cool now but i

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.470 
advanced old generator cool now but i
want<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.950> show<00:02:18.100> you<00:02:18.130> different<00:02:18.550> forms<00:02:19.180> power

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
want to show you different forms power

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.330 
want to show you different forms power
kite<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:20.350> show<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.560> how<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.920> make<00:02:21.160> like

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
kite just show you how to make like

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.430 
kite just show you how to make like
millions<00:02:21.760> solar<00:02:22.360> generators<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:23.080> yeah<00:02:23.290> if

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
millions solar generators so yeah if

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.340 
millions solar generators so yeah if
stick<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:23.710> here<00:02:23.770> oh<00:02:24.160> my<00:02:24.880> god<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.120> huge<00:02:27.180> through

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
stick this here oh my god a huge through

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.250 
stick this here oh my god a huge through
can<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.380> wire<00:02:29.650> under<00:02:30.100> if<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.370> wire<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.580> up

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
can I wire under if I can wire it up

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.250 
can I wire under if I can wire it up
like<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.950> don't<00:02:33.340> like<00:02:33.400> this<00:02:34.110> will<00:02:35.110> it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
like this I don't like this will it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.450 
like this I don't like this will it
break<00:02:35.500> easily<00:02:37.140> oh<00:02:38.670> my<00:02:39.670> god<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:41.370> filling<00:02:42.370> up

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
break easily oh my god is filling up

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.660 
break easily oh my god is filling up
fast<00:02:42.520> so<00:02:43.270> this<00:02:44.230> reason<00:02:44.560> also<00:02:44.800> why<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.070> midwinter

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
fast so this reason also why I midwinter

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.950 
fast so this reason also why I midwinter
bad<00:02:45.850> because<00:02:46.180> they<00:02:46.390> will<00:02:46.540> work<00:02:46.810> during<00:02:47.710> the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
bad because they will work during the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.640 
bad because they will work during the
night<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.510> make<00:02:52.720> wind<00:02:52.959> turbine<00:02:53.410> I

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
night so this is I make wind turbine I

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.920 
night so this is I make wind turbine I
don't<00:02:54.070> know<00:02:54.250> if<00:02:54.370> I'm<00:02:54.580> stick<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.209> not<00:02:55.630> close

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
don't know if I'm stick and not close

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.990 
don't know if I'm stick and not close
together<00:02:56.170> but<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.620> can<00:02:56.800> have<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> look<00:02:57.190> really

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
together but I can have a look really

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.370 
together but I can have a look really
quickly<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.690> I<00:03:00.180> wait<00:03:01.180> sorry<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.080> is<00:03:02.260> the

quickly and I wait sorry this is the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.340 
quickly and I wait sorry this is the
hotel<00:03:02.650> properly<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.459> just<00:03:06.810> if<00:03:07.810> i<00:03:07.930> hook<00:03:08.080> it<00:03:08.230> up

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
hotel properly if I just if i hook it up

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.100 
hotel properly if I just if i hook it up
stretch<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.830> means<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.610> might<00:03:10.000> hopefully<00:03:10.780> not

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
stretch it means it might hopefully not

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.540 
stretch it means it might hopefully not
explode<00:03:12.060> we'll<00:03:13.060> soon<00:03:13.209> find<00:03:13.330> out<00:03:13.800> hey<00:03:14.800> hasn't

exploded there we go and so yeah i'll
quickly<00:03:20.410> make<00:03:21.340> another<00:03:21.640> one<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.920> I'll<00:03:23.920> be

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
quickly make another one and I'll be

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.729 
quickly make another one and I'll be
right<00:03:24.160> back<00:03:24.280> hello<00:03:25.000> everyone<00:03:25.360> I'm<00:03:25.540> back<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.110> I

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
right back hello everyone I'm back and I

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.130 
right back hello everyone I'm back and I
had<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> lot<00:03:27.519> of<00:03:27.580> gold<00:03:27.850> luckily<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:28.900> was<00:03:29.019> able

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
had a lot of gold luckily so I was able

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.070 
had a lot of gold luckily so I was able
to<00:03:29.440> make<00:03:29.620> five<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.730> we<00:03:31.420> have<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.690> do<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> lot

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
to make five and we have to do a lot

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.870 
to make five and we have to do a lot
more<00:03:32.140> mining<00:03:32.620> now<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.040> used<00:03:33.640> on<00:03:33.760> the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
more mining now that I used on the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.810 
more mining now that I used on the
golden<00:03:34.180> wind<00:03:34.360> turbines<00:03:34.780> but<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:35.580> think<00:03:36.580> that

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
golden wind turbines but I think that

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.320 
golden wind turbines but I think that
it's<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:38.070> very<00:03:39.070> valuable<00:03:39.489> resource<00:03:40.450> to<00:03:40.690> use<00:03:42.330> the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
it's a very valuable resource to use the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.720 
it's a very valuable resource to use the
you<00:03:43.510> guys<00:03:43.630> who<00:03:43.750> use<00:03:43.930> these<00:03:44.650> up<00:03:45.070> these<00:03:45.400> actually

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
you guys who use these up these actually

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.199 
you guys who use these up these actually
are<00:03:45.790> full<00:03:46.090> though<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:47.530> i<00:03:47.560> might<00:03:47.800> have<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.209> make

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
are full though so i might have to make

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.350 
are full though so i might have to make
some<00:03:49.269> our<00:03:49.540> battery<00:03:49.810> boxes<00:03:50.170> but<00:03:51.239> let's<00:03:52.239> see

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
some our battery boxes but let's see

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.810 
some our battery boxes but let's see
these<00:03:52.600> go<00:03:53.140> next<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.530> ah<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.610> new<00:03:54.730> go

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
these go next to it ah so the new go

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:02.100 
these go next to it ah so the new go
next<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.090> each<00:03:55.209> other<00:03:55.300> so<00:03:55.540> they're<00:03:55.780> even<00:04:01.110> let

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
next to each other so they're even let

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.630 
next to each other so they're even let
me<00:04:02.200> say<00:04:02.380> now

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.520 

the<00:04:05.210> reason<00:04:05.510> they're<00:04:05.690> a<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:06.170> can<00:04:06.290> actually

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
the reason they're a you can actually

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.460 
the reason they're a you can actually
put<00:04:06.680> lock<00:04:06.830> together<00:04:07.040> so<00:04:07.490> the<00:04:07.580> more<00:04:08.470> efficient

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
put lock together so the more efficient

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.930 
put lock together so the more efficient
in<00:04:10.150> space<00:04:11.150> wise<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:11.870> so<00:04:12.800> here<00:04:13.069> I've<00:04:13.430> got<00:04:13.490> a<00:04:13.819> lot

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
in space wise and so here I've got a lot

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.140 
in space wise and so here I've got a lot
of<00:04:13.970> space<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:14.510> want<00:04:14.660> in<00:04:14.810> like<00:04:15.020> wind<00:04:15.230> turbines

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
of space you want in like wind turbines

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.520 
of space you want in like wind turbines
they're<00:04:17.410> pretty<00:04:18.519> cool<00:04:19.870> not<00:04:20.870> all<00:04:21.290> because

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
they're pretty cool not all because

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.940 
they're pretty cool not all because
they're<00:04:21.709> pretty<00:04:22.040> cool<00:04:22.220> and<00:04:23.770> I'm<00:04:24.770> probably

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
they're pretty cool and I'm probably

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.900 
they're pretty cool and I'm probably
going<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.220> play<00:04:25.370> some<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.640> other<00:04:25.730> way<00:04:25.880> around

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
going to play some the other way around

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.460 
going to play some the other way around
if<00:04:26.330> it<00:04:26.480> can<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:27.700> can't<00:04:28.900> wow<00:04:29.900> it's<00:04:30.110> pushing<00:04:30.290> me<00:04:30.440> up

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
let's go around here so yeah stick this

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.490 
let's go around here so yeah stick this
in<00:04:45.020> there<00:04:45.260> and<00:04:46.190> I'll<00:04:46.760> move<00:04:46.970> these<00:04:47.180> two<00:04:47.360> around

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
in there and I'll move these two around

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.270 
in there and I'll move these two around
between<00:04:48.500> episodes<00:04:48.940> but<00:04:49.940> yeah<00:04:50.919> that's<00:04:51.919> it<00:04:52.100> for

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
between episodes but yeah that's it for

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.370 
between episodes but yeah that's it for
wind<00:04:52.430> turbines<00:04:52.850> that's<00:04:53.720> how<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:53.870> make<00:04:54.110> them

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
wind turbines that's how you make them

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.820 
wind turbines that's how you make them
and<00:04:55.750> they<00:04:56.750> are<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:57.110> have<00:04:57.200> to<00:04:57.350> do<00:04:57.440> is<00:04:57.530> like<00:04:57.650> hook

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
and they are you have to do is like hook

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.760 
and they are you have to do is like hook
them<00:04:57.950> up<00:04:58.070> why<00:04:58.430> is<00:04:58.490> that<00:05:02.290> I'll<00:05:03.290> try<00:05:03.440> doing<00:05:03.680> that

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
them up why is that I'll try doing that

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.990 
them up why is that I'll try doing that
what<00:05:06.340> mine<00:05:07.340> yeah<00:05:08.210> and<00:05:08.950> then<00:05:09.950> are<00:05:10.430> so<00:05:10.820> they<00:05:10.910> have

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
what mine yeah and then are so they have

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.940 
what mine yeah and then are so they have
to<00:05:11.090> be<00:05:11.150> hooked<00:05:11.270> up<00:05:11.419> the<00:05:11.540> front<00:05:11.810> way<00:05:11.990> so<00:05:12.800> that's

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
to be hooked up the front way so that's

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.250 
to be hooked up the front way so that's
something<00:05:13.190> I'll<00:05:13.720> that<00:05:14.720> you<00:05:14.990> need<00:05:15.140> to<00:05:15.200> remember

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
something I'll that you need to remember

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.650 
something I'll that you need to remember
the<00:05:16.190> wire<00:05:16.400> has<00:05:16.610> to<00:05:16.700> go<00:05:16.790> at<00:05:16.880> the<00:05:16.940> front<00:05:17.240> so<00:05:17.540> I'm

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
the wire has to go at the front so I'm

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.850 
the wire has to go at the front so I'm
gonna<00:05:17.750> have<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:17.960> change<00:05:18.140> these<00:05:18.440> around

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
gonna have to change these around

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.400 
gonna have to change these around
actually<00:05:19.250> and<00:05:19.570> so<00:05:20.570> yeah<00:05:20.750> I<00:05:21.020> change<00:05:21.290> them

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
actually and so yeah I change them

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.710 
actually and so yeah I change them
around<00:05:21.470> between<00:05:22.130> episodes<00:05:22.430> but<00:05:23.270> yeah<00:05:23.419> make

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
around between episodes but yeah make

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.900 
around between episodes but yeah make
sure<00:05:23.750> that<00:05:24.169> the<00:05:24.229> wire<00:05:24.440> is<00:05:24.770> plugged<00:05:25.490> into<00:05:25.640> the

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
sure that the wire is plugged into the

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.240 
sure that the wire is plugged into the
front<00:05:26.180> and<00:05:26.419> then<00:05:26.990> they<00:05:27.200> will<00:05:27.410> prove<00:05:27.770> power<00:05:27.979> for

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
front and then they will prove power for

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.980 
front and then they will prove power for
you<00:05:28.370> so<00:05:29.090> yeah<00:05:29.270> that's<00:05:29.479> wind<00:05:29.780> turbines<00:05:30.290> and

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
you so yeah that's wind turbines and

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.520 
you so yeah that's wind turbines and
this<00:05:32.990> episode<00:05:33.290> just<00:05:33.380> finish<00:05:33.680> up<00:05:33.770> one<00:05:34.070> just<00:05:34.250> to

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
this episode just finish up one just to

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.440 
this episode just finish up one just to
teach<00:05:36.530> you<00:05:36.560> a<00:05:36.770> bit<00:05:37.190> more<00:05:37.220> about<00:05:37.580> energies<00:05:38.180> in

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
teach you a bit more about energies in

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.930 
teach you a bit more about energies in
different<00:05:38.840> ways<00:05:39.680> you<00:05:39.740> can<00:05:40.160> power<00:05:40.910> your

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
different ways you can power your

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.380 
different ways you can power your
factory<00:05:41.830> because<00:05:42.850> later<00:05:43.850> on<00:05:43.940> you<00:05:44.180> can<00:05:44.270> have

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
factory because later on you can have

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.270 
factory because later on you can have
more<00:05:44.540> more<00:05:45.200> and<00:05:45.320> more<00:05:45.500> advanced<00:05:45.919> machinery

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
more more and more advanced machinery

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.909 
more more and more advanced machinery
which<00:05:46.940> needs<00:05:47.690> more<00:05:47.930> of<00:05:47.960> our<00:05:48.110> power<00:05:48.289> so<00:05:48.710> the

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
which needs more of our power so the

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.440 
which needs more of our power so the
more<00:05:49.100> energy<00:05:49.190> is<00:05:49.430> that<00:05:49.580> you<00:05:49.669> can<00:05:49.820> use<00:05:50.060> and<00:05:50.270> more

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
more energy is that you can use and more

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.719 
more energy is that you can use and more
of<00:05:50.570> these<00:05:50.660> you<00:05:50.840> can<00:05:50.990> build<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:52.280> better<00:05:52.490> for

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
of these you can build the better for

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:59.260 
of these you can build the better for
you<00:05:52.789> and<00:05:55.300> yeah<00:05:57.010> thanks<00:05:58.010> for<00:05:58.039> watching<00:05:58.669> hit
