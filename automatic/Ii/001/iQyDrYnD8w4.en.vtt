and use the paint tool to make the paint

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.879 
and use the paint tool to make the paint
tool<00:00:11.849> itself<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:13.019> need<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.440> robotic

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
tool itself you need the robotic

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.919 
tool itself you need the robotic
crafting<00:00:14.309> table<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.790> here<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.480> can<00:00:15.660> see<00:00:15.809> it's

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
crafting table and here you can see it's

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.140 
crafting table and here you can see it's
recipe<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> yellow<00:00:16.890> blue<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.340> red<00:00:17.640> dye<00:00:17.910> all

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
recipe is a yellow blue and red dye all

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.390 
recipe is a yellow blue and red dye all
of<00:00:18.570> which<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:18.840> create<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.439> titanium

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
of which you can create and titanium

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.120 
of which you can create and titanium
panels<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:21.060> course<00:00:21.359> which<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.689> can<00:00:21.869> create

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
panels of course which you can create

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.710 
panels of course which you can create
titanium<00:00:23.130> itself<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.730> found<00:00:24.000> most<00:00:24.240> commonly

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
titanium itself is found most commonly

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.630 
titanium itself is found most commonly
on<00:00:24.869> gamma<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.350> Delta<00:00:25.710> sectors<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.369> any

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
on gamma and Delta sectors and any

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.240 
on gamma and Delta sectors and any
sector<00:00:27.090> after<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.500> also<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.920> Alpha

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
sector after that and it's also on Alpha

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.009 
sector after that and it's also on Alpha
and<00:00:29.340> Beta<00:00:29.429> sectors<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.210> not<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.570> very<00:00:30.750> large

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
and Beta sectors but not in very large

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.470 
and Beta sectors but not in very large
quantities<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.759> probably<00:00:33.059> better<00:00:33.360> to

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
quantities so it's probably better to

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.229 
quantities so it's probably better to
find<00:00:33.719> out<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.960> gamma<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.320> Delta<00:00:34.590> sectors<00:00:35.239> and

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
find out in gamma and Delta sectors and

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.729 
find out in gamma and Delta sectors and
then<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.600> make<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.870> titanium<00:00:37.380> panel's

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
then to make the titanium panel's

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.310 
then to make the titanium panel's
themselves<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.700> need<00:00:38.879> titanium<00:00:39.570> bars<00:00:39.840> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
themselves you need titanium bars and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.530 
themselves you need titanium bars and
each<00:00:41.010> one<00:00:41.250> makes<00:00:41.460> three<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.030> time<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.510> that

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
each one makes three at a time so that

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.510 
each one makes three at a time so that
means<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.899> would<00:00:43.020> need<00:00:43.170> seven<00:00:43.649> titanium<00:00:44.250> bars

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
means you would need seven titanium bars

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.310 
means you would need seven titanium bars
and<00:00:45.770> titanium<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:47.149> the<00:00:48.149> order<00:00:48.450> itself<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.260> you

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
and titanium is the order itself so you

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.340 
and titanium is the order itself so you
just<00:00:49.559> smelt<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:51.000> every<00:00:51.360> two<00:00:51.600> pieces

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
just smelt it and it's every two pieces

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.529 
just smelt it and it's every two pieces
of<00:00:52.379> or<00:00:52.590> makes<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.129> bar<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.120> take<00:00:54.390> those

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
of or makes one bar so you take those

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.799 
of or makes one bar so you take those
seven<00:00:54.870> bars<00:00:55.190> pop<00:00:56.190> them<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.910> make

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
seven bars pop them in here make

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.950 
seven bars pop them in here make
yourself<00:00:57.840> some<00:00:58.350> titanium<00:00:58.649> panels<00:00:59.480> and<00:01:00.480> there

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
yourself some titanium panels and there

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.709 
yourself some titanium panels and there
you<00:01:01.079> go<00:01:01.109> as<00:01:01.410> far<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you go as far as that is now I think the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.760 
you go as far as that is now I think the
dyes<00:01:04.129> themselves<00:01:05.129> are<00:01:05.400> not<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
dyes themselves are not on there so the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.649 
dyes themselves are not on there so the
dye<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.240> over<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
dye is going to be over here on the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.030 
dye is going to be over here on the
robotic<00:01:09.990> crafting<00:01:10.320> table<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.619> guess<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.890> should

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
robotic crafting table I guess I should

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.740 
robotic crafting table I guess I should
have<00:01:11.130> guessed<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.400> then<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.390> requires

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
have guessed that then they requires

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.920 
have guessed that then they requires
glass<00:01:13.200> blocks<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.979> 15<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:15.000> their<00:01:15.299> respective

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
glass blocks and 15 of their respective

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.660 
glass blocks and 15 of their respective
petals<00:01:16.380> you're<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> find<00:01:17.250> those<00:01:17.430> really

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
petals you're going to find those really

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.600 
petals you're going to find those really
commonly<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.299> grasslands<00:01:19.220> mostly<00:01:20.220> grasslands

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
commonly on grasslands mostly grasslands

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.190 
commonly on grasslands mostly grasslands
your<00:01:20.790> confinement<00:01:21.030> forest<00:01:21.600> sometimes<00:01:21.990> too

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
your confinement forest sometimes too

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.530 
your confinement forest sometimes too
and<00:01:22.439> jungles<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.939> find<00:01:24.180> them<00:01:24.330> really

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and jungles but you find them really

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.630 
and jungles but you find them really
dominantly<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.320> grasslands<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.979> then<00:01:26.400> glass

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
dominantly in grasslands and then glass

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.140 
dominantly in grasslands and then glass
blocks<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.630> from<00:01:27.960> smelting<00:01:28.740> fine<00:01:29.700> sand

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
blocks is just from smelting fine sand

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.929 
blocks is just from smelting fine sand
has<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.659> fine<00:01:30.900> sand<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.950> also<00:01:32.220> find

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
has to be fine sand you can also find

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.260 
has to be fine sand you can also find
petals<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.079> dies<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:35.189> chests<00:01:35.970> pretty

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
petals and dies in chests pretty

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.649 
petals and dies in chests pretty
commonly<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> now<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.030> part<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.509> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
commonly so now to the part that you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.020 
commonly so now to the part that you
guys<00:01:39.900> actually<00:01:40.140> care<00:01:40.590> about<00:01:40.729> making<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
guys actually care about making the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.760 
guys actually care about making the
paint<00:01:42.210> tool<00:01:42.390> itself<00:01:42.750> once<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.409> got<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:43.619> your

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
paint tool itself once you got all your

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.319 
paint tool itself once you got all your
components<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.700> make<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> paint<00:01:45.180> tool

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
components you just make the paint tool

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.710 
components you just make the paint tool
at<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:46.200> point<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:48.149> tool<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.420> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
at that point it is just a tool that you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.710 
at that point it is just a tool that you
now<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.439> right-click<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.240> see<00:01:51.270> i

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
now can right-click and as you can see i

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.830 
now can right-click and as you can see i
get<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> colorful<00:01:52.860> beam<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:54.240> beam<00:01:54.540> is

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
get a colorful beam and that beam is

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.450
