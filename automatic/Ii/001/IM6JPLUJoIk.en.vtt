actually a way to achieving this by

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.640 
actually a way to achieving this by
using<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.640> following<00:03:31.850> process<00:03:32.380> once<00:03:33.380> in<00:03:33.560> the

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
doors then turn left

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.710

proceeding onwards Mario needs to
perform<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.040> necessary<00:03:46.340> glitch<00:03:47.120> within<00:03:47.540> this

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
perform the necessary glitch within this

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.930 
perform the necessary glitch within this
stairway<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.590> objective<00:03:49.100> is<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.310> make<00:03:49.580> Mario

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
stairway the objective is to make Mario

stairway the objective is to make Mario
jump<00:03:50.300> high<00:03:50.510> enough<00:03:50.540> so<00:03:51.110> that<00:03:51.140> he<00:03:51.260> hits<00:03:51.710> the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
jump high enough so that he hits the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.370 
jump high enough so that he hits the
ceiling<00:03:52.340> above<00:03:52.460> but<00:03:53.210> which<00:03:53.360> also<00:03:53.630> causes<00:03:54.350> a

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
ceiling above but which also causes a

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.380 
ceiling above but which also causes a
glitch<00:03:54.710> allowing<00:03:55.160> Mario<00:03:55.550> to<00:03:55.640> grab<00:03:56.060> onto<00:03:56.240> a

there<00:03:59.600> are<00:03:59.750> numerous<00:04:00.110> ways<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.650> achieving

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
there are numerous ways to achieving

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.130 
there are numerous ways to achieving
this<00:04:01.250> maneuver<00:04:01.760> but<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.060> best<00:04:02.330> way<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.510> find<00:04:02.930> is

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
this maneuver but the best way I find is

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.040 
this maneuver but the best way I find is
to<00:04:03.380> one<00:04:03.950> make<00:04:04.430> sure<00:04:04.610> Mario<00:04:05.060> is<00:04:05.360> facing<00:04:05.870> down

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
to one make sure Mario is facing down

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.130 
to one make sure Mario is facing down
the<00:04:06.200> staircase<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:07.070> -<00:04:07.550> Mario<00:04:08.360> must<00:04:08.600> perform<00:04:09.020> a

the staircase and - Mario must perform a

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.930 
the staircase and - Mario must perform a
double<00:04:09.500> jump<00:04:09.710> as<00:04:09.950> close<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.490> the<00:04:10.580> wall<00:04:10.730> as

double jump as close to the wall as

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.360 
double jump as close to the wall as
possible<00:04:11.420> which<00:04:12.020> in<00:04:12.230> turn<00:04:12.560> should<00:04:13.040> allow

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
possible which in turn should allow

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.790 
possible which in turn should allow
