00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.769
 well this video will be unboxing and 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.679
 first view of samsung galaxy s 5 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.139
 since a few years ago samsung 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.810
 presents each spring what will be its 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.300
 flagship phone of the year and after 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.000
 a long wait finally managed to make me 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.119
 of this long-awaited phone the samsung 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.820
 galaxy s 5 and how will this be only om 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.309
 boxing and first sight try to do it 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.350
 as fast and as concise as possible because 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.320
 complete review will occur in the future 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.750
 video the device box has not 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.170
 changed a lot compared to his 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.850
 predecessor the samsung galaxy s 4 like 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.340
 can observe is a very 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.380
 elegant which evokes us to think about 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.230
 nature due to its surface 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.030
 similar to the wood in the front 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.460
 we only have the name of 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.309
 product and we can also appreciate a 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.500
 number 5 quite large and in the part 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.719
 back we have specifications 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.509
 phone techniques just like 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.430
 information related to it so 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.649
 no more time to waste let's go 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.390
 direct to l'homme boxing when opening the 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.389
 box first with what we come across 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.310
 is with the quick use manual which 

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:16.760
 It should be noted that it is based on 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.970
 a paper 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.950
 and it looks and feels a lot of quality 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.870
 nothing momentous but I mention it 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.720
 because when a product is of quality 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.690
 this is noticeable in every aspect from its 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.970
 packing up your user manual after 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.060
 we found the star of the show in 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.430
 samsung galaxy s 5 how can you see this 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.040
 it is the white color and at first sight the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.600
 phone looks great now I'll put it 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.640
 momentarily to one side to 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.190
 show them everything else that includes 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.800
 box first we came across the card 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.770

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.780

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.940

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.550

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.740

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.800
 all the team of it and see ' latino 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.260
 then we found another manual more to the 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.119
 same as the equipment warranty and in the 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.209
 final part of the box we have the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.150
 classic items the usb cable to micro 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.180
 usb to charge the phone the charger 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.610
 wall-mounted hearing aids and battery 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.980
 device which in this case is of 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.720
 2800 milliamps 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.049
 and this is basically all that 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.450
 includes the box returning to the galaxy s 5 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.549
 this feels very good in the hand and 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.860
 while I install the battery and do the 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.900
 first fired I will mention you some 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.569
 of the technical specifications more 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.290
 important the processor that gives life to 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.830
 this phone is a qualcomm snapdragon 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.890

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.170
 graphics card is an adreno 330 its 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.980
 RAM is 2 gigabytes and its 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.140
 operating system is android 4.4 point 2 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.049
 kat kit in terms of the screen is 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.950
 refers this is 5.1 inches with a 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:06.530
 full resolution hd which delivers us to 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.170
 432 pixels per inch and as for 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.230
 cameras the front is 2 megapixels and 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.049
 the back is 16 megapixels capable of 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.620
 record video in 4k to 30 frames per 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.049
 second 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.450
 these are just some specifications 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.940
 basic then in the complete review 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.670
 I will touch each of them much more to 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.010
 detail at first impression the performance 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.319
 of the phone is impeccably sum 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.900
 fast and the screen gives us a 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.299
 incredible image quality and how much 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.670
 to design honestly this is totally 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.890
 subjective but personally follows me 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.900
 Seeming to look something cheap in 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.480
 special when we talk about a phone 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.909
 high-end but again I repeat 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.620
 that this is a totally 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:51.530
 subjective and it may be that you will 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.200
 love the design as I mentioned before 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.150
 purpose of this video is only the 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.670
 to unpack the equipment and 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.950
 mention my first impressions 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.959
 so I'll finish this video here and I 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.359
 I will use this phone as my team 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.340
 daily use for a few days to 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.459
 after being able to bring them a complete 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.799
