00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.460
 tuna good profit 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.269
 ok what are we going to need we are going to 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:16.490
 need half onion half paprika 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:19.640
 a jar of mayonnaise of 445 grams a 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.270
 Tuna talk of this is the little the 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.150
 of 140 grams and a teaspoon of 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.920
 vinegar well and the first thing is then 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.070
 place all the mayonnaise 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.829
 this sauce is really easy really 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.899
 that does not make good sense and already with what 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.590
 that all the mayonnaise we proceed to place 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.590
 the tuna 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.910
 to dad 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.790
 the onion should not be placed and I'm going to 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.070
 liquefying all that and I need a little trickle 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.180
 of vinegar 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.750
 like a tablespoon of vinegar 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.750
 and that's it 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.930
 good and now I'm going to proceed to chop the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.170
 paprika try to get a paprika 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.170
 red because it gives more eye candy 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.390
 and they're going to bite it and I'm going to show you 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.460
 how are they going to chop it in very small squares 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.460
 but psychic minima 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.480
 and so but tiny little ones and 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.330
 well I will proceed to place 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.460
 the sauce is a little bit watery because 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.880
 It lacks a fridge but if they put it in the 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.880
 fridge 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.780
 that are used then I will place the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.780
 minced paprika 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.920
 I like to put the paprika 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.840
 because it gives you that crispy in the sauce not 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.909
 there are the clays does not give that other 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.349
 tasty song but if you what 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.869
 they want government they want to place the 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.730
 Do not put it on 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.730
 we started mixing 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.200
 well and here comes the recipe and 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.910
 they saw that it is extremely simple they are 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.740
