00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.910

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.570

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.369

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.939

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.400
 shades of gray today we're going to do the 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.680
 reaction to the trailer is already a bit late 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.260
 then we are already very desperate and 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.629
 darling and this well you already 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.640
 you know how is this they are going to listen to the 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.300
 audio if I can be very brave and 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.910
 put it 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.290
 on the screen and it's down if I put it 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.290
 and if not then nothing else listen 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.460
 and why does not it sound 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.360
 are you ready to boil fetal bieber 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.310
 hastings 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.310
 our reduced 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.250
 as I was 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.180
 hopefully and 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.420
 in hans marketing 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.420
 obviously good 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.170
 aeromar 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.900
 this 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.930
 carol bartz 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.630
 yes sir 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.810
 they give me 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.460
 but 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.580
 I want a man 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.600
 I sincerely good I do not know if I 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.690
 they are still on twitter and I think that post 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.120
 when they released the cast that was not me 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.950
 like that very agreeable in connected I think 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.570
 that nobody sees or gives or less because 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.690
 obviously we would have preferred more 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.180
 firefighter and so on but it was fine already 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.480
 watching the trailer and everything hujole if I 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.630
 I wrote is yes women but the year 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.420
 well I broke point 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:04:01.400
 megas I like it as good so if 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:03.290
 That serious but to the stay no if not no 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.090
 I'm sure I'll investigate them and 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.950
 if not good if I'm going to investigate 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.400
 but I suppose that a thesis very 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.700
 good 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.800
 Dakota is bigger than James or who 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.010
 it seems both bigger and supposed 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.580
 which is the other way around then if it costs me 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.510
 work 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:24.110
 the factions and they look bigger 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:27.500
 friends do not read I think so much now to 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.430
 james yes alone but I also tell you 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.820
 but if I can believe it 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.460
 what he did was natalia but it's not bad 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.260
 I also thought at the same time that 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.490
 you want me to like that session 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:48.700
 the helium paper 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.700
 and obviously I saw it as yes 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.670
 and watching the series and everything else homer 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.400
 I did imagine it more would have been 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.650
 better now he does not ask for the truth 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.900
 it's fine or already seeing the trailer you 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.420
 you see it well 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.310
 but below we are missing now the 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.930
 lighting to me it seemed perfect 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.670
 since we said geography also the 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.640
 photography is perfect 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.800
 good if it's okay since we saw the 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:22.340
 proof indeed we saw the three and 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:25.430
 this and from there yes very well this Monday 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.900
 Monday was the day we were here 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.000
 do not 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.000
 Saturday was Saturday 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.539
 and we are here making the night of 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:40.660
 girls all three and this if there are any pictures 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.660
 and bag we upload it I do not know if we're good 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.400
 rather there is in the parents I have 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.550
 something in my favor ok there are not my favor 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.400
 but I just finished the book 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.370
 crazy determined two hours and save your 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.009
 please good a favor because you have everything 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.530
 cool down because good I did not want it 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.580
 read for bad reviews that there is of 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:06.380
 good internet book 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.419
 then I said no no I do not want to read it 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.430
 but then I saw that he had 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.430
 obsessed with that 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:19.300
 I do not have to read it, I have to know why 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.560
 what are they so obsessed and good 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.370
 you will see it in the book review 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:27.130
 but if you have another expectation of it 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.860
 with I threw him or me saying not equal and 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.470
 I'm not going to like this book 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.930
 many this thing more than finding 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.990
 many together many with points in 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:42.220
 against but I with the trailer I do not know if 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:45.040
 I already know how to see is to see the movie 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:48.340
 and obviously then of books and is now 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:56.470
 I did like it, although there are things that 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:58.660
 are good writing is that is the 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.480
 story and this yes how are you doing 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.060
 hooking then you have to see the 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.620
 good movie I'm going to leave you the 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.950
 link h 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.400
 the video to see the trailer if not 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.400
 they have seen it 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.139
 is fine father and apart because in the 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.059
 book we know that when in all the 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:30.899
 biology in the first book does not come out 

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:33.479
 not so much but no more must be said 

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:35.039
 that in the three books if there are several 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.839
 things and a lot is mentioned to 

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:40.169
 villavicencio then it 's like him 

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:42.149
 like that of art the singer 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:46.939
 favorite of before and for the world 

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:46.939
 be a better place let's leave 

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:56.039
 facebook and inta and twitter of 

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:58.459
 channel here arribita and then it is all not 

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:58.459
 there is only 

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.720
 the delight
