00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.740 
was doing but this time I've got all the
food<00:03:29.079> in<00:03:29.379> and<00:03:29.760> essentially<00:03:30.760> what<00:03:31.329> i'm<00:03:31.420> doing

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
food in and essentially what i'm doing

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.530 
food in and essentially what i'm doing
is<00:03:31.840> i'm<00:03:31.989> going<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.620> go<00:03:32.890> back<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.159> Ian<00:03:33.579> their<00:03:34.299> way

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
is i'm going to go back to Ian their way

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.369 
is i'm going to go back to Ian their way
because<00:03:34.870> it's<00:03:35.019> a<00:03:35.140> more<00:03:35.379> general<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:38.140> diet

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
because it's a more general and the diet

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.390 
because it's a more general and the diet
is<00:03:38.709> far<00:03:39.099> more<00:03:39.390> gentle<00:03:40.390> on<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:41.709> digestive

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
is far more gentle on the digestive

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.229 
is far more gentle on the digestive
system<00:03:44.129> than<00:03:45.129> the<00:03:45.370> one<00:03:45.549> that<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.879> have<00:03:46.000> been

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
system than the one that I have been

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.349 
system than the one that I have been
trying<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.799> indeed<00:03:48.609> actually<00:03:49.030> I've<00:03:49.150> only

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
trying and indeed actually I've only

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.670 
trying and indeed actually I've only
been<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:50.409> it<00:03:50.590> now<00:03:50.799> for<00:03:51.069> a<00:03:51.129> day<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.609> already<00:03:51.730> my

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
been on it now for a day and already my

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.509 
been on it now for a day and already my
digestive<00:03:53.680> system<00:03:54.989> feels<00:03:55.989> more<00:03:56.590> ease<00:03:56.980> there's

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
digestive system feels more ease there's

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.849 
digestive system feels more ease there's
less<00:03:57.670> pain<00:03:58.120> inside<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.900> essentially<00:04:02.530> i'm

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
at least make me feel a little bit

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.650 
at least make me feel a little bit
better<00:05:28.170> I<00:05:29.640> mean<00:05:30.640> as<00:05:30.760> I<00:05:30.850> said<00:05:31.060> earlier<00:05:31.150> it<00:05:31.450> might

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
better I mean as I said earlier it might

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.220 
better I mean as I said earlier it might
start<00:05:32.050> to<00:05:32.170> be<00:05:32.290> the<00:05:32.380> case<00:05:32.590> time<00:05:32.880> I'm<00:05:33.880> very

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
start to be the case time I'm very

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.830 
start to be the case time I'm very
seriously<00:05:35.230> ill<00:05:35.470> now<00:05:35.770> I

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
seriously ill now I

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.890 
seriously ill now I
my<00:05:38.350> whites<00:05:38.590> very<00:05:38.949> low<00:05:40.380> and

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.249 

but<00:05:44.759> at<00:05:45.759> the<00:05:45.910> end<00:05:45.970> of<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.240> day<00:05:46.449> if<00:05:46.780> that's<00:05:47.050> to

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:47.259 
but at the end of the day if that's to

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.270 
but at the end of the day if that's to
be<00:05:47.440> that's<00:05:48.070> to<00:05:48.310> be<00:05:48.930> I'm<00:05:49.930> going<00:05:50.350> to<00:05:50.440> decided<00:05:51.070> not

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
be that's to be I'm going to decided not

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.659 
be that's to be I'm going to decided not
to<00:05:51.460> panic<00:05:51.780> or<00:05:52.780> become<00:05:52.990> upset<00:05:53.380> life<00:05:54.220> having<00:05:54.550> the

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
to panic or become upset life having the

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.390 
to panic or become upset life having the
past<00:05:54.940> and<00:05:55.360> all<00:05:55.449> that<00:05:55.600> stuff<00:05:55.750> and<00:05:56.370> all<00:05:57.370> that

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
past and all that stuff and all that

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.939 
past and all that stuff and all that
negative<00:05:58.000> stuff<00:05:58.210> and<00:05:58.690> what<00:05:59.110> essentially<00:05:59.800> i'm

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
negative stuff and what essentially i'm

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:04.040 
negative stuff and what essentially i'm
just<00:06:00.660> relaxing<00:06:01.660> as<00:06:01.750> much<00:06:01.810> as<00:06:02.139> I<00:06:02.229> can<00:06:02.289> and

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
just relaxing as much as I can and

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.950 
just relaxing as much as I can and
just<00:06:04.800> doing<00:06:05.220> doing<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:05.729> best<00:06:05.909> I<00:06:06.090> can<00:06:06.120> in<00:06:06.629> a

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
just doing doing the best I can in a

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.070 
just doing doing the best I can in a
difficult<00:06:07.169> situation

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.360 

I<00:06:11.169> guess<00:06:11.770> that's

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.219 

because<00:06:14.910> that's<00:06:15.180> really<00:06:15.479> what<00:06:15.750> I<00:06:15.840> wanted<00:06:16.139> to

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
because that's really what I wanted to

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.260 
because that's really what I wanted to
say

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.110 

so<00:06:19.930> hopefully

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.760 

um

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770
