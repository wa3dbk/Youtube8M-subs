00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.979
 Good night, I want to show you 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:07.229
 small experiment 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:11.490
 in order to demonstrate the quality of work 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:15.120
 antennas to a 14 2600 dp 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.920
 this is past the antenna for ltn our 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.530
 production would like to show you 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.140
 how effective is it even under conditions 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.060
 In principle, not bad reception was 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.740
 chosen night time specifically to 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.840
 estimate maximum signal quality 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.609
 maximum speed and so on and so 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.830
 similar to the load base was 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.050
 minimal means on my window hanging 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.929
 modem e 392 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.969
 the most famous most popular weighs 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:41.879
 he is like that on the window handle 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.049
 many people hang in the face of bad 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.019
 reception and using ashby cable 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:51.120
 connected to the computer where here on 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.269
 the program can be observed level 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.699
 a signal like this 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.339
 I just want to check out 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.739
 speed help sleeping with there 20 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:05.400
 millisecond pink input speed 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.690
 server no baynet now see 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.690
 how much will give 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:19.000
 6 megabits per second six seconds 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.030
 half straight does not twitch anywhere 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.009
 stability so let's say for the Altai 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.520
 not much notice even to the country more 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:33.110
 than at the reception so but here somewhere 776 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.560
 Now, in fact, what we are doing is note for 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.229
 the window hangs me antenna with two here 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.509
 inputs one and 2 for vertical and 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.729
 horizontal polarization here and 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:52.160
 actually here I have them from her 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:56.060
 You are now on top of here so I will connect 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.910
 this short pigtail here here we have 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.100
 will be vertical polarization and here 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.979
 this one is in length and this is mine 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.289
 horizontal to tennessee designations 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.289
 there are these pigtails and hooked up 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.530
 actually so cold supply 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.430
 cats lie and themselves are testing again on 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.890
 aids test how it will be with us 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:27.840
 look like we check 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.319
 server do not change mts crowd look 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.319
 speed 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.170
 speed see here and so 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.599
 the speed we have now is 49 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:48.860
 megabits per second that is almost 50 she 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:52.610
 recoil rate of 17 which is much higher than 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.430
 it was without an antenna now let's see what we have 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.370
 going on in mhh program you are modem 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.099
 software here is actually a reception but not 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.730
 much more than it was I want more 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:07.519
 time to emphasize that the antenna to 14 2600 dp 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.760
 and shows itself in a wonderful way in 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.409
 conditions not even poor signal and only 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.150
 under poor signal it to you 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.870
 will still feel the speed 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.760
 lt and 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:23.220
 and get a minimum ping and 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.939
 network stability is everything to everyone 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.939
 thank you bye
