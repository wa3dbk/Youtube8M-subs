00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.460
 certainly can not get better than it is 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.120
 ten digital action environments with cell phones 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.580
 even very modern stoves we have learned to expect high levels in our homes 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:18.310
 but it is a practical activity and brilliantly designed for fiesc 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.730
 that more and more people are putting these little things 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.970
 she stands discreetly in the sink 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 so most of the time you do not even know it exists 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.929
 but after using one to test how to live without it 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.880
 is the new food waste selector evolution of the disease in which 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.560
 the lie 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.470
 the brand is world leader 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.350
 and had no utility of belt strapped for modern kitchen 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.540
 food handlers as soon as they do not appear only 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.450
 with the contemporary city 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.940
 they provide an environmentally sound response to the problem 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.160
 of food waste 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.049
 but first let's talk about the daily mess 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.689
 however careful and organized we may be trash cans with sack pedals 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:05.850
 from trash passes to the garbage dump 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.830
 it is not exactly the investments 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.510
 the fact is that they must have 30% of kitchen waste are waste 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.450
 food 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.820
 and this means sticky material coma or pain and arises to deal 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.700
 especially when things go wrong 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.470
 and if they are food waste this can occur here from the mind a kitchen 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.490
 hot shoes for authors and breeders of bacteria in certain 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.360
 and if you live in an apartment with stairs between you and her outside 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.680
 come there now you understand 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.630
 so let's go back to the alternative who does. 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.810
 with the new models and bonuses 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.469
 who are at the top of the full line and elected 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.469
 the press has redefined itself and food waste operators 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.880
 thanks to new technological advances 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.289
 the models and the museum 100 and 200 are the quietest shredding thinner 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.590
 and the most powerful so far 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.640
 both feature state-of-the-art stone and noise reduction technologies 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.270
 so when it comes to traitors they live in the middle of 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.679
 establish a new standard 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:18.699
 as soon as you prepare the dishes the waste can be crushed immediately and effectively 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.219
 mind 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.529
 the additional power circuit with microprocessor 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.870
 increase because to eliminate foods difficult to crush 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.509
 open the tap press air switch 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.509
 in color and services to their position and they are gone 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.530
 the food waste disposer and all effortlessly safely 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.770
 in fine particles that are brought to Nato but also in terms of sales of 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.500
 kia to the sewage treatment system with 47 points 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.290
 security is no problem for a young family or for anyone 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.869
 the grinding ring that handles the waste 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:56.609
 is totally safe and is not blades 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.449
 as we have seen, the silent technology of evolution models helped create 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:05.559
 quieter food waste handlers that have already existed 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.589
 which makes our models perfect for modern life 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.669
 in the question of practicality that as soon as the inter also reaches maximum marks 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.889
 all models are compact and 700 to fit up here feel easier 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.389
 valuable 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.749
 there is a quick assembly assembly that was provided which provides 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.059
 easy installation 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:28.099
 that's how it looks inside 'a crusher 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.649
 food waste is discharged through the sink with cold water and 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.029
 falls on a turntable in the camera 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:37.639
 the rotary force decisive plays against the outer wall 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.699
 scream 12 thin particles in seconds 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.549
 alternative to discard food waste 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.349
 the amount can waive the diets has been causing concern 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:48.419
 all around the world 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.479
 governments around the world are committed to reducing 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.759
 amount of waste disposed of in landfills 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.139
 And think about it 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.769
 that all those food residues need to be collected and transported 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:01.569
 therefore 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.439
 when it comes to the presence of carbon the handlers got maximum marks 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.099
 again food leftovers that have passed through our tabs can be 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.800
 used to create good solids with biogas 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.569
 as part of a modern and oriental approach 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.870
 when recycled material is used with a source of energy 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.019
 soil conditioner fertilizer 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.150
 the cycle starts again 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.780
 the revolutionary shredding technology simply has the power to 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.689
 handle all kinds of food end point 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.800
 spaghetti position culpable bovine 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.940
 bark and coffee theft can 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.059
 vegetarians 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:41.869
 fruits these frozen fish fossils the list is endless 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.890
 and at the end of it all the kitchen gets tupi cavill 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.310
 leaving you at ease to do the things you would rather be doing 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.839
 you certainly will not have to worry about concentrating food and 

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:57.830
 yes that reiterates 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.419
 Our design and high quality is maintenance free 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.789
 so once installed you can forget it 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.659
 more than 75 million 30 food donors in the 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.900
 and three quarters of them are made that recently 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.289
 it's not time for you to put it in your kitchen 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.699
 in which he reiterates samus and patients
