hello so in today's video I am going to
be<00:00:05.370> talking<00:00:05.609> about<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.210> snowflake<00:00:06.750> method

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
be talking about the snowflake method

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.750 
be talking about the snowflake method
please<00:00:07.500> be<00:00:07.680> aware<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.189> original

article<00:00:09.179> on<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.540> snowflake<00:00:09.929> method<00:00:10.260> is

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
article on the snowflake method is

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.900 
article on the snowflake method is
linked<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.920> doobly-doo<00:00:11.070> go<00:00:11.550> check<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.820> out

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
linked in the doobly-doo go check it out

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.330 
linked in the doobly-doo go check it out
down<00:00:12.330> there<00:00:12.540> right<00:00:12.900> there<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.830> what<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
down there right there so what is the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.980 
down there right there so what is the
snowflake<00:00:14.790> method<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.269> may<00:00:15.420> be<00:00:15.480> wondering

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
snowflake method you may be wondering

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.990 
snowflake method you may be wondering
well<00:00:16.470> let<00:00:16.830> me<00:00:16.980> explain<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:17.940> will

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
well let me explain to you so you will

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.820 
well let me explain to you so you will
see<00:00:18.210> here<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.480> my<00:00:18.570> hand<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.050> paper<00:00:19.289> snowflake

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
see here on my hand a paper snowflake

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.290 
see here on my hand a paper snowflake
now<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.039> idea<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> method<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.150> you

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
now the idea of the method is that you

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.880 
now the idea of the method is that you
will<00:00:21.449> start<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> single<00:00:22.320> sentence<00:00:22.680> at<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
will start with a single sentence at the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.890 
will start with a single sentence at the
core<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.220> your<00:00:23.490> story<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.330> from<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.750> single

core of your story and from this single

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.179 
core of your story and from this single
sentence<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.470> will<00:00:25.560> expand<00:00:25.890> into<00:00:26.039> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
sentence you will expand into a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.710 
sentence you will expand into a
paragraph<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.849> paragraph<00:00:27.300> into<00:00:27.480> several

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
to write now I will just explain to you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.930 
to write now I will just explain to you
the<00:00:40.230> eight<00:00:40.440> steps<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.070> form<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.550> snowflake

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
the eight steps that form the snowflake

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.670 
the eight steps that form the snowflake
method<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.540> my<00:00:42.660> next<00:00:42.960> video<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> will<00:00:43.410> go

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
method and in my next video I will go

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.110 
method and in my next video I will go
through<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.190> many<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.610> these<00:00:44.700> steps<00:00:44.940> as

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
through as many of these steps as

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.229 
through as many of these steps as
possible<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.690> explain<00:00:46.469> how<00:00:47.129> my<00:00:47.610> script<00:00:48.000> has

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
possible and explain how my script has

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.810 
possible and explain how my script has
been<00:00:48.270> formed<00:00:48.960> through<00:00:49.289> its<00:00:49.410> method<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.579> step

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
been formed through its method so step

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.970 
been formed through its method so step
number<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.539> actually<00:00:52.050> probably<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.680> most

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
number one is actually probably the most

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.979 
number one is actually probably the most
difficult<00:00:53.430> step<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:54.300> see<00:00:54.480> you've<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.870> this

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
difficult step you see you've got this

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.180 
difficult step you see you've got this
wonderful<00:00:55.379> idea

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
