00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
so to make them you craft your bottles

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.569 
so to make them you craft your bottles
here<00:01:09.509> first<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.270> fill<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.630> water

here first and you fill them with water
and<00:01:15.380> again<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.650> doing<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:16.979> weird<00:01:17.970> thing

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and again it's doing that weird thing

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.640 
and again it's doing that weird thing
where<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.450> will<00:01:18.600> fill<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:18.960> water<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.530> I've

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
blaze powder and again this will take a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.170 
blaze powder and again this will take a
bit<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.270> time<00:01:33.390> then<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.930> actually<00:01:38.060> that's<00:01:39.060> the
