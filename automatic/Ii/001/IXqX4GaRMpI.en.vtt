 turns in ancient greece horses 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.370
 treated with sea buckthorn leaves 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.620
 and it not only saved them from 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.470
 disease gradually animal fur 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.750
 getting smooth shiny maybe 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.090
 it was from there that the name of sea buckthorn came 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.119
 which with translation means brilliant 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.740
 horse no less valuable properties 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.840
 possesses sea ​​buckthorn berries 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.060
 today we will do vitamins and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.260
 blanks for the winter 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.960
 Sea buckthorn is perhaps the most useful. 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.300
 plant on earth vitamin c in bright 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.940
 orange berries are 10 times more than 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.430
 lemon carotene 7 times than in carrots and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.070
 pumpkin besides the sea buckthorn fruits are rich 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.980
 trace elements they have iron 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.719
 calcium magnesium sodium potassium phosphorus a 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.090
 cortex contains serotonin which 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.160
 considered a hormone of happiness due 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.719
 unique properties of sea ​​buckthorn 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.270
 used in medicine prices and leaves in them 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.500
 very much contain ascorbic 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:10.159
 acids and in addition tannins and 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.350
 trace elements dry them well and 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.479
 brew like vitamin tea especially 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:22.170
 for those who suffer from gout and rheumatism 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:25.820
 here is a bark alcohol infusion to do very 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.070
 well understood she slows growth 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 neoplasm leaves for the winter in 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.170
 mostly dried but from the sea buckthorn fruit 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.450
 make all kinds of harvesting juices and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.030
 jelly fruit candy compote 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.250
 common delicacy jam on 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.470
 kilo washed hipro dried berries to us 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.939
 need one and a half kilograms of sugar and 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:52.040
 a glass of water we make sugar syrup and 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:53.990
 pour the berries put them in 45 hours 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.710
 cool place 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.840
 after that the syrup was drained 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:07.670
 boil give it a little cool and 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.929
 there we drop our berries and re-cook 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.430
 until ready 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.019
 it's about 10 15 minutes after this spill 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.420
 sterilized jars 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.239
 want to preserve vitamins to the maximum 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.430
 you can just make buckthorn sugar 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.590
 so that the berries quickly let the juice 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.110
 they need a little crush wood 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.360
 tolkushkoy and pour sugar kilo 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.640
 two hundred per kilogram of berries weight 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.640
 we put the sterilized jars to 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.790
 hangers poured sugar on top store 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.010
 in a dark cool place 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.860
 from sea buckthorn turns out very tasty and 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.080
 flavored jelly through juicer 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.650
 squeeze the juice and add sugar one to 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:53.569
 one well all of this we 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:57.290
 stir and boil for 5-7 minutes but you can 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:01.519
 do without care for this we take 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.459
 liter of juice and mix with two kilograms 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.959
 sugar is the most valuable preparation of 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.150
 sea ​​buckthorn is oil 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.000
 it is used to treat burn wounds 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.670
 skin diseases in gynecology and 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.079
 cosmetology 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.659
 make butter at home not 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.939
 it's hard to just dry well 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:23.090
 cake that remains after pushups 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:26.599
 juices dried cake we grind 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.180
 coffee grinder or mortar and pour 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:32.959
 warm oil 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.450
 can be used as sunflower olive 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.950
 corn but best of all she was 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.250
 refined fill jars and 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:46.310
 set for two or three weeks in a dark place 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.430
 after that we filter and pour by 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.680
 bottle is another option 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.959
 obtaining oil squeezed juice need 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.150
 hold oil in a cold place 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.540
 time rises to the surface where 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.849
 him 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.569
 and you can collect this oil is considered 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.879
 perhaps the most valuable dreams 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.859
 simple version of the preparations of sea buckthorn 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.769
 just in case you have no time to mess with 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:12.379
 jam or make juice fold washed 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.659
 and dried berries in the package and send 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.940
 him in the freezer so you 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:20.389
 will be provided with vitamins for the whole winter 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.799
 For today it is all good luck to you and to new 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.799
 meetings in category 6 acres 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.569
 September 4 and 5 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:36.539
 moon rising ibex ibex 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:40.270
 fertile sign in this period is good 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:43.139
 plant root crops and early green 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.629
 crops we plant radish salad for 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.430
 autumn-winter use when the moon 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.979
 is in ibex 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.330
 very well developed roots and have 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.360
 home plants 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.349
 therefore, during this period, you can repot 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.229
 plants with weak root system 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:06.630
 plants become resistant to 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:09.940
 pests and diseases and vagaries of weather 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:15.849
 we harvest we spend it 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:19.509
 recycling on September 6 and 7 the moon is growing 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:22.360
 in the constellation of Aquarius, Aquarius is the most 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:25.690
 ethereal sign of sowing and planting 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.039
 any plants and including watering 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.509
 garden 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:33.669
 not recommended working with soil 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:35.669
 we dig them up 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.699
 organic fertilizers 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:42.159
 harvest vegetables and 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:46.060
 fruit and berry crops are processed 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:49.449
 doing home canning 8 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:53.830
 september moon rising constellation fishes 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:56.500
 fish is a fertile mark but is landings 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.300
 and plant transplants are not worth it 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.440
 practice the day before 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.710
 new moon pouring loose mulch 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.360
 we make organic fertilizers 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.770
 tree trunks of fruit trees and 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.990
 berry crops 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.990
 all the best to you and see you again
