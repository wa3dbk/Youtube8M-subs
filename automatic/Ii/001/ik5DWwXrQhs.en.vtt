00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
longer because I did I think I did like

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.740 
longer because I did I think I did like
an<00:00:28.260> eight<00:00:28.470> order<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.279> did<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> mean<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.539> know<00:00:30.630> we

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
an eight order I did I mean you know we

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.200 
an eight order I did I mean you know we
did<00:00:30.869> many<00:00:31.230> many<00:00:31.679> multiple<00:00:32.279> episode<00:00:32.730> arcs

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210

right<00:00:33.630> yes<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.489> lot<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.700> ways<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.120> is

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
right yes so in a lot of ways this is

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.240 
right yes so in a lot of ways this is
the<00:00:36.420> concentrate<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.920> kind<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.160> to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the concentrate so you kind of have to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.340 
the concentrate so you kind of have to
get<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> point<00:00:39.000> also<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.870> can't<00:00:40.170> depend

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
get to the point also you can't depend

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.580 
get to the point also you can't depend
on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.950> audience<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:42.090> know<00:00:42.120> stuff<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.469> you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
your writing live-action you just create

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.790 
your writing live-action you just create
a<00:02:30.690> scene<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:30.959> your<00:02:31.050> head<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:31.380> describe

a scene in your head and you describe
what<00:02:31.980> happens<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.790> that's<00:02:33.060> what<00:02:33.330> is

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
what happens and that's what is

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.500 
what happens and that's what is
if<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.680> do<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> comic<00:02:35.460> book<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:36.120> have<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.390> do

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
if you do a comic book you have to do

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.540 
if you do a comic book you have to do
all<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.620> have<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.950> also<00:02:38.010> figure

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
all of that but you have to also figure

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.000 
all of that but you have to also figure
out<00:02:38.820> how<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.030> break<00:02:39.390> up<00:02:39.450> time<00:02:39.810> each<00:02:40.440> panel

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
out how you break up time each panel

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.430 
out how you break up time each panel
represents<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.790> certain<00:02:42.060> amount<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.510> time<00:02:42.720> you

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
represents a certain amount of time you

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.770 
represents a certain amount of time you
have<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.740> figure<00:02:43.950> out<00:02:44.130> what's<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.730> best<00:02:44.780> image

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
have to figure out what's the best image

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.710 
have to figure out what's the best image
to<00:02:46.200> get<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.620> information<00:02:46.920> across<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.940> what

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
to get that information across and what

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.260 
to get that information across and what
happens<00:02:49.140> between<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.740> panels<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.310> spaces

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
happens between the panels the spaces

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.420 
happens between the panels the spaces
between<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.870> panels<00:02:52.050> are<00:02:52.380> where<00:02:52.590> everything

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
between the panels are where everything

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.240 
between the panels are where everything
happens<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:54.290> what's<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.440> space<00:02:55.680> mean<00:02:55.950> where

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
happens so what's that space mean where

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.010 
happens so what's that space mean where
are<00:02:56.280> we<00:02:56.430> picking<00:02:56.610> up<00:02:56.940> how<00:02:57.330> much<00:02:57.510> time<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.990> that

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
are we picking up how much time is that

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.770 
are we picking up how much time is that
it's<00:02:58.620> technically<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.670> lot<00:03:00.090> more<00:03:00.300> difficult

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
it's technically a lot more difficult

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.260
