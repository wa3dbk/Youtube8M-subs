the new evh 5150 50 watt head right so

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.100 
the new evh 5150 50 watt head right so
if<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.340> actually<00:00:20.490> start<00:00:20.880> doing<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.270> need<00:00:21.720> 50

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
if you actually start doing this need 50

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.690 
if you actually start doing this need 50
watt<00:00:22.259> version<00:00:22.290> of<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.610> classic<00:00:24.050> 5150<00:00:25.050> amp

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
watt version of the the classic 5150 amp

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.139 
watt version of the the classic 5150 amp
is<00:00:26.700> got<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> real<00:00:28.189> iconic<00:00:29.189> sound<00:00:29.430> that<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> lot<00:00:30.029> of

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:30.149 
is got a real iconic sound that a lot of

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.729 
is got a real iconic sound that a lot of
people<00:00:30.480> want<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.619> try<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.829> go<00:00:32.009> after<00:00:33.560> 50<00:00:34.560> watts

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
people want and try to go after 50 watts

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.349 
people want and try to go after 50 watts
means<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.520> crank<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.970> a<00:00:36.059> lot<00:00:36.210> harder

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
means that you can crank it a lot harder

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.150 
means that you can crank it a lot harder
and<00:00:36.750> probably<00:00:36.989> make<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.230> output<00:00:37.559> valve<00:00:37.829> sing

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and probably make you output valve sing

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.029 
and probably make you output valve sing
a<00:00:38.460> lot<00:00:38.699> more<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:39.629> opposed<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.079> 100<00:00:40.440> amps<00:00:40.800> where

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
a lot more as opposed to 100 amps where

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.459 
a lot more as opposed to 100 amps where
I<00:00:41.489> mean<00:00:41.730> there's<00:00:42.149> not<00:00:42.269> really<00:00:42.449> many<00:00:43.109> chances

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
I mean there's not really many chances

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.639 
I mean there's not really many chances
you<00:00:43.679> get<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.070> put<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.519> 10<00:00:44.760> even<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.179> gig<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.780> 50

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
you get to put it on 10 even a gig so 50

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.500 
you get to put it on 10 even a gig so 50
watts<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> lot<00:00:47.250> better<00:00:47.429> it<00:00:47.969> gives<00:00:48.359> you<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
watts is a lot better it gives you a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.290 
watts is a lot better it gives you a
chance<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> crank<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.260> lot<00:00:49.410> more<00:00:49.940> this<00:00:50.940> amps

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
chance to crank it a lot more this amps

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.759 
chance to crank it a lot more this amps
really<00:00:51.719> good<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:51.989> got<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> headphones<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
really good it's got a headphones to

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.770 
really good it's got a headphones to
help<00:00:52.920> her<00:00:53.129> an<00:00:53.339> effects<00:00:53.789> loop<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.629> got<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
help her an effects loop it's got a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.329 
help her an effects loop it's got a
resonance<00:00:55.230> control<00:00:55.589> on<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> back<00:00:56.010> which

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
resonance control on the back which

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.430 
resonance control on the back which
allows<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> control<00:00:57.690> kind<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
allows you to control kind of the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.349 
allows you to control kind of the
movements<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> speaker<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.640> bit<00:00:59.969> more<00:01:00.179> and

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
movements of the speaker a bit more and

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.810 
movements of the speaker a bit more and
have<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> bit<00:01:00.870> more<00:01:00.899> control<00:01:01.440> over<00:01:01.589> how<00:01:01.949> tight<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
have a bit more control over how tight a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.549 
have a bit more control over how tight a
speaker<00:01:03.300> stays<00:01:03.690> when<00:01:03.929> it<00:01:04.019> plays<00:01:04.170> whether<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
speaker stays when it plays whether it

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.930 
speaker stays when it plays whether it
flaps<00:01:04.769> around<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.100> bit<00:01:05.220> more<00:01:05.370> which<00:01:05.640> give<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> a

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
flaps around a bit more which give you a

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.830 
flaps around a bit more which give you a
better<00:01:06.390> bass<00:01:06.780> response<00:01:08.210> channel<00:01:09.210> wise<00:01:09.360> we've

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
better bass response channel wise we've

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.470 
better bass response channel wise we've
got<00:01:10.170> channels<00:01:10.680> 1<00:01:10.890> &amp;<00:01:11.040> 2<00:01:11.160> here<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.610> share<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.030> EQ

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
got channels 1 &amp; 2 here that share in EQ

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.870 
got channels 1 &amp; 2 here that share in EQ
so<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.800> have<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.580> low<00:01:14.700> B<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
so when you have it in that low B the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.280 
so when you have it in that low B the
green<00:01:15.060> light<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.300> that's<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.020> kind<00:01:16.230> of

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
green light on that's a kind of

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.510 
green light on that's a kind of
clean-ish<00:01:16.710> channel<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.400> really

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
clean-ish channel and you can really

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.160 
clean-ish channel and you can really
clean<00:01:17.760> it<00:01:17.910> up<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.150> get<00:01:18.240> some<00:01:18.420> nice<00:01:18.570> sparkly

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
clean it up and get some nice sparkly

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.280 
clean it up and get some nice sparkly
sounds<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.840> flick<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> over<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
sounds out of it then flick it over to

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.160 
sounds out of it then flick it over to
that<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.000> driven<00:01:24.000> sound<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that and you get a driven sound so I

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.350 
that and you get a driven sound so I
mean<00:01:25.770> I've<00:01:25.920> only<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.520> my<00:01:26.670> dog<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.240> you're

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
mean I've only in my dog that you're

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.580 
mean I've only in my dog that you're
gonna<00:01:27.480> see<00:01:27.690> on<00:01:27.720> when<00:01:27.960> you've<00:01:28.050> got<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> game<00:01:28.560> on

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
gonna see on when you've got the game on

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.970 
gonna see on when you've got the game on
a<00:01:28.770> half<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:30.260> it<00:01:31.260> goes<00:01:31.440> a<00:01:31.470> lot<00:01:31.650> higher<00:01:31.860> than

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
a half but it goes a lot higher than

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.240 
a half but it goes a lot higher than
that<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.190> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.400> get<00:01:32.520> much<00:01:32.730> more<00:01:32.760> Drive<00:01:34.250> EQ

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that so you can get much more Drive EQ

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.510 
that so you can get much more Drive EQ
is<00:01:35.520> staying<00:01:36.090> at<00:01:36.500> 12<00:01:37.500> o'clock<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:38.010> entire<00:01:38.280> way

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
is staying at 12 o'clock the entire way

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.940 
is staying at 12 o'clock the entire way
at<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.760> halfway<00:01:38.910> point<00:01:39.120> and<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.500> volume<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
at the halfway point and the volume is

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.010 
at the halfway point and the volume is
just<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.340> about<00:01:41.550> one<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> moment<00:01:42.180> so

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
just on about one at the moment so

00:01:43.020 --> 00:02:01.110 
just on about one at the moment so
here's<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> clean<00:01:44.070> channel

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.870 

right<00:02:02.080> now<00:02:02.350> let's<00:02:03.010> have<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.130> listen<00:02:03.280> with<00:02:03.790> the

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
right now let's have a listen with the

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.820 
right now let's have a listen with the
accuse<00:02:04.150> on<00:02:04.480> exactly<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.170> same<00:02:05.350> settings

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
accuse on exactly the same settings

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.050 
accuse on exactly the same settings
let's<00:02:06.100> have<00:02:06.190> a<00:02:06.220> listen<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.610> overdrive

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
let's have a listen to the overdrive

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:25.059 
let's have a listen to the overdrive
channel

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.339 

right<00:02:26.069> now<00:02:26.370> let's<00:02:26.760> hear<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.390> third<00:02:28.049> channel

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
right now let's hear the third channel

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.530 
right now let's hear the third channel
which<00:02:28.769> is<00:02:28.799> to<00:02:29.640> me<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.879> feels<00:02:30.000> slightly<00:02:30.360> more

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
which is to me it feels slightly more

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.679 
which is to me it feels slightly more
over<00:02:30.810> driven<00:02:31.170> then<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.950> last<00:02:32.129> one<00:02:32.599> for<00:02:33.599> this

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
over driven then the last one for this

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.619 
over driven then the last one for this
one<00:02:33.900> I've<00:02:34.140> got<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.530> low<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.849> mid<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.450> kind

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
one I've got the low and mid just kind

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.539 
one I've got the low and mid just kind
of<00:02:36.659> a<00:02:36.750> little<00:02:36.930> bit<00:02:37.019> past<00:02:37.170> halfway<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.430> was

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
of a little bit past halfway so it was

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.599 
of a little bit past halfway so it was
at<00:02:38.670> about<00:02:38.879> six<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.920> highest<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.400> backed

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
at about six and the highest just backed

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.720 
at about six and the highest just backed
off<00:02:41.819> below<00:02:42.390> halfway<00:02:43.189> presents<00:02:44.189> just<00:02:44.549> below

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
off below halfway presents just below

00:02:44.730 --> 00:03:05.800 
off below halfway presents just below
halfway<00:02:44.970> as<00:02:45.269> well

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.910 

so<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.870> couple<00:03:07.050> of<00:03:07.140> other<00:03:07.230> features<00:03:07.650> on<00:03:07.800> this

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
so a couple of other features on this

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.840 
so a couple of other features on this
look<00:03:08.160> quite<00:03:08.370> cool<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.930> got<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.140> selectable

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
look quite cool is it's got a selectable

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.100 
look quite cool is it's got a selectable
impedance<00:03:11.850> output<00:03:12.090> which<00:03:12.630> means<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.990> can

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
impedance output which means you can

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.350 
impedance output which means you can
change<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.440> between<00:03:13.620> 4<00:03:14.100> 8<00:03:14.430> or<00:03:14.760> 16<00:03:15.180> ohms

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
change it between 4 8 or 16 ohms

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.700 
change it between 4 8 or 16 ohms
depending<00:03:15.750> on<00:03:15.810> what<00:03:15.960> cab<00:03:16.170> you're<00:03:16.380> running

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
depending on what cab you're running

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.800 
depending on what cab you're running
those<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.400> comes<00:03:17.550> with<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.760> full<00:03:18.330> button<00:03:18.540> foot

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
those it comes with a full button foot

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.990 
those it comes with a full button foot
switch<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.590> it's<00:03:20.280> no<00:03:20.370> need<00:03:20.520> to<00:03:20.640> worry<00:03:20.850> about

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
switch so it's no need to worry about

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.030 
switch so it's no need to worry about
buying<00:03:21.570> extra<00:03:21.960> bits<00:03:22.110> which<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.320> included<00:03:22.920> in

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
buying extra bits which is included in

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.940 
buying extra bits which is included in
there<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.850> also<00:03:24.510> it's<00:03:24.810> got<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.990> line<00:03:25.560> out<00:03:25.590> on

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
there and also it's got a line out on

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.130 
there and also it's got a line out on
the<00:03:26.040> back<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.460> you<00:03:26.490> can<00:03:26.610> run<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.390> directly<00:03:27.600> into

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
the back so you can run it directly into

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.800 
the back so you can run it directly into
the<00:03:28.710> cooling<00:03:29.220> software<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.450> clearly<00:03:30.690> go

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the cooling software and clearly go

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.980 
the cooling software and clearly go
speaker<00:03:31.110> simulator<00:03:31.470> going<00:03:31.860> on
