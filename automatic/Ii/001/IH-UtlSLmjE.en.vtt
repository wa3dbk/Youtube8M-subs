into<00:01:45.450> ponds<00:01:45.690> helping<00:01:46.410> keep<00:01:46.560> things<00:01:46.590> crystal

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
into ponds helping keep things crystal

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.499 
into ponds helping keep things crystal
clear<00:01:47.460> they're<00:01:47.640> going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.850> love<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.149> too<00:01:48.330> and

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
clear they're going to love it too and

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.210 
clear they're going to love it too and
for<00:01:49.020> pennies<00:01:49.289> a<00:01:49.320> day<00:01:49.440> your<00:01:49.740> ponds<00:01:49.979> going<00:01:50.160> to

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
for pennies a day your ponds going to

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:28.950 
for pennies a day your ponds going to
look<00:01:50.310> better<00:01:50.520> than<00:01:50.729> ever

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.940 

so<00:02:29.960> this<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.170> where<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.380> diffuser<00:02:30.710> is<00:02:30.830> going

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
so this is where the diffuser is going

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.140 
so this is where the diffuser is going
to<00:02:31.010> be<00:02:31.100> connected<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.550> this<00:02:31.730> what<00:02:31.910> we're<00:02:32.030> going

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
to be connected to this what we're going

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
to be connected to this what we're going
to<00:02:32.210> do<00:02:32.300> is<00:02:32.390> want<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.570> fill<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.840> with<00:02:32.960> sand

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
to do is want to fill it with sand

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.050 
to do is want to fill it with sand
there's<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.440> little<00:02:33.650> hole<00:02:33.770> right<00:02:33.800> here<00:02:34.060> we're

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
there's a little hole right here we're

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.640 
there's a little hole right here we're
going<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.240> fill<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.510> with<00:02:35.600> sand<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:36.350> way<00:02:36.500> when

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
going to fill it with sand that way when

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.930 
going to fill it with sand that way when
we<00:02:36.740> get<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:36.980> into<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.250> middle<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.580> pond<00:02:37.790> it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
we get it into the middle of the pond it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.300 
we get it into the middle of the pond it
sinks<00:02:38.210> to<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.360> bottom<00:02:44.530> okay<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:46.100> kit

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
sinks to the bottom okay on this kit

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.830 
sinks to the bottom okay on this kit
we're<00:02:46.430> using<00:02:46.580> three-eighths<00:02:47.150> weighted

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
we're using three-eighths weighted

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.560 
we're using three-eighths weighted
tubing<00:02:48.320> now<00:02:49.160> when<00:02:49.670> you're<00:02:49.880> going<00:02:50.240> to<00:02:50.390> pick<00:02:50.540> a

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
tubing now when you're going to pick a

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.760 
tubing now when you're going to pick a
kit<00:02:50.870> you're<00:02:51.140> going<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.320> be<00:02:51.380> looking<00:02:51.500> at<00:02:51.680> the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
kit you're going to be looking at the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.230 
kit you're going to be looking at the
difference<00:02:52.010> between<00:02:52.040> non<00:02:52.460> weighted<00:02:52.880> tubing

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
difference between non weighted tubing

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.880 
difference between non weighted tubing
and<00:02:53.390> weighted<00:02:54.050> tubing<00:02:54.320> of<00:02:54.440> course<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.770> can

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
and weighted tubing of course you can

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.680 
and weighted tubing of course you can
see<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.190> thick<00:02:55.400> wall<00:02:55.670> here<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:56.600> very

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
see that thick wall here it's very

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.470 
see that thick wall here it's very
durable<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.970> weight<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.240> tubing

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
durable this is the weight of tubing

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.120 
durable this is the weight of tubing
throw<00:02:59.660> this<00:02:59.810> in<00:02:59.960> the<00:03:00.050> pond<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.410> sinks<00:03:00.710> right<00:03:00.920> to

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
throw this in the pond it sinks right to

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.070 
throw this in the pond it sinks right to
the<00:03:01.220> bottom<00:03:01.610> now<00:03:01.790> this<00:03:02.300> is<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.600> non<00:03:02.750> weighted

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
the bottom now this is the non weighted

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.040 
the bottom now this is the non weighted
tubing<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.710> can<00:03:03.830> see<00:03:04.070> it<00:03:04.430> can<00:03:05.030> get<00:03:05.150> kinked<00:03:05.600> you

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
tubing you can see it can get kinked you

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.990 
tubing you can see it can get kinked you
can<00:03:06.200> bend<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.500> right<00:03:06.560> in<00:03:06.800> half<00:03:06.980> I'll<00:03:07.730> show<00:03:07.910> you

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
can bend it right in half I'll show you

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.970 
can bend it right in half I'll show you
that<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.450> if<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:09.230> throw<00:03:09.410> this<00:03:09.560> in<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.800> pond

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
that and if you throw this in the pond

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.950 
that and if you throw this in the pond
it<00:03:10.100> floats<00:03:10.310> across<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.610> pond<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.180> imagine

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
it floats across the pond and imagine

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.240 
it floats across the pond and imagine
this<00:03:12.080> with<00:03:12.290> air<00:03:12.530> in<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.800> it's<00:03:12.950> just<00:03:12.980> going<00:03:13.190> to

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
this with air in it it's just going to

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.920 
this with air in it it's just going to
look<00:03:13.400> like<00:03:13.520> a<00:03:13.580> giant<00:03:13.970> snake<00:03:14.240> in<00:03:14.420> there<00:03:14.600> unless

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
look like a giant snake in there unless

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.840 
look like a giant snake in there unless
you<00:03:15.560> get<00:03:15.710> take<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.100> time<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.520> hide<00:03:16.700> it

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
you get take the time to hide it

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.310 
you get take the time to hide it
underneath<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.240> rockwork<00:03:17.660> or<00:03:17.900> in<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:18.080> bottom

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
underneath the rockwork or in the bottom

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.140 
underneath the rockwork or in the bottom
of<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.470> pond<00:03:18.680> this<00:03:19.580> is<00:03:19.730> not<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:19.880> very<00:03:20.090> good

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
of the pond this is not a very good

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.970 
of the pond this is not a very good
choice<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.780> spend<00:03:21.020> the<00:03:21.080> extra<00:03:21.200> money<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.800> get

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
choice so spend the extra money and get

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.170 
choice so spend the extra money and get
the<00:03:22.070> weighted<00:03:22.310> tubing<00:03:22.610> and<00:03:22.700> do<00:03:22.790> it<00:03:22.880> right<00:03:23.030> the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
the weighted tubing and do it right the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.210 
the weighted tubing and do it right the
first<00:03:23.300> time

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
first time

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.350 
first time
okay<00:03:25.220> what<00:03:25.370> we<00:03:25.460> have<00:03:25.490> here<00:03:25.850> is<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:25.940> rocking

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
okay what we have here is a rocking

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.880 
okay what we have here is a rocking
piston<00:03:26.810> unit<00:03:27.110> here<00:03:27.320> this<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:27.530> going<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.710> drive

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
piston unit here this is going to drive

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.170 
piston unit here this is going to drive
all<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.130> air<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.640> bottom<00:03:28.850> of<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.000> pond

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
all the air to the bottom of the pond

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.630 
all the air to the bottom of the pond
this<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:29.900> our<00:03:29.990> pressure<00:03:30.260> relief<00:03:30.620> valve<00:03:30.920> and

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
this is our pressure relief valve and

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.620 
this is our pressure relief valve and
we're<00:03:31.760> going<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:31.910> connect<00:03:32.210> our<00:03:32.300> weighted

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
we're going to connect our weighted

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.870 
we're going to connect our weighted
tubing<00:03:32.960> to<00:03:33.080> this<00:03:33.230> guy<00:03:33.470> here<00:03:33.890> and<00:03:34.010> send<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:34.850> out

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
tubing to this guy here and send it out

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.730 
tubing to this guy here and send it out
to<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.150> bottom<00:03:35.270> of<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.480> pond<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.900> right<00:03:36.440> here

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
to the bottom of the pond and right here

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.860 
to the bottom of the pond and right here
we<00:03:36.920> have<00:03:36.950> our<00:03:37.460> little<00:03:37.940> air<00:03:38.150> filter<00:03:38.630> if<00:03:38.750> you

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
we have our little air filter if you

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.510 
we have our little air filter if you
will<00:03:39.050> it's<00:03:39.500> going<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.710> protect<00:03:39.860> this<00:03:40.220> pump

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
will it's going to protect this pump

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:58.850 
will it's going to protect this pump
from<00:03:40.760> sucking<00:03:41.060> in<00:03:41.360> sand<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:42.560> dust<00:03:42.740> and<00:03:43.040> such
