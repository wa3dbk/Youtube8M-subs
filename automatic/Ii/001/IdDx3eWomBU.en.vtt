00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
times and one thing I noticed this will

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.400 
times and one thing I noticed this will
rust<00:01:11.229> up<00:01:11.940> and<00:01:12.940> it<00:01:13.120> will<00:01:13.240> stop<00:01:13.510> functioning<00:01:13.750> so

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
rust up and it will stop functioning so

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.800 
rust up and it will stop functioning so
I<00:01:14.440> just<00:01:14.770> spray<00:01:15.040> it<00:01:15.070> or<00:01:15.400> put<00:01:16.120> a<00:01:16.150> few<00:01:16.390> drops<00:01:16.630> of

I just spray it or put a few drops of

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.320 
I just spray it or put a few drops of
vegetable<00:01:17.260> oil<00:01:17.500> on<00:01:17.650> it<00:01:17.830> and<00:01:17.950> it<00:01:18.670> keeps<00:01:18.820> it<00:01:19.030> free

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
vegetable oil on it and it keeps it free

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.520 
vegetable oil on it and it keeps it free
and<00:01:19.420> moving<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:21.520> can<00:01:21.700> see<00:01:22.230> this<00:01:23.230> panel

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530

that aspect I like it and if you if you

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.320 
that aspect I like it and if you if you
got<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.980> good<00:02:23.160> fire<00:02:23.370> going<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.880> fans<00:02:24.090> going

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
got a good fire going on the fans going

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.870 
got a good fire going on the fans going
you<00:02:24.660> don't<00:02:24.840> get<00:02:24.930> all<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.200> soot<00:02:25.500> on<00:02:25.709> your<00:02:26.640> pots

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
you don't get all the soot on your pots

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.720 
you don't get all the soot on your pots
that<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.330> would<00:02:27.540> with<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.860> with<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> non-fan

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
that you would with a with a non-fan

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.699 
that you would with a with a non-fan
driven<00:02:30.860> wood-fired<00:02:31.860> stove<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.720> I'm<00:02:34.140> thinking

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
driven wood-fired stove so I'm thinking

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.610 
driven wood-fired stove so I'm thinking
about<00:02:34.830> getting<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.459> kettle<00:02:35.760> pot<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.620> don't

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
about getting the kettle pot I don't

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.940 
about getting the kettle pot I don't
really<00:02:37.800> know<00:02:37.980> why<00:02:38.220> because<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.730> have<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:39.950> have

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
really know why because I have I have

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.460 
really know why because I have I have
lots<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.340> pots<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.760> use<00:02:42.000> with<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.360> already<00:02:42.660> but

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
lots of pots to use with it already but

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.920 
lots of pots to use with it already but
yeah<00:02:43.950> maybe<00:02:44.790> because<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.390> carrying<00:02:45.720> case

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
yeah maybe because it's a carrying case

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.650 
yeah maybe because it's a carrying case
for<00:02:45.959> this<00:02:46.230> unit<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.739> guess<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.239> think<00:02:48.540> I'm

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
for this unit I guess but I think I'm

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.400 
for this unit I guess but I think I'm
going<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.840> do<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.079> try<00:02:49.320> REI<00:02:49.769> gave<00:02:50.130> me<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.310> $20

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
going to do it try REI gave me a $20

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.860 
going to do it try REI gave me a $20
whatever<00:02:52.410> dividend<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.510> might<00:02:54.510> put<00:02:54.720> that

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
whatever dividend so I might put that

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.180 
whatever dividend so I might put that
towards<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:56.280> guess<00:02:57.269> in<00:02:57.480> September

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
towards it and I guess in September

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.020 
towards it and I guess in September
