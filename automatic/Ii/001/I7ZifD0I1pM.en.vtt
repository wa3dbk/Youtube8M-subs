00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
 hey 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.150
 entirely at the end of the last century 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.720
 honda a land rover working together 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.119
 development of a new compact SUV 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.829
 that marriage beaches and honda went in 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.329
 his one for that became the cr-v 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.579
 but eventually a rover I 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.450
 of course also through and that degenerates into 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.599
 the 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.590
 friel others 1997 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.870
 there was a special car for it 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.670
 Land Rover because it was a small one 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.649
 compact land grabbing that ensures that 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.430
 the brand and once a piece accessible the 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.430
 for the general public 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.190
 and there was no wonder that it was free 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.260
 countries at the end of the last century 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.930
 one of the most successful compact 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.180
 SUVs of that time was the first 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.040
 generation freelander lasted 9 years and 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.239
 that also applied to the second generation 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.800
 then you think what we have calculated 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.230
 then you know this year time for the 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.420
 third generation in freelander 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.890
 but no freelander is the grave worn 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.270
 i no longer exists 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.559
 at least of course the name no longer 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.590
 because the friends below is going well 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.579
 now under the name discovery sport and that is 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.579
 the car driving today 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.480
 then I know this car early this year too 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.670
 though it was on iceland and it was 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.200
 as the name suggests only on ice and 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.180
 snow and our chicken couple 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.160
 pieces of asphalt it soaked on tires 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.200
 with nails where the average god me 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.920
 young orange brothers on so now for it 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.920
 first on the asphalt 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.680
 although that discovery sport is really complete 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.410
 is new you have to be pretty good 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.790
 to see the difference with the second 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.830
 generation free countries become a dive 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.150
 building on the same pattern as 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.020
 nothing wrong with that is a nice car 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.640
 to see 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.100
 the same goes for the interior so 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.390
 pretty tight though somewhat easier than one 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.310
 range rover of course 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.100
 nevertheless clearly recognizable as 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.450
 a larger family is clear 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.400
 and and and logically all were sitting 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.619
 only the infotainment is a bit slow 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.300
 and that menu structure makes it complicated 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.790
 yes that button above another door for that 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.920
 the window controls if you often land rover 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.940
 Used out of the beds but goes on each 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.800
 grab again but those are small things 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.390
 behind you you are also nice and spacious 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.680
 extra handy and this car is it is 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.680
 from now on a seven-seater 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.360
 was just like leads and this car is 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.040
 first was the extreme part 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.630
 circumstances I already had 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.400
 He learned that he is on site very 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.710
 good progress comes from one 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.650
 has low gearing and none 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.610
 left right per has but important 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.890
 of course here 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.090
 how are you on asphalt and that 's great 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.290
 order 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.700
 he could have done just a little 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.140
 predict what is under the skin this 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.910
 of course just an evoque and that's 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.170
 very nice a moving car and that is 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.170
 this of course also 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.410
 and if you do a child 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.450
 He does have a blubbering 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.820
 empty this nine-speed automatic gearbox and 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.920
 that first order is so awful 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.290
 is actually a bit like a low one 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.390
 giering works discovery sport is 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.180
 now in the Netherlands and the best 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.890
 News still has to come because 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.000
 history repeats itself because the 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.350
 first friel other 1997 actually the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.090
 threshold for land rover driving a lot 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.450
 brought it down again 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.340
 because this is indeed the sd4 with 190 hp 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.280
 and four-wheel drive an automatic but 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.870
 there comes the ED4 later in the year 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.670
 150 hp 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.050
 it has a manual six-speed gearbox and 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.870
 only front-wheel drive that means 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.030
 that that car will soon be in step 10 thousand 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.420
 euro is lower than a second generation 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.420
 freelander
