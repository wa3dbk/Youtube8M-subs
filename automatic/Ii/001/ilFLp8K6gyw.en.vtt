00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.330
 a lot of people I hope you 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.220
 be well 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.020
 I'm fine but I realized 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.449
 realize that I had not made the video 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.699
 ok shopping yes that's it since a certain 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.050
 time and besides myself and to 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.189
 picks to buy as young people would say 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.439
 because I buy all the time from 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.640
 pikachu outside the four ok mode or 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.470
 so we love t shirt with the effigy of 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.390
 picasso it's true that I buy all the 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.370
 time of the disney boosters or 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.989
 pokemons and not enough to tell you and 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.270
 it's a mistake because precisely 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.800
 love it and that's it and figurines the 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.780
 fluff or even besides all that 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.370
 is to the effect of pikachu so this 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.539
 video be short enough i'm going 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.149
 that work on several plans 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.039
 made two shots the one here and the 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.750
 usual work plan when I you 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.949
 show my cards 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.660
 so now that we have changed our plan 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.219
 I really wanted to introduce you 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.780
 this game i do not know if you have it you 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.129
 even buy but me he reminded me 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.059
 full of memories of when I had it 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.010
 had on gamecube 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.360
 besides with pikachu at this time 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.590
 there but I did not even remember it 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.750
 to say how much I'm a 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.110
 poor fans i'm going to open it all from 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.689
 after 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.270
 so I'm going to buy toys r us on the 2nd 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.619
 October they were already available 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.490
 so the official release was of course 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.920
 the 3rd of October 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.820
 for those who would not be here I 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.799
 still removed the little 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.180
 cartridge 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.710
 I show you that a little closer in 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.320
 done exactly the same as the 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.280
 cover of the game in the end 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.689
 finally plastic and inside so 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.130
 I do not really know what it is 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.500
 so here they just say it's 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.210
 available on two ds3 ds and 3ds 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.649
 xl interesting patrice we will open his 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.590
 so there is a little bit of pub for 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.240
 pokemon xy 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.240
 it came out well before but well and there 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.789
 precisely for the new ruby series 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.270
 omega and zafira the fact that we can see 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.710
 right here 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.450
 Besides, I'm really looking forward to 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.119
 buy it this game is a small passage 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.579
 on link a game that 20 zelda a game that 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.899
 I love so I really want 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.359
 not all looked there are little tricks 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.810
 without mario also it's the ad for 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:13.120
 the other games in fact so we 're going 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.840
 take orders with a small 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.000
 stung in the middle so tell me if you 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.590
 have already played this game I love 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.200
 give me your impressions what 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.520
 character you prefer to use so 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.470
 it seems not very interesting 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.730
 I am going to show you that there 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.370
 what I will remember is the 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.740
 cover and the graphics are 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.150
 really fantastic I find behind 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.400
 we can see some characters well 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.900
 sure they are not all available here on 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.330
 will discover a little bit and precisely 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.640
 there is not only pikachu there is also 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.150
 charizard you can see there in the end 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.260
 hobby there was who also read cariou and 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.730
 pikachu and I think that's all in 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.400
 terms of pokemon then I had bought 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.000
 the number one manga of the great adventure 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.290
 of pokemon I adore them and so if you 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.280
 read it you want to know more 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.320
 I was a little late 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.670
 however, because it's true that the 2 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.709
 was coming out in August 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.870
 so I'm just starting a game you 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.800
 show the small mark pages only 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.739
 here then I'm going to open it and that's 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.489
 simply a little peppers of the 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.350
 pikachu's head 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.900
 I told myself when we mark pages this 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.030
 would be super nice so after level 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.100
 drawings is nice but when 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.019
 even far enough still from this 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.970
 we can see on the animated for example 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.680
 pikachu there that I show you here he did 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.910
 nothing to do with the pica that I can 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.049
 to show you here from elsewhere 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.140
 behind I do not know if you want to see 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.790
 the back on the other hand if you want to read the 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.320
 summary maybe you're interested 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:48.400
 actually with the little artwork of 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.870
 behind so this manga costs 10 euros if 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.890
 you want to buy it do not hesitate this 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.590
 is not very very expensive either 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.959
 knowing that in mangane has at least 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.440
 at least three I'll say at least three 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.360
 mangas and for small cards 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.640
 in the end I did not go much further in 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.500
 my pikachu card collection that's 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.260
 are simple coach so there are 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.630
 this one with the silver medal that 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.640
 I like it a lot and that's where for me 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.489
 is exactly the same but with the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.510
 gold medal I think it seems to me that 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.530
 it's the gold medal but I do not speak 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.329
 no japanese no it's a little 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.979
 complicated for me alas the little ghetto 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.210
 is right on the other side it's all there 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.490
 change of location but it's the same 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.669
 illustration is the color of the 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.810
 medal simply changes them 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.190
 are really super nice so they will 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.440
 they will cost 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.480
 10 euros both I ordered them to 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.580
 my second Japanese seller because 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.900
 I have two now and who are 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.220
 besides both very nice I 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.440
 thanks them because they are the ones who 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.280
 provide me with all pikachu cards 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.140
 that I can get 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.760
 I will now go to the bigger ones 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.000
 and I show you that on the second 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.490
 plan 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.170
 and finally we will go to what I have 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.520
 bought two bigger ones and that I do not 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.810
 could not show you on the verge of 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.040
 work where I film to my cards 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:00.340
 usually so I could not 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.360
 resist I did not buy the size zero 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.040
 if you want to know 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.290
 and besides I showed him his mast 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.570
 facebook photo and most of 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.700
 have asked you to make it work 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.060
 in video I knew by damn well yes 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.060
 I think 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.130
 we were not happy especially 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.250
 and then here I am going to unpack then 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.780
 and his little ampex drives going on to 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.250
 inside here I do not know if you 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.790
 will see very well and then he makes 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:31.300
 attacks as we can see here you 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:34.419
 shows the beautiful and I could not help but 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.310
 to buy it then there's this big cop 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.990
 again but it's a teddy 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.820
 or we can not say that it's really 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.500
 that he bought I cheat a little bit 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.210
 in this video so because it's the 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.010
 young people who offered it to me so much 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.169
 disgusted good to run over cabinets 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.820
 who offered so later when I 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.230
 I will unpack because of the angle of his little 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.900
 but I wanted to introduce you 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.390
 like these, it's a stuffed tommy 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.340
 and this one I already had it in miniature 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.230
 but it's true that it's ten times 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.569
 softer and ten times bigger according to 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.219
 jaguar to finish 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.499
 you talk about the videos I made 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:07.629
 soon but afterwards I got 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:09.429
 said no, so eventually I will not do 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.990
 not that because I have a lot of ideas 

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:12.849
 there will be a lot of videos but his 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.199
 mother in my little head and finally 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.189
 that will be the surprise 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.189
 Hi
