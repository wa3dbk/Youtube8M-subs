00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.560
 very good welcome to my second 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:11.900
 good video what will be the first video 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.900
 without counting the presentation of the channel 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.190
 and well, we would be clear as the 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.650
 first video my collection of games 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.520
 wii and wii and as our videos 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.840
 I'll show 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.480
 you owe them and 3ds 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.350
 and showing different videos and then already 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.740
 morning 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.350
 Well, whether it's tomato boxing, chili 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.359
 different things 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.100
 Well, I must jude, although I do have 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.469
 as you see very few games only 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.699
 we have four video games the one that has 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.699
 a console this Christmas 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.020
 apart from write here I have no longer 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.120
 it's not like there's any game that calls me 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.370
 attention 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.360
 without counting the biggest cartridge 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.070
 but trying to save to get it 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.350
 what we did with the promotion they do 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.089
 that they give you a game version 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.550
 digital 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.890
 Well, I think it's worth it 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.230
 and good as you see the first nintendo 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.850
 land 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.850
 one game pass be 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.990
 it's like a very part style 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.270
 but more like simpler 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.549
 in my opinion we like to try 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.070
 liked it more than the pri did not take for 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.210
 example 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.950
 but a tad less worry 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.610
 and well I also want to buy a 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.250
 partidillo 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.760
 then the second to get put 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.760
 this world 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.700
 for me I think it's going to be the best 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.039
 water game up 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.380
 until it burns smash bros if it is that 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:56.140
 they do not disappoint us in the end 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.140
 then zombie john is not wrong 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.750
 the July 22nd edition is pretty cool 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.729
 with beige gray with and suits of sea and 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.729
 louis and things like that 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.240
 and there it is 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.510
 put two wii games me in your already 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.849
 I had 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.849
 this is from here x 4 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.440
 a day that I came to sell the uy 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.930
 at the end I backed out in a console 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.470
 and there was a big part of the video game 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.720
 and luckily I stayed with the best 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.360
 and then I bought a few more 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.040
 well here we have the wii sports I know that 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.049
 the cover is wrong and everything but 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.180
 having a pet dog 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.319
 consequences that dry it has shattered 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.579
 quite a scale 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.579
 for example they are here 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.370
 is here is here is 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.750
 we have best wii games wii party 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.120
 past 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.340
 is already thrown hours and hours and I do not 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.200
 it tires 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.340
 so if now they equate 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.340
 dryly cdg 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.430
 a playmobil 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.430
 because it's not bad but 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.049
 we have liked to spend a while is rough 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.349
 does not have any comparison with very 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.349
 farc 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.959
 Y 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.980
 18 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.980
 also the hard leg 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.969
 or the game is also pretty good 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.350
 I was 90 and I tell myself that I sold it and 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:48.350
 of having come a lot 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.170
 but good that is going to be done if we have 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.550
 a ball z tenkaichi 3 a version 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.060
 pretty cool 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.250
 the original playstation 2 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.190
 I like dragon ball 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.960
 then also a bartender 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.830
 that we already go with the prohibited in the 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.870
 description and things 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.640
 here we have a bol revenge of king 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.100
 I got this piccolo makes a 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.080
 weeks even if it's pretty old 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.360
 we're 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.290
 it's a style after it's a smash style 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.870
 Bros is not bad 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.810
 in the favorite game of water and I'm going to 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.040

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.730
 Martin 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.630
 strikers 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.520
 so cool so they take us out in investment 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.689
 European the go 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.279
 then equal 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:40.279
 again and we get out of the customers 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:48.170
 another wii classic what margüello 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:50.000

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.229
 this game for a classic 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:06.320
 we have little brown wonders beyond my 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.540
 opinion was not they are not 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.370
 they are not like poker like the 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.680
 first read to because for one 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.440

 the fans of pokémon and good here the 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.740
 game that burst for me was the 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.840

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.010
 again 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:55.720
 There is a game that I have for a while

 three throw some kisses with some 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.860

 but good 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.590
