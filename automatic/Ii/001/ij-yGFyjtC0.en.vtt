00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:11.889
 if a defaulter 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.239
 signs a payment agreement with the lawyer 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:16.299
 that this one 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.409
 po being in colombia and said 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.409
 interrupts the prescription of arrears 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.189
 If you fail to comply with these arrears 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.150
 let's talk about the prescription 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.130
 he is talking about quotas 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.030
 I waited added that we are talking about 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.030
 is for example property for insulting 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.850
 all your players that we are talking about 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.150
 of in the monthly installments against a credit in a bank 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.600
 perfect there is no difference 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.490
 good that it would be different 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.230
 remember that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.880
 when one enters the 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.400
 the horizontal property 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.400
 the administrator that there be a certification 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.120
 of the debt of the ordinary installments with the doors of being in areas 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.030
 and with that certification 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.810
 issued by the administration 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.030
 that if you can start the actions 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.540
 legal proceedings against the defaulter 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.760
 that document that debt certification issued by the administrator is a 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.240
 executive title 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.320
 and the accuracy of executive titles 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.390
 They are 25 years old 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.840
 by provision of the civil code 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.540
 Right 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.800
 remember that in installments 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.740
 each month 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.090
 has its own prescription term 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.399
 shaq every month 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.239
 has five years to be charged otherwise you can write because 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.290
 now we are talking for example 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.570
 from a bank a debt to a bank the arrears 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.910
 the difference is that in the bank 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.750
 usually signed min 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.780
 and the promissory notes are not titles that executive but are titles 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.260
 values 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.510
 and in that case the commercial code establishes that securities 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.710
 they have a prescription 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.130
 three years 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.039
 it is clear 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.039
 mar that little introduction let's go to the question 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.139
 if a defaulter 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.159
 sign a payment agreement 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.360
 with the lawyer 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.839
 that is finding the legal collection process 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.619
 the prescription is interrupted 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.169
 the first thing we are going to walk is 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.329
 that to be able to talk about interruption dep 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.519
 Perez wants to leave and they go 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.559
 this what the title 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.259
 I saw the executive was the title 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:35.959
 deborah title value 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.589
 that is the obligation 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.019
 it has to be prescribed 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.789
 we can not talk about interrupting 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:44.619
 something 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:46.409
 that has not yet arrived 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.989
 why spread interested in the subject please write us article 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.709
 25 14 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.529
 I repeat article 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.529
 25 14 of the civil code 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.089
 it tells you only 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:04.859
 may be interrupted 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.859
 tacitly or expressly the prescription 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.479
 when enforced 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.949
 if we are talking about debt 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:18.389
 for example on Monday I will be watching the door plays the odds admits 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.559
 administration 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.559
 ordinary quotas is also areas of a condo 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.069
 of the year 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.439
 2005 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.189
 today 2011 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:29.689
 six years 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.059
 already prescribed 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:35.249
 that obligation already prescribed now if at this time 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.759
 traveling prescribed 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.109
 the debtor 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.549
 Cuba signature signed a payment agreement 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.449
 acknowledging that debt in 2005 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.889
 there if you are interrupting the prescription because 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.009
 because she 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:54.999
 was born the precision and a after 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:57.999
 that has already been generated is that it can be interrupted 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:00.919
 if the defaulter on the contrary 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.129
 I subscribe to the payment agreement 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.790
 of the five years 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.870
 of that obligation with the horizontal itself 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.359
 we would not be talking about interruption 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.369
 because it is not interrupting something that has not yet prescribed 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.359
 or what 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.109
 buehrle finally asks 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.349
 what will happen if that payment agreement 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:21.799
 it is broken 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.770
 what happens with the arrears 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.099
 then at that moment 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.639
 returns initiated from the subscription of the payment agreement 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.129
 returns and starts the prescription term to counted 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.570
 correct because signing a payment agreement 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.820
 about the debt that is already prescribed what you are doing is interrupting and 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.460
 of living again an obligation 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.740
 be very careful with that 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.419
 who recommended reading 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.039
 everything that has to go with prescriptions that are from the article 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:58.780
 25 12 and following of the civil code in particular the interruption 25 14
