the cut and turn over principle which is
an<00:00:34.559> old<00:00:34.770> principle<00:00:35.219> introduced<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.790> me<00:00:35.940> by<00:00:37.640> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
an old principle introduced to me by the

four cards and stick them face up

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.709 
four cards and stick them face up
anywhere<00:00:55.500> amongst<00:00:56.219> your<00:00:56.489> spread<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:56.969> packet

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
up and then you can hold the packet

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.859 
up and then you can hold the packet
either<00:01:05.010> face<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:05.850> face<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.420> your<00:01:06.689> hand

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
either face up or face down in your hand

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.469 
either face up or face down in your hand
and<00:01:07.400> what<00:01:08.400> we're<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.330> we're

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and what we're going to do now is we're

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.850 
and what we're going to do now is we're
going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> deal<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> cards<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> time

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
going to deal the cards one at a time

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.899 
going to deal the cards one at a time
and<00:01:11.070> we're<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.340> mix<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> cards

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
and we're going to mix the cards

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.590 
and we're going to mix the cards
flipping<00:01:12.750> them<00:01:13.080> alternative<00:01:13.680> alternatively

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
flipping them alternative alternatively

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.030 
flipping them alternative alternatively
and<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.320> way<00:01:16.500> I'll<00:01:16.650> show<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.009> mean

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
and this way I'll show you what I mean

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.399 
and this way I'll show you what I mean
you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.400> choose<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.700> either<00:01:17.960> flip<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> card

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
you can choose to either flip the card

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.359 
you can choose to either flip the card
up<00:01:20.070> or<00:01:20.430> deal<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> card<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.530> down<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:22.920> like

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
up or deal the card as is down just like

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.539 
up or deal the card as is down just like
so<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:24.509> whatever<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.560> choose<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.100> next<00:01:26.250> card

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
so now whatever you choose the next card

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.719 
so now whatever you choose the next card
you're<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> opposite<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.729> I'm

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
you're going to do the opposite so I'm

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.789 
you're going to do the opposite so I'm
going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.030> flip<00:01:30.509> up<00:01:30.689> my<00:01:30.869> card<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> first<00:01:31.530> card

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
going to flip up my card the first card

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.100 
going to flip up my card the first card
so<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.460> means<00:01:32.790> I'm<00:01:32.909> going<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.090> deal<00:01:33.299> down<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
so that means I'm going to deal down the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.160 
so that means I'm going to deal down the
second<00:01:34.500> card<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.729> course<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.049> other

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
second card and of course it's the other

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.840 
second card and of course it's the other
way<00:01:37.320> around<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.890> choose<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.460> deal<00:01:38.640> down

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
way around if you choose to deal down

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.429 
way around if you choose to deal down
the<00:01:39.030> first<00:01:39.210> card<00:01:39.450> its<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.020> flip<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the first card its you flip up the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.200 
the first card its you flip up the
second<00:01:40.860> card<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.189> whatever<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.119> do

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
second card so whatever you want to do

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.480 
second card so whatever you want to do
it's<00:01:42.329> up<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.200> I'm<00:01:43.290> doing<00:01:43.590> I'm<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:44.070> up

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it's up to you so I'm doing I'm going up

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.109 
it's up to you so I'm doing I'm going up
down<00:01:45.060> up<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.380> then<00:01:47.100> down<00:01:47.490> even<00:01:47.939> though<00:01:48.000> this

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
down up and then down even though this

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.870 
down up and then down even though this
cards<00:01:48.390> face<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:49.079> remain<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:50.340> down<00:01:50.610> just

cards face up I remain going down just
like<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.750> then<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> deal<00:01:52.829> up<00:01:53.070> down<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:54.000> down
