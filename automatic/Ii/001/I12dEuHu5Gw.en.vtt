00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
now first things first a mistake that I

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.169 
now first things first a mistake that I
made<00:00:13.679> right<00:00:14.040> off<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> start<00:00:14.549> was<00:00:14.730> not<00:00:14.880> putting

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
made right off the start was not putting

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.090 
made right off the start was not putting
scavenger<00:00:15.719> pro<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.139> my<00:00:16.260> first<00:00:16.500> perk<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.920> had

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
scavenger pro is my first perk I had

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.769 
scavenger pro is my first perk I had
slight<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.460> hand<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.820> recommend<00:00:18.630> putting

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
slight of hand I recommend putting

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.320 
slight of hand I recommend putting
scavenger<00:00:19.470> pro<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.130> have<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.910> maximum

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
scavenger pro so you have the maximum

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.910 
scavenger pro so you have the maximum
amount<00:00:21.390> ammo<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:21.960> can<00:00:22.050> start<00:00:22.410> off<00:00:22.560> with<00:00:22.769> that

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
amount ammo you can start off with that

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.259 
amount ammo you can start off with that
way<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.160> don't<00:00:23.400> need<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.609> move<00:00:23.760> around<00:00:23.910> from

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
way you don't need to move around from

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.750 
way you don't need to move around from
your<00:00:24.420> spot<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> lot<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.230> yes<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.430> guys<00:00:26.580> can

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
your spot a lot and yes you guys can

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.609 
your spot a lot and yes you guys can
probably<00:00:27.060> guess<00:00:27.300> by<00:00:27.510> me<00:00:27.689> saying<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.410> that

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
probably guess by me saying that is that

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.139 
probably guess by me saying that is that
this<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.820> really<00:00:30.390> slow<00:00:30.750> paced<00:00:31.080> Moab<00:00:31.529> and

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
snipers not really the best thing

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.930 
snipers not really the best thing
because<00:01:01.890> they<00:01:02.039> might<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.309> running<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:02.820> you

are the guns I'd recommend sticking to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590 
are the guns I'd recommend sticking to
other<00:01:26.189> weapons<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.820> I've<00:01:26.939> also<00:01:27.090> tried<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
other weapons that I've also tried it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.410 
other weapons that I've also tried it
with<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.990> actually<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> mp7<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.299> know

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
with is actually the mp7 but you know

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.420 
with is actually the mp7 but you know
it's<00:01:30.689> good<00:01:31.049> cuz<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.380> has<00:01:31.500> no<00:01:31.740> recoil<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.310> it's

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
it's good cuz it has no recoil and it's

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.130 
it's good cuz it has no recoil and it's
got<00:01:32.549> pretty<00:01:32.850> good<00:01:32.909> range<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.840> fact<00:01:34.049> that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
got pretty good range but the fact that

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.929 
got pretty good range but the fact that
it's<00:01:34.320> still<00:01:34.470> an<00:01:34.590> SMG<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.310> doesn't<00:01:35.610> keep<00:01:35.729> up

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
it's still an SMG it doesn't keep up

Moab so easily when I do that and I've
gotten<00:06:06.610> about<00:06:06.790> two<00:06:07.270> or<00:06:07.420> three<00:06:07.720> Moab's<00:06:08.080> sitting

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
gotten about two or three Moab's sitting

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.170 
gotten about two or three Moab's sitting
at<00:06:08.620> that<00:06:08.740> spot<00:06:09.070> but<00:06:09.250> I<00:06:09.370> don't<00:06:09.610> normally<00:06:09.760> run

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
at that spot but I don't normally run

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.450 
at that spot but I don't normally run
specialist<00:06:10.870> on<00:06:11.080> a<00:06:11.110> mission<00:06:11.920> I<00:06:12.010> hardly<00:06:12.340> ever

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
specialist on a mission I hardly ever

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.610 
specialist on a mission I hardly ever
run<00:06:12.850> specialist<00:06:13.420> on<00:06:13.540> mission<00:06:13.900> I<00:06:14.110> actually

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
run specialist on mission I actually

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.340 
run specialist on mission I actually
mostly<00:06:15.130> stick<00:06:15.400> to<00:06:15.640> a<00:06:15.670> salt<00:06:16.360> which<00:06:16.990> like<00:06:17.200> I<00:06:17.320> said

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
mostly stick to a salt which like I said

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.440 
mostly stick to a salt which like I said
um<00:06:17.800> that's<00:06:18.220> the<00:06:18.430> spot<00:06:18.670> works<00:06:18.940> for<00:06:19.180> more<00:06:19.330> than

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
um that's the spot works for more than

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.810 
um that's the spot works for more than
just<00:06:19.510> specialist<00:06:20.200> it<00:06:20.350> really<00:06:20.530> does<00:06:20.710> um<00:06:21.010> you

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
just specialist it really does um you

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.340 
just specialist it really does um you
can<00:06:22.000> use<00:06:22.120> a<00:06:22.150> salt<00:06:22.540> or<00:06:22.750> support<00:06:23.170> but<00:06:23.320> I

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
can use a salt or support but I

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.830 
can use a salt or support but I
recommend<00:06:23.800> having<00:06:23.950> scavenger<00:06:24.820> or<00:06:24.850> you<00:06:25.510> know<00:06:25.630> a

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
recommend having scavenger or you know a

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.810 
recommend having scavenger or you know a
weapon<00:06:26.350> was<00:06:26.410> a<00:06:26.470> lot<00:06:26.830> of<00:06:27.010> ammo<00:06:27.340> so<00:06:27.550> you<00:06:27.610> don't

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
weapon was a lot of ammo so you don't

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.100 
weapon was a lot of ammo so you don't
have<00:06:27.880> to<00:06:28.000> keep<00:06:28.180> running<00:06:28.390> back<00:06:28.690> to<00:06:28.840> that<00:06:28.990> spot

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
have to keep running back to that spot

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.410 
have to keep running back to that spot
because<00:06:29.440> sometimes<00:06:30.430> they'll<00:06:30.640> just<00:06:30.790> 80s<00:06:31.210> at

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
because sometimes they'll just 80s at

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.370 
because sometimes they'll just 80s at
that<00:06:31.570> hill<00:06:31.810> if<00:06:31.990> there

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
that hill if there

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.530 
that hill if there
playing<00:06:32.710> like<00:06:32.950> even<00:06:33.640> bigger<00:06:33.850> bitches<00:06:34.300> and<00:06:34.450> I

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
playing like even bigger bitches and I

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.940 
playing like even bigger bitches and I
am<00:06:34.750> and<00:06:34.990> I'll<00:06:35.140> just<00:06:35.290> wait<00:06:35.470> for<00:06:35.500> you<00:06:35.680> to<00:06:35.800> turn

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
am and I'll just wait for you to turn

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.470 
am and I'll just wait for you to turn

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
that corner which you know there's

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.030 
that corner which you know there's
really<00:06:37.630> no<00:06:37.840> need<00:06:38.050> to<00:06:38.230> push<00:06:38.410> into<00:06:38.590> that<00:06:38.740> spawn

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
really no need to push into that spawn

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.680 
really no need to push into that spawn
or<00:06:39.250> else<00:06:39.400> you<00:06:39.550> end<00:06:39.580> up<00:06:39.850> flipping<00:06:40.090> it<00:06:40.360> to<00:06:40.450> see

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
or else you end up flipping it to see

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.440 
or else you end up flipping it to see
anyways<00:06:41.110> but<00:06:41.350> you<00:06:42.310> know<00:06:42.430> this<00:06:42.970> doesn't<00:06:43.120> work

they added a spawn flipping a little bit
to<00:07:10.510> it<00:07:10.630> like<00:07:10.810> some<00:07:10.990> ultimate<00:07:11.410> spawns<00:07:11.710> but<00:07:12.240> you
