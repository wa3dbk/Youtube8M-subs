00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Hello, my name is the player and I wanted to 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.210
 Let's not oversee it here for hours or times 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.519
 small instructions 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.149
 to bring in Prince Hamlet the lows still do not know it or not yet 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:19.259
 can walk around the clock can speak difficult will copulate 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.009
 Country finances world 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.359
 Spira I have a pretty good percent on this topic 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.029
 written in the Republic publishing house in order for this for the this 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.199
 Interested 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.530
 In the end, you will get the passengers on with the first volume 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.370
 so 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.910
 What you can see here was what was called a salt mine in late May 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.410
 Steiner 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.290
 to continue numerous, so to speak 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.740
 and promptly the year has to do with the copies came to the next picture of the 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.160
 simply that is namely copulated that is a so-called 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.690
 Copulation job cashier 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.260
 this is a malfunction to do the percent a winter preferred percent 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.440
 may be used and for example in this 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.850
 to multiply by two kind percent 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.619
 and how exactly you do it draws on the next pictures 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.130
 should try to bring something closer to quantified so he then everyone 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.130
 Hits from sometimes open can work as well 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.710
 on the next picture you can see 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.700
 Here's an action Ansa on, this is just a picture street owner 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.020
 heavier that already extinct since both known to 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.010
 very good roots I prayed never thought I'm just a route 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.890
 and that worked very well 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.000
 to get the SR leadership from both teams to the right here 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.220
 so to speak pulled that so-called Reto Steinmann copulation 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.810
 Strasser 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.040
 and promptly a cross-section will be similar to what was shown 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.750
 and becomes more or less exactly the orientation of the instinct Advanced Bite 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.120
 a thumb and hand to knife race so it must be rigid with it 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.850
 Do not charge anything that you do not cut yourself 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.799
 by year more on the next note on next picture 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.140
 Here you can see the cut 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.030
 as stated that in what you can see very well that the sector confessed 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.069
 even if the picture is a bit blurred unfortunately 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.859
 around here in the Ammerland and long led that Solana Kambium that it the 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:19.930
 growth perspective 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.779
 it is very important to her 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:26.839
 after that, the Iran has to travel to the desired flames 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.450
 Concern exactly with the match around 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.259
 the network 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.179
 with meat that was still 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:38.479
 that is here now, so to speak, and the rice cut in the diction or 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:43.299
 You see around the cuts are the same length and you try as possible 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.709
 equally strong 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.150
 Greiser to get the documents to produce 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.259
 because plant team would like to compete 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.819
 You can also see here and the buds towards ICANN's equipment so 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.169
 this direction corresponds to something red 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:02.689
 so here you can see a smaller one that is even shifted by another bit 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:03.889
 promote themselves 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:08.129
 that is the base, that is, the whole is the population that will become 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.449
 placed on top of each other and who follow picture shown 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.329
 around with one 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.890
 with a warm band or rubber band 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.319
 entangled with the fact that just over one percent is due to change and can not slip 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.949
 That's how it looks later 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:29.039
 this is another thing between Faido just to show that again 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:30.339
 can do it all 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:35.039
 so the end result looks like I have no idea an apple tree in the old one 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:38.039
 Condition it also much the refinement 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:43.799
 And yes, that also gives that is a method percent so that he 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.889
 both were also denied 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.019
 calculated as it were a cross section along the road 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.159
 that's what you call the area tongue so that keeps you better, so to speak 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.809
 Connect for beginners so Strobl quite well suited 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:59.809
 around them you can see how it is put together 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.200
 yes it is pushed into each other what is that 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.579
 that is zoned here 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.809
 and that makes the whole thing a bit better 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.649
 As a result, different rims are so that here for the 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:16.549
 Rescue operations the population are doing the bottom of important game and that 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.049
 SuS has I'm just being 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.919
 This will prevent materials such as bast and embossing from turning them over 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.629
 one uses for it 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.899
 then we have the elapse or that is an artist through 

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:30.059
 Diverse is good for is suitable 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:34.199
 and here on Sondermann example how the whole thing can look like 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.710
 Here we have the bike in the next consultation post the food Geißfuß 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.309
 kicking or splitting frustrate various instructions 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.569
 this, of course, too 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.419
 there in my book 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.319
 Here's another one would be and besides Träsch 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.360
 the book binds copy publisher he speaks and Amazon thanks a lot 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.349
 for yours 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.400
 watch and see Nick's post
