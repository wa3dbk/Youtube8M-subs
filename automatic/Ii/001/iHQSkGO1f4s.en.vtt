00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:04.569 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.329 

I<00:05:04.629> just<00:05:05.379> thought<00:05:05.469> the<00:05:05.589> script<00:05:05.830> was<00:05:05.949> really

00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:06.339 
I just thought the script was really

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.309 
I just thought the script was really
well<00:05:06.849> written<00:05:07.059> and<00:05:07.509> it<00:05:07.629> had<00:05:07.809> a<00:05:07.839> lot<00:05:08.050> of<00:05:08.139> themes

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:08.319 
well written and it had a lot of themes

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.559 
well written and it had a lot of themes
that<00:05:08.529> resonated<00:05:09.309> with<00:05:09.520> me<00:05:09.699> and<00:05:09.939> I<00:05:10.059> think<00:05:10.119> that

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
that resonated with me and I think that

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.019 
that resonated with me and I think that
resonate<00:05:11.439> today<00:05:11.649> in<00:05:11.949> the<00:05:12.039> world<00:05:12.189> it's<00:05:12.879> all

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:13.029 
resonate today in the world it's all

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:15.659 
resonate today in the world it's all
about<00:05:13.300> acceptance<00:05:13.899> and<00:05:14.139> not<00:05:14.529> judging<00:05:15.189> I<00:05:15.429> guess

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
about acceptance and not judging I guess

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.909 
about acceptance and not judging I guess
and<00:05:15.999> I<00:05:16.330> think<00:05:16.809> that<00:05:16.929> can<00:05:17.050> be<00:05:17.110> applied<00:05:17.409> to<00:05:17.679> so

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
and I think that can be applied to so

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.089 
and I think that can be applied to so
many<00:05:18.039> aspects<00:05:18.550> of<00:05:18.759> our<00:05:19.449> lives<00:05:19.899> today<00:05:20.259> and<00:05:20.860> I

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
many aspects of our lives today and I

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.649 
many aspects of our lives today and I
just<00:05:21.339> I<00:05:21.729> thought<00:05:21.879> it<00:05:22.029> was<00:05:22.119> a<00:05:22.149> fun<00:05:22.509> adventure

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659

just I thought it was a fun adventure
story<00:05:23.229> so<00:05:23.499> if<00:05:23.589> it<00:05:23.709> can<00:05:23.860> it<00:05:24.159> can<00:05:24.189> be<00:05:24.309> a<00:05:24.429> little

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610
