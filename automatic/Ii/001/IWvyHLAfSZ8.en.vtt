the pod here we've got our ESC and
receiver<00:00:34.920> installed<00:00:35.399> already<00:00:35.640> our<00:00:36.300> servos

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
receiver installed already our servos

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.840 
receiver installed already our servos
are<00:00:37.020> installed<00:00:37.410> down<00:00:37.950> under<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.370> bottom<00:00:38.730> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
are installed down under the bottom of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.420 
are installed down under the bottom of
the<00:00:38.940> fuselage<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.590> all<00:00:40.890> that's<00:00:41.070> left<00:00:41.219> to

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the fuselage here so all that's left to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.280 
the fuselage here so all that's left to
do<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.300> assemble<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> main

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
do really is just assemble the main

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.220 
do really is just assemble the main
parts<00:00:43.710> which<00:00:43.920> consists<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.690> pod<00:00:45.930> with

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
parts which consists of the the pod with

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.810 
parts which consists of the the pod with
the<00:00:46.379> tail<00:00:46.559> section<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.430> got<00:00:47.579> your

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the tail section on it you got your

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.240 
the tail section on it you got your
horizontal<00:00:48.450> stabilizer<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.140> you've<00:00:50.070> got

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
horizontal stabilizer here you've got

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.400 
horizontal stabilizer here you've got
your<00:00:50.360> your<00:00:51.360> rudder<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.660> goes<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> back

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
your your rudder that goes on the back

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.040 
your your rudder that goes on the back
your<00:00:52.680> vertical<00:00:53.129> stabilizer<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.820> rudder<00:00:54.050> your

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
your vertical stabilizer and rudder your

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.049 
your vertical stabilizer and rudder your
wing<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.680> two-piece<00:00:56.070> construction<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
wing is of two-piece construction the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.970 
wing is of two-piece construction the
ailerons<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.840> our<00:00:58.020> everything's<00:00:58.500> pre-hinged

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
ailerons are our everything's pre-hinged

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.830 
ailerons are our everything's pre-hinged
so<00:00:59.250> your<00:00:59.430> ailerons<00:00:59.850> are<00:01:00.030> pre-hinged<00:01:00.239> along

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
so your ailerons are pre-hinged along

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.869 
so your ailerons are pre-hinged along
with<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.230> servos<00:01:01.949> installed<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.579> have

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
with your servos installed you just have

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.050 
with your servos installed you just have
to<00:01:03.120> basically<00:01:04.159> hook<00:01:05.159> up<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> simple

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
to basically hook up the simple

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.560 
to basically hook up the simple
connections<00:01:06.479> onto<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.010> radio<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.820> wing<00:01:09.090> does

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
connections onto the radio the wing does

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.969 
connections onto the radio the wing does
tape<00:01:09.869> together<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.470> we've<00:01:10.590> got<00:01:10.770> some

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
tape together and we've got some

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.620 
tape together and we've got some
stiffeners<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.760> go<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.360> looks<00:01:12.540> like

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
stiffeners that go in here it looks like

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.719 
stiffeners that go in here it looks like
you<00:01:12.960> slide<00:01:13.260> those<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.100> instructions

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
you slide those in for your instructions

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.850 
you slide those in for your instructions
and<00:01:14.939> put<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> final<00:01:16.020> piece<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.470> tape<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.770> hold

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
and put the final piece of tape to hold

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.530 
and put the final piece of tape to hold
your<00:01:17.100> wing<00:01:17.220> together<00:01:17.549> now<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.360> pretty

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.510 
your wing together now this is a pretty
good<00:01:18.780> sized<00:01:19.020> plane<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.590> got<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> 4-foot

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
good sized plane it's got a 4-foot

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.710 
good sized plane it's got a 4-foot
wingspan<00:01:20.700> Don<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.710> it's<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:23.450> not<00:01:24.450> your

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
wingspan Don it it's it's not your

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.740 
wingspan Don it it's it's not your
typical<00:01:24.900> small<00:01:25.560> trainer<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.310> we've<00:01:27.299> got<00:01:27.720> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
typical small trainer so we've got a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.649

gives you a little bit more feel of what
a<00:01:32.250> bigger<00:01:32.460> plane<00:01:32.729> will<00:01:32.909> perform<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
a bigger plane will perform like this is

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.999 
a bigger plane will perform like this is
also<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.860> am<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.610> park<00:01:35.909> pilot<00:01:36.240> program<00:01:37.009> legal

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
also a am a park pilot program legal

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.700 
also a am a park pilot program legal
plane<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.329> anybody<00:01:39.869> that's<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.290> program
