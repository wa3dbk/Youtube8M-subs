 is a skin preparation for the day is 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.809
 super easy super basic with produtinhos 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.160
 to sensitive national authorities before 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.160
 video was to give a very important state 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.619
 from today Wednesday, the 20th of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.510
 August our blog 90 off the air but it is 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.789
 for a little while we will be there 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.769
 new face everything will be different everything 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.779
 more beautiful for you so much 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.490
 important that you take a look at the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.349
 Blog there on Facebook for you guys 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.449
 can stay inside everything looks at the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.579
 link in the information box is here and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.010
 there also follows on instagram okay because 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.559
 there I can have new things in my 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.489
 day by day so I guess that's it in 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.500
 a province 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.110
 the first thing for a makeup to 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.110
 The day that is extremely important is 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.530
 moisturize and protect so I got it here 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.940
 two items that I use in my day to day 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.610
 to moisturize there which is the most important 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.219
 from that link you already know my 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.309
 wear sunscreen that he has 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.199
 solar protection factor 30 it has touch 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.690
 dry so it 's great for those with skin 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.970
 Oily is already the tip, then how is it? 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.790
 that we could if we did not want to 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.520
 you do not have to treat tafic up to the criterion 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.680
 but it is extremely important that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.570
 essential to use sunscreen 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.770
 regardless of your skin tone use 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.170
 sunscreen because it is 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.020
 indispensable good as makeup could 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.009
 use a super light base that base that 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.229
 hence the cosmetics is the base hd but also 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.850
 You can wear a bikini on a protector. 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.380
 solar that has color 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.810
 Finally, something very light because people 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.909
 imagine that for the day everyone who is 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.619
 something light if you do not want to or by hebe 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.790
 because suddenly the situation asks for something 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.220
 heaviest 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.259
 then do according to what you need but the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.140
 principle we are going to work with a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.210
 skin is very light every day, I go 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.380
 apply this base that gives iess i go 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.380
 apply with your hands 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.509
 It was applied all over my face. 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.160
 she is super light even if we have 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.410
 found that this base has a 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.510
 beak coverage in at least my 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.840
 skin it covers 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.900
 only it's super super light super light 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.030
 Even I got back very little because I 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.860
 I do not want anything to be loaded but 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.870
 I thought I needed a little more okay 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.160
 good we you can see that my 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.290
 skin 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.390
 she does not have much to cover 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.970
 I'm lucky that's what I'm doing. 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.700
 enough blackheads in this region so 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.650
 It's something I have to hide well. 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.080
 because it gets super- punchy that that 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.640
 lot of tip so much trying 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.459
 to hide 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.130
 finally, we apply base in all 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.750
 face base protector public at last what 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.160
 what you have to give body to give a 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.570
 face coverage 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.360
 if you lose it 's now we 're going to look for 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.400
 active I had to use the one that gives 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.140
 It's about linpien heaven. I love this. 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.459
 collective because it is super lightweight 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.670
 he has a cover 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.489
 great and then all the collective you have in 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.590
 house , preferably of a very light 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.380
 that what you want to find out if you are 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.630
 so very very light and did not cover that 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.450
 need to cover it also helps to 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.150
 to use a corrective to us so he has 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.690
 be light but have to cover the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.980
 spells that are bothering but had 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.820
 of thorn 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.239
 in the end I apply it and then it comes with 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.340
 theirs always with beatings people 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.959
 sinnott mainly in the region of 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.660
 ear okay let me give you a tip to 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.180
 You guys, if I come here dragging 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.340
 rubbing you will activate even more the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.459
 blood circulation and will leave this 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.140
 even more purple or red area will 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.580
 get more swollen this will give more 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.480
 stand out for tolerates that you want 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:53.060
 hide then always're tapping 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.160
 never rub even because if the employee 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.380
 it will take away the whole base it has 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.940
 low and this is not what the tucanato wants 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.160
 cover all gives good coverage and leaves 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.130
 everything in place then always with 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.609
 regardless of where tapping was 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.850
 We've always fought hard because 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.530
 otherwise we'll leave everything else 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.870
 reddish 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.510
 Good now that we've covered our 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.550
 skin with the base and corrective we go 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.410
 there are people who do not need them because 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.000
 your skin is already very fine 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.950
 but as makeup we will use 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.880
 during the day she runs the risk of 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.950
 to melt 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.919
 So it's good that we use the same powder. 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.450
 too light to seal it all 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.070
 that we put on the face so that 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.930
 take the risk of getting makeup 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.030
 found then I'll show you two options 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.650
 of products here that you can use 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.750
 two powder options 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.340
 the first is the translucent powder of dailus 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.460
 which is a powder that will not give you coverage 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.010
 he will simply know there it put 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.320
 on the face without adding cover then 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.169
 will not get heavy and as the dust is 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.720
 this one that gives lap that he is super light and 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:02.390
 has a very good coverage despite 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.280
 be lightweight and gives you a cover though 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.290
 you can choose to use the one you have 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.479
 home, I'm going to apply this here 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.010
 Snake that I really like with the brush. 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.270
 pretty cuddly powder 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.700
 first I will apply with more dedication 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.100
 in the region where I applied correction 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.740
 to seal this product well. 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:24.250
 I put it here to get everything in place. 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.250
 and then comes applying on the rest of the face 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.760
 then our skin is already late in the day 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.490
 we just really feel a lot of need 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.620
 to pass the owner to pass a bronze 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.500
 otherwise we could imagine 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.140
 That thing split up and I woke up beautiful for 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.120
 depreciate of health that aims 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.130
 rosadinha I opted for a coral blush 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.460
 This one gives birth to celebrate coral. 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.039
 people are like a coral not half rosy 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:02.050
 apply very little it is very limited 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:02.050
 so I shot the excess and applied on the apple 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.540
 and that's what we want for makeup 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.030
 destiny that is that thing loaded 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.010
 skin full of effects right 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.060
 unless you want it is not ugly it is not 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.130
 forbidden 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.290
 everything depends on what you want than you 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.080
 likes to use but we think 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.850
 very basic thing this is the ideal 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.890
 we are ready with our skin 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.050
 People, this is the finished skin. 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.420
 as you might see in the course of the video 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.610
 I already had eye makeup 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.290
 I just prepared my skin and makeup 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.970
 in the eyes the question of with the palette 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.300
 naked and on the lips 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:45.370
 I'm with the frozen lipstick 152 from laps 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.100
 You saw people who are nothing at all. 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:51.430
 elaborated a super basic skin but that 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:54.250
 Look, give an air of uad health. I woke up. 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.320

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.840

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.460

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.830
 and you saw that the heavens and the
