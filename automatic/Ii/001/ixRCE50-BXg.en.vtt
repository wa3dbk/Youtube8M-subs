well<00:04:28.980> I<00:04:29.250> guess<00:04:29.670> it<00:04:29.850> kind<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.150> does<00:04:30.330> work<00:04:31.310> one

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310

well I guess it kind of does work one
thing<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.550> find<00:04:32.730> rather<00:04:32.940> funny<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.570> actually

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
thing I find rather funny and actually

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.170

pretty<00:04:34.260> insulting<00:04:34.740> at<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.890> same<00:04:35.040> time<00:04:35.280> it's

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
pretty insulting at the same time it's

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.910 
pretty insulting at the same time it's
the<00:04:36.270> film<00:04:36.600> motion<00:04:36.960> video<00:04:37.230> that<00:04:37.380> plays<00:04:37.590> between
