girl like mine so they have the business
suits<00:00:33.320> which<00:00:34.320> again<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.620> mean<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> couple<00:00:35.160> look

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
to like balls and such but it's only in

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.420 
to like balls and such but it's only in
the<00:00:45.719> top<00:00:46.020> which<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.410> kind<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.710> weird<00:00:47.190> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the top which is kind of just weird I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.340 
the top which is kind of just weird I
mean<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.660> cool<00:00:48.899> summer

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the same exact item just a different

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.639 
the same exact item just a different
color<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.780> would<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.079> say<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> name<00:01:01.620> of

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649

color that it would just say the name of
the<00:01:01.859> item<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.460> could<00:01:02.640> select<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> color

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the item and you could select the color

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.840 
the item and you could select the color
for<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> price<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.100> way<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.339> couldn't

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
