00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.180
 In this class we are going to study about plant. 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.670
 low 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.459
 the ground floor is one of the main 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.830
 components of the architectural design and 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.740
 where we specify most of the 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.130
 project information 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.640
 the floor plan is generally a view 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.920
 or sectional topographic topography 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.740
 made on each floor by means of a 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.500
 horizontal secant projection plane 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.289
 imaginary position in order to 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.530
 select as many as possible 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.530
 elements 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.250
 the horizontal cut is usually 1.5 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.040
 feet tall 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.200
 if we are to develop a project 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.770
 architectural design of a 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.320
 single floor will have obvious need for a 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.950
 single floor plant which is the case of 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.860
 the base project used in the 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.199
 multi-storey buildings will be 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.800
 a low plant is required for each 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.710
 architecturally distinct pavement 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.830
 several different floors will have 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.170
 representation a single low plant 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.850
 called the low floor plan 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.730
 type 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.850
 for the other floors the title of the 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.100
 includes the designation of the floor by 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.040
 example first floor plant 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.040
 floor 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.130
 lower than the second basement floor plan 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.440
 ground floor cover and 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.170
 so on 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.520
 the usual scale for printing 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.430
 plants is from 1 to 50 it occurs that 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.170
 for certain buildings in function 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.660
 of its dimensions 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.580
 this scale can be very large and 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.310
 difficult to print 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:02.370
 in such cases 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:05.130
 scales from 1 to 75 and from 1 to 100 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.560
 the elements of a low plant are 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.430
 divided into constructive elements and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.430
 information 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.310
 are part of the constructive elements 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.980
 the walls and structural elements 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.610
 openings doors windows gates between 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.160
 other floors and their components 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.740
 and stair ramps among others 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.770
 construction equipment such as 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.830
 sanitary cabinets fireplaces appliances 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.360
 electrical appliances such as stoves 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.630
 refrigerators washing machines between 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.780
 other elements of visible importance 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.370
 which are reservoir ventilation ducts 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.390
 among others 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.769
 the walls usually in masonry 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.650
 selected by the cutting plane that 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.349
 generates the floor plan are represented 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.620
 through parallel lines of thickness 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:04.549
 may appear to be filled or not 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.650
 by solid color textures and or with or without 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.610
 representation of the coating of 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.640
 masonry 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.710
 see the example of representations of 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.710
 common wall types 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.520
 lower walls than the 1.50 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.860
 meters are not cut by the 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.470
 plan and consequently are 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.880
 represented in view with lines of 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.420
 average thickness 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.420
 see example 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.239
 elements in the projection 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.420
 construction sites located above the 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.390
 cutting of the floor plan and consequently 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.720
 not visible shall be represented in 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.980
 projection through dashed lines or 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.989
 line brings two points are so 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.470
 represented the eaves of the roofs 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.560
 we go from openings and mullions beams 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.650
 chimneys among others 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.700
 in the case of gradients and transitions 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.340
 of flats 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.190
 these should be represented with lines 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:18.049
 recommended that the use of rows in the 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:21.560
 thickness from 0.20 mm to 0.25 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:26.990
 millimeters for uneven sill ramps 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:29.360
 and steps and from 0.10 mm to 0.15 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.440
 millimeters for transition lines of 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.590
 floors 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.170
 the frames in general doors and windows 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:42.290
 can be represented in a way 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.290
 simplified or more detailed 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.680
 Fixed equipment such as dishwashers 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.620
 sanitary toilets and toilets 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.820
 kitchens sinks tanks can be 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.370
 represented 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.500
 using both blocks and lines 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.650
 individual 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:03.430
 floors should be represented with 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:07.120
 fine lines measuring between 0.09 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.830
 mm to 0.15 mm in color 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.950
 black or gray 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.940
 on the ground floor must contain the following 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.570
 Compartment Name Information 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.720
 useful areas of the compartments levels 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:27.240
 positions of the vertical cut planes 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.720
 dimensions of the openings dimensions and other 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.720
 information 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:37.190
 texts should be represented in 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:41.139
 numerous technical letters avoiding 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:44.830
 artistic and lavish sources 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:50.860
 the dimensions or dimensions follow the 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:53.469
 determinations of nbr 10 126 and nbr 6 492 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.349
 the quotas are formed by the following 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:58.719
 elements line of quota line of 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.229
 extension and completion of the 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.229
 quota 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:07.419
 the dimension line is the line containing the 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.759
 dimension of what is being quoted and 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.849
 in which the numerical value 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:15.270
 of quota 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:19.639
 the extension line is the line connecting the 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.639
 quotes the element being quoted 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.090
 the completion of dimension lines is a 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.840
 meeting the quota line with the 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.840
 extension 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.270
 The floor plan uses the symbol 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:36.610
 indicates level reference to inform 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.669
 certain points of the 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.710
 project should be given all 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.880
 different levels present in the plant 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.720
 low 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:50.380
 levels should always be stated 100 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.480
 meters and accompanied by the negative 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.480
 if they locate below the level of 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.850
 can optionally be used 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.240
 positive signal in the case of 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:04.640
 located above the reference level 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.620
 are always indicated with reference to the 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.570
 project zero level 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.850
 we conclude this class where we learn 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:17.400
 on one of the main components of the 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.400
 architectural design the floor plan
