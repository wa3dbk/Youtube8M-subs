00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.799 
match and they I think that made a
difference<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.760> end<00:01:02.879> there's<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> big<00:01:03.570> call

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
difference in the end there's a big call

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.210 
difference in the end there's a big call
in<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.170> frame<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.530> you've<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:05.010> mentioned

deference<00:02:10.709> because<00:02:10.860> I've<00:02:11.129> waited<00:02:11.280> for<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
deference because I've waited for the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.190 
deference because I've waited for the
double<00:02:11.760> when<00:02:11.879> there

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
double when there

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.500 
double when there

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
they read anyway and actually thought it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.839 
they read anyway and actually thought it
was<00:02:14.599> and<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.020> I've<00:02:15.319> if<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.220> doubled<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.610> read

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
was and so I've if I doubled the read

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.580 
was and so I've if I doubled the read
then<00:02:17.120> no<00:02:17.540> but<00:02:17.569> they<00:02:17.750> were<00:02:17.840> done<00:02:18.019> you<00:02:18.470> know

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
you you've had some very good results

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.570 
you you've had some very good results
this<00:02:29.480> season<00:02:29.870> you've<00:02:29.989> definitely<00:02:30.340> moved<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.550> a

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
this season you've definitely moved on a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.120 
this season you've definitely moved on a
year<00:02:31.849> from<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.840> last<00:02:33.019> couple<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.349> years<00:02:33.590> em

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
year from the last couple of years em

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.470 
year from the last couple of years em
yeah<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:35.390> say<00:02:36.880> it's<00:02:37.880> tossed<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.180> heart<00:02:38.330> I've

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
yeah but say it's tossed a heart I've

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.910 
yeah but say it's tossed a heart I've
thought<00:02:38.599> about<00:02:38.660> if<00:02:38.959> you<00:02:39.049> get<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.410> close<00:02:39.560> and

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
thought about if you get so close and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.900 
thought about if you get so close and
then<00:02:40.549> that<00:02:41.450> was<00:02:41.950> that's<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.099> bypass<00:02:43.430> all<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.760> mean

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
then that was that's a bypass all I mean

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.870 
then that was that's a bypass all I mean
that<00:02:44.030> don't<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:45.370> don't<00:02:46.370> really<00:02:46.519> know<00:02:46.700> how<00:02:46.819> to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
that don't I don't really know how to

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.550 
that don't I don't really know how to
take<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.120> one<00:02:47.390> it's<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.569> bad<00:02:47.750> result<00:02:47.870> system

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
take that one it's a bad result system

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.520 
take that one it's a bad result system
pulls<00:02:48.769> out<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.540> then<00:02:50.959> obviously<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.380> two

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
pulls out and and then obviously the two

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.780 
pulls out and and then obviously the two
things<00:02:51.739> I've<00:02:51.980> lost<00:02:52.160> I've<00:02:52.370> had<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.519> lot<00:02:52.700> of

the<00:05:20.870> course<00:05:21.440> investments<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:22.370> if<00:05:22.430> I<00:05:22.550> know

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
the course investments and if I know

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.250

Ronnie's<00:05:23.480> nobody<00:05:23.750> let<00:05:23.900> him<00:05:23.990> off<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.110> hook

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
that we had that and there I think

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:33.550 
that we had that and there I think
that'd<00:05:26.660> be<00:05:26.780> a<00:05:26.810> deference<00:05:32.170> wise<00:05:33.170> I<00:05:33.350> mean<00:05:33.500> a

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.930 
think it's what for that much they are
fair<00:06:24.170> enough<00:06:24.380> but<00:06:25.370> it's<00:06:25.520> not<00:06:25.550> going<00:06:25.730> to<00:06:25.820> work

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
fair enough but it's not going to work

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:33.510 
fair enough but it's not going to work
no<00:06:26.060> longer
