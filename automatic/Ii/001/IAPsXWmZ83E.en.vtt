the subject closer to the camera Roy we
change<00:01:50.040> things<00:01:50.250> around<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.700> little<00:01:50.790> bit<00:01:51.000> now

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
change things around a little bit now

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.899 
change things around a little bit now
and<00:01:51.450> these<00:01:52.290> two<00:01:52.530> soft<00:01:52.799> boxes<00:01:52.890> are<00:01:53.399> closer

and these two soft boxes are closer

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.810 
and these two soft boxes are closer
there<00:01:54.479> are<00:01:54.659> fifty<00:01:55.079> centimeters<00:01:55.649> away<00:01:56.399> now<00:01:56.759> and

there are fifty centimeters away now and

this one has been raised up a little bit

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.399 
this one has been raised up a little bit
and<00:01:58.799> that's<00:01:58.950> about<00:01:59.100> 70<00:01:59.670> centimeters<00:02:00.149> away

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
and that's about 70 centimeters away

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.780 
and that's about 70 centimeters away
still<00:02:01.409> got<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> reflected<00:02:02.340> em<00:02:02.490> along

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
still got the reflected em along

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.350 
still got the reflected em along
reflecting<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.659> some<00:02:04.049> light<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.240> as<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
reflecting that some light and as you

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.260 
reflecting that some light and as you
can<00:02:06.479> see<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.840> backdrop<00:02:07.259> now<00:02:07.469> has<00:02:08.250> starting<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
can see the backdrop now has starting to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.210 
can see the backdrop now has starting to
turn<00:02:09.539> rikes<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.410> we've<00:02:10.590> moved<00:02:10.800> away<00:02:11.039> from

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
turn rikes because we've moved away from

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.690 
turn rikes because we've moved away from
it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.790 
it
we're<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> meter<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.480> half<00:02:12.510> away<00:02:12.900> from<00:02:13.050> it

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
we're a meter and a half away from it

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.260 
we're a meter and a half away from it
and<00:02:14.240> it<00:02:15.240> shows<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.990> can<00:02:16.410> control<00:02:17.270> the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
and it shows you you can control the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.930 
and it shows you you can control the
light<00:02:18.590> on<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.950> camera<00:02:20.100> we're<00:02:20.520> shooting<00:02:20.850> a
