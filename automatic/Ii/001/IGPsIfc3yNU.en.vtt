may want to consider a larger set a lot
of<00:00:30.480> them<00:00:30.570> provide<00:00:30.750> very<00:00:31.140> good<00:00:31.380> sound<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:32.250> know

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
of them provide very good sound you know

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.920 
of them provide very good sound you know
they're<00:00:32.489> either<00:00:32.640> over<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> ear<00:00:33.329> models<00:00:33.750> or

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
they're either over the ear models or

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.600 
they're either over the ear models or
on-air<00:00:34.320> models<00:00:34.739> if<00:00:34.950> you're<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> be

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
on-air models if you're going to be

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.160 
on-air models if you're going to be
primarily<00:00:36.180> taking<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.600> show<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> road

your portable models that fold up in

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
your portable models that fold up in
carrying<00:00:50.550> cases<00:00:50.840> what<00:00:51.840> about<00:00:51.960> wireless

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
carrying cases what about wireless

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.139 
carrying cases what about wireless
headphones<00:00:53.010> we're<00:00:53.309> seeing<00:00:53.579> more<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.820> more<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
headphones we're seeing more and more of

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.479 
headphones we're seeing more and more of
them<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> our<00:00:55.110> tests<00:00:55.500> show<00:00:55.590> yeah<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
them what it our tests show yeah you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.010 
them what it our tests show yeah you
know<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:56.850> are<00:00:56.969> seeing<00:00:57.210> more<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> them<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.899> what

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
know we are seeing more of them and what

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.720 
know we are seeing more of them and what
we<00:00:58.140> found<00:00:58.350> really<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.430> sort<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
we found really is that it's sort of a

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.369 
we found really is that it's sort of a
trade-off<00:00:59.969> right<00:01:00.210> now<00:01:00.480> between<00:01:00.660> convenience

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
trade-off right now between convenience

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.500 
trade-off right now between convenience
and<00:01:01.590> sound<00:01:01.829> quality<00:01:02.340> typically<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> wired

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and sound quality typically the wired

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.359 
and sound quality typically the wired
models<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.199> better<00:01:04.439> from<00:01:04.680> overall<00:01:05.129> sound

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
models do better from overall sound

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.280 
models do better from overall sound
quality<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.090> there's<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.570> real<00:01:06.750> convenience

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
quality but there's a real convenience

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.929 
quality but there's a real convenience
aspect<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.860> some<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.159> wireless<00:01:08.580> models

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
aspect to some of the wireless models

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.670 
aspect to some of the wireless models
particularly<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.869> want<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> store<00:01:10.380> an

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
particularly if you want to store an

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.429 
particularly if you want to store an
audio<00:01:11.040> player<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> cell<00:01:12.180> phone<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.750> your<00:01:12.810> bag

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
audio player or a cell phone in your bag

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.499 
audio player or a cell phone in your bag
not<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.010> deal<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:15.299> nice

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
not have to deal with it it's nice

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.690 
not have to deal with it it's nice
having<00:01:15.900> wireless<00:01:16.259> capability<00:01:16.830> are<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.580> any

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
having wireless capability are there any

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.310 
having wireless capability are there any
features<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.360> jumped<00:01:18.659> out<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.810> us<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.200> we

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
features that jumped out at us that we

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.260 
features that jumped out at us that we
really<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.770> yeah<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> think<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.119> you're

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
really like yeah I think that if you're

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.730 
really like yeah I think that if you're
a<00:01:21.299> person<00:01:21.689> who<00:01:21.810> travels<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.290> lot<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.680> you

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
a person who travels a lot you know you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.200 
a person who travels a lot you know you
like<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.070> listen<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.369> music<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> subway

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
like to listen to music on the subway

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.940 
like to listen to music on the subway
you're<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.600> airplanes<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.500> should<00:01:25.680> consider

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
you're on airplanes you should consider

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.160 
you're on airplanes you should consider
a<00:01:26.070> noise<00:01:26.280> isolating<00:01:26.939> or<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> noise<00:01:27.570> cancelling

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
a noise isolating or a noise cancelling

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
a noise isolating or a noise cancelling
model<00:01:28.500> we're<00:01:29.009> also<00:01:29.130> seeing<00:01:29.430> different

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
model we're also seeing different

when I'm

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.740 
when I'm
yeah<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.430> mean<00:02:14.610> if<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:14.910> can<00:02:15.060> get<00:02:15.180> into<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> store

yeah I mean if you can get into a store

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.210 
yeah I mean if you can get into a store
and<00:02:15.780> check<00:02:16.110> them<00:02:16.319> out<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.830> know<00:02:16.920> sound

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220

quality and comfort of both subjective

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.630 
quality and comfort of both subjective
so<00:02:19.080> if<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:19.590> actually<00:02:19.739> try<00:02:20.069> them<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.370> it's
