00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.590 
that by removing an opponent support
point<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.959> will<00:02:40.110> be<00:02:40.350> able<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:41.390> make<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
point you will be able to make the

areas<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.560> board<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.100> means<00:02:47.700> that

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
areas on the board and that means that

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.880 
areas on the board and that means that
maybe<00:02:48.239> some<00:02:48.600> leaders<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.200> could<00:02:49.560> have<00:02:49.680> been

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
maybe some leaders that could have been

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.680 
maybe some leaders that could have been
wildcards<00:02:50.700> during<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.970> struggle<00:02:51.209> become

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
wildcards during the struggle become

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.449 
wildcards during the struggle become
completely<00:02:51.989> useless<00:02:52.050> cards<00:02:52.739> because<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
completely useless cards because the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.340 
completely useless cards because the
only<00:02:53.580> player<00:02:53.820> does<00:02:54.030> not<00:02:54.330> have<00:02:54.600> control<00:02:55.140> of

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
only player does not have control of

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.380 
only player does not have control of
that<00:02:55.440> here<00:02:55.800> anymore<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:56.850> very<00:02:57.150> mean

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
that here anymore so this is a very mean

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.740 
that here anymore so this is a very mean
card<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.200> play<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.400> very<00:02:59.700> effective<00:03:00.030> so

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
card to play but it is very effective so

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.550

great<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:02.220> attack<00:04:02.610> was<00:04:03.260> was<00:04:04.260> stopped<00:04:04.680> and

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
great that attack was was stopped and

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.910 
great that attack was was stopped and
then<00:04:05.250> these<00:04:05.400> two<00:04:05.640> cards<00:04:05.940> are<00:04:06.739> discarded<00:04:07.739> but

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
then these two cards are discarded but

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.920 
then these two cards are discarded but
before<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.640> happens<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.299> defender<00:04:09.900> that

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
before that happens the defender that

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.770 
before that happens the defender that
managed<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.560> successfully<00:04:11.040> defend<00:04:11.630> gets<00:04:12.630> a

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
managed to successfully defend gets a

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.340 
managed to successfully defend gets a
chance<00:04:13.019> of<00:04:13.980> stealing<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:15.180> initiative<00:04:16.049> from

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
chance of stealing the initiative from

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.949 
chance of stealing the initiative from
the<00:04:16.590> opponent<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.609> do<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.329> defender<00:04:18.750> rolls

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
the opponent to do so the defender rolls

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.860 
the opponent to do so the defender rolls
a<00:04:19.169> die<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.739> must<00:04:20.459> roll<00:04:20.849> the<00:04:21.120> number<00:04:21.479> printed

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
a die and must roll the number printed

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.550 
a die and must roll the number printed
on<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.200> card<00:04:22.530> of<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.400> attacker

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
on the card of the attacker

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.950 
on the card of the attacker
I'll<00:04:24.980> match<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.460> number<00:04:25.760> or<00:04:25.940> exceeded<00:04:26.720> so

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
I'll match the number or exceeded so

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.379 
I'll match the number or exceeded so
four<00:04:27.260> or<00:04:27.530> more<00:04:27.860> in<00:04:28.490> this<00:04:28.639> case<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:28.970> defender

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
four or more in this case the defender

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.970 
four or more in this case the defender
was<00:04:29.540> able<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.930> steal<00:04:30.169> initially<00:04:30.620> these<00:04:30.770> two

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
was able to steal initially these two

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.400 
was able to steal initially these two
cars<00:04:31.250> are<00:04:31.460> discard<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.150> now<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.780> defender

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
cars are discard and now the defender

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.250 
cars are discard and now the defender
will<00:04:33.590> play<00:04:33.919> a<00:04:34.160> card<00:04:34.610> from<00:04:35.060> his<00:04:35.210> hand<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.840> now

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
will play a card from his hand and now

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.830 
will play a card from his hand and now
it<00:04:36.530> is<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:37.160> suppose<00:04:37.940> this<00:04:38.120> is<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.270> card<00:04:38.540> and

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
it is the suppose this is the card and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.050 
it is the suppose this is the card and
now<00:04:39.020> it<00:04:39.139> is<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.590> opponent<00:04:40.130> that<00:04:40.310> must<00:04:40.580> play<00:04:40.850> a

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
now it is the opponent that must play a

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.360 
now it is the opponent that must play a
card<00:04:41.450> to<00:04:41.750> defend<00:04:42.110> against<00:04:42.410> that<00:04:42.620> suppose<00:04:43.100> that

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
card to defend against that suppose that

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.940 
card to defend against that suppose that
the<00:04:43.460> opponent<00:04:43.940> has<00:04:44.030> control<00:04:45.020> of<00:04:45.050> elites<00:04:45.440> no

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
the opponent has control of elites no

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.280 
the opponent has control of elites no
marches<00:04:46.610> left<00:04:46.940> in<00:04:47.090> his<00:04:47.240> hands<00:04:47.690> so<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:48.020> plays

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
marches left in his hands so it plays

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.860 
marches left in his hands so it plays
the<00:04:48.530> elite<00:04:48.770> leader<00:04:49.010> as<00:04:49.250> a<00:04:49.970> march<00:04:50.300> but<00:04:50.600> then<00:04:50.780> he

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
the elite leader as a march but then he

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.670 
the elite leader as a march but then he
has<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.260> roll<00:04:51.440> a<00:04:52.030> six<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:54.320> doesn't

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
has to roll a six and that doesn't

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.740 
has to roll a six and that doesn't
happen<00:04:54.830> so<00:04:55.280> d<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:56.090> this<00:04:56.210> case<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:56.540> attacker

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
happen so d in this case the attacker

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.960 
happen so d in this case the attacker
still<00:04:57.169> has<00:04:57.410> initiative<00:04:57.979> also<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.729> attacker

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
still has initiative also the attacker

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.060 
still has initiative also the attacker
now<00:04:59.360> knows<00:04:59.720> that<00:04:59.750> the<00:05:00.229> defender<00:05:00.710> doesn't<00:05:00.979> have

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
now knows that the defender doesn't have

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.360 
now knows that the defender doesn't have
any<00:05:01.220> marches<00:05:01.610> anymore<00:05:02.030> why<00:05:02.270> would<00:05:02.690> have<00:05:02.930> the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
any marches anymore why would have the

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.340 
any marches anymore why would have the
defender<00:05:04.370> use<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.820> leader<00:05:05.060> otherwise<00:05:05.479> so<00:05:05.960> the

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
defender use a leader otherwise so the

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.950 
defender use a leader otherwise so the
attacker<00:05:07.280> may<00:05:07.610> try<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:07.910> capitalize<00:05:08.660> on<00:05:08.690> that

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
attacker may try to capitalize on that

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.730 
attacker may try to capitalize on that
information<00:05:09.700> and<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.870> power<00:05:12.200> struggle

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
information and the power struggle

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.840 
information and the power struggle
continues<00:05:13.580> like<00:05:14.060> this<00:05:14.090> for<00:05:14.870> several<00:05:15.350> rounds

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
continues like this for several rounds

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.950 
continues like this for several rounds
the<00:05:16.850> attacker<00:05:17.470> launches<00:05:18.470> attacks<00:05:18.620> by<00:05:19.340> using

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
the attacker launches attacks by using

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.170 
the attacker launches attacks by using
cards<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.139> the<00:05:21.320> defender<00:05:21.860> must<00:05:22.190> defend<00:05:22.729> again

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
cards and the defender must defend again

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.710 
cards and the defender must defend again
by<00:05:23.360> matching<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:24.350> card<00:05:24.650> that<00:05:25.010> was<00:05:25.280> played<00:05:25.910> the

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
by matching the card that was played the

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.590 
by matching the card that was played the
game<00:05:26.930> continues<00:05:27.410> until<00:05:28.040> the<00:05:28.310> defender<00:05:28.970> cannot

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
game continues until the defender cannot

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.590 
game continues until the defender cannot
defend<00:05:30.320> against<00:05:31.220> the<00:05:31.430> card<00:05:31.880> of<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.180> attacker

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
defend against the card of the attacker

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.510 
defend against the card of the attacker
and<00:05:33.080> at<00:05:33.260> that<00:05:33.440> point<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:33.860> struggle<00:05:34.220> is<00:05:34.340> over

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
and at that point the struggle is over

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.360 
and at that point the struggle is over
and<00:05:34.970> the<00:05:35.180> attacker<00:05:35.479> wins<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.229> struggle<00:05:36.860> the

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
and the attacker wins the struggle the

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.880 
and the attacker wins the struggle the
defender<00:05:37.910> cannot<00:05:38.419> win<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.380> struggle<00:05:39.620> the

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
defender cannot win the struggle the

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.860 
defender cannot win the struggle the
defender<00:05:40.250> can<00:05:40.370> only<00:05:40.520> defend<00:05:40.940> then<00:05:41.450> try<00:05:41.810> to

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
defender can only defend then try to

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.810 
defender can only defend then try to
grab<00:05:42.260> initiative<00:05:42.800> and<00:05:43.010> once<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.490> defender

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
grab initiative and once the defender

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.159 
grab initiative and once the defender
has<00:05:43.880> initially<00:05:44.360> and<00:05:44.479> becomes<00:05:44.780> the<00:05:44.900> attacker

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
has initially and becomes the attacker

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.950 
has initially and becomes the attacker
then<00:05:45.890> he<00:05:46.280> gets<00:05:46.520> a<00:05:46.640> chance<00:05:46.669> of<00:05:47.210> winning<00:05:47.690> the

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
then he gets a chance of winning the

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.350 
then he gets a chance of winning the
game<00:05:47.990> of<00:05:48.530> winning<00:05:49.100> the<00:05:49.190> power<00:05:49.370> struggle<00:05:49.850> so

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
game of winning the power struggle so

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.610 
game of winning the power struggle so
the<00:05:51.260> defender<00:05:51.680> can<00:05:51.860> wholly<00:05:52.070> well<00:05:52.370> defend<00:05:53.620> also

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
the defender can wholly well defend also

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.430 
the defender can wholly well defend also
if<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:54.979> attacker<00:05:55.450> does<00:05:56.450> not<00:05:56.720> have<00:05:56.900> any<00:05:57.020> card

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
if the attacker does not have any card

if the attacker does not have any card
the<00:05:58.250> displayable<00:05:59.030> may<00:05:59.300> be<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.510> attackers<00:05:59.840> and

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
the displayable may be the attackers and

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.200 
the displayable may be the attackers and
no<00:06:00.139> cards<00:06:00.500> left<00:06:00.590> at<00:06:01.100> all<00:06:01.310> or<00:06:01.700> the<00:06:01.940> attacker

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
no cards left at all or the attacker

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.159 
no cards left at all or the attacker
only<00:06:02.539> has<00:06:02.750> useless<00:06:03.260> leaders<00:06:03.680> then<00:06:04.310> that<00:06:05.169> then

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
only has useless leaders then that then

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.440 
only has useless leaders then that then
the<00:06:06.470> attacker<00:06:06.889> loses<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.639> power<00:06:07.850> struggle

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
the attacker loses the power struggle

from the raising of the stakes at the

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.540 
from the raising of the stakes at the

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550 
beginning of the struggle and of course

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.420 
beginning of the struggle and of course
and<00:07:01.820> it<00:07:01.910> is<00:07:02.060> great<00:07:02.330> when<00:07:03.170> with<00:07:03.710> a<00:07:03.740> rally<00:07:04.100> but

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
and it is great when with a rally but

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.580 
and it is great when with a rally but
it's<00:07:04.580> not<00:07:04.790> that<00:07:05.030> easy<00:07:05.090> because<00:07:05.570> the<00:07:05.990> number<00:07:06.410> on

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590 
it's not that easy because the number on

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.640 
it's not that easy because the number on
the<00:07:07.010> rally<00:07:07.160> cards<00:07:07.820> is<00:07:08.390> 1<00:07:08.870> so<00:07:09.170> as<00:07:09.230> soon<00:07:09.320> as<00:07:09.440> you

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
the rally cards is 1 so as soon as you

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.590 
the rally cards is 1 so as soon as you
play<00:07:10.070> that<00:07:10.790> card

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:11.600 
play that card

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.170 
play that card
if<00:07:11.690> the<00:07:12.140> defender<00:07:12.980> can<00:07:13.280> defend<00:07:13.640> against<00:07:13.970> it

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180 
if the defender can defend against it

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.700 
if the defender can defend against it
then<00:07:14.420> the<00:07:14.600> defender<00:07:14.990> clearly<00:07:15.320> will<00:07:15.470> be<00:07:15.500> able

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:15.710 
then the defender clearly will be able

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.380 
then the defender clearly will be able
to<00:07:15.980> roll<00:07:16.100> one<00:07:16.310> or<00:07:16.490> more<00:07:16.670> so<00:07:17.000> you<00:07:17.060> lose

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:17.390 
to roll one or more so you lose

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.320 
to roll one or more so you lose
initiative<00:07:17.870> immediately<00:07:18.440> and<00:07:18.890> as<00:07:19.700> the

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
initiative immediately and as the

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.480 
initiative immediately and as the
Democrat<00:07:21.110> player<00:07:21.380> you<00:07:21.710> should<00:07:21.740> really<00:07:22.250> try

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490 
Democrat player you should really try

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.550 
Democrat player you should really try
not<00:07:22.910> just<00:07:23.180> to<00:07:23.420> win<00:07:23.630> the<00:07:23.810> struggles<00:07:24.350> well

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
not just to win the struggles well

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.720 
not just to win the struggles well
that's<00:07:24.740> pretty<00:07:24.950> important<00:07:25.340> um<00:07:25.400> but<00:07:25.520> it<00:07:25.610> may

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:25.730 
that's pretty important um but it may

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.310 
that's pretty important um but it may
not<00:07:25.760> be<00:07:26.090> sufficient<00:07:26.270> you<00:07:26.780> need<00:07:26.900> to<00:07:27.050> win<00:07:27.200> the
