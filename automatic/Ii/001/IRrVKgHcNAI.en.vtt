00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
having us I've heard of fat grafting

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
having us I've heard of fat grafting
it's<00:00:35.879> something<00:00:36.269> it's<00:00:36.449> not<00:00:36.660> new<00:00:37.019> but<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.469> is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it's something it's not new but it is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.279 
it's something it's not new but it is
great<00:00:38.010> gaining<00:00:38.399> more<00:00:38.550> popularity<00:00:39.289> absolutely

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
great gaining more popularity absolutely

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.110 
great gaining more popularity absolutely
tests<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.070> we've<00:00:41.460> finally<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> think

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
tests what we've finally I think

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.569 
tests what we've finally I think
realized<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.280> rejuvenating<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> face

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
realized is that rejuvenating the face

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.099 
realized is that rejuvenating the face
isn't<00:00:45.449> really<00:00:45.690> about<00:00:46.129> higher<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.399> tighter

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
isn't really about higher and tighter

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.689 
isn't really about higher and tighter
all<00:00:49.109> of<00:00:49.350> our<00:00:49.440> procedures<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:50.219> until<00:00:50.609> about

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
all of our procedures up until about

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.430 
all of our procedures up until about
this<00:00:51.000> point<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.960> been<00:00:52.170> very

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
this point have been very

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.410 
this point have been very
two-dimensional<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> face<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.089> very

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
two-dimensional but the face is very

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.729 
two-dimensional but the face is very
three-dimensional<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.589> we're

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
three-dimensional and so what we're

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.590 
three-dimensional and so what we're
trying<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.339> is<00:00:56.609> restore<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> volume<00:00:57.269> in

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
trying to do is restore the volume in

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.540 
trying to do is restore the volume in
the<00:00:57.660> face<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.469> injectables<00:00:59.370> both

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the face with injectables both

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.759 
the face with injectables both
commercial<00:01:00.089> and<00:01:00.199> ultimately<00:01:01.199> using<00:01:01.559> your<00:01:01.679> own

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
commercial and ultimately using your own

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.979 
commercial and ultimately using your own
fat<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.909> face<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.390> loses<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
fat because the face actually loses a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.290 
fat because the face actually loses a
tremendous<00:01:04.530> amount<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.890> volume<00:01:05.100> beginning<00:01:06.030> in

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
tremendous amount of volume beginning in

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.120 
tremendous amount of volume beginning in
your<00:01:06.420> 30s<00:01:06.840> 40s<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.410> 50s<00:01:07.590> okay<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.440> Kim<00:01:10.440> who's

and on a cost basis it's very very
affordable<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.600> get<00:01:57.750> very<00:01:58.050> nice

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
up so where does the fat come from how

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.950 
up so where does the fat come from how
do<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.700> get<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.060> out<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:42.330> how<00:02:42.540> do<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.720> put<00:02:42.870> it

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
do you get it out and how do you put it

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.600 
do you get it out and how do you put it
in<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.380> that's<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.800> beauty<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.280> we<00:02:44.430> can

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
in and that's the beauty of it we can

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.100 
in and that's the beauty of it we can
actually<00:02:44.760> do<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.210> procedure<00:02:45.540> right<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.020> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
actually do this procedure right in the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.900 
actually do this procedure right in the
office<00:02:46.290> under<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.770> little<00:02:46.950> bit<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.220> local<00:02:47.670> and

office under a little bit of local and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.240 
office under a little bit of local and
it<00:02:48.750> doesn't<00:02:49.020> require<00:02:49.140> general<00:02:49.500> anesthesia<00:02:49.860> we

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
it doesn't require general anesthesia we

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.870 
it doesn't require general anesthesia we
take<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.580> from<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> patient's<00:02:51.300> own<00:02:51.480> body<00:02:51.900> and

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
take it from the patient's own body and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.840 
take it from the patient's own body and
it's<00:02:53.880> very<00:02:54.630> reasonable<00:02:55.500> as<00:02:56.160> far<00:02:56.430> as<00:02:56.580> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
it's very reasonable as far as the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.660 
it's very reasonable as far as the
recovery<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.570> cost<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.320> per<00:02:58.590> CC<00:02:59.070> basis<00:02:59.520> is

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
recovery the cost on a per CC basis is

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.130 
recovery the cost on a per CC basis is
actually<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.090> cheapest<00:03:00.540> filler<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.900> you

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
actually the cheapest filler that you

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.200 
actually the cheapest filler that you
can<00:03:01.350> do<00:03:01.500> how<00:03:01.740> long<00:03:01.800> does<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.400> last<00:03:02.460> how<00:03:02.880> often

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
can do how long does this last how often

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.860 
can do how long does this last how often
do<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.330> have<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.570> get<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.840> done<00:03:03.990> if<00:03:04.440> we<00:03:04.710> if<00:03:05.280> we

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
do you have to get it done if we if we

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.250 
do you have to get it done if we if we
do<00:03:06.870> at<00:03:07.320> least<00:03:08.120> one<00:03:09.120> full<00:03:09.570> session<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.140> one

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
do at least one full session and one

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.600 
do at least one full session and one
touch-up<00:03:10.680> session<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.070> can<00:03:11.190> get<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> good

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
touch-up session you can get a good

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.910 
touch-up session you can get a good
10-year<00:03:12.090> result<00:03:12.450> from<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.660> we<00:03:13.530> think<00:03:13.770> that

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
10-year result from that we think that

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.460 
10-year result from that we think that
at<00:03:14.010> least<00:03:14.040> 50%<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.360> fat<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.900> we<00:03:16.020> put<00:03:16.290> in

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
at least 50% of the fat that we put in

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.590 
at least 50% of the fat that we put in
stays<00:03:16.920> permanently<00:03:17.400> with<00:03:17.940> each<00:03:18.120> injection

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
stays permanently with each injection

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.440 
stays permanently with each injection
and<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.530> by<00:03:19.739> building<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.520> you're<00:03:21.239> actually

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
and so by building that you're actually

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.420 
and so by building that you're actually
restoring<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.200> three-dimensional<00:03:22.950> volume

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
restoring the three-dimensional volume

difference<00:03:34.650> by<00:03:34.739> putting<00:03:34.980> into<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.280> cheeks

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
difference by putting into the cheeks

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.010 
difference by putting into the cheeks
you<00:03:35.610> said<00:03:35.880> right<00:03:36.090> well<00:03:36.330> that's<00:03:36.600> that's

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
you said right well that's that's

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.650 
you said right well that's that's
somewhat<00:03:37.500> age<00:03:37.680> dependent<00:03:38.280> because<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:39.480> begin

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
somewhat age dependent because you begin

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.040 
somewhat age dependent because you begin
losing<00:03:40.170> fat<00:03:40.620> around<00:03:41.520> your<00:03:41.850> eyes<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.959> around

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
losing fat around your eyes and around

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.560 
losing fat around your eyes and around
the<00:03:43.260> mouth<00:03:43.500> but<00:03:43.890> ultimately<00:03:44.370> most<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.510> the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
the mouth but ultimately most of the

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.360 
the mouth but ultimately most of the
facial<00:03:45.930> fat<00:03:46.110> goes<00:03:46.380> away<00:03:46.680> by<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.950> time<00:03:47.190> you're

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
facial fat goes away by the time you're

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.949 
facial fat goes away by the time you're
in<00:03:47.400> your<00:03:47.550> 60s<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.090> 70s<00:03:48.209> so<00:03:48.630> we're<00:03:48.780> actually

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
in your 60s and 70s so we're actually

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.300 
in your 60s and 70s so we're actually
grafting<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.830> entire<00:03:50.580> face<00:03:51.980> losing<00:03:52.980> fat<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.280> a

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
grafting the entire face losing fat is a

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.130 
grafting the entire face losing fat is a
good<00:03:53.550> thing<00:03:53.760> but<00:03:53.910> it's<00:03:54.060> making<00:03:54.209> us<00:03:54.450> age<00:03:54.660> that's

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
good thing but it's making us age that's

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.840 
good thing but it's making us age that's
right<00:03:55.410> that's<00:03:55.650> that's<00:03:55.890> what<00:03:56.190> gravity<00:03:56.430> pulls

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
right that's that's what gravity pulls

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.790 
right that's that's what gravity pulls
on<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.239> that's<00:03:57.360> why<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.570> sag<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.320> so<00:03:58.500> instead

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
on and that's why you sag and so instead

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.160 
on and that's why you sag and so instead
of<00:03:58.920> doing<00:03:59.340> these<00:04:00.000> two<00:04:00.270> dimensional<00:04:00.780> sort<00:04:01.080> of

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
of doing these two dimensional sort of

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.500 
of doing these two dimensional sort of
higher<00:04:01.380> titer<00:04:01.800> you<00:04:02.190> know<00:04:02.310> Joan<00:04:03.030> Rivers<00:04:03.330> type

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
higher titer you know Joan Rivers type

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.510 
higher titer you know Joan Rivers type
of<00:04:03.660> facelifts<00:04:04.110> you<00:04:04.290> know<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:05.070> definitely<00:04:05.190> had

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
of facelifts you know it definitely had

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.920 
of facelifts you know it definitely had
a<00:04:05.550> more<00:04:05.730> natural<00:04:06.090> look<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.330> that's<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:06.750> much

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
a more natural look like that's a much

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.050 
a more natural look like that's a much
more<00:04:07.110> natural<00:04:07.320> all<00:04:07.800> right<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.160> with<00:04:08.340> Kim<00:04:08.610> who's

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
more natural all right so with Kim who's

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.430 
more natural all right so with Kim who's
who's<00:04:09.330> here<00:04:09.510> who's<00:04:09.720> beautiful<00:04:10.140> already

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
who's here who's beautiful already

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.990 
who's here who's beautiful already
doesn't<00:04:11.010> need<00:04:11.130> any<00:04:11.250> work<00:04:11.489> but<00:04:11.670> what<00:04:11.820> are<00:04:11.910> you

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
doesn't need any work but what are you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.390 
doesn't need any work but what are you
gonna<00:04:12.120> be<00:04:12.300> doing<00:04:12.540> with<00:04:12.660> her<00:04:12.690> well<00:04:13.370> two<00:04:14.370> days

gonna be doing with her well two days

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.190 
gonna be doing with her well two days
ago<00:04:14.850> we<00:04:15.030> just<00:04:15.180> injected<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:15.810> little<00:04:16.019> bit<00:04:16.109> of

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
ago we just injected a little bit of

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.770 
ago we just injected a little bit of
Sculptra<00:04:16.739> into<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.310> cheek<00:04:17.549> areas<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.269> under

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
Sculptra into the cheek areas and under

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.650 
Sculptra into the cheek areas and under
her<00:04:18.959> nasolabial<00:04:19.799> creases<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:20.850> that's<00:04:21.359> helped

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
her nasolabial creases and that's helped

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.840 
her nasolabial creases and that's helped
to<00:04:21.810> lift<00:04:22.109> them<00:04:22.320> out<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:23.100> think<00:04:23.310> we<00:04:23.550> do<00:04:23.640> that

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
to lift them out and I think we do that

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.610 
to lift them out and I think we do that
before<00:04:24.000> picture<00:04:24.360> yeah<00:04:24.720> before<00:04:25.050> picture<00:04:25.590> you

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
before picture yeah before picture you

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.260 
before picture yeah before picture you
can<00:04:25.860> see<00:04:25.979> this<00:04:26.160> way<00:04:26.340> for<00:04:26.550> me<00:04:26.669> Kim<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:26.970> there<00:04:27.120> you

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
can see this way for me Kim so there you

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.930 
can see this way for me Kim so there you
go<00:04:27.390> so<00:04:27.419> we<00:04:27.600> just

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
go so we just

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.670 
go so we just
it<00:04:28.090> straight<00:04:28.390> yeah<00:04:28.780> so<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.080> think<00:04:29.260> that<00:04:29.440> we've

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
it straight yeah so I think that we've

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.410 
it straight yeah so I think that we've
really<00:04:29.710> done<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.250> nice<00:04:30.460> job<00:04:30.520> building<00:04:31.090> the

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
really done a nice job building the

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.060 
really done a nice job building the
deeper<00:04:31.810> tissue<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.290> that's<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.560> thing<00:04:32.740> you

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
deeper tissue and that's the thing you

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.810 
deeper tissue and that's the thing you
really<00:04:33.100> have<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.580> know<00:04:33.610> the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
really have to know the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.700 
really have to know the
three-dimensional<00:04:34.420> anatomy<00:04:34.900> of<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.260> face<00:04:35.440> so

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
three-dimensional anatomy of the face so

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.200 
three-dimensional anatomy of the face so
that<00:04:35.740> you<00:04:35.920> can<00:04:36.280> build<00:04:36.640> it<00:04:36.910> with<00:04:37.090> the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
that you can build it with the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.330 
that you can build it with the
appropriate<00:04:37.690> filler<00:04:38.050> so<00:04:38.830> we're<00:04:39.010> just<00:04:39.040> going

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
appropriate filler so we're just going

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.280 
appropriate filler so we're just going
to<00:04:39.400> add<00:04:39.550> an<00:04:39.880> enhance<00:04:40.480> just<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.870> little<00:04:41.110> bit

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
to add an enhance just a little bit

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.170 
to add an enhance just a little bit
along<00:04:41.680> her<00:04:42.280> nasal<00:04:42.520> labial<00:04:43.000> lines<00:04:43.030> okay<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.940> so

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
along her nasal labial lines okay and so

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.790 
along her nasal labial lines okay and so
this<00:04:46.390> would<00:04:46.540> normally<00:04:46.690> done<00:04:47.080> been<00:04:47.320> had<00:04:47.620> been

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
this would normally done been had been

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.170 
this would normally done been had been
been<00:04:48.070> done<00:04:48.220> in<00:04:48.340> an<00:04:48.400> office<00:04:48.670> that's<00:04:48.820> correct

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.780 
begin to degrade and so it has to be
maintained<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:17.800> longer<00:05:18.220> than<00:05:18.370> something<00:05:18.550> like
