shows up nicely on a light or a dark

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.290 
shows up nicely on a light or a dark
fabric<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.640> very<00:02:11.849> versatile

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
fabric so it's very versatile

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.330 
fabric so it's very versatile
and<00:02:13.410> they<00:02:14.410> cost<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.800> little<00:02:14.920> bit<00:02:15.070> maybe

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
and they cost you a little bit maybe

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.900 
and they cost you a little bit maybe
about<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:16.890> 15<00:02:17.890> dollar<00:02:18.040> mark<00:02:18.370> but<00:02:18.760> it's

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
about a 15 dollar mark but it's

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.940 
about a 15 dollar mark but it's
definitely<00:02:19.120> worth<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.720> investment<00:02:19.840> for<00:02:20.440> for

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
definitely worth the investment for for

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.630 
definitely worth the investment for for
what<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.190> does<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:22.060> how<00:02:22.120> helpful<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:22.870> and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
what it does and how helpful it is and

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.930 
what it does and how helpful it is and
our<00:02:24.640> sewing<00:02:24.880> gauge<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:27.340> something<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.910> I

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
our sewing gauge and is something that I

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.360 
our sewing gauge and is something that I
use<00:02:28.270> quite<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> lot<00:02:29.080> now<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.530> if<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:29.980> had<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.160> from

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
use quite a lot now and if I had it from

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.880 
use quite a lot now and if I had it from
the<00:02:30.490> beginning<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:31.030> would<00:02:31.290> use<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.590> nearly

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the beginning I would use it in nearly

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.400 
the beginning I would use it in nearly
everything<00:02:33.130> that<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.520> do<00:02:33.600> so<00:02:34.600> you<00:02:34.660> could<00:02:35.080> use<00:02:35.230> as

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
everything that I do so you could use as

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.080 
everything that I do so you could use as
just<00:02:35.710> a<00:02:36.060> small<00:02:37.060> general<00:02:37.390> ruler<00:02:38.460> or<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:39.970> has

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
just a small general ruler or and it has

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.850 
just a small general ruler or and it has
a<00:02:40.120> gauge<00:02:40.390> here<00:02:40.630> if<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:40.990> need<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.230> measure

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
a gauge here if you need to measure

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.970 
a gauge here if you need to measure
certain<00:02:42.220> distances<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:44.050> where<00:02:44.830> you're

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
certain distances so where you're

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
certain distances so where you're
placing<00:02:45.160> things<00:02:45.490> especially<00:02:45.820> if<00:02:45.910> you're

doing<00:02:46.090> application<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.900> need<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.200> measure

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
doing application you need to measure

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.820 
doing application you need to measure
the<00:02:48.970> distance<00:02:49.390> between<00:02:49.710> where<00:02:50.710> your

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
and just use that to measure quite

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.510 
and just use that to measure quite
easily<00:04:47.190> rather<00:04:47.789> than<00:04:48.060> having<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:49.340> to<00:04:50.340> use

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
easily rather than having to to use

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.909 
easily rather than having to to use
something<00:04:50.910> else<00:04:51.090> maybe<00:04:51.539> yet<00:04:51.810> almost<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.470> solid

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
something else maybe yet almost a solid

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.330 
something else maybe yet almost a solid
straight<00:04:53.130> ruler<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:55.789> now<00:04:56.789> if<00:04:57.120> you're<00:04:57.300> doing

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
straight ruler and now if you're doing

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.120 
straight ruler and now if you're doing
say<00:04:59.340> more<00:04:59.610> quilting<00:05:00.030> type<00:05:00.449> sewing<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:01.130> would

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
say more quilting type sewing I would

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.149 
say more quilting type sewing I would
definitely<00:05:02.639> recommend<00:05:02.990> you<00:05:03.990> get<00:05:04.199> a<00:05:04.530> rotary

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
definitely recommend you get a rotary

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.350 
definitely recommend you get a rotary
cutter<00:05:06.319> especially<00:05:07.319> one<00:05:07.849> has<00:05:08.849> the<00:05:09.000> built-in

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
cutter especially one has the built-in

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.559 
cutter especially one has the built-in
safety<00:05:09.949> this<00:05:10.949> one's<00:05:11.159> a<00:05:11.250> 45<00:05:11.729> millimeter<00:05:12.210> rotary

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
safety this one's a 45 millimeter rotary

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.249 
safety this one's a 45 millimeter rotary
cutter<00:05:12.870> and<00:05:13.639> make<00:05:14.639> quite<00:05:14.819> common<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:16.099> ruler<00:05:17.099> and

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
cutter and make quite common a ruler and

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.839 
cutter and make quite common a ruler and
on<00:05:19.259> the<00:05:19.500> bottom<00:05:19.740> here<00:05:20.039> you'll<00:05:20.190> see<00:05:20.400> my<00:05:20.550> cutting

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
on the bottom here you'll see my cutting

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.730 
on the bottom here you'll see my cutting
mat<00:05:20.880> now<00:05:21.659> if<00:05:21.750> you<00:05:21.840> get<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.020> cutting<00:05:22.259> mat<00:05:22.500> I'd

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
mat now if you get a cutting mat I'd

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.779 
mat now if you get a cutting mat I'd
recommend<00:05:23.400> getting<00:05:23.819> an<00:05:24.590> 18<00:05:25.590> by<00:05:25.919> 24<00:05:26.370> inch

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
recommend getting an 18 by 24 inch

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.659 
recommend getting an 18 by 24 inch
cutting<00:05:27.120> mat<00:05:27.389> and<00:05:28.009> that'd<00:05:29.009> probably<00:05:29.159> be<00:05:29.490> the

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
cutting mat and that'd probably be the

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.200 
cutting mat and that'd probably be the
smallest<00:05:29.969> that<00:05:30.300> I<00:05:30.360> would<00:05:30.539> go<00:05:31.009> okay<00:05:32.009> and<00:05:32.400> and<00:05:33.090> my

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
smallest that I would go okay and and my

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.860 
smallest that I would go okay and and my
ruler<00:05:33.560> is<00:05:34.560> a<00:05:34.620> 24<00:05:35.280> inch<00:05:35.490> ruler<00:05:36.090> as<00:05:36.360> well<00:05:36.570> so<00:05:36.719> it's

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
ruler is a 24 inch ruler as well so it's

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.050 
ruler is a 24 inch ruler as well so it's
about<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.139> same<00:05:37.169> length<00:05:37.650> as<00:05:37.979> the<00:05:38.610> cutting<00:05:38.789> mat

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
about the same length as the cutting mat

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.499 
about the same length as the cutting mat
and<00:05:39.919> and<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.430> reason<00:05:41.759> why<00:05:41.880> I'd<00:05:41.940> go<00:05:42.090> this<00:05:42.270> size

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
and and the reason why I'd go this size

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.830 
and and the reason why I'd go this size
is<00:05:42.840> um<00:05:43.080> usually<00:05:43.860> with<00:05:44.180> your<00:05:45.180> quilting<00:05:45.570> type

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
is um usually with your quilting type

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.969 
is um usually with your quilting type
fabrics<00:05:46.380> it<00:05:46.979> comes<00:05:47.430> in<00:05:48.560> usually<00:05:49.560> comes<00:05:49.740> fold

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
fabrics it comes in usually comes fold

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.140 
fabrics it comes in usually comes fold
in<00:05:50.130> half<00:05:50.400> and<00:05:51.080> it's<00:05:52.080> usually<00:05:52.680> about<00:05:53.030> when<00:05:54.030> it's

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
in half and it's usually about when it's

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.830 
in half and it's usually about when it's
folded<00:05:54.419> in<00:05:54.449> half<00:05:54.630> it's<00:05:54.900> about<00:05:55.110> 22<00:05:55.500> inches<00:05:55.699> wide

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
folded in half it's about 22 inches wide

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.709 
folded in half it's about 22 inches wide
so<00:05:57.840> it's<00:05:58.469> this<00:05:59.310> size<00:05:59.729> cutting<00:06:00.090> that's<00:06:00.180> perfect

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
so it's this size cutting that's perfect

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:03.589 
so it's this size cutting that's perfect
for<00:06:00.750> cutting<00:06:01.020> quilting<00:06:01.500> fabric<00:06:02.599> especially

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
for cutting quilting fabric especially

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.399 
for cutting quilting fabric especially
when<00:06:03.750> it's<00:06:03.900> folded<00:06:04.020> in<00:06:04.319> half<00:06:06.020> okay<00:06:07.020> so<00:06:07.080> they're

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:07.409 
when it's folded in half okay so they're

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.010 
when it's folded in half okay so they're
the<00:06:07.860> basics<00:06:08.280> that<00:06:08.460> I<00:06:08.490> would<00:06:08.789> include<00:06:09.150> in<00:06:09.539> a
