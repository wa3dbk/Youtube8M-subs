you throw in the crown it jumps it up to
right<00:03:28.360> around<00:03:28.480> 43<00:03:29.230> millimeters<00:03:31.020> you're

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
right around 43 millimeters you're

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.890 
right around 43 millimeters you're
between<00:03:32.230> 47<00:03:32.950> or<00:03:33.040> 48<00:03:33.070> millimeters<00:03:33.760> on<00:03:34.210> the<00:03:34.600> lug

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
between 47 or 48 millimeters on the lug

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.270 
between 47 or 48 millimeters on the lug
to<00:03:35.080> lug<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.970> it's<00:03:37.420> about<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.290> 12<00:03:38.950> millimeter

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
to lug and it's about a 12 millimeter

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.670 
to lug and it's about a 12 millimeter
height<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:42.810> even<00:03:43.810> for<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.990> small<00:03:44.080> watch<00:03:44.440> it's

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
height so even for a small watch it's

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.870 
height so even for a small watch it's
going<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:44.890> have<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.040> little<00:03:45.250> bit<00:03:45.370> of<00:03:45.430> presence
