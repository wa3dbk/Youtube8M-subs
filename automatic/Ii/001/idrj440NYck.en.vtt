 castro painting as it was before 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:53.360
 that will ruin him and I have a very life 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:56.930
 it could well be a way to achieve it in 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:00.910

 I'm sorry to have ruined your painting 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.630
 duly asked before doing what 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.990
 I have to, but if I was very 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.010

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.680

 in the end this painting has 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:11.630
 reason is my painting so it transmits me 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.630
 what I feel is well painted 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.730
 all right 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.370
