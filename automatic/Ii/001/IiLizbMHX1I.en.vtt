 with the rebound 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.899

 for those who have this kind of office is 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.560

 I saw the configuration of it is ready 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.830
 for sl since its motherboard supports 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.220
 and the source is also a very long model 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.890
 of the right color x 150 watts will support the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.530
