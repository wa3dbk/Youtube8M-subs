00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.160
 hello to all I come here 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.580
 so today the first text of computer maths 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.309
 also the graphics card I recently bought the percentage of members 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.849
 video quality and for those who already have a 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.650
 so that's a gigabyte gtx 570 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.929
 the operation includes the foot 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.759
 so with them a gig of boys ram as you can see all that 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.939
 is written that a prominently on the box 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.020
 the graphics card is delivered then with the good that the box is really 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.210
 huge i will take steps to retype xive 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.020
 but the box 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.210
 twenty-seven roughly 27 centimeters wide on 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.700
 33 without times 2 euros 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.100
 so a box the valette 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.730
 evolution of things that you will find so his fascicle mow a lot of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.600
 year 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.020
 the cd of dreamers that serves absolutely nothing you're going to look for the values ​​the 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.600
 newer on the internet 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.780
 you also have a molex adapter to the pci express 6 pin power supply 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.060
 there is 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.310
 warsaw 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.510
 and it's not ready 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.740
 the famous 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 the practice 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.370
 if it is tied in relation to the much less imposing box she 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.380
 made 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 24 centimeters long I do not believe 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.050
 24 centimeters 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.800
 and so you also have ants 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.250
 the adapter 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.500
 from the father of life 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.460
 because I come here 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.460
 map collector you have 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.220
 Lives 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.420
 between mike gillis 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.310
 you are forced to use an adapter for the committee indeed the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.920
 limitations 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.620
 standard 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.930
 so the graphics card being a paper model 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.320
 heller with 1 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.120
 the cooling system 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.839
 the owner at gigabyte 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.170
 so is called the back 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.789
 for a force 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.789
 with them big fan 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.469
 so that to ensure the airflow behind the fan you have 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:27.010
 a whole system of colo duke awakening that will therefore only diffuse heat 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:28.010
 in the radiator 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.239
 radiator 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.659
 the map and huk 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.230
 not great and whatever and that the culprit all the place of slate 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.159
 both fans sound 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.689
 extremely quiet this is the strong point of the map 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.149
 and for the worst that she is easy powerful she is not so 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:52.289
 tomorrow detailing his competitors you saw 24 centimeters long on two 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.989
 is 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:53.929
 the game 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:55.609
 default that is to say this card 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.499
 is that they said pci express feeds so on the two they put 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.099
 the watercourse of the map while it is necessary that the 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.099
 me it does not bother me like that who opened 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.549
 but for to pocket smaller spell was much more practical they 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.180
 put the power supplies on top 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.150
 like that is done a lot now on the assaults the cards really 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.049
 bigger 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.199
 a step 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:25.749
 so as you could see in all 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:28.889
 the test videos what I could do I always put it 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.480
 on the full hd so that's when I was playing on this screen 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:36.599
 so it's a 40 inch TV 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.469
 so i'm in full hd with them always at the details from 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:43.759
 funds 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.389
 and the little budget this card is really no ecological concern of the game 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:48.809
 that I could test 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:50.439
 always at the bottom 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.290
 if ever 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.559
 in the current 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.209
 I had an issue that would begin to set 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.789
 today I lowered the graphics I'll tell you right away thought about 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:02.509
 you show hourly the performance limits of the map 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.429
 after of course there are all those who are really empty 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:12.209
 and we will still be finding more advanced tests than the Caribbean you 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.079
 let's show all the performances on each game 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.780
 but you have to know that for an average user to be able to deliver 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.320
 on the way the authors 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.039
 for now this type of map and then the weather has made 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.719
 those to work they will cost about now we find it 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:30.469
 on the internet for about 220 euros 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:31.509
 2 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.509
 for me that's what attracts the price-quality ratio 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.879
 dad 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.430
 also for you had questions about this graphics card you 

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:42.990
 about we're going to see you a little 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.689
 the boat what I use 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:47.360
 do not hesitate to 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.680
 the man with all these questions in the comments I will try to answer them 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.990
 the best 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.880
 So here it was instead of art and test I introduced you soon pj 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.319
 I was little 7 560 tdi 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.639
 so with an equidia picogiga processor of ddr5 memory 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.360
 the traffic is to arrive in lyon and see you soon
