 times go after miraculous things 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.039
 everything does not work sometimes green tea and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.570
 alters the metabolism half percent one 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.980
 percent that will do so much 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.170
 difference in final result 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.820
 so much is that increasingly it despite 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.980
 good for health but with this 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.469
 The purpose of weight loss has not been 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.780
 least used one thing much 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.730
 important that really makes a difference 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.700
 in metabolism but practically nobody 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.680
 talk is our posture during the day 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.289
 the posture as well let's go because you 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.800
 works six hours during the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.110
 day 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.129
 it is capable that you are thus able to spend 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.140
 300 more calories per day as if you 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.460
 sitting with arms and glued 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.170
 back and the colorado is still a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.940
 sliding forward the metabolism 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.809
 scary profile decreases 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.270
 abdominal 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.979
 we will find for delta vertebrae 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.110
 lloyd roles they are all musicians 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.510
 relaxed so that we can improve our 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.670
 our posture might say cost arm of the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.799
 back and best team achieving the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.890
 sometimes take pictures of the back of the chair 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.600
 of drums will keep frighteningly 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.159
 other tips for improving posture and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.710
 increase this metabolism is when 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.619
 stand up is not exploring the table 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.360
 not exploring on the wall because 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.009
 That way, I got enough 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.840
 metabolism very common thing in 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.520
 Women at the right time standing it 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.799
 do it here 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.880
 this here also decreases beyond the suit 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.970
 official inflation targeting but also 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.310
 decreased 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.560
 nevertheless to stand on trial 2 in the two 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.210
 legs and thus trunk musculature 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.580
 find much more metabolism accelerates 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.990
 something other than this posture in the 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.580
 Work is when we can 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.950
 do tasks during the day or have a 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.780
 work that drives 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.730
 example a person who gaÃºcha raises 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.260
 up stair up chair time 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.060
 all her calorie expenditure was very 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.180
 greater than that person who works 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.520
 sitting all day at bes be better 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.920
 a person who moves during the day 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.660
 during work 86 hours of work 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.850
 be even better than that person 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.860
 He's been sitting all day an hour ago. 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.420
 and a half of walking you can be sure that 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.100
 even without doing physical activity 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.050
 person who moves more walks 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.270
 more during the day is more standing it 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.160
 spends more calories and then tries 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.950
 improve your posture try to stop yourself 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.870
 stand on the table on the wall and try

 improve your posture before the life until 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.950

 people talk on the phone like that 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.490
 So try to stay, but you're 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.980
 elbow were metabolic difference 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.640
 Giant video not that power is gone 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.640
 to surprise
