00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
couple times how do you unlock shaders

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.130 
couple times how do you unlock shaders
and<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.550> know<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.789> made<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> previous<00:00:18.359> video<00:00:18.840> on

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
and I know I made a previous video on

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.840 
and I know I made a previous video on
how<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.320> unlock<00:00:19.590> shaders<00:00:19.980> was<00:00:20.130> kind<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.789> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
how to unlock shaders was kind of like a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.759 
how to unlock shaders was kind of like a
short<00:00:21.150> video<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:22.080> today<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.350> want<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.590> show<00:00:22.710> you

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
asked a lot how do you unlock shaders

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.929 
asked a lot how do you unlock shaders
how<00:00:26.010> do<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.189> get<00:00:26.310> different<00:00:26.490> types<00:00:26.699> of

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
how do you get different types of

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.259 
how do you get different types of
shaders<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:28.019> decided<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.949> make<00:00:29.099> another<00:00:29.279> video

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
shaders I decided to make another video

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
shaders I decided to make another video
showing<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.750> guys<00:00:30.900> exactly<00:00:31.109> how<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.590> get

for a fact the majority of you already
know<00:00:36.149> where<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:36.570> shaders<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.050> I'm<00:00:37.140> just

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
know where to get shaders but I'm just

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.709 
know where to get shaders but I'm just
gonna<00:00:37.500> show<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> quick<00:00:38.129> reference<00:00:38.309> point<00:00:38.790> for

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
gonna show a quick reference point for

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.750 
gonna show a quick reference point for
the<00:00:39.809> people<00:00:39.930> who<00:00:40.200> don't<00:00:40.469> know<00:00:40.710> how<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> get<00:00:41.550> you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the people who don't know how to get you

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.430 
the people who don't know how to get you
know<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> common<00:00:42.450> shaders<00:00:42.809> or<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> regular

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
know the common shaders or the regular

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.540 
know the common shaders or the regular
shaders<00:00:43.710> basically<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> chances<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
shaders basically the chances that

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.600 
shaders basically the chances that
everybody<00:00:45.180> already<00:00:45.450> has<00:00:45.870> now<00:00:46.340> before<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.460> get

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
everybody already has now before we get

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.130 
everybody already has now before we get
started<00:00:47.850> there's<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.360> couple<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.750> shaders<00:00:49.020> that

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
started there's a couple of shaders that

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.930 
started there's a couple of shaders that
you<00:00:49.230> were<00:00:49.350> able<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.890> unlock<00:00:50.219> if<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
you were able to unlock if you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.880 
you were able to unlock if you
pre-ordered<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> game<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.500> pre-ordered

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
pre-ordered the game if you pre-ordered

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.229 
pre-ordered the game if you pre-ordered
the<00:00:52.949> game<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.399> ordered<00:00:53.699> call<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.030> duty

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the game and you ordered call of duty

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.060 
the game and you ordered call of duty
you<00:00:54.719> were<00:00:54.870> able<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> gold<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.860> black

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
you were able to get the gold and black

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.979 
you were able to get the gold and black
shaders<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.120> that's<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> only<00:00:57.510> way<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.750> get

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
shaders so that's the only way to get

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.049 
shaders so that's the only way to get
that<00:00:58.140> shader<00:00:58.440> currently<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> right<00:00:59.850> now

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that shader currently as of right now

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.720 
that shader currently as of right now
it's<00:01:00.690> only<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.320> ordered<00:01:02.070> call<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.520> duty

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
it's only if you ordered call of duty

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.820 
it's only if you ordered call of duty
advanced<00:01:03.030> warfare<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.690> shader<00:01:04.409> will<00:01:04.680> be

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
advanced warfare and that shader will be

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.590 
advanced warfare and that shader will be
unlocked<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.640> now<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.390> other

people that are looking for other types
of<00:01:08.159> shaders<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.790> know<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.060> wondering

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
of shaders and you know like wondering

of shaders and you know like wondering
how<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.689> get<00:01:09.840> certain<00:01:10.170> shaders<00:01:10.500> well<00:01:11.119> let<00:01:12.119> me

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
how do I get certain shaders well let me

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.929 
how do I get certain shaders well let me
show<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.540> few<00:01:13.229> steps<00:01:13.710> now<00:01:13.979> there<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.729> some

but for the new people in order for you
to<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.200> shaders<00:01:19.590> you're<00:01:19.710> gonna<00:01:19.799> make<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to get shaders you're gonna make the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.190 
to get shaders you're gonna make the
left<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.390> quick<00:01:21.600> reference<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.170> have

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
left and just a quick reference you have

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.350 
left and just a quick reference you have
to<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.560> level<00:01:22.799> 20<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.430> unlock<00:01:23.759> these<00:01:23.970> shaders

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
to be level 20 to unlock these shaders

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.539 
to be level 20 to unlock these shaders
now<00:01:25.049> don't<00:01:25.530> think<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.040> shaders<00:01:26.280> will

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
now don't think that these shaders will

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.070 
now don't think that these shaders will
get<00:01:26.759> updated<00:01:27.180> once<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.689> hit<00:01:27.840> different

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
get updated once you hit different

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.840 
get updated once you hit different
levels<00:01:28.530> or<00:01:28.770> they'll<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.130> updated<00:01:29.670> weekly

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
levels or they'll get updated weekly

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.120 
levels or they'll get updated weekly
which<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.810> wish<00:01:31.049> they<00:01:31.290> would<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:31.860> don't

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
which I wish they would but they don't

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.890 
which I wish they would but they don't
because<00:01:32.939> that's<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> way<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.570> unlock

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
because that's not the way you unlock

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.170 
because that's not the way you unlock
the<00:01:34.049> shaders<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.530> gonna<00:01:35.159> cover<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.549> lady<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the shaders is gonna cover this lady and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.569 
the shaders is gonna cover this lady and
she's<00:01:36.509> gonna<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:37.049> shaders<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.369> pick

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
she's gonna have shaders for you to pick

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.190 
she's gonna have shaders for you to pick
from<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> these<00:01:39.090> shaders<00:01:39.299> are<00:01:39.570> always<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
from and these shaders are always the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.380 
from and these shaders are always the
same<00:01:40.229> shaders<00:01:40.860> regardless<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.700> whatever

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
same shaders regardless of whatever

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.450 
same shaders regardless of whatever
level<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.079> whatever<00:01:43.409> weak<00:01:43.680> type<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.250> now

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
level or whatever weak type there is now

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.920 
level or whatever weak type there is now
that's<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:45.000> way<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> shaders<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
that's one way to get the shaders and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.300 
that's one way to get the shaders and
you<00:01:46.170> guys<00:01:46.320> don't<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.680> any<00:01:46.860> shaders

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
you guys don't have any shaders

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.880 
you guys don't have any shaders
currently<00:01:48.149> now<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.780> you're<00:01:48.899> past<00:01:49.200> level<00:01:49.530> 20

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
currently now if you're past level 20

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.560 
currently now if you're past level 20
and<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.159> guys<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.430> looking<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:50.790> sinners<00:01:51.060> one

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and you guys are looking for sinners one

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.149 
and you guys are looking for sinners one
of<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.750> key<00:01:51.960> elements<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.500> getting<00:01:52.829> shaders

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
of the key elements to getting shaders

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.230 
of the key elements to getting shaders
is<00:01:53.310> not<00:01:53.520> only<00:01:54.409> being<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.829> type<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.700> contact

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
is not only being in type of contact

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.999 
is not only being in type of contact
with<00:01:57.570> what's<00:01:57.840> happening<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.409> Destiny<00:01:58.829> for

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
with what's happening in Destiny for

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.830 
with what's happening in Destiny for
example<00:01:59.490> currently<00:02:00.210> right<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.509> have<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
example currently right now we have the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.620 
example currently right now we have the
Queen's<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:02.189> Queen's<00:02:02.490> wrath<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> Queen's

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
Queen's the Queen's wrath of the Queen's

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.510 
Queen's the Queen's wrath of the Queen's
missions<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.110> got<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.350> do<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.189> will<00:02:05.340> give

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
missions we got to do so that will give

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.219 
missions we got to do so that will give
you<00:02:05.640> unlock<00:02:06.119> shaders<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.020> unlock

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
you unlock shaders for you to unlock

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.749 
you unlock shaders for you to unlock
shaders<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.740> no<00:02:07.920> one<00:02:08.099> else<00:02:08.280> would<00:02:08.580> probably

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
shaders that no one else would probably

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.059 
shaders that no one else would probably
have<00:02:09.149> unless<00:02:09.840> they<00:02:10.020> do<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.440> Queen<00:02:10.679> bounties

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
have unless they do the Queen bounties

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.470 
have unless they do the Queen bounties
or<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.340> Queen<00:02:11.489> stuff<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> way<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.180> unlock

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
or the Queen stuff so the way you unlock

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.610 
or the Queen stuff so the way you unlock
those<00:02:12.629> shaders<00:02:12.959> is

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
those shaders is

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.809 
those shaders is
you<00:02:13.650> gotta<00:02:13.799> get<00:02:13.980> your<00:02:14.129> rank<00:02:14.340> up<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:14.730> I'm

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
you gotta get your rank up and I'm

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.430 
you gotta get your rank up and I'm
pretty<00:02:15.000> sure<00:02:15.269> that<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.599> iron<00:02:16.019> banner<00:02:16.230> will

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
pretty sure that the iron banner will

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.680 
pretty sure that the iron banner will
also<00:02:16.739> have<00:02:16.890> shaders<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.340> their<00:02:17.459> own<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.390> you

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
also have shaders of their own so you

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.869 
also have shaders of their own so you
have<00:02:19.379> to<00:02:19.590> stay<00:02:19.799> tuned<00:02:20.040> for<00:02:20.310> events<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.790> are

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
have to stay tuned for events that are

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.699 
have to stay tuned for events that are
happening<00:02:21.000> within<00:02:21.420> destiny<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.140> unlock<00:02:22.470> those

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
happening within destiny to unlock those

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.289 
happening within destiny to unlock those
type<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.920> shaders<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.489> is<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> quick<00:02:23.879> example

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
type of shaders this is a quick example

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.350 
type of shaders this is a quick example
we<00:02:25.290> got<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.590> queen<00:02:25.830> event<00:02:26.159> and<00:02:26.430> as<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.180> see

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
we got the queen event and as you see

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.059 
we got the queen event and as you see
right<00:02:27.390> here<00:02:27.510> we<00:02:27.810> are<00:02:27.840> able<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.290> unlock<00:02:28.590> rose

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
right here we are able to unlock rose

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.520 
right here we are able to unlock rose
gold<00:02:29.370> shader<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.879> were<00:02:30.390> able<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.690> write<00:02:30.930> write

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
gold shader and were able to write write

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.770 
gold shader and were able to write write
the<00:02:31.739> other<00:02:32.280> shader<00:02:32.700> that<00:02:32.790> will<00:02:33.060> unlock<00:02:33.450> once

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
the other shader that will unlock once

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.289 
the other shader that will unlock once
you<00:02:33.930> hit<00:02:34.049> level<00:02:34.110> 3<00:02:34.650> with<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.489> Queen<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.030> as<00:02:36.120> you

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
you hit level 3 with the Queen so as you

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.390 
you hit level 3 with the Queen so as you
see<00:02:36.780> right<00:02:36.930> now<00:02:37.049> I'm<00:02:37.200> rarely<00:02:37.440> Rank<00:02:37.860> 1<00:02:37.950> with<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
see right now I'm rarely Rank 1 with the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.160 
see right now I'm rarely Rank 1 with the
Queen<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.209> if<00:02:39.299> I<00:02:39.360> want<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.629> you<00:02:39.780> know<00:02:39.810> get<00:02:40.049> this

Queen so if I want to you know get this

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.539 
Queen so if I want to you know get this
other<00:02:40.379> shader<00:02:40.709> I'm<00:02:40.890> gonna<00:02:41.040> have<00:02:41.129> to<00:02:41.250> get<00:02:41.370> that

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
other shader I'm gonna have to get that

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.759 
other shader I'm gonna have to get that

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.000 
what the shader looks like so the vault
of<00:03:06.030> glass<00:03:06.090> shader<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.810> looks<00:03:07.019> like<00:03:07.379> this

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
of glass shader it looks like this

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.210 
of glass shader it looks like this
it's<00:03:08.519> primarily<00:03:09.239> all-white<00:03:09.959> it's<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.890> full

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
it's primarily all-white it's a full

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.880 
it's primarily all-white it's a full
white<00:03:11.489> armor<00:03:11.879> for<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.450> vault<00:03:12.659> of<00:03:12.840> glass<00:03:12.890> now

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
white armor for the vault of glass now

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.399 
white armor for the vault of glass now
as<00:03:14.849> you<00:03:15.000> see<00:03:15.180> these<00:03:15.359> I<00:03:15.390> have<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.930> one<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
as you see these I have this one is the

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.319 
as you see these I have this one is the
one<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.590> purchase<00:03:17.069> from<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.340> lady<00:03:17.519> this<00:03:18.090> one

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
one you purchase from the lady this one

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.440 
one you purchase from the lady this one
right<00:03:18.450> here<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:19.019> believe<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.950> got<00:03:20.190> from<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.120> code

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
right here I believe I got from a code

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.900 
right here I believe I got from a code
that<00:03:22.109> you<00:03:22.319> are<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.190> could<00:03:23.459> probably<00:03:23.639> put<00:03:23.880> a

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
that you are that I could probably put a

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.400 
that you are that I could probably put a
code<00:03:24.150> down<00:03:24.329> below<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.810> guys<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:24.989> get<00:03:25.230> the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
code down below so you guys can get the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.039 
code down below so you guys can get the
code<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.280> shader<00:03:26.519> as<00:03:26.760> well<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.209> this

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
code for this shader as well and this

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.710 
code for this shader as well and this
shader<00:03:28.319> I<00:03:28.650> also<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.579> believe<00:03:30.060> it's<00:03:30.269> based<00:03:30.540> on

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
shader I also I believe it's based on

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.390 
shader I also I believe it's based on
the<00:03:30.870> code<00:03:31.049> as<00:03:31.200> well<00:03:31.319> so<00:03:31.769> you're<00:03:31.919> able<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.220> get

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
the code as well so you're able to get

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.830 
the code as well so you're able to get
like<00:03:32.549> three<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.879> four<00:03:33.060> shooters<00:03:33.299> just<00:03:33.419> off

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
like three to four shooters just off

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.509 
like three to four shooters just off
codes<00:03:34.169> which<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.590> will<00:03:34.769> list<00:03:34.980> down<00:03:35.129> below<00:03:35.190> so

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
codes which I will list down below so

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.339 
codes which I will list down below so
you<00:03:35.669> guys<00:03:35.730> can<00:03:35.819> get<00:03:36.060> them<00:03:36.180> now<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.720> quick<00:03:37.109> tip

you guys can get them now the quick tip
on<00:03:37.590> how<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.799> get<00:03:38.010> shaders<00:03:38.430> that's<00:03:38.639> probably

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
on how to get shaders that's probably

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.220 
on how to get shaders that's probably
what<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.090> guys<00:03:39.180> are<00:03:39.329> here<00:03:39.510> for<00:03:39.540> in<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.989> video

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
week so for example let's say you do the

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.089 
week so for example let's say you do the
daily<00:04:20.609> mission<00:04:21.510> every<00:04:21.900> time<00:04:22.169> for<00:04:22.500> seven<00:04:22.800> days

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
daily mission every time for seven days

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.760 
daily mission every time for seven days
you're<00:04:23.880> most<00:04:24.150> likely<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.630> get<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.990> shader<00:04:25.440> from

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
you're most likely to get a shader from

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.080 
you're most likely to get a shader from
that<00:04:26.010> daily

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
that daily

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.360 
that daily
completion<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.169> if<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.830> do<00:04:28.979> the<00:04:29.130> weekly

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
completion and if you do the weekly

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.180 
completion and if you do the weekly
heroic<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.720> you<00:04:30.960> do<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.320> weekly<00:04:31.590> nightfall

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
heroic and you do the weekly nightfall

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.070 
heroic and you do the weekly nightfall
you<00:04:32.310> were<00:04:32.460> most<00:04:32.669> likely<00:04:32.880> unlock<00:04:33.389> a<00:04:33.419> shader<00:04:33.840> for

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
you were most likely unlock a shader for

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.200 
you were most likely unlock a shader for
that<00:04:34.229> event<00:04:34.530> as<00:04:34.680> well<00:04:34.889> another<00:04:35.639> way<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:35.910> do<00:04:36.090> it

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
that event as well another way to do it

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.480 
that event as well another way to do it
is<00:04:36.389> if<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:36.690> do<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.410> daily<00:04:37.620> patrol<00:04:38.130> missions

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
is if you do the daily patrol missions

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.370 
is if you do the daily patrol missions
you'll<00:04:38.639> be<00:04:38.910> able<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.270> unlock<00:04:39.389> a<00:04:39.720> shader<00:04:40.080> either

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
you'll be able to unlock a shader either
