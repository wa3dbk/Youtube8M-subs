00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.670
 hi my name is Dasha today 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.380
 reinvent the wheel I will show 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.440
 what principle do i keep my books so 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.929
 to more space to no more 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.570
 number fit fit in one 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:25.019
 the place of the idea is not my idea of ​​one of my 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.580
 subscribers and I bring to life the first 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.650
 principle which I want to tell you 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.610
 you are quite popular, I think that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.680
 the thing is that you smoke and yet 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.770
 strongly show so the first principle is very 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.800
 simple and it is to 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.350
 putting books is not like this 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.489
 over other books as we usually do 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.450
 many do dump 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.460
 and so along 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.899
 so we kill two at once 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.399
 hares first takes much less 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.070
 place of the book in such storage 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.989
 oddly enough and secondly simpler and 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.489
 pull out the open middle book while 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.250
 this storage is still 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.350
 one hand can pull 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.850
 that is very convenient if you are still like that 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.080
 do not practice will try 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.150
 faithful you will like 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.210
 for example here on this shelf and just 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.320
 Now your shelf in electronic form 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.180
 I bring on bek mix on the server and here on this 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.290
 68 books are being stored in the shelf 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:33.659
 I would never have thought the second principle 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:36.750
 I think less known it is based on such 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.720
 here are my little books they are 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.270
 are called i make of them 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.649
 stand ie books 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.799
 Of course those that I am very 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:56.060
 I practically do not reread 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:01.530
 in such a way we laid down and his name is bottom 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.320
 shelves so that if you put them on 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.030
 book and and the spine would rest on the ceiling 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.620
 shelves of course it's done 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.540
 name out 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.840
 there is no reprint to read something though 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.319
 hardly what we are trying to achieve with it 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.230
 firstly pour in all this more elegant below 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.850
 than just throw like here to 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:32.290
 on top of other books 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.290
 and plus to this here for those who do not like 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.220
 put a few rows of books 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:44.180
 This is such a very aesthetic way. 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.790
 avoid it how am i there that 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.700
 if you arrange the books like this 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.489
 the name but as it rises above we 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.470
 we can put books like this and 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.780
 we can also add a topic to those 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.180
 until the name is set up 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.880
 I already see the name closed and 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.880
 I will stay no more 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.860
 above put here all the simple ways 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.049
 another way to save space is 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.030
 he is about nothing 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.440
 is to put the book like this 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.110
 the way that is here we see that already 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.000
 they are not what book you will not put that 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:36.980
 You can put it like this cover 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.920
 out at the same time on a single book, and even 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.400
 may even be two fits on 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.670
 the shelf is bigger and at the same time while you 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.130
 somehow more beautiful to wish a huge personal 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.890
 the library so that each book I was 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.340
 especially dear to your heart and very 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.340
 is useful
