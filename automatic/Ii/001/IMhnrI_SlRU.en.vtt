point to make is a lot of people i think
from<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.170> outline<00:00:44.440> you<00:00:44.620> know<00:00:44.680> read<00:00:45.090> training

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
from the outline you know read training

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.030 
from the outline you know read training

those<00:00:59.830> time<00:01:00.070> and<00:01:00.370> there's<00:01:01.200> you've<00:01:02.200> got<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.560> cut

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
those time and there's you've got to cut

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.289 
those time and there's you've got to cut
some<00:01:03.040> things<00:01:03.280> out<00:01:03.430> of<00:01:03.550> your<00:01:03.640> life<00:01:03.760> that<00:01:04.059> aren't

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
a priority and some people struggle with

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.490 
a priority and some people struggle with
doing<00:01:07.479> that<00:01:07.600> and<00:01:07.750> that<00:01:07.840> makes<00:01:08.080> that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
doing that and that makes that

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.100 
doing that and that makes that
challenging<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.240> number<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:10.570> years<00:01:10.689> I<00:01:10.930> had

walks<00:01:57.420> our<00:01:58.420> marches<00:01:58.899> I<00:01:59.079> will<00:01:59.560> say<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:01.600> wasn't

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
walks our marches I will say just wasn't

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.099 
walks our marches I will say just wasn't
able<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:03.579> to<00:02:03.939> maintain<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.689> I<00:02:04.899> just

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
able to to to maintain that I just

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.539 
able to to to maintain that I just
wasn't<00:02:05.229> recovering<00:02:05.709> on<00:02:05.889> the<00:02:06.009> squats<00:02:06.249> which<00:02:06.429> I

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
wasn't recovering on the squats which I

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.249 
wasn't recovering on the squats which I
had<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.359> feeling<00:02:07.479> what<00:02:07.749> happened<00:02:08.110> but<00:02:08.229> I

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
had the feeling what happened but I

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.699 
had the feeling what happened but I
wasn't<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:09.399> needed<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.899> know<00:02:10.929> see<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.560> and

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
wasn't I needed to you know see it and

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.670 
wasn't I needed to you know see it and
feel<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:11.980> for<00:02:12.310> myself<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.470> did<00:02:14.650> that

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
feel it for myself and and so I did that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.490 
feel it for myself and and so I did that
and<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:16.120> doing<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.750> marches<00:02:17.110> I'm<00:02:17.260> getting

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
and so doing the marches I'm getting

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.080 
and so doing the marches I'm getting
really<00:02:17.800> good<00:02:18.010> effect<00:02:18.250> i'm<00:02:18.340> really<00:02:18.670> loving<00:02:18.880> it

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
really good effect i'm really loving it

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.140 
really good effect i'm really loving it
i<00:02:19.709> bounce<00:02:20.709> between<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.220> glute<00:02:21.580> ham<00:02:21.760> raises

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
i bounce between that glute ham raises

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.840 
i bounce between that glute ham raises
or<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.480> squat<00:02:22.750> as<00:02:23.709> well<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.129> i'm<00:02:24.220> hitting

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
or the squat as well so i'm hitting

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.720 
or the squat as well so i'm hitting
something<00:02:25.210> on<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.420> end<00:02:25.660> every<00:02:25.990> day<00:02:26.140> still

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
includes doing some speed bench which

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.940 
includes doing some speed bench which
you'll<00:03:03.640> see<00:03:03.700> in<00:03:03.850> some<00:03:04.150> fall<00:03:04.330> at<00:03:04.450> wing<00:03:04.570> weeks

you'll see in some fall at wing weeks

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.760 
you'll see in some fall at wing weeks
and<00:03:06.510> getting<00:03:07.510> back<00:03:07.630> into<00:03:07.870> using<00:03:08.290> my<00:03:08.380> velocity

press the max effort as well and making
some<00:03:13.480> other<00:03:13.570> changes<00:03:13.810> that<00:03:14.050> I'll<00:03:14.260> discuss<00:03:14.710> in

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
some other changes that I'll discuss in

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.100 
some other changes that I'll discuss in
the<00:03:15.130> future<00:03:15.460> but<00:03:16.090> I'm<00:03:16.210> easing<00:03:16.480> into<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.750> pretty

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
the future but I'm easing into a pretty

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.840 
the future but I'm easing into a pretty
slow<00:03:17.470> taking<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.040> really<00:03:18.190> light<00:03:18.490> kind<00:03:18.760> of

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
slow taking a really light kind of

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.120 
slow taking a really light kind of
building<00:03:19.090> into<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.570> figuring<00:03:20.530> out<00:03:20.680> where<00:03:20.890> and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
building into it figuring out where and

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.760 
building into it figuring out where and
what<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.520> how<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.640> want<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.060> approach<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.770> go

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
what and how I want to approach it go

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.830 
what and how I want to approach it go
like<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.130> said<00:03:24.190> it'll<00:03:24.760> be<00:03:24.880> more<00:03:25.150> details<00:03:25.510> later

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
like I said it'll be more details later

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.890 
like I said it'll be more details later
but<00:03:26.050> this<00:03:26.620> here<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.220> think<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.550> my<00:03:27.730> sixth<00:03:28.390> set<00:03:28.690> of

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
but this here I think is my sixth set of

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.030 
but this here I think is my sixth set of
five<00:03:30.600> doing<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.690> slight<00:03:32.110> pause<00:03:32.350> right<00:03:32.800> as<00:03:32.920> the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
five doing a slight pause right as the

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.860 
five doing a slight pause right as the
bars<00:03:33.250> touching<00:03:33.640> my<00:03:33.760> shirt<00:03:34.060> with<00:03:34.300> me<00:03:34.480> the

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
bars touching my shirt with me the

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.170 
bars touching my shirt with me the
duffel<00:03:35.170> Oh<00:03:35.230> bar<00:03:35.440> or<00:03:36.190> one<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.460> the<00:03:36.520> early<00:03:36.790> duffel

obar<00:03:37.390> prototypes<00:03:37.960> and<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:40.690> that's<00:03:41.020> going

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
obar prototypes and so that's going

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.320 
obar prototypes and so that's going
pretty<00:03:41.500> well<00:03:41.590> hidden<00:03:42.070> well<00:03:42.880> I<00:03:42.910> have<00:03:43.180> been

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
pretty well hidden well I have been

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.110 
pretty well hidden well I have been
hitting<00:03:43.600> some<00:03:43.870> form<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.500> legs<00:03:45.400> posterior
