00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
new music to the table that that's it

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.330 
new music to the table that that's it
that's<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.210> path<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:57.960> need<00:01:58.109> to<00:01:58.200> take<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
that's the path that we need to take the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.099 
that's the path that we need to take the
approach<00:01:59.759> vocally<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.539> something<00:02:00.899> different

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
approach vocally is something different

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:13.340 
approach vocally is something different
it<00:02:01.499> was

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.940 

but<00:02:13.590> they<00:02:14.490> said<00:02:15.290> we<00:02:16.290> want<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:16.680> something

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
but they said we want to do something

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.480 
but they said we want to do something
maybe<00:02:17.250> more<00:02:17.580> than<00:02:17.820> just<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.180> song<00:02:22.130> which<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.310> me

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
maybe more than just a song which to me

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:32.450 
maybe more than just a song which to me
was<00:02:30.230> basically<00:02:31.230> kind<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.800> came<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.100> my<00:02:32.220> rescue

cold<00:02:55.320> very<00:02:55.860> California<00:02:56.400> boy<00:02:56.550> but<00:02:57.650> where<00:02:58.650> it

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
cold very California boy but where it

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:17.210 
cold very California boy but where it
was<00:02:58.860> really<00:02:59.070> warm<00:02:59.400> with<00:03:14.810> explorer<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.220> think

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
was really warm with explorer I think

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.470 
was really warm with explorer I think
one<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.460> things<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.820> make<00:03:18.000> them<00:03:18.180> such

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
one of the things that make them such

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.540 
one of the things that make them such
incredible<00:03:18.960> producers<00:03:19.470> they<00:03:19.890> don't<00:03:20.070> stick<00:03:20.370> to

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
incredible producers they don't stick to

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:32.210 
incredible producers they don't stick to
one<00:03:20.820> style<00:03:21.410> they're<00:03:22.410> borrowing<00:03:22.710> from<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:31.590> think

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
one style they're borrowing from I think

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.540 
one style they're borrowing from I think
defining<00:03:32.700> yourself<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:37.230> with<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:37.830> one<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.100> you

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
defining yourself so with this one I you

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.760 
defining yourself so with this one I you
know<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:38.670> went<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.300> there<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:40.320> goal<00:03:40.590> was

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
know I went in there and the goal was

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.400 
know I went in there and the goal was
more<00:03:41.180> let's<00:03:42.180> deliver<00:03:43.050> something<00:03:43.740> honest
