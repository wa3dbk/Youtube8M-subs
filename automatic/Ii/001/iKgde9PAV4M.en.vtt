00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.690 

so<00:00:20.080> the<00:00:20.200> Barley's<00:00:20.560> that<00:00:20.770> we're<00:00:21.220> working<00:00:21.340> with

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
so the Barley's that we're working with

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.179 
so the Barley's that we're working with
right<00:00:21.880> now<00:00:22.090> in<00:00:22.300> this<00:00:22.480> field<00:00:23.100> we're<00:00:24.100> all

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
right now in this field we're all

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.630 
right now in this field we're all
crosses<00:00:24.760> between<00:00:25.980> selections<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.220> varieties

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
crosses between selections and varieties

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.920 
crosses between selections and varieties
we've<00:00:27.880> developed<00:00:28.180> here<00:00:28.390> at<00:00:28.540> Oregon<00:00:28.900> State

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
we've developed here at Oregon State

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.810 
we've developed here at Oregon State
University<00:00:29.140> that<00:00:29.980> we've<00:00:30.099> brought<00:00:30.310> in<00:00:30.490> from

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
University that we've brought in from

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.840 
University that we've brought in from
other<00:00:31.240> places<00:00:31.599> around<00:00:31.930> the<00:00:32.199> world<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.850> this

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
other places around the world and this

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.880 
other places around the world and this
barley<00:00:34.330> is<00:00:34.540> pretty<00:00:34.870> nice<00:00:35.170> and<00:00:35.620> bright<00:00:35.830> and

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
barley is pretty nice and bright and

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.189 
barley is pretty nice and bright and
golden<00:00:36.610> and<00:00:36.910> it's<00:00:37.090> holding<00:00:37.239> up<00:00:37.510> quite<00:00:37.720> well<00:00:37.780> we

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
golden and it's holding up quite well we

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:39.900 
golden and it's holding up quite well we
have<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.379> disease<00:00:38.739> that<00:00:38.800> just<00:00:39.370> runs<00:00:39.580> rampant

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
have a disease that just runs rampant

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.910 
have a disease that just runs rampant
here<00:00:40.360> in<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.900> Willamette<00:00:41.350> Valley<00:00:41.379> that's

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
here in the Willamette Valley that's

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.070 
here in the Willamette Valley that's
called<00:00:42.160> barley<00:00:42.520> stripe<00:00:42.790> rust<00:00:43.030> and<00:00:43.300> so<00:00:43.930> this

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
called barley stripe rust and so this

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.750 
called barley stripe rust and so this
variety<00:00:44.530> actually<00:00:44.949> looked<00:00:45.220> pretty<00:00:45.519> good

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
variety actually looked pretty good

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.520 
variety actually looked pretty good
about<00:00:45.910> two<00:00:46.210> months<00:00:46.390> ago<00:00:46.600> but<00:00:46.960> that<00:00:47.140> rust<00:00:47.379> has

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
about two months ago but that rust has

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.600 
about two months ago but that rust has
come<00:00:47.800> in<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:48.190> buy<00:00:48.910> sapping<00:00:49.840> the<00:00:50.430> strength<00:00:51.430> of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
come in and buy sapping the strength of

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.250 
come in and buy sapping the strength of
that<00:00:51.760> plant<00:00:52.030> if<00:00:52.180> you<00:00:52.329> will<00:00:52.510> has<00:00:52.780> just<00:00:53.020> left

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
that plant if you will has just left

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.680 
that plant if you will has just left
this<00:00:53.470> business<00:00:54.399> it's<00:00:54.550> on<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.760> ground<00:00:54.790> so<00:00:55.300> this

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
this business it's on the ground so this

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.120 
this business it's on the ground so this
is<00:00:55.840> what<00:00:56.020> we<00:00:56.110> have<00:00:56.290> to<00:00:56.410> beat<00:00:56.620> if<00:00:56.890> you're<00:00:57.040> going

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
is what we have to beat if you're going

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.130 
is what we have to beat if you're going
to<00:00:57.190> be<00:00:57.309> raising<00:00:57.760> these<00:00:57.940> varieties<00:00:58.300> in<00:00:58.690> Oregon

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
to be raising these varieties in Oregon

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.650 
to be raising these varieties in Oregon
Washington<00:00:59.469> Idaho<00:01:00.059> California<00:01:01.059> you're<00:01:01.510> going

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
Washington Idaho California you're going

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.180 
Washington Idaho California you're going
to<00:01:01.719> have<00:01:01.930> to<00:01:02.110> have<00:01:02.290> resistance<00:01:02.860> to<00:01:03.070> these

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
to have to have resistance to these

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.389 
to have to have resistance to these
diseases<00:01:03.670> they're<00:01:04.330> going<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.540> have<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.869> have

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
diseases they're going to have to have

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.710 
diseases they're going to have to have
resistance<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.610> low<00:01:06.729> temperature<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:07.479> a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
resistance to low temperature and a

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.139 
resistance to low temperature and a
number<00:01:07.869> of<00:01:08.020> other<00:01:08.200> traits<00:01:08.560> in<00:01:08.770> order<00:01:09.009> to<00:01:09.190> to<00:01:09.970> be

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
number of other traits in order to to be

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.820 
number of other traits in order to to be
able<00:01:10.390> to<00:01:10.509> successfully<00:01:10.810> produce<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.470> barley

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
able to successfully produce that barley

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.230 
able to successfully produce that barley
so<00:01:12.250> we've<00:01:12.399> been<00:01:12.520> through<00:01:12.580> here<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:12.910> couple<00:01:13.060> of

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
so we've been through here a couple of

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.180 
so we've been through here a couple of
times<00:01:13.479> picked<00:01:14.289> each<00:01:14.410> one<00:01:14.680> of<00:01:14.710> these<00:01:14.860> rows

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
times picked each one of these rows

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.850 
times picked each one of these rows
based<00:01:15.550> on<00:01:15.850> its<00:01:16.030> disease<00:01:16.720> resistance<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.649> fact

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
based on its disease resistance the fact

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.770 
based on its disease resistance the fact
that<00:01:17.950> it's<00:01:18.160> standing<00:01:18.580> up<00:01:18.759> that<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.240> head

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
that it's standing up that the head

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.770 
that it's standing up that the head
looks<00:01:20.080> to<00:01:20.259> be<00:01:20.380> well<00:01:20.590> formed<00:01:21.390> from<00:01:22.390> each<00:01:22.539> one<00:01:22.569> of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
looks to be well formed from each one of

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.230 
looks to be well formed from each one of
these<00:01:22.959> we're<00:01:23.259> taking<00:01:23.679> five<00:01:24.160> heads<00:01:24.459> the

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
these we're taking five heads the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.790 
these we're taking five heads the
undergrads<00:01:25.690> will<00:01:25.869> be<00:01:25.959> threshing<00:01:26.380> those<00:01:26.530> heads

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
undergrads will be threshing those heads

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.999 
undergrads will be threshing those heads
over<00:01:27.160> the<00:01:27.190> summer<00:01:27.520> next<00:01:28.420> year<00:01:28.660> each<00:01:29.649> one<00:01:29.979> of

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
over the summer next year each one of

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.859 
over the summer next year each one of
these<00:01:30.190> heads<00:01:30.490> will<00:01:30.729> give<00:01:30.910> rise<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.149> a<00:01:31.390> new<00:01:31.599> road

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
these heads will give rise to a new road

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.210 
these heads will give rise to a new road
just<00:01:32.140> like<00:01:32.289> you<00:01:32.440> see<00:01:32.590> here<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:33.039> there'll<00:01:33.190> be

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
just like you see here so there'll be

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.070 
just like you see here so there'll be
another<00:01:33.610> field<00:01:33.940> this<00:01:34.209> size<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.690> has<00:01:34.869> these

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
another field this size that has these

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.740 
another field this size that has these
progeny<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:36.340> in<00:01:36.520> this<00:01:36.610> way<00:01:36.819> the<00:01:37.330> whole<00:01:37.450> process

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
progeny so in this way the whole process

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.779 
progeny so in this way the whole process
of<00:01:38.110> plant<00:01:38.380> breeding<00:01:38.619> is<00:01:38.860> really<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.160> process<00:01:39.700> of

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
of plant breeding is really a process of

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.850 
of plant breeding is really a process of
directed<00:01:40.270> evolution<00:01:40.360> we're<00:01:40.929> deciding<00:01:41.440> which

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
directed evolution we're deciding which

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.680 
directed evolution we're deciding which
individuals<00:01:42.490> in<00:01:42.700> this<00:01:42.849> field<00:01:43.119> get<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.509> pass

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
individuals in this field get to pass

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:53.390 
individuals in this field get to pass
their<00:01:43.869> genes<00:01:43.899> on<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.319> the<00:01:44.500> next<00:01:44.649> generation

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:04.149 

you

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.980 

you

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.050 

you
