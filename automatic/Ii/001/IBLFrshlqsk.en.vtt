string<00:02:21.370> open<00:02:22.330> right<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:23.050> here<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.319> am<00:02:23.350> playing

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
string open right so here I am playing

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.550 
string open right so here I am playing
an<00:02:23.860> A<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:25.830> know<00:02:26.830> I'm<00:02:27.160> going<00:02:27.819> I'm<00:02:27.970> going<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.270> D

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.900 
just goofing around there you can see
you<00:04:00.500> can<00:04:00.650> toss<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:01.040> these<00:04:01.190> notes<00:04:01.520> pretty<00:04:01.730> well

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
you can toss it these notes pretty well

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.290 
you can toss it these notes pretty well
anywhere<00:04:02.570> you<00:04:02.720> can<00:04:02.870> think<00:04:02.900> of<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.440> do<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:04.300> so

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
anywhere you can think of to do that so

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.300 
anywhere you can think of to do that so
that's<00:04:05.360> basically<00:04:05.780> what<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.620> lesson<00:04:06.950> is<00:04:07.160> I

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
that's basically what the lesson is I

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.760 
that's basically what the lesson is I
guess<00:04:07.520> just<00:04:07.730> use<00:04:08.480> your<00:04:08.600> open<00:04:08.720> notes<00:04:08.960> now<00:04:09.470> think

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
guess just use your open notes now think

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:10.540 
guess just use your open notes now think
about<00:04:09.860> this

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
about this

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.820 
about this
I<00:04:10.580> just<00:04:11.120> used<00:04:11.300> a<00:04:11.450> minor<00:04:11.720> because<00:04:12.140> it's<00:04:12.560> easy<00:04:12.710> a

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
I just used a minor because it's easy a

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.449 
I just used a minor because it's easy a
minor<00:04:13.100> has<00:04:13.370> only<00:04:13.730> natural<00:04:14.150> notes<00:04:14.330> right<00:04:15.459> no

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
minor has only natural notes right no

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.280 
minor has only natural notes right no
flats<00:04:16.730> and<00:04:16.880> sharps<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.900> course<00:04:18.140> we<00:04:18.230> don't

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
flats and sharps and of course we don't

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.890 
flats and sharps and of course we don't
have<00:04:18.380> any<00:04:18.470> flats<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:18.950> sharps<00:04:19.010> in<00:04:19.400> our<00:04:19.750> in<00:04:20.750> our

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
have any flats and sharps in our in our

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.680 
have any flats and sharps in our in our
open<00:04:21.140> strings<00:04:21.410> in<00:04:22.160> standard<00:04:22.610> tuning<00:04:22.820> but

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
open strings in standard tuning but

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.430 
open strings in standard tuning but
think<00:04:23.930> about<00:04:24.020> this

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
think about this

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.770 
think about this
what<00:04:24.800> other<00:04:25.010> scales<00:04:25.400> can<00:04:25.910> you<00:04:26.060> now<00:04:26.210> use<00:04:26.480> in<00:04:26.720> the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
what other scales can you now use in the

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.380 
what other scales can you now use in the
same<00:04:26.990> way<00:04:27.170> right<00:04:27.440> so<00:04:27.820> I'll<00:04:28.820> give<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.150> couple

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
same way right so I'll give you a couple

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.210 
same way right so I'll give you a couple
ideas<00:04:29.450> but<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:29.900> challenge<00:04:30.230> you<00:04:30.290> to<00:04:30.410> go<00:04:30.560> well<00:04:31.130> you

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
ideas but I challenge you to go well you

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.800 
ideas but I challenge you to go well you
probably<00:04:31.400> at<00:04:31.669> home<00:04:31.880> but<00:04:32.060> go<00:04:32.390> home<00:04:32.419> and<00:04:32.720> think

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
probably at home but go home and think

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.620 
probably at home but go home and think
about<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.110> that's<00:04:33.950> your<00:04:34.100> homework<00:04:34.630> think

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
about it that's your homework think

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.960 
about it that's your homework think
about<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.169> try<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.010> figure<00:04:37.160> out<00:04:37.280> all<00:04:37.910> of

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
about it and try to figure out all of

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.180 
about it and try to figure out all of
the<00:04:38.150> different<00:04:38.240> scales<00:04:38.690> that<00:04:39.680> have<00:04:39.860> open

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
the different scales that have open

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.650 
the different scales that have open
notes<00:04:40.370> in<00:04:40.580> them<00:04:40.700> that<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.000> can<00:04:41.150> use<00:04:41.270> now<00:04:41.450> some

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
notes in them that you can use now some

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.590 
notes in them that you can use now some
of<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.780> scales<00:04:42.080> may<00:04:42.830> only<00:04:43.070> have<00:04:43.400> one<00:04:43.790> string

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
of the scales may only have one string

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.930 
of the scales may only have one string
that<00:04:45.440> you're<00:04:45.560> going<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.740> be<00:04:45.860> able<00:04:45.950> to<00:04:46.070> use<00:04:46.340> open

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
that you're going to be able to use open

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:56.050 
that you're going to be able to use open
e<00:04:53.260> minor<00:04:54.260> for<00:04:54.560> one<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:55.280> gonna<00:04:55.490> be<00:04:55.669> great<00:04:55.910> with

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
e minor for one is gonna be great with

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.120 
e minor for one is gonna be great with
open<00:04:56.390> two<00:04:56.540> right<00:04:56.780> because<00:04:57.110> if<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:57.860> think

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
open two right because if you think

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.190 
open two right because if you think
about<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:58.520> the<00:05:01.300> like<00:05:02.300> if<00:05:02.419> you<00:05:02.510> notice<00:05:02.810> on<00:05:03.050> these

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
about it the like if you notice on these

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.930 
about it the like if you notice on these
on<00:05:03.590> these<00:05:03.680> minor<00:05:04.040> scales<00:05:04.370> or<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.580> pentatonic

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
on these minor scales or the pentatonic

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.750 
on these minor scales or the pentatonic
minor<00:05:05.150> scales<00:05:05.860> basically<00:05:06.860> with<00:05:07.400> that<00:05:07.550> root

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
minor scales basically with that root

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.390 
minor scales basically with that root
starting<00:05:08.210> note<00:05:08.360> like<00:05:08.660> in<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:09.070> did<00:05:10.070> you<00:05:10.160> notice

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
starting note like in a did you notice

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.440 
starting note like in a did you notice
the<00:05:10.520> use<00:05:10.729> every<00:05:11.090> single<00:05:11.270> note<00:05:11.600> on<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:11.870> fret

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.969 

all<00:05:17.450> of<00:05:17.600> those<00:05:17.720> notes<00:05:17.990> are<00:05:18.320> on<00:05:18.380> that<00:05:18.560> fret<00:05:18.770> so

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
all of those notes are on that fret so

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:24.130 
all of those notes are on that fret so
II<00:05:20.440> minor<00:05:21.760> by<00:05:22.760> default<00:05:23.240> we're<00:05:23.419> gonna<00:05:23.510> have<00:05:23.930> all

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
II minor by default we're gonna have all

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.930 
II minor by default we're gonna have all
of<00:05:24.169> those<00:05:24.410> open<00:05:24.860> notes<00:05:25.040> available<00:05:25.280> to<00:05:25.700> us<00:05:25.820> as

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
of those open notes available to us as

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:39.230 
of those open notes available to us as
well<00:05:26.120> right<00:05:26.330> so<00:05:26.510> this<00:05:26.600> is<00:05:26.660> just<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.080> octave

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.790 

so<00:05:40.240> you<00:05:40.390> miner<00:05:40.570> is<00:05:40.660> another<00:05:40.870> great<00:05:41.200> one<00:05:41.410> to<00:05:41.620> use

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
so you miner is another great one to use

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.450 
so you miner is another great one to use
the<00:05:42.010> the<00:05:42.370> open<00:05:42.640> string<00:05:43.890> add-on<00:05:44.890> mode<00:05:45.130> in<00:05:45.280> right

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
the the open string add-on mode in right

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.670 
the the open string add-on mode in right
and<00:05:45.730> another<00:05:46.570> cool<00:05:46.840> thing<00:05:46.870> you<00:05:47.230> can<00:05:47.380> do<00:05:47.530> with

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
and another cool thing you can do with

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.150 
and another cool thing you can do with
that<00:05:47.860> is<00:05:49.620> you<00:05:50.620> know<00:05:52.650> play<00:05:53.650> it<00:05:53.740> out<00:05:53.830> on<00:05:53.980> one

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
that is you know play it out on one

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.680 
that is you know play it out on one
string<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:54.730> then<00:05:54.910> play<00:05:54.940> the<00:05:55.210> next<00:05:55.330> string

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
string and then play the next string

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.990 
string and then play the next string
open<00:05:55.990> so<00:05:56.200> rather<00:05:56.440> than<00:05:56.680> just<00:05:56.740> okay<00:05:57.310> always

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
open so rather than just okay always

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.860 
open so rather than just okay always
skipping<00:05:58.420> between<00:05:59.320> the<00:05:59.470> one<00:05:59.650> string<00:06:03.870> they're

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
skipping between the one string they're

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.610 
skipping between the one string they're
just<00:06:05.290> using<00:06:05.500> the<00:06:05.710> E<00:06:05.740> string

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.430 

or<00:06:12.520> so<00:06:13.240> right<00:06:13.449> there<00:06:13.630> what<00:06:13.840> I'm<00:06:13.930> doing<00:06:14.229> is<00:06:14.320> I'm

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
or so right there what I'm doing is I'm

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.050 
or so right there what I'm doing is I'm
just<00:06:14.470> playing<00:06:14.860> off<00:06:15.070> of<00:06:15.100> the<00:06:15.340> e<00:06:15.370> string<00:06:15.790> and

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
just playing off of the e string and

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.439 
just playing off of the e string and
then<00:06:16.750> using<00:06:17.139> the<00:06:17.229> B<00:06:17.440> string<00:06:17.979> as<00:06:18.190> a<00:06:18.220> drone<00:06:18.580> where

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 
then using the B string as a drone where

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:32.660 
then using the B string as a drone where
you<00:06:19.540> can<00:06:19.720> you<00:06:20.050> know<00:06:20.080> invert

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670
