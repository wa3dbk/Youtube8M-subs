00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
which it then plans to run and so here

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.840 
which it then plans to run and so here
well<00:00:59.520> boom<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.329> popped<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.020> says<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:02.190> want

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to install this program in order to view

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.740 
to install this program in order to view
the<00:01:04.949> video<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.939> course<00:01:06.180> you're<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> say

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the video of course you're going to say

yes<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.939> off<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.869> go

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.899 

so<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> malware<00:01:13.770> successfully<00:01:14.520> installed

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
so the malware successfully installed

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.090 
so the malware successfully installed
files<00:01:15.180> onto<00:01:15.390> your<00:01:15.540> computer<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.259> then<00:01:16.710> was

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
files onto your computer and then was

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.010 
files onto your computer and then was
able<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.490> run<00:01:17.670> them<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.330> use<00:01:18.780> social

able to run them and use social

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.300 
able to run them and use social
engineering<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.619> trick<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.040> what<00:01:20.189> if

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
engineering to trick you now what if

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.039 
engineering to trick you now what if
you'd<00:01:20.430> been<00:01:20.670> running<00:01:21.000> an<00:01:21.119> anti-virus<00:01:21.750> program

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
you'd been running an anti-virus program

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.469 
you'd been running an anti-virus program
on<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:22.890> been<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> am<00:01:24.270> on

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
on this or been going on so here I am on

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.140 
on this or been going on so here I am on
the<00:01:24.540> Mac<00:01:24.780> again<00:01:24.960> at<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:25.920> time<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.220> have<00:01:26.640> Sophos

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the Mac again at this time I have Sophos

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.240 
the Mac again at this time I have Sophos
antivirus<00:01:27.509> running<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> background<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
antivirus running in the background and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.920 
antivirus running in the background and
there<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.119> false<00:01:30.329> antivirus<00:01:30.570> has

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
there we are so false antivirus has

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.719 
there we are so false antivirus has
detected<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.500> threat<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.070> java<00:01:32.310> applet

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
detected the threat in the java applet

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.880 
detected the threat in the java applet
and<00:01:32.939> prevented<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.900> from<00:01:33.930> executing<00:01:34.650> so

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
and prevented it from executing so

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.590 
and prevented it from executing so
you're<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.880> get<00:01:36.030> infected

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you're not going to get infected

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.069 
you're not going to get infected
well<00:01:37.020> that's<00:01:37.380> Mac<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.310> what<00:01:38.729> about<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.270> Linux

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
well that's Mac so what about on Linux

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.889 
well that's Mac so what about on Linux
so<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.500> I'm<00:01:40.619> running<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.009> bun<00:01:41.220> -<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.899> I'm

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
so here I'm running a bun - and I'm

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.039 
so here I'm running a bun - and I'm
going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.140> go<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.560> same<00:01:43.920> web<00:01:44.520> page<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:45.180> this

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
going to go to the same web page on this

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.320 
going to go to the same web page on this
computer<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:46.890> well

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.500 

it<00:01:50.330> begins<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:51.050> load<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:52.000> bam<00:01:53.000> there<00:01:53.300> you<00:01:53.390> are

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
it begins to load and bam there you are
