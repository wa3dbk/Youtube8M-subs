00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

you'll<00:00:00.480> notice<00:00:00.840> it<00:00:00.989> says<00:00:01.140> box<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:01.620> this<00:00:01.740> will

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
you'll notice it says box so this will

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.590 
you'll notice it says box so this will
actually<00:00:02.040> act<00:00:02.370> like<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.669> box<00:00:02.939> but<00:00:03.210> we<00:00:03.360> don't

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
actually act like a box but we don't

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.410 
actually act like a box but we don't
want<00:00:03.810> that<00:00:04.020> we<00:00:04.319> want<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.529> attack<00:00:04.799> like<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.069> cone

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
want that we want to attack like a cone

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.210 
want that we want to attack like a cone
so<00:00:06.420> if<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.660> click<00:00:06.839> on<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.140> menu<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.710> can<00:00:07.919> hit

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
so if you click on this menu you can hit

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.629 
so if you click on this menu you can hit
cone<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:09.110> if<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.230> have<00:00:10.380> obscure<00:00:10.980> objects<00:00:11.460> you

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
cone and if you have obscure objects you

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.339 
cone and if you have obscure objects you
can<00:00:11.790> hit<00:00:11.910> triangle<00:00:12.210> mesh<00:00:12.540> or<00:00:12.780> convex<00:00:13.170> hull

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
can hit triangle mesh or convex hull

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.919 
can hit triangle mesh or convex hull
whichever<00:00:13.710> one<00:00:13.950> works<00:00:14.130> better<00:00:14.719> but<00:00:15.719> they're

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
whichever one works better but they're

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.660 
whichever one works better but they're
not<00:00:16.080> as<00:00:16.260> accurate<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.190> will<00:00:17.310> act<00:00:17.430> like<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
not as accurate so this will act like a

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.890 
not as accurate so this will act like a
cone<00:00:17.940> now<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:21.560> if<00:00:23.210> not<00:00:24.210> now<00:00:24.449> you'll<00:00:24.660> notice

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
cone now so if not now you'll notice

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.339 
cone now so if not now you'll notice
that<00:00:26.210> down<00:00:27.210> here<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.779> added<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.170> whole<00:00:28.289> bunch

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
that down here it added a whole bunch

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.189 
that down here it added a whole bunch
more<00:00:28.830> settings<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.519> if<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.359> didn't<00:00:30.660> decide<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
more settings so if you didn't decide to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.319 
more settings so if you didn't decide to
make<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.560> rigidbody<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.610> edit

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
make it a rigidbody you can just edit

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.290 
make it a rigidbody you can just edit
these<00:00:33.690> location<00:00:34.820> properties<00:00:35.820> right<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.149> but

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
these location properties right here but

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.830 
these location properties right here but
I'm<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> use<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.290> velocity<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> since

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
I'm going to use the velocity so since

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.860 
I'm going to use the velocity so since
we<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:41.010> cone<00:00:41.879> traveling<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.629> way

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
we want this cone traveling this way

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.680 
we want this cone traveling this way
through<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> building<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.450> way<00:00:45.539> we're

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
through the building so the way we're

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.220 
through the building so the way we're
going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.899> do<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.760> we're<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:51.230> we're

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
going to do that is we're going to we're

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.529 
going to do that is we're going to we're
going<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:54.800> sorry<00:00:56.059> we're<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:58.850> make<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.239> so

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
going to sorry we're going to make it so

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.410 
going to sorry we're going to make it so
that<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.170> linear<00:01:02.160> velocity<00:01:02.280> let's<00:01:03.239> say

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
that the linear velocity let's say

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.020 
that the linear velocity let's say
negative<00:01:03.930> 5<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.979> let's<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.430> how<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> works

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
negative 5 and let's see how that works

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.670 
negative 5 and let's see how that works
and<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.390> should<00:01:07.130> that<00:01:08.130> should<00:01:08.640> make<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.680> go

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and that should that should make it go

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.550 
and that should that should make it go
through<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> building<00:01:11.430> yep<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.260> that's

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
through the building yep so but that's

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.859 
through the building yep so but that's
not<00:01:13.770> really<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.159> very<00:01:14.220> fast<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.600> can't

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
not really not very fast and it can't

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.179 
not really not very fast and it can't
really<00:01:16.049> get<00:01:16.259> through<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> building<00:01:18.140> so<00:01:19.189> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
really get through the building so to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.149 
really get through the building so to
make<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.490> faster<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.450> gonna<00:01:21.570> go<00:01:22.159> negative

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
make it faster we're gonna go negative

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.730 
make it faster we're gonna go negative
15<00:01:23.909> now<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.810> x<00:01:25.610> y&amp;z<00:01:26.930> velocities<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.500> same

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
15 now this is x y&amp;z velocities and same

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.999 
15 now this is x y&amp;z velocities and same
with<00:01:28.890> location<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.759> you're<00:01:29.939> using<00:01:30.090> location

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
with location if you're using location

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.490 
with location if you're using location
so<00:01:32.009> let's<00:01:32.490> hit<00:01:32.640> V<00:01:33.000> again<00:01:35.360> yeah<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.570> kind<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
so let's hit V again yeah it kind of it

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.550 
so let's hit V again yeah it kind of it
kind<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.600> kind<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.720> nudges<00:01:40.229> its<00:01:40.409> way

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
kind of it's like kind of nudges its way

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.080 
kind of it's like kind of nudges its way
through<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> building<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.400> want<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.850> fly

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
through the building we want to fly

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.050 
through the building we want to fly
through<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.509> building<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:44.310> way<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.850> that

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
through the building the way we do that

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.870 
through the building the way we do that
is<00:01:45.439> we<00:01:46.439> go<00:01:46.590> over<00:01:46.619> here<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.100> its<00:01:47.490> physics

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
is we go over here to its physics

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.469 
is we go over here to its physics
settings<00:01:48.180> increase<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> mass<00:01:49.530> by<00:01:50.040> 50<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.000> if

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
settings increase the mass by 50 and if

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.719 
settings increase the mass by 50 and if
you're<00:01:51.689> using<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.500> static<00:01:52.890> object<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.610> don't

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
you're using a static object you don't

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.420 
you're using a static object you don't
really<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:55.409> now<00:01:55.560> it'll

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
really have to do this but now it'll

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.880 
really have to do this but now it'll
just<00:01:56.520> go<00:01:56.820> right<00:01:56.850> through<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> building<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
just go right through the building so it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.440 
just go right through the building so it
goes<00:02:02.070> right<00:02:02.159> through<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.520> building<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.030> if

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
goes right through the building but if

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.020 
goes right through the building but if
you<00:02:03.600> want<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.869> edit<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.200> more<00:02:04.530> without

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
you want to edit this more without

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.160 
you want to edit this more without
having<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> simulate<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.689> whole<00:02:06.810> building

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
having to simulate the whole building

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.839 
having to simulate the whole building
fall<00:02:07.590> down<00:02:07.799> every<00:02:08.160> time

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
fall down every time

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.830 
fall down every time
hit<00:02:09.390> M<00:02:09.569> move<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.590> layer<00:02:10.739> let's<00:02:11.430> go<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.239> now<00:02:12.780> you

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
hit M move to layer let's go to now you

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.790 
hit M move to layer let's go to now you
will<00:02:13.020> notice<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.319> there

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
will notice that there

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.450 
will notice that there
a<00:02:13.890> dot<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.290> which<00:02:16.290> means<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:17.160> was<00:02:17.250> since

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
a dot on this which means it was since

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.100 
a dot on this which means it was since
it's<00:02:17.640> yellow<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.000> means<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.450> your<00:02:18.690> selected

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
it's yellow it means that your selected

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.330 
it's yellow it means that your selected
object<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:20.190> on<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.610> layer<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.830> means

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
object is on that layer and that means

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.270 
object is on that layer and that means
that<00:02:23.700> there<00:02:23.910> are<00:02:23.940> objects<00:02:24.600> on<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.080> layer<00:02:25.290> so

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
that there are objects on that layer so

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.950 
that there are objects on that layer so
now<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.880> hit<00:02:27.060> P<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.570> just<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:27.900> how

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
now if you hit P you can just see how

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.290 
now if you hit P you can just see how
fast<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:28.410> moving<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.040> good<00:02:29.300> reference

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
fast it's moving it's a good reference

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.020 
fast it's moving it's a good reference
thing<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.650> let's<00:02:31.830> make<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.250> negative<00:02:32.610> 25

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
thing so let's make that negative 25

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.420 
thing so let's make that negative 25
feet<00:02:33.240> I<00:02:33.330> like<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.660> better

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
feet I like that better

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.980 
feet I like that better
so<00:02:35.430> let's<00:02:35.700> back<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:35.910> up<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.300> little<00:02:36.390> bit<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:39.420> P

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
so let's back this up a little bit so P

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.360 
so let's back this up a little bit so P
yep<00:02:40.740> that<00:02:40.980> looks<00:02:41.010> good<00:02:41.400> now<00:02:42.530> we're<00:02:43.530> gonna<00:02:43.650> to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
yep that looks good now we're gonna to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.030 
yep that looks good now we're gonna to
make<00:02:44.730> them<00:02:44.940> both<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.900> make<00:02:46.050> kind<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.680> combine

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
make them both to make kind of combine

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.700 
make them both to make kind of combine
both<00:02:47.310> layers<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.940> hit<00:02:48.570> shift<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.410> have

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
both layers you hit shift and that have

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.620 
both layers you hit shift and that have
both<00:02:49.920> layers<00:02:50.190> selected<00:02:52.670> now<00:02:53.670> if<00:02:54.120> we<00:02:54.270> hit<00:02:54.360> P

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
both layers selected now if we hit P

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.650 
both layers selected now if we hit P
it'll<00:02:55.380> just<00:02:55.620> it'll<00:02:55.800> start<00:02:56.340> flying<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:57.120> right

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
it'll just it'll start flying and right

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.360 
it'll just it'll start flying and right
you<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.930> building<00:03:00.050> okay<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:01.740> we<00:03:02.070> have<00:03:02.190> that

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
you the building okay so we have that

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.090 
you the building okay so we have that
down<00:03:04.760> now<00:03:05.760> we<00:03:06.750> want<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:07.050> record<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.560> animation

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
down now we want to record the animation

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.500 
down now we want to record the animation
and<00:03:08.250> have<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.520> record<00:03:08.850> all<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.090> keyframes

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
and have it record all the keyframes

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.880 
and have it record all the keyframes
let's<00:03:09.900> get<00:03:10.080> rid<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.380> window<00:03:10.560> first

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
let's get rid of this window first

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.100 
let's get rid of this window first
because<00:03:11.130> it's<00:03:11.310> kind<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.760> annoying<00:03:12.110> we're

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
because it's kind of annoying we're

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.870 
because it's kind of annoying we're
going<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.940> we<00:03:15.300> want<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:16.580> except<00:03:17.580> we<00:03:17.700> want

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
going to so we want this except we want

going to so we want this except we want
to<00:03:17.940> be<00:03:18.030> able<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.239> render<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:18.959> record<00:03:19.320> it

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
to be able to render it and record it

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.140 
to be able to render it and record it
but<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:19.890> don't<00:03:20.040> notice<00:03:20.130> down<00:03:20.550> here<00:03:20.610> at<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
but you don't notice down here at the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.100 
but you don't notice down here at the
and<00:03:21.390> are<00:03:21.750> at<00:03:22.110> yeah<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.010> animation<00:03:23.989> or<00:03:24.989> the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
and are at yeah the animation or the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.290 
and are at yeah the animation or the
timeline<00:03:25.410> here<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.640> doesn't<00:03:27.030> do<00:03:27.120> anything

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
timeline here it doesn't do anything

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.220 
timeline here it doesn't do anything
when<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.570> move<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:30.209> way<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.959> do<00:03:31.080> this

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
when I move this so the way to do this

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.560 
when I move this so the way to do this
is<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.709> want<00:03:31.830> us<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.130> save<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.640> because<00:03:32.970> what

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
is you want us to save this because what

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.380 
is you want us to save this because what
we're<00:03:33.690> gonna<00:03:33.780> do<00:03:34.310> is<00:03:35.310> we're<00:03:35.910> gonna<00:03:36.030> simulate

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
we're gonna do is we're gonna simulate

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.080 
we're gonna do is we're gonna simulate
this<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.130> except<00:03:38.130> we're<00:03:38.550> going<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.760> record

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
this and except we're going to record

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.729 
this and except we're going to record
everything<00:03:39.270> onto<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.959> timeline<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.560> once

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
everything onto the timeline and once

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.800 
everything onto the timeline and once
you<00:03:40.890> do<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.220> all<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.760> keyframes<00:03:41.970> for<00:03:42.480> every

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
you do that all the keyframes for every

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.990 
you do that all the keyframes for every
object<00:03:42.989> are<00:03:43.410> set<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.550> can't<00:03:44.790> really

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
object are set and you can't really

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.760 
object are set and you can't really
delete<00:03:45.270> them<00:03:45.510> so<00:03:45.720> if<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.290> want<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.530> go<00:03:46.590> back

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
delete them so if you want to go back

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.020 
delete them so if you want to go back
and<00:03:46.920> change<00:03:47.040> something<00:03:47.370> like<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.850> position

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
and change something like the position

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.080 
and change something like the position
as<00:03:48.450> your<00:03:48.600> cone<00:03:48.840> here<00:03:49.310> you<00:03:50.310> can't<00:03:50.520> really<00:03:50.700> you

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
as your cone here you can't really you

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.860 
as your cone here you can't really you
can't<00:03:51.300> do<00:03:51.450> that

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
can't do that

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.479 
can't do that
so<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:52.350> want<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:53.100> want<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.340> save

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
so you want to you want to save

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.710 
so you want to you want to save
different<00:03:53.730> versions<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.300> want<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.540> save

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
different versions you want to save

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.620 
different versions you want to save
non-simulated<00:03:55.560> version<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.630> assimilator

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
non-simulated version and assimilator

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.380 
non-simulated version and assimilator
version<00:03:58.140> now<00:03:58.860> alright<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:02.090> we're<00:04:03.090> going<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.239> go

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
version now alright so we're going to go

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.340 
version now alright so we're going to go
record<00:04:03.720> animation<00:04:07.850> so<00:04:08.850> go<00:04:09.570> up<00:04:09.630> here<00:04:09.989> gain

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
record animation so go up here gain

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.699 
record animation so go up here gain
record<00:04:10.860> animation<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.580> now<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:13.110> time<00:04:13.440> when

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
record animation and now this time when

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.840 
record animation and now this time when
we<00:04:13.739> render<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.700> mean<00:04:15.209> when<00:04:15.360> we<00:04:15.510> simulate<00:04:16.850> soap

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
we render I mean when we simulate soap

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.849 
we render I mean when we simulate soap
recipe<00:04:18.060> you'll<00:04:18.690> notice<00:04:19.019> it<00:04:19.200> goes<00:04:19.350> with<00:04:19.530> kind

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
recipe you'll notice it goes with kind

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.890 
recipe you'll notice it goes with kind
of<00:04:19.980> a<00:04:20.100> lot<00:04:20.250> slower<00:04:20.609> that's<00:04:21.269> just<00:04:21.450> because<00:04:21.600> it's

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
of a lot slower that's just because it's

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.330 
of a lot slower that's just because it's
recording<00:04:22.320> every<00:04:22.530> single<00:04:22.830> frame<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.250> that

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
recording every single frame and that

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.170 
recording every single frame and that
skipping<00:04:23.820> frames

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
skipping frames

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.400 
skipping frames
so<00:04:25.840> here<00:04:26.290> it<00:04:26.350> goes<00:04:27.160> wait<00:04:27.520> for<00:04:27.760> if<00:04:27.940> just<00:04:28.900> me<00:04:29.080> you

of this is just waiting I'm stuck when
you<00:04:35.650> think<00:04:35.860> it's<00:04:36.010> all<00:04:36.130> done<00:04:37.080> now<00:04:39.690> there<00:04:40.690> we<00:04:40.840> go

okay

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.550 
okay
so<00:04:42.520> now<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.419> can<00:04:43.570> kind<00:04:43.780> of<00:04:43.840> zoom<00:04:43.900> around<00:04:44.199> and

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
so now you can kind of zoom around and

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.870 
so now you can kind of zoom around and
stuff<00:04:46.470> but<00:04:47.470> you'll<00:04:47.620> notice<00:04:47.949> that<00:04:48.160> the

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
stuff but you'll notice that the

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.879 
stuff but you'll notice that the
keyframes<00:04:49.330> go<00:04:49.510> way<00:04:49.690> past<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:52.199> frame<00:04:53.199> 250<00:04:53.530> when

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
keyframes go way past the frame 250 when

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.439 
keyframes go way past the frame 250 when
we're<00:04:54.190> supposed<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.639> stop<00:04:54.910> requiring<00:04:55.300> our

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
we're supposed to stop requiring our

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.860 
we're supposed to stop requiring our
animation<00:04:56.280> so<00:04:57.280> find<00:04:58.060> kind<00:04:58.300> of<00:04:58.360> a<00:04:58.449> point<00:04:58.660> where

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
animation so find kind of a point where

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.590 
animation so find kind of a point where
the<00:04:59.050> last<00:04:59.229> keyframe<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.860> it<00:05:00.520> says<00:05:01.120> right<00:05:01.419> down

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
the last keyframe is it says right down

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.420 
the last keyframe is it says right down
here<00:05:01.810> for<00:05:02.050> 40<00:05:02.380> so<00:05:02.560> we're<00:05:02.710> going<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:02.889> change<00:05:03.190> the

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
here for 40 so we're going to change the

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.920 
here for 40 so we're going to change the
info<00:05:03.760> for<00:05:03.940> 40<00:05:04.410> so<00:05:05.410> now<00:05:05.590> our<00:05:06.419> article<00:05:07.419> our<00:05:07.690> work

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
info for 40 so now our article our work

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.560 
info for 40 so now our article our work
area<00:05:08.320> is<00:05:10.139> 440<00:05:11.139> frames<00:05:11.410> long<00:05:11.680> or<00:05:11.970> 441<00:05:12.970> frames

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
area is 440 frames long or 441 frames

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.070 
area is 440 frames long or 441 frames
long<00:05:13.979> so<00:05:14.979> you<00:05:15.100> have<00:05:15.280> this<00:05:15.430> whole<00:05:15.639> queue<00:05:16.120> that's

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
long so you have this whole queue that's

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.760 
long so you have this whole queue that's
all<00:05:17.350> good<00:05:18.240> you<00:05:19.240> can<00:05:19.539> kind<00:05:20.020> of<00:05:20.110> play<00:05:20.320> it<00:05:20.470> well

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
all good you can kind of play it well

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.070 
all good you can kind of play it well
you<00:05:21.250> know<00:05:21.280> you're<00:05:21.729> well<00:05:22.419> it's<00:05:22.539> happening<00:05:22.990> and

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
you know you're well it's happening and

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.370 
you know you're well it's happening and
that<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:23.530> think<00:05:23.830> that's<00:05:23.949> kind<00:05:24.250> of<00:05:24.310> cool
