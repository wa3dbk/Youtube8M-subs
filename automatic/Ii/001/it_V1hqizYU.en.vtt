00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
conversations with my mother um this

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.539 
conversations with my mother um this
weekend<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.660> so<00:03:55.959> I<00:03:56.320> wanted<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:56.920> draw<00:03:57.250> her<00:03:57.400> and

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
weekend and so I wanted to draw her and

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.479 
weekend and so I wanted to draw her and
maybe<00:03:57.940> thought<00:03:58.299> I<00:03:58.630> thought<00:03:59.109> maybe<00:03:59.380> a<00:03:59.489> senator

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
maybe thought I thought maybe a senator

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.180 
maybe thought I thought maybe a senator
but<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:01.359> does<00:04:01.690> not<00:04:01.959> really<00:04:02.230> look<00:04:02.500> more<00:04:02.739> like<00:04:02.980> my

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
but it does not really look more like my

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.970 
but it does not really look more like my
mother<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:03.820> have<00:04:04.239> this<00:04:04.510> photo<00:04:05.049> booth<00:04:05.470> thing
