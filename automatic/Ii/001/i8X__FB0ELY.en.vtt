joke the choke lever is really loose
just<00:00:39.510> kind<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.870> flopped<00:00:40.110> around<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:41.030> so

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
just kind of like flopped around and so

just kind of like flopped around and so
just<00:00:42.390> when<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.570> started<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> vacuum<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
just when you started the vacuum of the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.940 
just when you started the vacuum of the
engine<00:00:44.910> sucks<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> back<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.930> go<00:00:46.050> pull<00:00:46.800> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
while holding the choke hard so I'll use

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:54.870 
while holding the choke hard so I'll use
my<00:00:49.680> invoice<00:00:50.250> tripod

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.980 

it<00:01:55.880> does<00:01:56.060> run

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:13.760 

I<00:02:11.780> just<00:02:12.780> realized<00:02:13.200> don't<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:13.530> how<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.650> missed

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770

I just realized don't know how I missed
this<00:02:14.040> before<00:02:14.510> looks<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.870> must<00:02:15.989> have

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
this before looks like it must have

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.860 
this before looks like it must have
thrown<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.440> rod<00:02:16.709> at<00:02:16.920> some<00:02:17.130> point<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:18.480> crankcase

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
thrown a rod at some point the crankcase

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.780 
thrown a rod at some point the crankcase
has<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.440> patch<00:02:19.739> on<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.040> looks<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.519> you<00:02:20.640> can

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
has this patch on it looks like you can

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.900 
has this patch on it looks like you can
see<00:02:21.030> like<00:02:21.390> rivets<00:02:21.630> over<00:02:21.959> there<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:23.640> didn't

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
see like rivets over there and I didn't

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.580 
see like rivets over there and I didn't
notice<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.269> until<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.540> saw<00:02:24.810> oil<00:02:25.019> spraying<00:02:25.470> out

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
notice it until I saw oil spraying out

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.740 
notice it until I saw oil spraying out
on<00:02:25.739> my<00:02:25.860> garage<00:02:26.040> floor<00:02:26.489> like<00:02:27.239> what<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.480> hell<00:02:27.630> is

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
on my garage floor like what the hell is

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.509 
on my garage floor like what the hell is
that<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.440> make<00:02:28.590> any<00:02:28.709> sense<00:02:28.950> exhaust<00:02:29.340> on

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
that you can make any sense exhaust on

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.699 
that you can make any sense exhaust on
the<00:02:29.610> other<00:02:29.730> side<00:02:29.970> water<00:02:30.230> look<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.349> mean<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.560> can

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
the other side water look I mean you can

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:32.960 
the other side water look I mean you can
see<00:02:31.890> right<00:02:31.920> there<00:02:32.280> how<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:32.580> dripping<00:02:32.849> down

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
see right there how it's dripping down

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.140 
see right there how it's dripping down
there<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.560> not<00:02:35.190> only<00:02:35.220> they<00:02:35.700> patch<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:35.940> with

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
there so I not only they patch it with

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.710 
there so I not only they patch it with
some<00:02:36.480> sort<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.750> rivets<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.319> then<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.519> are

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
some sort of rivets and then they are

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.940 
some sort of rivets and then they are
and<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.810> didn't<00:02:40.140> work<00:02:40.170> enough<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:40.650> they<00:02:40.769> put

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
and that didn't work enough so they put

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.910 
and that didn't work enough so they put
like<00:02:41.150> some<00:02:42.150> sort<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.540> sealant<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:43.620> there<00:02:43.860> it's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
like some sort of sealant on there it's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.780 
like some sort of sealant on there it's
low<00:02:44.519> it's<00:02:45.360> kind<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.690> soft<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.340> took<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
low it's kind of soft so I took the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.690 
low it's kind of soft so I took the
brig's<00:02:48.360> off<00:02:48.569> their<00:02:49.280> think<00:02:50.280> i'm<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.459> going<00:02:50.670> to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
brig's off their think i'm just going to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.340 
brig's off their think i'm just going to
use<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.420> for<00:02:51.450> parts<00:02:51.870> on<00:02:52.709> other<00:02:52.980> things<00:02:53.310> because

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
use it for parts on other things because

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.479 
use it for parts on other things because
there's<00:02:55.350> no<00:02:55.470> point<00:02:55.709> in<00:02:55.769> keeping<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.130> subscribe

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
there's no point in keeping it subscribe

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.570 
there's no point in keeping it subscribe
to<00:02:56.519> correct<00:02:56.880> crankcase<00:02:57.709> we<00:02:58.709> can<00:02:58.920> tank<00:02:59.160> and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
to correct crankcase we can tank and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.870 
to correct crankcase we can tank and
burns<00:03:00.090> oil<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.600> also<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.989> crown<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.819> how<00:03:02.819> do

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
burns oil and also to crown so how do

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.270 
burns oil and also to crown so how do
stuff

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280
