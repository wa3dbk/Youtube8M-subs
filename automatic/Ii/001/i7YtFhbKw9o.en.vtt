00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.070
 before about 9 years 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.970
 began to grow oil palm in the municipality of maríalabaja bolívar 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:13.609
 goes to the scheme productive alliances and the results I see today are a 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.560
 economic reactivation 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.090
 for the municipality made settlers seroló one have pointed out the own 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.470
 farmers and inhabitants 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.060
 in general the palm helped 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.400
 enough to all sectors with the leveling of 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.600
 to boost the various productive activities 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.600
 and impact the regional economy 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.060
 the palm you try is a tropical plant 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.850
 own warm equimac 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.170
 that grows on land below 500 meters above sea level 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.810
 its origin is located in the gulf of guinea in west africa 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 it is popularly called African palm 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.579
 the irrigation system 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.340
 is through channels through which 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.340
 water will be distributed to all of the crop 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.810
 The productive life of the palm is tried can last more than 50 years 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.700
 but from 20 to 25 southall reached a height with difficulties 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.049
 labor and marks the beginning of the revolution in the 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.049
 commercial plants 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.070
 in the palm of oil some 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.520
 flowers 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.890
 male and female 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.950
 from which fruits are born by thousands 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.720
 spherical ovo idespo elongated to conform 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.080
 compact clusters of between 10 and 40 kilograms of weight 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.390
 the transport is done through animal transition and mechanical traction 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.990
 knowing the products towards the plant extract 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.310
 where the processing of the products of the palm plan is carried out 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.450
 for the extraction of crude palm oil and palm trees or palm kernel 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.359
 the first process in the reception of the fruit 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.110
 that were fame 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.879
 nothing for the star at the bat research 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.499
 if still bunches 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:25.559
 of fresh fruit are the first equipment found in the oil extractor 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:27.239
 Palm 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.639
 Africans serve to deliver the fruit in the baskets 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.319
 deep cobo waves 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.110
 for sterilization 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.620
 with terol and evaluation of the quality of the fruit received and through 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.099
 this is done the assessment of the quality of the fruit received 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.279
 and storage 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.809
 to have fruit magazines 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.559
 for later use 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.469
 and then you pay at 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.629
 the sterilization 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.200
 which is in the second stage of the process in which the clusters suffer 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.129
 a transformation 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.749
 in correct this list of bunches is essential for the stages 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.749
 later in the process and to a large extent 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.339
 the rate of oil extraction depends on this stage 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.929
 we went through rubbing 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:29.839
 which is in the selection in which the fruit after boiling is fired 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:34.679
 the mechanically mediated spine of its winner is rotating 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:41.649
 to allow its subsequent processing the television consist of two fighters 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.649
 bridges volt cranes 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:48.959
 cluster feeders sense that the nose 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.639
 we passed aral di state arm 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:00.419
 where is they are following compounds by a rotary vertical axis with arms 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:01.789
 agitators 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:08.149
 julia functions the fruit is more row coma they graduate and heated 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:10.629
 separating it from the meso party 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.469
 and breaking the offers 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.479
 it contains and the oil 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.079
 we passed harper in 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.639
 that is the attention where the oil will be mechanically 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.779
 contained on that occasion 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:29.059
 the goal is treated so that it breaks through heat and cypress and still 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:32.899
 mechanically to the cells that contain the mesocarp oil 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.879
 the applied pressure 3º such that the largest amount of oil was extracted and 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.879
 the break is minimized 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.340
 we passed alves fibers 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.900
 which is composed of the final cake breaking zinc which is a 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.419
 pallet conveyor that has been specially designed 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.000
 to achieve an effective separation between the nuts the fibers that is 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.550
 all right 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.550
 of the mixed and compressed dams 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.969
 the team accomplishes this by means of their paddles that acting at great speed 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:16.489
 how shovels shake and unleash the cake of fibers and nuts 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.590
 coming from the presses in a 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.590
 long journey 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.990
 to these six tentella extracted already 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.240
 of the meso divided by 3 to 1 contains varying amounts of impurity 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.099
 vegetal material 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:40.339
 part of which are presented as insoluble solids and dissolved parts 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.270
 in the water that contain the oil 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.090
 both water and impurities must be removed and what is achieved through 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.770
 plan 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.990
 clarification
