00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.430
 Mai together after I last a 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.720
 a bit spicy is shot unboxing 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.120
 I now have one after the election 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.800
 camera back home is the ipad mini 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.960
 made again and I became 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.759
 asked by some people again 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.800
 a little something to show before the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.970
 Maybe he's connecting because of the people 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.160
 is not in the store you can do it 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.260
 watch or just in video form 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.779
 want to see it on the internet 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.070
 somehow not rich and therefore still 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.300
 times in something sharper the ipad mini here 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.180
 above you have us clear you see 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.860
 the on and off switch here has in 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.170
 Connection for the headphones and below 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.629
 Do you have the stereo speakers and the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.579
 suffering changes are funnier 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.520
 the stereo speakers somehow 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.649
 bit unfavorable because provided 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.820
 that's me, somehow 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.050
 exhibit because I have a movie kokowääh 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.969
 I really have no 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.379
 speakers more 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.149
 it would have been more logical these links 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.020
 and would have been consumed right so 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.969
 above and below 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.710
 of course they shine like that now 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.830
 now is now new dierig right 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.659
 Direction yes so the ipad mini looks 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.150
 I hope you can do it on the camera 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.350
 so kinda recognize me personally 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.080
 Of course, it is also because it is in the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.110
 third and fourth generation too 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.979
 Of course we do not have any here 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.750
 we have a retina display 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.150
 here a resolution of 1024 x 768 den 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.729
 you definitely see different if 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.250
 one with the retina display before 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.650
 One has to work very clearly 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.720
 say devices like the nexus have these 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.939
 in the form of the display or regulation 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.799
 In my opinion, simple tick 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.420
 sharper and also they are 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.329
 cheaper still is the ipad if that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:52.720
 my text report really reads 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:55.660
 show good device 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.520
 so the fun of it so I have it 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.070
 sorted here so it works too 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.510
 super fluid although of course only a 1 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.270
 gigahertz processor with 512 mb ram 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.170
 the new gasoline against already has one 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.790
 gigabytes of ram 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.440
 yet most of the games are running 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.350
 all liquid which one stops a bit 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.240
 you notice the ipad 3 in the restaurant that 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.890
 the fourth generation has the opinion 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.520
 the loading times on apps a bit 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.890
 are longer 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.950
 I have that with me animals, we are like that 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.720
 what I play is so relative 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.590
 unspectacular percent just once again 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.990
 have shown what it looks like 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.180
 The news of the fun is in 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.410
 compared to the normal ipad I have 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.370
 Of course some pictures were taken too 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.050
 to the iphone 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.580
 After all, I'll look at you, of course 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.670
 wanted to show what, of course, maybe 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.780
 in the video is not so good is the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.700
 sound partie free oh yes and what's new 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.590
 if you dream that beforehand makes such a 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.840
 rocker switch is alive now you have here 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.700
 the speakers respectively 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.430
 volume control you have in 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.420
 separate buttons 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.800
 that was not like that before 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.110
 I 'm just looking for the album which 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.590
 undeniably already determined 500 times 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.590
 heard 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.379
 find it 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.120
 So I think it is measured by the size 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.920
 what have really very good ones 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.790
 loud speaker i look somehow 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.790
 but which indicated fast 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.090
 yes that do so to express how 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.880
 The treatment did not really say 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.360
 Because of their design, the bad 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.780
 as I said - points is completely at the iPad 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.920
 clearly the price is just when 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.630
 here in devices 32 gigabytes it is 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.700
 really very expensive and you have 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.370
 enough alternatives in the cheaper 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.810
 area the display has with me too 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.110
 Minus points I got as I said 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.180
 in predecessor would need to share 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.370
 Note Japan 4 3 format if the company 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.810
 look have the old bars because apple 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.910
 sits just too much to 3 while others 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.640
 stop on 16 2 sets 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.580
 Look at it for 16-19 years 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.190
 Of course, both have a negative positive for the two 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.570
 The speakers are really fantastic 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.530
 Processing one of apple 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:10.310
 the camera recognizes 5 megapixels 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:13.390
 that is quite okay but has the disadvantage 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.620
 that they really only in bright surroundings 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.600
 good to use once is 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.990
 the device gets a bit darker 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.500
 keep quiet because otherwise rush that stop 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.380
 somehow very strong yes what else is there 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.210
 so to speak, I think that's in 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.610
 big that most stops in 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.710
 my text here again that is one 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.960
 really is a nice one 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.669
 device who has the money and in the apple 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.000
 universe would be at home just was 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.050
 time are fantastic apps for you the 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.310
 can take a look 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.050
 that may be a reason why 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.360
 Apple vampire to 3 format remained it 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.980
 Soon the apps are still screen 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.960
 do not fill up and do not have to 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.750
 to be adjusted again 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.030
 yes as I said if you have any questions 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.669
 quietly stop by the village and see you 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.320
 read through all the fun requests there 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.650
 are to be answered until the 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.650
 rundschau
