the<00:01:18.050> world<00:01:18.260> is<00:01:18.410> is<00:01:18.950> bad<00:01:19.280> because<00:01:19.840> mental<00:01:20.840> don't

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
the world is is bad because mental don't

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.580 
the world is is bad because mental don't
become<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:22.490> train<00:01:22.880> with<00:01:23.360> Lee<00:01:23.540> physical<00:01:24.110> so

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
become to train with Lee physical so

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.650 
become to train with Lee physical so
they<00:01:24.740> will<00:01:24.830> be<00:01:24.980> equivalent<00:01:25.250> see<00:01:26.000> now<00:01:26.180> if<00:01:26.480> you

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
they will be equivalent see now if you

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.690 
they will be equivalent see now if you
ask<00:01:26.840> him<00:01:27.110> when<00:01:27.260> you<00:01:27.380> do<00:01:27.560> this<00:01:27.770> without<00:01:28.220> this

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
ask him when you do this without this

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.120 
ask him when you do this without this
this<00:01:29.570> is<00:01:29.750> tiring<00:01:30.050> because<00:01:30.410> mental<00:01:31.040> is

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
this is tiring because mental is

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.370 
this is tiring because mental is
becoming<00:01:31.550> fit<00:01:31.820> it's<00:01:32.510> coming<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.990> work<00:01:33.110> is

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
becoming fit it's coming to work is

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.480 
becoming fit it's coming to work is
engaged<00:01:33.890> but<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.729> old<00:01:35.360> old<00:01:35.720> way<00:01:36.170> of

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
engaged but the old old way of

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.160 
engaged but the old old way of
old-fashioned<00:01:37.490> training<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.390> mind<00:01:38.540> sleeping

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
old-fashioned training the mind sleeping

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.710 
old-fashioned training the mind sleeping
on<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.440> Rebs<00:01:39.650> be<00:01:39.910> see<00:01:40.910> this<00:01:41.090> different<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:41.660> you

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
on the Rebs be see this different so you

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.710 
on the Rebs be see this different so you
become<00:01:42.260> physically<00:01:42.979> fit<00:01:43.250> yeah<00:01:43.790> but<00:01:44.210> military

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
become physically fit yeah but military

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.260 
become physically fit yeah but military
anything<00:01:45.229> yeah<00:01:45.830> well<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.490> know<00:01:46.520> how<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.030> know

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
anything yeah well you know how you know

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.170 
anything yeah well you know how you know
when<00:01:47.780> they<00:01:47.990> go<00:01:48.259> they<00:01:49.040> be<00:01:49.220> play<00:01:49.490> they<00:01:49.729> go<00:01:49.940> there

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
when they go they be play they go there

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.280 
when they go they be play they go there
in<00:01:50.390> 10<00:01:51.110> years<00:01:51.259> 15<00:01:51.890> years<00:01:52.190> they<00:01:52.640> missed<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.030> all

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
in 10 years 15 years they missed it all

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.920 
in 10 years 15 years they missed it all
you're<00:01:54.290> seeing<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.770> why<00:01:55.369> because<00:01:56.150> mental<00:01:56.780> is

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
you're seeing a why because mental is

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.320 
you're seeing a why because mental is
not<00:01:57.380> trained<00:01:57.800> if<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:58.520> was<00:01:58.729> training

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
not trained if it was training

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.389 
not trained if it was training
equivalent<00:01:59.899> to<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.140> this<00:02:00.590> approach<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.100> not

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
equivalent to this this approach to not

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.520 
equivalent to this this approach to not
miss<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.210> that's<00:02:02.420> why<00:02:02.570> we<00:02:02.750> are<00:02:02.840> training<00:02:03.200> him

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
miss so that's why we are training him

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.859 
miss so that's why we are training him
in<00:02:03.680> future<00:02:04.040> so<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.340> can<00:02:04.580> his<00:02:05.180> mentor<00:02:05.570> we<00:02:05.720> can

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
in future so you can his mentor we can

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.020 
in future so you can his mentor we can
see<00:02:06.050> it<00:02:06.110> like<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:06.350> day<00:02:06.770> we<00:02:06.950> did<00:02:07.130> mental

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
see it like that day we did mental

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.449 
see it like that day we did mental
physical<00:02:08.479> fitness<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:09.530> balls<00:02:09.770> one<00:02:10.009> after<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
physical fitness the balls one after the

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.490 
physical fitness the balls one after the
other<00:02:10.489> wonder<00:02:10.970> if<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.510> ask<00:02:11.690> him<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.170> if<00:02:12.410> you

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
other wonder if you ask him and if you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.710 
other wonder if you ask him and if you
put<00:02:12.739> green<00:02:13.160> mountain<00:02:13.670> would<00:02:13.820> be<00:02:13.940> more<00:02:14.120> tired<00:02:14.390> I

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
put green mountain would be more tired I

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.229 
put green mountain would be more tired I
you<00:02:15.680> know<00:02:15.709> because<00:02:16.070> there<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.340> mental

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
you know because there is mental

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.210 
you know because there is mental
physical<00:02:17.720> fitness<00:02:17.959> because<00:02:18.230> what<00:02:18.620> was<00:02:18.860> easy

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
physical fitness because what was easy

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.550 
physical fitness because what was easy
way<00:02:19.610> just<00:02:19.880> as<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.570> put<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.900> ball<00:02:21.080> into<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
way just as to put the ball into the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.970 
way just as to put the ball into the
goal<00:02:22.030> going<00:02:23.030> bring<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.510> numbers<00:02:24.019> yeah<00:02:24.530> with

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
goal going bring the numbers yeah with

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.500 
goal going bring the numbers yeah with
the<00:02:25.130> scoring<00:02:25.670> then<00:02:25.970> it's<00:02:27.940> all<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.090> signal

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
the scoring then it's all the signal

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.199 
the scoring then it's all the signal
coming<00:02:29.720> in<00:02:29.870> fact<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.470> have<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.010> understand<00:02:31.580> yeah

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
coming in fact I have to understand yeah

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.660 
coming in fact I have to understand yeah
the<00:02:32.660> program<00:02:33.350> because<00:02:33.830> it's<00:02:34.070> something<00:02:34.370> very

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
the program because it's something very

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.090 
the program because it's something very
unique<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.989> know<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.290> world<00:02:36.470> does<00:02:36.709> not<00:02:36.890> know

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
unique you know the world does not know

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.400 
unique you know the world does not know
because<00:02:37.400> we<00:02:37.610> are<00:02:37.730> hiking<00:02:38.000> zone
