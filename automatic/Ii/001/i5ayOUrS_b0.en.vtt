00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
and let's look at the code

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.510 
and let's look at the code
this<00:04:09.060> will<00:04:09.300> be<00:04:09.420> very<00:04:09.630> interesting<00:04:10.490> so<00:04:11.490> what

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
this will be very interesting so what

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.590 
this will be very interesting so what
has<00:04:11.910> happened<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:13.520> dream<00:04:14.520> weavers<00:04:14.910> had<00:04:15.210> this

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
has happened is a dream weavers had this

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.260 
has happened is a dream weavers had this
rollover<00:04:16.080> effect<00:04:18.230> going<00:04:19.230> back<00:04:19.410> like<00:04:19.650> 10

rollover effect going back like 10

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.050 
rollover effect going back like 10
versions<00:04:21.270> but<00:04:21.990> the<00:04:22.140> code<00:04:22.380> is<00:04:22.650> totally<00:04:23.370> funky

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
versions but the code is totally funky

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.640 
versions but the code is totally funky
because<00:04:24.960> this<00:04:25.320> my<00:04:25.950> friends<00:04:26.430> is<00:04:26.520> no<00:04:26.760> longer

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
down into CSS road there's a much easier

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.610 
down into CSS road there's a much easier
way<00:05:34.650> to<00:05:34.980> do<00:05:35.460> this<00:05:35.670> with<00:05:36.060> some<00:05:36.300> CSS<00:05:36.900> code<00:05:37.260> called

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
way to do this with some CSS code called

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.510 
way to do this with some CSS code called
the<00:05:37.800> hover<00:05:38.220> effect<00:05:38.730> um<00:05:39.590> but<00:05:40.590> this<00:05:40.800> used<00:05:41.160> to<00:05:41.310> be

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
the hover effect um but this used to be

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.560 
the hover effect um but this used to be
the<00:05:41.990> only<00:05:42.990> way<00:05:43.200> to<00:05:43.260> get<00:05:43.740> it<00:05:43.770> done<00:05:43.890> and<00:05:44.430> if<00:05:45.150> I

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
the only way to get it done and if I

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.970 
the only way to get it done and if I
come<00:05:45.780> down<00:05:45.960> here<00:05:46.170> to<00:05:46.230> swap<00:05:46.680> image<00:05:47.460> I<00:05:48.740> get<00:05:49.740> this

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
come down here to swap image I get this

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.520 
come down here to swap image I get this
little<00:05:50.490> menu<00:05:50.730> here<00:05:51.240> and<00:05:51.360> I<00:05:51.420> can<00:05:51.600> browse<00:05:51.960> and
