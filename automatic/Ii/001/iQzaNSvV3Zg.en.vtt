make the DTM cars able to be used in

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.140 
make the DTM cars able to be used in
different<00:03:58.900> championships<00:03:59.740> and<00:04:00.370> also<00:04:00.820> giving

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
different championships and also giving

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.110

the<00:04:01.270> chance<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:02.470> cars<00:04:02.710> from<00:04:02.920> Japan<00:04:02.980> or<00:04:03.910> maybe

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
the chance to cars from Japan or maybe

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:24.390 
the chance to cars from Japan or maybe
United<00:04:04.690> States<00:04:04.960> race<00:04:05.290> here<00:04:05.590> in<00:04:05.800> the<00:04:06.040> GM

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.770 

I<00:04:29.220> think<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.340> next<00:04:30.580> video<00:04:30.850> Stryver<00:04:31.180> will<00:04:31.509> come

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
I think the next video Stryver will come

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.080 
I think the next video Stryver will come
when<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.590> timing<00:04:32.949> is<00:04:33.039> right<00:04:33.100> that<00:04:33.789> there<00:04:33.940> is<00:04:34.060> a

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
when the timing is right that there is a

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.719 
when the timing is right that there is a
place<00:04:34.389> free<00:04:34.720> at<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.320> Audi<00:04:35.919> or<00:04:36.340> maybe<00:04:36.580> at

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
place free at the Audi or maybe at

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.760 
place free at the Audi or maybe at
Mercedes<00:04:37.240> but<00:04:37.509> I<00:04:37.570> also<00:04:37.780> think<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.320> needs<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.680> be

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
Mercedes but I also think it needs to be

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.860 
Mercedes but I also think it needs to be
a<00:04:38.919> guy<00:04:39.160> which<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.580> really<00:04:39.850> good<00:04:40.060> and<00:04:40.300> I'm

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870

what<00:04:52.960> makes<00:04:53.169> DTM<00:04:53.620> really<00:04:53.949> popular<00:04:54.520> is<00:04:54.580> that

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
what makes DTM really popular is that

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.249 
what makes DTM really popular is that
the<00:04:55.030> racing<00:04:55.419> is<00:04:55.509> good<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:55.960> for<00:04:56.139> that<00:04:56.199> reason

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
the racing is good and for that reason

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.500 
the racing is good and for that reason
we<00:04:56.650> have<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.800> lot<00:04:57.010> of<00:04:57.160> fans<00:04:57.430> on<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.850> grandstands

we have a lot of fans on the grandstands

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.120 
we have a lot of fans on the grandstands
on<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.810> races<00:04:59.229> or<00:04:59.560> in<00:04:59.710> front<00:04:59.889> of<00:05:00.070> the
