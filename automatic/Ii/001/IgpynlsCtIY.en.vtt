00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.320 
me but anyways last night I was on
runescape<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:28.220> was<00:02:28.430> literally<00:02:28.790> about<00:02:29.270> a

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
runescape and I was literally about a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.200 
runescape and I was literally about a
ball<00:02:29.810> hair<00:02:30.230> away<00:02:30.650> from<00:02:30.950> buying<00:02:31.190> full<00:02:31.700> torva

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
ball hair away from buying full torva

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.020 
ball hair away from buying full torva
and<00:02:32.450> maybe<00:02:32.990> like<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.290> divine<00:02:33.890> or<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.280> Nellie<00:02:34.580> and

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
and maybe like a divine or a Nellie and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.150 
and maybe like a divine or a Nellie and
then<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.600> basically<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:36.380> remembered<00:02:36.920> that

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
then I basically just remembered that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.580 
then I basically just remembered that
those<00:02:37.700> items<00:02:38.030> would<00:02:38.540> probably<00:02:39.050> most<00:02:39.230> likely

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
those items would probably most likely

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.130 
those items would probably most likely
just<00:02:39.620> sit<00:02:40.130> in<00:02:40.280> my<00:02:40.400> bank<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:41.420> for<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.900> final
