00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hello and welcome back to SRB gaming

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.579 
hello and welcome back to SRB gaming
I've<00:00:02.340> got<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.700> very<00:00:03.090> special<00:00:03.270> episode<00:00:03.600> of<00:00:03.929> KSP

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
I've got a very special episode of KSP

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.920 
I've got a very special episode of KSP
real<00:00:04.830> solar<00:00:05.100> systems<00:00:05.490> day<00:00:05.700> now<00:00:06.480> if<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.720> look

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
real solar systems day now if you look

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.839 
real solar systems day now if you look
on<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:08.220> screen<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:09.210> might<00:00:09.420> see<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:10.019> planet

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
on the screen you might see a planet

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.970 
on the screen you might see a planet
that's<00:00:11.849> Pluto<00:00:12.540> it's<00:00:13.019> not<00:00:13.230> actually<00:00:13.530> planet<00:00:13.860> of

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
that's Pluto it's not actually planet of

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.259 
that's Pluto it's not actually planet of
course<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.490> considered<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.940> dwarf<00:00:15.059> planet

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
course it's considered a dwarf planet

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.580 
course it's considered a dwarf planet
but<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.080> sent<00:00:16.859> an<00:00:17.070> outpost<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.970> Pluto<00:00:18.600> for

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
but I sent an outpost to Pluto for

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.710 
but I sent an outpost to Pluto for
kerbals<00:00:20.160> are<00:00:20.699> gonna<00:00:20.910> set<00:00:21.090> up<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.240> base<00:00:21.420> there

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
kerbals are gonna set up a base there

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.450 
kerbals are gonna set up a base there
and<00:00:22.130> that's<00:00:23.130> what<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.400> video<00:00:23.640> will<00:00:23.910> be<00:00:25.039> so<00:00:26.039> I

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and that's what this video will be so I

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.060 
and that's what this video will be so I
have<00:00:27.210> sent<00:00:27.449> missions<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.900> Pluto<00:00:28.199> before<00:00:28.590> some

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
have sent missions to Pluto before some

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.640 
have sent missions to Pluto before some
unmanned<00:00:29.869> yeah<00:00:30.869> those<00:00:31.080> didn't<00:00:31.289> go<00:00:31.410> very<00:00:31.529> well

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
unmanned yeah those didn't go very well

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.310 
unmanned yeah those didn't go very well
I<00:00:32.099> think<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:33.090> didn't<00:00:33.570> actually<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.930> any<00:00:34.050> make

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
I think I didn't actually have any make

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.530 
I think I didn't actually have any make
orbit<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.520> had<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.300> big

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
orbit so for this one I had this big

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.540 
orbit so for this one I had this big
transfer<00:00:37.079> stage<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> vasa<00:00:37.950> Mir<00:00:38.190> engines

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
transfer stage with the vasa Mir engines

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.400 
transfer stage with the vasa Mir engines
and<00:00:38.790> two<00:00:39.329> reactors<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.899> then<00:00:39.989> quite<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> big

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
and two reactors and then quite a big

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.010 
and two reactors and then quite a big
lander<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.000> hitchhiker<00:00:42.000> pod<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.809> carry

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
lander with a hitchhiker pod to carry

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.959 
lander with a hitchhiker pod to carry
the<00:00:43.110> kerbals<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:46.640> couldn't<00:00:47.640> leave

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the kerbals and I couldn't leave

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.020 
the kerbals and I couldn't leave
directly<00:00:48.570> from<00:00:48.690> Earth<00:00:48.989> because<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:50.520> Delta<00:00:50.879> V

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
directly from Earth because the Delta V

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.900 
directly from Earth because the Delta V
requirement<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:51.930> big<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.730> did

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
requirement was so big that if you did

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.420 
requirement was so big that if you did
the<00:00:54.030> manoeuvre<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:55.020> would<00:00:55.170> lower<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.160> parry

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the manoeuvre you would lower the parry

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.580 
the manoeuvre you would lower the parry
ops<00:00:56.610> into<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> ground<00:00:57.390> before<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.079> actually

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
ops into the ground before you actually

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.349 
ops into the ground before you actually
got<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> maneuver<00:00:59.309> node<00:00:59.460> guess<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.270> had

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
got to the maneuver node guess you had

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.579 
got to the maneuver node guess you had
to<00:01:00.390> start<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.780> early<00:01:01.699> so<00:01:02.699> huh<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:04.049> why<00:01:04.320> I'm

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
to start so early so huh that's why I'm

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.460 
to start so early so huh that's why I'm
I<00:01:05.000> did<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.180> different<00:01:06.390> way<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:06.960> did<00:01:07.170> was<00:01:07.350> I

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
I did a different way what I did was I

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.620 
I did a different way what I did was I
got<00:01:08.369> escape<00:01:08.700> velocity<00:01:09.119> actually<00:01:09.360> had<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> moon

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
got escape velocity actually had a moon

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.590 
got escape velocity actually had a moon
flyby<00:01:09.900> then<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.100> changed<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.880> inclination<00:01:12.270> of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
flyby then I changed the inclination of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.770 
flyby then I changed the inclination of
my<00:01:12.720> solar<00:01:13.229> orbit<00:01:13.680> which<00:01:13.860> took<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.490> 8<00:01:14.700> km/s<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
my solar orbit which took like 8 km/s to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.080 
my solar orbit which took like 8 km/s to
match<00:01:15.900> Pluto<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.590> then<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> did<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> Hohmann

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
match Pluto and then I did a Hohmann

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.480 
match Pluto and then I did a Hohmann
transfer<00:01:18.119> burn<00:01:19.020> which<00:01:19.619> was<00:01:19.830> another<00:01:20.070> 12

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
transfer burn which was another 12

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.010 
transfer burn which was another 12
kilometres<00:01:21.060> per<00:01:21.090> second<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:21.810> when<00:01:21.990> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
kilometres per second but when I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.570 
kilometres per second but when I
actually<00:01:22.170> got<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> Pluto<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.159> only<00:01:23.310> took

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
actually got the Pluto it only took

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.080 
actually got the Pluto it only took
about<00:01:23.640> 2<00:01:24.119> kilometers<00:01:24.570> per<00:01:24.720> second<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:26.090> just

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
about 2 kilometers per second to just

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.960 
about 2 kilometers per second to just
circular<00:01:27.420> eyes<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.869> get<00:01:27.990> into<00:01:28.140> orbit<00:01:28.320> so

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
circular eyes and get into orbit so

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.950 
circular eyes and get into orbit so
anyway<00:01:29.970> another<00:01:30.210> thing<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.540> special<00:01:30.869> about

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
anyway another thing is special about

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.319 
anyway another thing is special about
this<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:32.040> have<00:01:32.070> actually<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.880> capability

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
this is we have actually the capability

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.080 
this is we have actually the capability
to<00:01:33.390> get<00:01:33.479> back<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:34.020> earth<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.890> need<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.250> so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
to get back to earth if I need to so

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.960 
to get back to earth if I need to so
this<00:01:36.570> transfer<00:01:37.530> stage<00:01:38.130> has<00:01:38.430> plenty<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.820> fuel

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
this transfer stage has plenty of fuel

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.649 
this transfer stage has plenty of fuel
left<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:40.320> our<00:01:40.650> 4<00:01:41.009> inflatable<00:01:41.790> lifeboats

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
left and on our 4 inflatable lifeboats

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.760 
left and on our 4 inflatable lifeboats
from<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.799> US<00:01:44.100> side<00:01:44.250> survivability<00:01:44.759> pack<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
from the US side survivability pack and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.050 
from the US side survivability pack and
those<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:47.009> inflate<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.520> carry<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:47.850> four

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
those can inflate and carry all four

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.670 
those can inflate and carry all four
kerbals<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.689> transfer<00:01:49.079> stage<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.500> bring

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
kerbals the transfer stage can bring

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.590 
kerbals the transfer stage can bring
them<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.460> Earth's<00:01:50.640> sphere<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.119> influence<00:01:51.329> and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
them to Earth's sphere of influence and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.850 
them to Earth's sphere of influence and
then<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:51.990> detach<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.649> little

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
then they can detach the little

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.429 
then they can detach the little
lifeboats<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> parachute<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.439> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
lifeboats and have a parachute and the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.870 
lifeboats and have a parachute and the
lander<00:01:55.829> although<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.729> enough

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
lander although it will not have enough

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.410 
lander although it will not have enough
fuel<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.180> get<00:01:57.299> back<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:59.610> ship<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.090> its

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
fuel to get back to the the ship on its

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.770 
fuel to get back to the the ship on its
own

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
own

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.410 
own
I<00:02:00.810> believe<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:02.040> brought<00:02:02.670> Carbonite<00:02:03.090> mining

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
I believe I brought Carbonite mining

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
I believe I brought Carbonite mining
equipment<00:02:03.600> from<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.469> Carbonite<00:02:04.799> mod<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.310> I

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
equipment from the Carbonite mod so I

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.190 
equipment from the Carbonite mod so I
can<00:02:05.640> completely<00:02:06.000> refuel<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.750> ship<00:02:06.930> given

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
can completely refuel the ship given

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.710 
can completely refuel the ship given
enough<00:02:07.409> time<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:08.030> yeah<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.270> ever<00:02:09.300> needed<00:02:09.629> to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
enough time and yeah if I ever needed to

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.479 
enough time and yeah if I ever needed to
bring<00:02:09.929> them<00:02:10.050> back<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.319> could<00:02:10.560> although<00:02:11.220> I'm<00:02:11.340> not

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
bring them back I could although I'm not

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.570 
bring them back I could although I'm not
planning<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
planning that

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.950 
planning that
this<00:02:12.790> is<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.940> bass<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.510> would<00:02:13.630> rather<00:02:13.780> leave

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
this is a bass and I would rather leave

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.720 
this is a bass and I would rather leave
it<00:02:14.080> there<00:02:14.260> he's<00:02:15.190> wanted<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.490> have<00:02:15.580> that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
it there he's wanted to have that

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.410 
it there he's wanted to have that
capability<00:02:16.710> anyway<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.910> we're<00:02:19.060> coming<00:02:19.270> up<00:02:19.330> on

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
capability anyway so we're coming up on

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.760 
capability anyway so we're coming up on
the<00:02:19.510> detachment<00:02:19.990> right<00:02:20.140> now<00:02:20.260> you'll<00:02:20.440> see<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
the detachment right now you'll see the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.500 
the detachment right now you'll see the
actual<00:02:20.920> bass<00:02:21.250> module<00:02:21.670> detached<00:02:22.000> from<00:02:22.300> the

Pluto<00:02:54.940> is<00:02:55.090> very<00:02:55.510> very<00:02:56.410> mountainous<00:02:57.340> in<00:02:57.610> this

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
Pluto is very very mountainous in this

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.620 
Pluto is very very mountainous in this
game<00:02:59.400> it's<00:03:00.400> it's<00:03:00.730> it's<00:03:01.000> like<00:03:01.120> there's

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
game it's it's it's like there's

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.820 
game it's it's it's like there's
mountains<00:03:02.080> everywhere<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.590> thought<00:03:02.740> it

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
mountains everywhere and I thought it

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.050 
mountains everywhere and I thought it
would<00:03:02.920> be<00:03:02.980> kind<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.190> an<00:03:03.340> even<00:03:03.580> but<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:03.760> decided

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
would be kind of an even but I decided

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.370 
would be kind of an even but I decided
to<00:03:04.209> try<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.510> land<00:03:04.630> in<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.900> spaces<00:03:05.230> between

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
to try and land in the spaces between

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.500 
to try and land in the spaces between
the<00:03:05.620> mountains<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.160> actually<00:03:06.550> wasn't<00:03:06.790> too

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
the mountains and it actually wasn't too

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.570 
the mountains and it actually wasn't too
inclined<00:03:08.320> I've<00:03:08.530> had<00:03:08.680> much<00:03:08.890> worse<00:03:09.100> encounters

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
inclined I've had much worse encounters

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.150 
inclined I've had much worse encounters
on<00:03:09.730> drehs<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.720> stuff<00:03:10.870> anyway<00:03:11.230> some<00:03:11.860> facts

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
on drehs and stuff anyway some facts

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.830 
on drehs and stuff anyway some facts
about<00:03:12.190> Pluto<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:12.910> it's<00:03:13.030> got<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.240> zero<00:03:13.510> point

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
about Pluto so it's got a zero point

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.530 
about Pluto so it's got a zero point
five<00:03:14.140> six<00:03:14.650> five<00:03:14.860> meters<00:03:15.310> per<00:03:15.400> second<00:03:15.820> squared

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
five six five meters per second squared

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.180 
five six five meters per second squared
acceleration<00:03:17.230> which<00:03:17.500> is<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.709> little<00:03:17.980> more<00:03:18.070> than

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
acceleration which is a little more than

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.220 
acceleration which is a little more than
minimus<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:18.850> landing<00:03:19.450> on<00:03:19.570> this<00:03:19.690> is<00:03:19.900> about<00:03:20.050> like

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
minimus so landing on this is about like

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.770 
minimus so landing on this is about like
minimus<00:03:20.590> except<00:03:20.950> it's<00:03:21.510> hundreds<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.570> times

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
minimus except it's hundreds of times

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.530 
minimus except it's hundreds of times
harder<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.140> get<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:26.250> Pluto<00:03:27.250> in<00:03:28.000> real<00:03:28.330> life

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
harder to get to and Pluto in real life

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.150 
harder to get to and Pluto in real life
it<00:03:28.720> has<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.900> moon<00:03:29.170> that's<00:03:29.320> about<00:03:29.470> half<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.950> size

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
it has a moon that's about half the size

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.130 
it has a moon that's about half the size
of<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:31.150> dwarf<00:03:31.420> planet<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:31.989> they

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
of that the dwarf planet so they

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.380 
of that the dwarf planet so they
actually<00:03:32.320> orbit<00:03:32.830> a<00:03:32.890> point<00:03:33.160> outside<00:03:33.430> of<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:34.030> of

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
actually orbit a point outside of the of

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.880 
actually orbit a point outside of the of
Pluto<00:03:34.930> so<00:03:35.140> they're<00:03:35.260> considered<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.680> binary

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
Pluto so they're considered a binary

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.380 
Pluto so they're considered a binary

sadly<00:03:37.390> real<00:03:38.140> solar<00:03:38.440> system<00:03:38.800> doesn't<00:03:39.190> have<00:03:39.430> any

that<00:03:44.440> but<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:44.739> can't<00:03:45.130> make<00:03:45.250> planets<00:03:45.640> so<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.120> won't

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
that but I can't make planets so I won't

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.060 
that but I can't make planets so I won't
be<00:03:46.930> able<00:03:47.050> to<00:03:47.170> do<00:03:47.290> that<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.620> I'll<00:03:47.680> just<00:03:47.739> have<00:03:47.920> to

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
be able to do that and I'll just have to

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.220 
be able to do that and I'll just have to
wait<00:03:48.360> there's<00:03:49.360> a<00:03:49.420> probe<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:49.930> probably<00:03:50.140> heard

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
wait there's a probe you probably heard

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.180 
wait there's a probe you probably heard
about<00:03:50.320> this<00:03:50.530> but<00:03:50.709> there's<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:50.950> probe<00:03:51.130> called

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
about this but there's a probe called

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.250 
about this but there's a probe called
New<00:03:51.519> Horizons<00:03:51.700> headed<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:52.510> Pluto<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.050> it<00:03:53.140> will

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
New Horizons headed to Pluto and it will

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.630 
New Horizons headed to Pluto and it will
arrive<00:03:53.410> in<00:03:53.650> July<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.100> will<00:03:54.190> actually<00:03:54.550> have

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
arrive in July and will actually have

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.310 
arrive in July and will actually have
pictures<00:03:54.730> of<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.180> I<00:03:55.300> don't<00:03:55.840> know<00:03:55.900> if<00:03:55.989> you<00:03:56.110> knew

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
pictures of it I don't know if you knew

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.170 
pictures of it I don't know if you knew
but<00:03:56.350> there<00:03:57.100> aren't<00:03:57.250> actually<00:03:57.700> good<00:03:57.850> pictures

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
but there aren't actually good pictures

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.670 
but there aren't actually good pictures
of<00:03:58.300> Pluto<00:03:58.450> like<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.050> pictures<00:03:59.290> we<00:03:59.440> have<00:03:59.560> or

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
of Pluto like the pictures we have or

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.160 
of Pluto like the pictures we have or
the<00:03:59.769> specs<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.160> light<00:04:00.220> or<00:04:00.820> these<00:04:01.170> extremely

the specs of light or these extremely

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.970 
the specs of light or these extremely
low<00:04:02.800> res<00:04:04.080> pictures<00:04:05.080> that<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:05.650> can't<00:04:05.860> really

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
low res pictures that you can't really

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.979 
low res pictures that you can't really
tell<00:04:06.160> anything<00:04:06.489> but<00:04:07.269> that<00:04:07.510> probe<00:04:07.750> will<00:04:07.870> be

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
tell anything but that probe will be

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.720 
tell anything but that probe will be
there<00:04:08.200> in<00:04:08.650> July<00:04:08.980> in<00:04:09.220> real<00:04:09.400> life<00:04:09.870> anyway

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
there in July in real life anyway

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.610 
there in July in real life anyway
again<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.480> landing<00:04:13.750> was<00:04:13.840> like<00:04:13.989> minimus<00:04:14.350> so<00:04:14.500> it

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
again the landing was like minimus so it

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.140 
again the landing was like minimus so it
wasn't<00:04:14.950> very<00:04:14.980> hard<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:15.549> I<00:04:15.610> had<00:04:15.760> plenty<00:04:16.000> of

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
wasn't very hard and I had plenty of

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.030 
wasn't very hard and I had plenty of
Delta<00:04:16.510> P<00:04:16.660> in<00:04:16.780> this<00:04:16.930> nice<00:04:17.200> Lander<00:04:17.769> with<00:04:17.950> the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
Delta P in this nice Lander with the

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.570 
Delta P in this nice Lander with the
poodle<00:04:18.340> engine<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:19.810> was<00:04:20.320> honestly<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.280> biggest

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
poodle engine I was honestly the biggest

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.300 
poodle engine I was honestly the biggest
thing<00:04:21.729> I<00:04:21.820> was<00:04:21.940> afraid<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.240> was<00:04:22.890> having<00:04:23.890> Pluto

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
thing I was afraid of was having Pluto

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.650 
thing I was afraid of was having Pluto
be<00:04:24.430> another<00:04:24.640> Deimos<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:25.150> if<00:04:25.419> you

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
be another Deimos and if you

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.000 
be another Deimos and if you
launched<00:04:25.930> my<00:04:26.050> other<00:04:26.170> videos<00:04:26.470> basically<00:04:26.950> I

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
launched my other videos basically I

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.190 
launched my other videos basically I
sent<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.640> sent<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.150> mission<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.480> Deimos<00:04:28.900> which

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
sent a I sent a mission to Deimos which

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.590 
sent a I sent a mission to Deimos which
is<00:04:29.380> smaller<00:04:29.980> than<00:04:30.070> Phobos<00:04:30.490> moon<00:04:31.030> of<00:04:31.180> Mars<00:04:31.330> and

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
is smaller than Phobos moon of Mars and

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.600 
is smaller than Phobos moon of Mars and
the<00:04:32.230> whole<00:04:32.380> thing<00:04:32.590> is<00:04:32.830> basically<00:04:33.010> cracking

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
the whole thing is basically cracking

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.010 
the whole thing is basically cracking
you<00:04:33.820> land<00:04:34.000> on<00:04:34.120> it<00:04:34.270> your<00:04:34.390> ship<00:04:34.570> sinks<00:04:34.870> into<00:04:34.960> the

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
you land on it your ship sinks into the

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.390 
you land on it your ship sinks into the
ground<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:35.320> explodes<00:04:35.590> and<00:04:35.950> I<00:04:35.980> couldn't<00:04:36.220> find

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
ground and explodes and I couldn't find

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.460 
ground and explodes and I couldn't find
I<00:04:36.580> landed<00:04:36.880> 15<00:04:37.330> times<00:04:37.570> maybe<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:37.960> couldn't<00:04:38.290> find

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
I landed 15 times maybe I couldn't find

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.140 
I landed 15 times maybe I couldn't find
a<00:04:38.710> spot<00:04:38.950> on<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.280> surface<00:04:39.580> of<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.790> Moon<00:04:39.940> that

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
a spot on the surface of the Moon that

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.420 
a spot on the surface of the Moon that
actually<00:04:40.450> worked<00:04:40.650> so<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:41.980> mission<00:04:42.310> is

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
actually worked so that mission is

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.430 
actually worked so that mission is
stranded<00:04:42.670> in<00:04:42.850> orbit<00:04:43.090> around<00:04:43.180> Mars<00:04:43.450> I<00:04:43.750> was

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
stranded in orbit around Mars I was

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.110 
stranded in orbit around Mars I was
afraid<00:04:44.650> of<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:44.920> happening<00:04:45.280> here<00:04:45.490> but<00:04:45.730> it

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
afraid of that happening here but it

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.820 
afraid of that happening here but it
didn't<00:04:46.420> happen<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.870> landing<00:04:47.200> was<00:04:47.320> successful

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
didn't happen the landing was successful

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.600 
didn't happen the landing was successful
so<00:04:51.750> this<00:04:52.750> base<00:04:53.020> again<00:04:53.650> has<00:04:53.920> capability<00:04:54.490> to

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
so this base again has capability to

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.000 
so this base again has capability to
return<00:04:54.850> to<00:04:54.970> orbit<00:04:55.210> or<00:04:55.360> earth<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:55.810> this<00:04:56.770> is<00:04:56.920> the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
return to orbit or earth and this is the

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.500 
return to orbit or earth and this is the
first<00:04:57.220> time<00:04:57.400> I've<00:04:57.550> actually<00:04:57.640> achieved<00:04:57.970> orbit

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
first time I've actually achieved orbit

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.980 
first time I've actually achieved orbit
around<00:04:58.660> Pluto<00:04:59.530> now<00:04:59.980> I<00:05:00.280> have<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.420> say<00:05:01.600> who<00:05:01.870> this

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
around Pluto now I have to say who this

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.840 
around Pluto now I have to say who this
mission<00:05:02.320> is<00:05:02.440> in<00:05:02.530> honor<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:02.800> and<00:05:03.100> sadly<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:03.670> many

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
mission is in honor of and sadly so many

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.470 
mission is in honor of and sadly so many
of<00:05:03.970> these<00:05:04.120> missions<00:05:04.600> have<00:05:05.290> to<00:05:05.470> say<00:05:05.650> something

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
of these missions have to say something

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.530 
of these missions have to say something
so<00:05:07.480> my<00:05:07.630> first<00:05:07.870> mission<00:05:08.200> to<00:05:08.350> Pluto<00:05:08.500> was<00:05:09.540> I'll

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
so my first mission to Pluto was I'll

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.730 
so my first mission to Pluto was I'll
start<00:05:10.720> with<00:05:10.780> my<00:05:10.900> second<00:05:11.200> my<00:05:11.260> second<00:05:11.560> mission

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
start with my second my second mission

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.340 
start with my second my second mission
to<00:05:11.830> Pluto<00:05:11.920> was<00:05:12.250> an<00:05:12.340> old<00:05:12.550> Mars<00:05:13.170> transfer<00:05:14.170> that

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
to Pluto was an old Mars transfer that

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.290 
to Pluto was an old Mars transfer that
had<00:05:14.500> already<00:05:14.620> ditched<00:05:14.950> its<00:05:15.190> payload<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:15.820> I

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
had already ditched its payload and I

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.880 
had already ditched its payload and I
still<00:05:16.780> had<00:05:16.870> tons<00:05:17.050> of<00:05:17.140> delta-v<00:05:17.410> so<00:05:17.650> I<00:05:17.680> brought

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
still had tons of delta-v so I brought

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.980 
still had tons of delta-v so I brought
it<00:05:18.010> from<00:05:18.100> Mars<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.580> Pluto<00:05:18.880> I<00:05:19.120> was<00:05:19.540> like<00:05:19.660> 50

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
it from Mars to Pluto I was like 50

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.560 
it from Mars to Pluto I was like 50
meters<00:05:20.110> per<00:05:20.410> second<00:05:20.770> from<00:05:21.270> Circular<00:05:22.270> rising

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
meters per second from Circular rising

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.240 
meters per second from Circular rising
and<00:05:22.690> I<00:05:22.720> couldn't<00:05:23.110> do<00:05:23.200> it<00:05:23.320> so<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:23.500> ended<00:05:23.740> up<00:05:24.070> just

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
and I couldn't do it so I ended up just

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.920 
and I couldn't do it so I ended up just
getting<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.670> gravity<00:05:25.240> assist<00:05:25.270> out<00:05:25.690> of<00:05:25.810> the

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
getting a gravity assist out of the

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.960 
getting a gravity assist out of the
solar<00:05:26.140> system<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:27.160> I<00:05:27.190> kind<00:05:27.400> of<00:05:27.430> had<00:05:27.550> a<00:05:27.580> Voyager

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
solar system so I kind of had a Voyager

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.430 
solar system so I kind of had a Voyager
type<00:05:28.180> thing<00:05:28.450> and<00:05:28.630> that's<00:05:28.750> way<00:05:28.990> out<00:05:29.140> there<00:05:29.170> now

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
type thing and that's way out there now

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.260 
type thing and that's way out there now
it's<00:05:29.650> like<00:05:29.830> three<00:05:30.070> times<00:05:30.280> as<00:05:30.490> far<00:05:30.640> as<00:05:30.820> Pluto<00:05:31.120> is

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
it's like three times as far as Pluto is

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.860 
it's like three times as far as Pluto is
from<00:05:31.420> the<00:05:31.510> Sun<00:05:32.940> but<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.180> first<00:05:34.390> mission<00:05:34.690> was

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
from the Sun but the first mission was

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.660 
from the Sun but the first mission was
quite<00:05:35.230> sad<00:05:35.470> and<00:05:35.740> here<00:05:36.280> we<00:05:36.370> have<00:05:36.490> the<00:05:36.580> landing

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
quite sad and here we have the landing

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.110 
quite sad and here we have the landing
we<00:05:39.670> had<00:05:39.850> the<00:05:40.150> Kerbal<00:05:40.510> moon<00:05:41.080> hat<00:05:41.380> moon<00:05:41.919> hat<00:05:42.160> took

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
we had the Kerbal moon hat moon hat took

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.020 
we had the Kerbal moon hat moon hat took
the<00:05:43.540> grueling<00:05:44.020> 210<00:05:44.980> year<00:05:45.490> journey<00:05:45.820> although

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
the grueling 210 year journey although

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.659 
the grueling 210 year journey although
these<00:05:46.210> are<00:05:46.270> kerbin<00:05:46.780> years<00:05:47.040> journey<00:05:48.040> to<00:05:48.310> Pluto

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
these are kerbin years journey to Pluto

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.940 
these are kerbin years journey to Pluto
and<00:05:48.970> after<00:05:49.810> all<00:05:49.990> that<00:05:50.020> time<00:05:50.410> he<00:05:50.620> was<00:05:50.770> so

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
and after all that time he was so

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.580 
and after all that time he was so
excited<00:05:51.040> to<00:05:51.370> land<00:05:51.640> and<00:05:51.910> then<00:05:52.720> I<00:05:52.900> found<00:05:53.110> out<00:05:53.380> I

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
excited to land and then I found out I

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.810 
excited to land and then I found out I
didn't<00:05:53.890> have<00:05:53.980> enough<00:05:54.190> fuel<00:05:54.340> because<00:05:54.700> of

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
didn't have enough fuel because of

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.290 
didn't have enough fuel because of
inclination<00:05:55.210> I<00:05:55.540> was<00:05:55.660> coming<00:05:55.930> in<00:05:56.050> at<00:05:57.300> rather

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
inclination I was coming in at rather

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.560 
inclination I was coming in at rather
than<00:05:59.370> send<00:06:00.370> moon<00:06:00.790> had<00:06:01.030> into<00:06:01.270> a<00:06:01.300> permanent

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
than send moon had into a permanent

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.260 
than send moon had into a permanent
solar<00:06:01.990> orbit<00:06:02.640> the<00:06:03.640> Space<00:06:03.880> Center<00:06:04.060> decided<00:06:04.690> to

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
solar orbit the Space Center decided to

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.490 
solar orbit the Space Center decided to
adjust<00:06:07.270> his<00:06:07.510> orbit<00:06:08.020> so<00:06:08.169> that<00:06:08.290> it<00:06:08.380> would

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
adjust his orbit so that it would

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.320 
adjust his orbit so that it would
collide<00:06:09.070> with<00:06:09.280> the<00:06:09.370> planet<00:06:09.730> so<00:06:09.940> moon<00:06:10.120> hat

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
collide with the planet so moon hat

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.760 
collide with the planet so moon hat
could<00:06:10.480> at<00:06:10.600> least<00:06:10.720> see<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.020> surface<00:06:11.230> before<00:06:11.650> he

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
could at least see the surface before he

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.130 
could at least see the surface before he
died<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.190> he<00:06:12.280> did<00:06:13.270> just<00:06:13.540> that<00:06:13.600> and<00:06:13.870> we<00:06:13.990> were

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
died and he did just that and we were

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.470 
died and he did just that and we were
actually<00:06:14.500> able<00:06:14.590> to<00:06:14.770> see<00:06:14.890> the<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:19.180> rocky

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
actually able to see the the the rocky

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.900 
actually able to see the the the rocky
and<00:06:19.840> mountainous<00:06:20.230> surface<00:06:20.620> before<00:06:21.040> he<00:06:21.700> died

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
and mountainous surface before he died

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:22.860 
and mountainous surface before he died
so<00:06:22.600> uh

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
so uh

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.159 
so uh
rest<00:06:23.500> in<00:06:23.620> peace<00:06:23.800> moon<00:06:24.100> hat<00:06:24.340> and<00:06:24.750> he<00:06:25.750> was<00:06:25.780> late

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
rest in peace moon hat and he was late

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.290 
rest in peace moon hat and he was late
his<00:06:26.350> name<00:06:26.560> will<00:06:26.710> be<00:06:26.740> on<00:06:26.830> the<00:06:26.980> flag<00:06:27.220> anyway<00:06:28.090> once

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
his name will be on the flag anyway once

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.450 
his name will be on the flag anyway once
I<00:06:28.450> land<00:06:28.720> I<00:06:28.900> get<00:06:29.440> kerbals<00:06:29.860> out<00:06:30.010> and<00:06:30.220> after<00:06:30.370> the

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
I land I get kerbals out and after the

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.500 
I land I get kerbals out and after the
flag<00:06:30.610> and<00:06:30.760> everything<00:06:30.820> and<00:06:31.120> I<00:06:31.150> go<00:06:31.300> into<00:06:31.390> the

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
flag and everything and I go into the

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.330 
flag and everything and I go into the
cast<00:06:31.720> boxes<00:06:32.169> and<00:06:32.320> pile<00:06:32.500> on<00:06:32.680> myself<00:06:32.860> down<00:06:33.160> with

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
cast boxes and pile on myself down with

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.190 
cast boxes and pile on myself down with
a<00:06:33.370> pipe<00:06:33.580> that's<00:06:34.419> just<00:06:34.750> for<00:06:34.930> safety

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
a pipe that's just for safety

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.300 
a pipe that's just for safety
precautions<00:06:35.710> I<00:06:35.860> don't<00:06:36.039> want<00:06:36.190> this<00:06:36.250> thing

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
precautions I don't want this thing

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.620 
precautions I don't want this thing
tipping<00:06:36.820> that<00:06:37.030> could<00:06:37.210> prevent<00:06:37.419> me<00:06:37.570> from

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
tipping that could prevent me from

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.770 
tipping that could prevent me from
getting<00:06:37.960> back<00:06:38.080> into<00:06:38.229> orbit<00:06:38.560> and<00:06:38.620> I<00:06:38.710> do<00:06:38.770> know

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
getting back into orbit and I do know

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.730 
getting back into orbit and I do know
now<00:06:40.780> though<00:06:40.900> I'm<00:06:40.990> not<00:06:41.110> actually<00:06:41.410> planning<00:06:41.560> to

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
now though I'm not actually planning to

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.460 
now though I'm not actually planning to
go<00:06:41.830> back<00:06:41.860> in<00:06:42.100> orbit<00:06:42.400> I<00:06:42.460> want<00:06:42.640> that<00:06:42.790> option<00:06:43.470> and

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
go back in orbit I want that option and

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.190 
go back in orbit I want that option and
then<00:06:45.190> the<00:06:45.580> Carbonite<00:06:46.000> equipment<00:06:46.930> I<00:06:46.990> bring

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
then the Carbonite equipment I bring

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.070 
then the Carbonite equipment I bring
that<00:06:47.320> out<00:06:47.500> actually<00:06:48.250> after<00:06:48.610> the<00:06:48.790> video<00:06:49.000> but<00:06:49.810> I

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
that out actually after the video but I

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.230 
that out actually after the video but I
have<00:06:50.710> enough<00:06:50.950> power<00:06:51.100> with<00:06:51.340> the<00:06:51.400> four<00:06:51.580> RTGS<00:06:52.060> to

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
have enough power with the four RTGS to

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.940 
have enough power with the four RTGS to
run<00:06:52.450> that<00:06:52.630> and<00:06:52.930> I<00:06:53.260> don't<00:06:53.320> have<00:06:53.650> to<00:06:53.740> rely<00:06:53.920> on

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
run that and I don't have to rely on

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.560 
run that and I don't have to rely on
solar<00:06:54.250> power<00:06:54.460> I<00:06:54.730> would<00:06:54.790> have<00:06:55.060> brought<00:06:55.150> Soler's

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.570 
solar power I would have brought Soler's

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.080 
solar power I would have brought Soler's
like<00:06:55.750> I<00:06:55.870> usually<00:06:56.140> do<00:06:56.290> but<00:06:56.860> this<00:06:57.580> is<00:06:57.730> really<00:06:57.880> far

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
like I usually do but this is really far

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.290 
like I usually do but this is really far
from<00:06:58.210> the<00:06:58.330> Sun<00:06:59.310> so<00:07:00.310> yeah<00:07:00.490> I<00:07:00.520> gotta<00:07:00.760> say<00:07:00.850> this<00:07:01.120> is

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300 
from the Sun so yeah I gotta say this is

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.760 
from the Sun so yeah I gotta say this is
probably<00:07:01.630> my<00:07:01.750> hardest<00:07:01.930> thing<00:07:02.290> on<00:07:02.380> real<00:07:02.590> solar

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
probably my hardest thing on real solar

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.630 
probably my hardest thing on real solar
system<00:07:03.130> um<00:07:03.640> I<00:07:04.770> got<00:07:05.770> to<00:07:05.860> do<00:07:05.950> mercury<00:07:06.310> next<00:07:06.580> I

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:06.640 
system um I got to do mercury next I

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.890 
system um I got to do mercury next I
guess<00:07:06.820> I<00:07:06.940> tried<00:07:07.150> that<00:07:07.300> I<00:07:07.330> got<00:07:07.510> a<00:07:07.540> ship<00:07:07.750> into

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
guess I tried that I got a ship into

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.270 
guess I tried that I got a ship into
orbit<00:07:08.230> but<00:07:08.380> I'll<00:07:08.590> get<00:07:08.740> it<00:07:08.830> eventually

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
orbit but I'll get it eventually

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.730 
orbit but I'll get it eventually
it's<00:07:09.610> actually<00:07:10.110> maybe<00:07:11.110> a<00:07:11.200> little<00:07:11.410> easier<00:07:11.650> than

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
it's actually maybe a little easier than

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.710 
it's actually maybe a little easier than
Pluto<00:07:12.010> I<00:07:12.040> don't<00:07:12.310> know<00:07:12.400> more<00:07:12.940> gravity<00:07:13.330> hard<00:07:13.570> to

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 
Pluto I don't know more gravity hard to

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.540 
Pluto I don't know more gravity hard to
land<00:07:13.930> but<00:07:14.310> anyway

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
land but anyway

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.040
