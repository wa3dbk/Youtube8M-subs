00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.820
 Hi everyone, we are back today 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.360
 in the garden to take care of 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.460
 tomatoes 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.470
 we will carry out the hope in the 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.130
 and the first treatments based on 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.230
 Pyrethrum so an axillary jet appears 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.390
 of tomato in its initial phase of 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.099
 growth at this stage can be 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.099
 even removed with hands 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.260
 these plants have already developed 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.210
 too without a check without one 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.340
 sowing the jets accordingly 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.320
 axillary have grown a lot are 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.840
 these that must be removed at the base of the 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:55.630
 leaf following the main stem ci 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.400
 we realize that some of the jets e 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.380
 cell phones have grown decisively 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.030
 too and some also bring 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.040
 even already some tomatoes 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:12.430
 in this case we choose the one at 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:13.270
 base of the leaf and remove the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:19.660
 same thing 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:22.229
 on the other side and we continue so long 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.229
 the stem of the plant 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.479
 at this point once the 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.680
 plant from all its accelerate objects 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.360
 we can tie it to the guardian for convenience 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.470
 let's start from the highest part of the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.350
 plant and we attach to keep them 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.060
 setting a comfortable position for 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.069
 then carry out the other bindings is 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.009
 the binding in the part is also important 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:57.160
 low that gives stability 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:59.350
 another cure for the whole plant 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.649
 cultural that we can give to ours 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.840
 tomato is that of tamping 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.080
 we discover then the base we free the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.759
 soil around and we report with 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.060
 the use of a transplanted king of one 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.340
 scoop a bit of earth around the stem 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.480
 this operation that vast name of 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.450
 earthing up is used to make a 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.010
 plant new roots to the collar then 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.810
 in the area of â€‹â€‹contact with the ground e 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.090
 thus ensuring better development 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.890
 of the radical apparatus and of the whole 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.620
 plant 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.870
 we are now preparing to carry out the first one 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.620
 Pyrethrum treatment in ours 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.730
 vegetable garden 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.410
 we have indeed noticed some 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.900
 infestations of trust on ours 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.709
 tomato plants with the appropriate 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.549
 doser we prepare the recommended dose 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.269
 which in our case is 1.5 milliliters 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.269
 per liter of water 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.819
 if possible we do this 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.590
 operation away from water courses in 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.660
 as the pyrethrum especially in form 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.819
 concentrated and very dangerous for the 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:16.920
 aquatic environments take the dose 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:22.079
 I recommend his love in ours 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.670
 sprayed and mixed well see 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.310
 so here on our plants of 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.220
 tomato the first signs of a 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.299
 infestation of aphids that appear like 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.510
 black dots but they can also be 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.069
 we find them normally or yellow 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.319
 on the underside of the leaves o 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.049
 along the stem along the pigeon of the 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.660
 leaves along the stem of the plant in 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.630
 application phase we must take care 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.510
 to wet the upper side well but 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.160
 also the underside of the leaves 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.400
 in fact the pyrethrum is an insecticide 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.769
 natural that acts by contact 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.230
 consequently especially on the page 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.819
 lower where we said to be the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.880
 Aphid colonies must be had 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:08.400
 the foresight to wet the pyrethrum is a 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.079
 broad spectrum insecticide allowed 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.609
 in organic farming as of 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:16.380
 natural origin is a 16 from which has a 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.359
 extremely low shortage time 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.220
 in fact after two days 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.030
 from the application the molecule itself is already 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.560
 decomposed 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.750
 that retro blows is a treatment that 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.430
 indeed it must be repeated frequently afterwards 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.610
 57 days from the first treatment 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.520
 we will intervene one last time 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.980
 care in doing this 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.930
 treatment is to work during 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.330
 late afternoon evening hours 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.060
 as the pyrethrum molecule e 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.800
 strongly photosensitive by performing the 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.870
 treatment in the hours of major 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.220
 brightness we would encounter a minor 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.220
 effectiveness of the treatment itself
