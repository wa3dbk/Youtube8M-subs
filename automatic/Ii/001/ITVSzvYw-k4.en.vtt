bouncer<00:01:33.060> I'm<00:01:33.240> proud<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> problem<00:01:34.979> we

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
bouncer I'm proud I think the problem we

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.100 
bouncer I'm proud I think the problem we
need<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.369> now<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:36.450> you're<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> get

into music
you've<00:01:38.579> kind<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.030> got<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.360> some<00:01:39.570> money

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you've kind of got to have some money

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.359 
you've kind of got to have some money
behind<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:40.619> there's<00:01:40.950> no<00:01:41.070> money<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
behind you because there's no money to

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.999 
behind you because there's no money to
be<00:01:41.490> made<00:01:41.780> it's<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.110> very<00:01:43.140> nature<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.860> is

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
be made it's it's a very nature of it is

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.399 
be made it's it's a very nature of it is
it<00:01:44.130> becomes<00:01:44.430> more<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.909> vanity<00:01:45.180> thing<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.110> so

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
it becomes more of a vanity thing and so

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.990 
it becomes more of a vanity thing and so
you're<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> end<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.549> more<00:01:47.729> posh

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
you're going to end up with more posh

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.590 
you're going to end up with more posh
but<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.140> simple<00:01:49.950> fact<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.369> life

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
but it's just a simple fact of life

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.880 
but it's just a simple fact of life
there's<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.720> huge<00:01:52.079> benefit<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.640> doing<00:01:53.840> well<00:01:54.890> yes

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
there's a huge benefit to doing well yes

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.069 
there's a huge benefit to doing well yes
it<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.759> problem<00:01:57.119> has<00:01:57.240> been<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.840> only

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
it the problem has been that the only

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.920 
it the problem has been that the only
way<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.259> down<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:59.250> some<00:02:00.119> kind<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.540> music

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
way is down because some kind of music

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.840 
way is down because some kind of music
we<00:02:01.049> make<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.350> wasn't<00:02:01.680> hugely<00:02:02.130> mainstream

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
we make it wasn't hugely mainstream

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.440 
we make it wasn't hugely mainstream
music<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.869> know<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.259> but<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.399> entered<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
music you know and but it entered the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.540 
music you know and but it entered the
mainstream<00:02:06.659> because<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.920> Mercury<00:02:08.340> Prize

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
coming from 20 different directions but

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.620 
coming from 20 different directions but
what's<00:02:35.370> great<00:02:35.610> for<00:02:35.850> us<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.450> know

what's great for us is that you know

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.930 
what's great for us is that you know
anyone<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.410> like<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> gomu<00:02:38.100> song<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.670> we<00:02:38.790> have

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
anyone can like a gomu song so we have

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.180 
anyone can like a gomu song so we have
incredibly<00:02:39.510> disparate<00:02:40.140> audiences<00:02:40.770> we

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
incredibly disparate audiences we

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.070 
incredibly disparate audiences we
sometimes<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.210> think<00:02:42.270> that<00:02:42.450> some<00:02:42.630> people<00:02:42.660> are

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080

sometimes I think that some people are
so<00:02:43.230> my<00:02:43.410> audiences<00:02:43.860> look<00:02:44.070> at<00:02:44.190> each<00:02:44.280> other<00:02:44.460> and

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
so my audiences look at each other and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.650 
so my audiences look at each other and
they<00:02:44.700> don't<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:45.060> don't<00:02:45.300> think<00:02:45.420> they've<00:02:45.510> ever

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
they don't I don't think they've ever
