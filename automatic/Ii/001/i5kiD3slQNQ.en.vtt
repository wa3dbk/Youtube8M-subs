 if they have left me toasted 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.080

 we will put with the fire under 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.030
 so that they go slowly 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.780

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.280

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.760
 drain a little oil and 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.760
 mortar

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.700
 cut into pieces 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.660

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.710
 and while we heat the casserole 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.680
 again we are going to cut the potatoes the 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.690
 potatoes the charas that we will do so that 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.090
 release the starch and make us a 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.630
 more thick salsita wants them after 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.630

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.260
 we proceed in teacher bits 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.260
 kids 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.570
 when it starts to boil we put the 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.639
 potatoes we will leave them to wade 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.820
 taking about ten minutes or so 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.760
 that at the level of the potatoes when you see 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.240
 that are a bit soft will be the 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.910
 time to put it and the fish 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.509
 we cover the casserole and let it go 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.509
 Youtube 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.900
 we already have the potatoes practically 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.900
 cooked we are going to put 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.340
 yes 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.729
 we put it in the pan 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.780
 we also thank you 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.139
 the improvements we have had a shore with 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.330
 water and salt 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.050
 so that if there was a little earth 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.050
 reasonable 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.160
 now we will cover and let cook 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.300
 10 minutes or so 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.810
 we will taste it in time of salt 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.759

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.389

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.280
 missing if you were missing a 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.270
 little broth you can always 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.270
 add a little water 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.719
 this dish like all fish with 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.509
 sauce is better if you can have it in 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:06.369
 rest before eating half an hour or 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:09.459
 one hour because that way they are absorbing 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:11.469
