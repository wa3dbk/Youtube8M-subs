 the school and the guardianship council 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.910
 first part 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.910
 Dear fellow guardians 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.819
 this is a theme that I'm going to talk about 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:12.349
 despite being one of the Achilles' heels of the year of the child's defense and 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:13.649
 of the teenager 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:15.099
 this because 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.099
 directions and teachers see injured 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.670
 the now trapped 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.550
 it will serve to place your students module 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.819
 given the experts or collective 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:27.359
 quite the opposite 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.800
 is very deceived those who think that the tutelary council should 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.510
 perform this role 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.260
 the school is much more responsible than she thinks and change her behavior 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.670
 is ignorant 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.010
 these situations 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.590
 supervision is a fundamental need for 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.320
 tutelary 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.579
 otherwise they will not let us work and some kind of action 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:49.610
 will be 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.510

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.140
 - tutelary counselors 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.390
 we will analyze the mythic statute as regards the right to education 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.370
 superficially 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.010
 since our 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.400
 main object is not this 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.890
 the tutelary council 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.580
 is the body responsible for ensuring rights 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.150
 I could not make boys and girls 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.520
 to know their duties under Article 131 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.240
 second 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.979
 Article 53 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.720
 the adolescent child have the right to education 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.110
 aiming at the development of their person preparation for the exercise of citizenship and 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.010
 qualification for work 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.000
 3rd 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.370
 it is the state's duty to ensure education 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.080
 because access to public education toni venturi 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.740
 it's subjective public right 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.320
 regardless of the will of educators who will be educated 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.320
 as stated in Article 54 of its sole paragraph 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.650
 suspension or expulsion can not be seen as 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.700
 many cases these attitudes are exactly what love hopes to receive 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.410
 not to attend classes 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.950
 such measures 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.920
 besides the pedagogies banda baile da pinha institutionalization tÃ¡ 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.330
 attend school 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.540
 which is all determined in its article 73 actively part that the leaders 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.440
 by analogy and with the public a principle of absolute priority 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:20.059
 informed the board about cases of mistreatment involving their students. 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.289
 the simple suspicion 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.339
 it is already generated need 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.179
 pursuant to Article 13 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:30.439
 repeated unjustified school and school absences 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.929
 depleting school resources by repeating 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.039
 depleted school resources 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:40.109
 and finally 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.559
 the high repeating neris 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.309
 but what you see today because schoolchildren 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:47.339
 often school 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:49.489
 nor communicate the students' parents 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.269
 of the few times 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.269
 is not close relationship with them do not check what happened when in fact 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.469
 before sending the case to the council 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.079
 simply holland 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.209
 and many times when we asked parents when they were the counselors 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.600
 we did not really know 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.969
 of the sum of the children 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:10.709
 because the school tests 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.309
 does not adopt a protocol procedure and information to parents 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:19.599
 generally a disorganization that needs to change the school needs to be 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.149
 organize better 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.569
 the statute put into that standard 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.609
 behind the occasional difficulties 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.679

 hidden behind repeating plaque 2 staves 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.589
 this is the key point of acting of the council in the school 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.079
 and here we are finishing the first part 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:41.890
