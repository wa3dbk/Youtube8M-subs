00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 pit lane this is undoubtedly the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.040
 end of the pilot options 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.050
 canadian drp to be done for the title 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880
 we will see what happens 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.740
 Well, it seems that he complains about the 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.720
 front wheel 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.200
 well then the Canadian that I think that 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.730
 goodbye goodbye definitely to the title 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.680
 Only I stretch it is the virtual victor 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.480
 because after this stop 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.530
 I just do not understand very well what 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.800
 that I believe this is something more mental than 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.230
 that something really happened to the car and 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.470
 if the situation between them was already very 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.890
 tense before this race something tells me 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.410
 that first curve that they have made 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.440
 have faced the two erp pilots not 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.870
 will help in any way that that 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.760
 situation that relationship between both is 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.260
 sofviza facu regalia since with less than 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.000
 two minutes still in first position 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.750
 it seems that the Argentine can round 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.210
 a practically perfect weekend 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.920
 so he is already on track to carry out the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.170
 first double of the season 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.439
 could achieve the third victory today 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.939
 here in the circuit of cataluña and nicoló 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.299
 schiro that stays in fourth 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:20.450
 position until today second of the general 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.700
 and virtually virtual the generator of 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.860
 title if something happens to you from here to 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.020
 end of the final we are already in 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.850
 the last turn last step on the line 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.310
 of goal facu regalia that faces and the 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.020
 last lap in first position 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.299
 connection saura in a certain distance something 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.189
 more than two seconds and álex riberas 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.979
 comfortably installed there in third 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:44.200
 extraordinary performance position 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:47.110
 of the Catalan driver 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.810
 that had started from the sixth line 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.119
 of the grid from sixth position 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.039
 from the starting grid an alex first 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.409
 is that yesterday he was on the podium already 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:01.320
 finished in third place and today goes 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.320
 way of repeating that result 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.780
 we see yesterday and stretch it 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.789
 of the curves 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.630
 the virtual victor d 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.760
 of this championship 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.550
 It really has been a very championship 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.160
 played very exciting especially for 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.640
 the excellent comeback he has made 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.960
 this Italian driver who had won 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.900
 the two monza races 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.490
 and after that double already real of 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.620
 Tim I suffer a lot of pressure beat him 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.380
 a lot of pressure to gianmarco raimondo 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.060
 that he could not overcome it here in the 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.010
 circuit in the catalonia circuit 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.130
 nicole is shot about to take the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.100
 relay of the champion of last year who 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.380
 was Álex Fontana a Swiss driver who 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.350
 so it really worked a season 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.510
 brilliant last year happened to the and 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.610
 facing the last meters of the one 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.900
 it may be his third victory of the 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.900
 season here in the open f3 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.460
 behind facu regalia jones 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.980
 and the adrián fields team that is going to 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.980
 make a double thanks to facu regalia 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.489
 facing the arrival line 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.080
 Victory attention for the Argentine facu 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.750
 regalia when there is a car there that is 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.650
 stopped in the middle of the curve facu 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.890
 regalia that leads to victory 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.140
 second position for jones 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.300
 but álex riberas 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.400
 third position for álex riberas well 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.500
 because for the second consecutive day it goes 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.920
 to get on the podium álex riberas when 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.430
 attention we just saw there stretched 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.690
 the day cole 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.150
 I would say that Raymond the one who is standing 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.880
 let's see why the ski car or 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.220
 Despite this impact, he has 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.330
 cross the finish line 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.250
 third fourth position for schiro not 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.780
 I know if it's the raymond car or the one that 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.300
 is stopped in the curve we have not 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.980
 I could see it but real and busy that 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.470
 explains the head of rp motorsport 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.690
 he does not seem especially happy and ccoo 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.490
 and there we see that he makes ostensible gestures 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.850
 that sierra and mondo has 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.890
 stopped 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.590
 the entry in line of goal without place to 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.590
 doubts is a very dangerous way 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.550
 that raymundo if it was really there 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.919
 taken that decision 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.050
 of trying exactly is not the one that 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.270
 leave out of the race is the truth kilo 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.150
 is that it is an authentic but repeated 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.870
 that maneuver as 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:43.130
 ski or collided with earth and world 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:46.350
 if we see the helmet and half the track I 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.020
 the mendoza raymonda is a very season 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.270
 bright but I think that does not help 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.030
 not at all good we already have the 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.300
 disbelief in one's own 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.160
 rp team because I had entered the 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.050
 pib 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.420
 well here we see the classification of the 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.580
 career toni good facu regalia victor 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.740
 edward jones second álex riberas 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.840
 third these three pilots climbed to 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.880
 podium the other top ranked Spanish 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.890
 has been very sensory that has set a 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.450
 very good performance moisés soriano has 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.900
 It has been the fastest driver in the 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.900
 the winner within the group of 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.150
 pilots who participate with a dallara 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.720
 f308 ie those who take part in the 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.960
 cup and there we see the rest of the 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.250
 classification and we are really 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.180
 surprised by the fact that from that 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.440
 call run the world has left the 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.850
 car stopped there in the middle of the curve 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.590
 It is hard to believe that it has been possible 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.940
 stay spontaneously stopped 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.450
 right at that single point I stretch it to 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.970
 victor champion of the champion season 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.980
 of the european f3 open with five points 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:54.760
 advantage over gianmarco raimondo 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.760
 that was
