00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.900
 Do not look at me with those honest eyes, 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.720
 I can not be seen yet! I just put away mine. 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.360
 I have hidden my black spots, 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.890
 a demon dressed in white. 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.590
 Never change! I just kept running away 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.370
 until I lost even my tenderness. 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.980
 While I continued to inflict damage, I erased my selfish self. 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.600
 I can never be honest! I'm tied with chains ... 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.970
 I do not know anything about words! I do not have anyone to tell them ... 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:35.110
 Everything is a misunderstanding; you just can not see anything! 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.330
 Although I am the one I have resigned. 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:02:00.400
 The face that I have hidden and the face that I show 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.780
 Do not forget, Do not forget, Really ... I'm alone ... 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.920
 The more I think about it, the more I lose sight of it ... 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.880
 I still do not know the correct answer, 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.060
 I can not raise my voice, asking for help is a game of hide and seek. 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.740
 I've lost it ... If I can not even break 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.210
 the lock in my heart, this is goodbye. 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.510
 Everything is falling; although you realize, 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.610
 broken things do not return to their original state. 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:27.950
 The face that I have hidden and the face that I show 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.790
 Do not forget, Do not forget, Really ... I loved you ...
