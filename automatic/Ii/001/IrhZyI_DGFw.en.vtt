00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.119
 very good lads I know what happens 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:10.060
 It's been a long time since I went up the 

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:13.120
 last video but everyone has the right to 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.860
 a well-deserved vacation and that's what 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.800
 what has happened that has been inactivity 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.890
 of the casting in the channel as you will see 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.839
 part of the beta you are also watching 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.810
 other things that are swimming by the water 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:28.619
 you'll wonder what it is then to see if 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.619
 they are put here 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.570
 here you can see it's baby 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.760
 tadpole 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.620
 Y 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.589
 and that I will explain a little bit 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.600
 you want to have caught our attention 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.270
 I can explain a few things about 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.700
 which 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.760
 they have to condition the 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.400
 aquarium to be able to have these 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.770
 tadpoles the first thing is to have a 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.270
 aquarium like the one that I have more or less 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.170
 20 liters depends the amount that 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.740
 you want me I have about 10 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.200
 Y 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.100
 the water sand as if to distract the 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.320
 same gravel that is in the rivers 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.780
 what we will need later later 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.159
 how beta also favors them 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.840
 be the water at high altitude 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.630
 we will go down a bit and put a 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.250
 platform where you can upload the 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.280
 frogs when they have developed a little 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.490
 and to the legs the food that the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.820
 the tadpoles are usually 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.520
 seaweed can already be lettuce or spinach 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.080
 Triturate 11 Spinach Lettuce that 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.420
 you have frozen and you have it and you have it 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.390
 made very little chips for them 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.380
 they can eat it or the same 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.170
 fish food 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.240
 It serves you very carefully 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.069
 simple and they called me a lot the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.259
 attention I chose a pond and I 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.220
 They liked it a lot and I'm trying 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.670
 raise them 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.670
 to see if they survive I hope that you 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.040
