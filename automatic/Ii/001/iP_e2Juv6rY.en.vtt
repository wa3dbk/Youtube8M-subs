00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.040
 hello and welcome to this analysis of 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.700
 google crista in the trilogy for 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.700
 Play Station 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.400
 it's an honor for me to start this 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.740
 analysis with the first game I had 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.510
 for the console the first time I saw it 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.060
 I was left blank since I had a 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.800
 game 3 in an action game in third 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.599
 person to have an action game in 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.930
 first person and a driving game 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.759
 What else could he ask for besides he was 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.610
 based on a film saga more 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.989
 famous of the 90 you want an old 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.989
 place in 1996 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.370
 the first game was based on the 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.810
 first movie it was a game 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.430
 of action in third person where 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.930
 you had to kill every Tuesday that 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.530
 they went on the screen and go rescuing 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.530
 hostages 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.500
 at the end of each phase I had to 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.150
 deactivate a bomb that was 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.150
 normally in an elevator 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.190
 the second game was based on the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.530
 second movie 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.240
 the game was such a crisis type and you 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.880
 goal was to kill any bad guy that 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.240
 I knew you on screen with guns 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.500
 Shotguns a pee up with visible by 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.280
 dine in exchange for killing all 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.280
 bad guys i would love 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.630
 the game teacher is based on the 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.460
 third movie 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.380
 It was a driving game and your goal 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.400
 was to disable all the ways that 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.500
 disseminate measures in a free time 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.390
 but the days and obviously lost 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.390
 a life and you were dead man 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.440
 now as you may have appreciated 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.560
 in the video is practically a whore 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.560
 shit 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.420
 it saves the fact of being a franchise 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.800
 cinematographic well-known in addition to 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.420
 to always put on the skin of Lyon 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.420
 mclean you want a lot of sincere 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.220
 paradoxically the only thing that is saved 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.290
 of the game is the music is in format 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.610
 cd and also has some very songs 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.610
 Catchy and very good 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.930
 this game will only enjoy it 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.540
 those who are followers of the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.060
 saga jungle crystal if you're not 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.020
 would go by long I would look for another option in 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.420
 the wide catalog of the playstation 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.570
 if you try the game have patience and 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.530
 may john mcclain take pity on you 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.580
 I hope you liked nothing and 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.580
 until next time
