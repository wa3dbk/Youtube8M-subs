00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
don't even need a towel so you just

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.909 
don't even need a towel so you just
score<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.960> surface<00:05:13.320> where<00:05:13.500> you<00:05:13.560> want<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:13.770> make

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
your cut you snap it along that line and

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.760 
your cut you snap it along that line and
then<00:05:16.770> you<00:05:16.889> cut<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.220> mess<00:05:17.400> reinforcement<00:05:18.240> and

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
then you cut the mess reinforcement and

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.260 
then you cut the mess reinforcement and
then<00:05:19.770> it's<00:05:19.919> grab<00:05:20.130> it<00:05:20.250> in<00:05:20.400> just<00:05:20.730> like<00:05:20.790> ceramic

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270
