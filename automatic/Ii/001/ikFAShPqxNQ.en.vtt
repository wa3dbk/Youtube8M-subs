00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
can get a rocks up get some damn thats

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.580 
can get a rocks up get some damn thats
cool<00:01:23.790> now<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.900> thought<00:01:25.140> he<00:01:25.350> would<00:01:25.439> go

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
cool now here like I thought he would go

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.060 
cool now here like I thought he would go
for<00:01:25.830> an<00:01:25.890> earth<00:01:26.100> power<00:01:26.659> because<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.869> believe<00:01:28.380> its

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
for an earth power because I believe its

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.530 
for an earth power because I believe its
own<00:01:29.220> gets<00:01:29.490> earth<00:01:29.729> power<00:01:29.970> while<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.509> could

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
own gets earth power while so we could

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.090 
own gets earth power while so we could

here I thought about going for a I'm
akaike<00:02:38.670> coil<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:39.900> i<00:02:39.930> figured<00:02:40.290> i<00:02:40.350> get<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.709> pair

akaike coil but i figured i get the pair

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.710 
akaike coil but i figured i get the pair
ahead<00:02:41.310> but<00:02:41.550> flinch<00:02:41.940> action<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.480> i<00:02:42.510> get

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
ahead but flinch action and i get

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.229 
ahead but flinch action and i get
neither<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.290> those<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.800> happen<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.000> get<00:02:45.209> the

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
neither of those to happen but I get the

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.620 
neither of those to happen but I get the
boost<00:02:45.660> i<00:02:46.050> got<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.800> boost<00:02:47.100> from<00:02:47.819> aurorus<00:02:48.390> but

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
boost i got the boost from aurorus but

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.750 
boost i got the boost from aurorus but
then<00:02:48.750> again<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.230> game<00:02:49.500> would<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.890> DC<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
then again the game would you DC the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.520 
then again the game would you DC the
head<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:51.030> again<00:02:51.300> firing<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.870> off<00:02:51.989> Dunsparce
