only using my knife in most cases it's
not<00:00:46.680> very<00:00:46.890> practical<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.180> not

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
not very practical and it's really not

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
of this video though I think it will do

of this video though I think it will do
a<00:00:54.300> good<00:00:54.449> job<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.690> how<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.430> intelligently

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
a good job of how to intelligently

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.189 
a good job of how to intelligently
rotate<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> map<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.420> avoid<00:00:57.629> those<00:00:57.870> enemy

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
rotate the map and avoid those enemy

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.450 
rotate the map and avoid those enemy

firing lanes that are going to stop you

firing lanes that are going to stop you
sure<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.789> get<00:00:59.910> your<00:01:00.059> kill<00:01:00.300> streaks<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.079> back

on<00:01:01.590> track<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.280> pulled<00:01:02.579> back<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.149> view<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
on track here I pulled back to view the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.570 
on track here I pulled back to view the
whole<00:01:04.170> map<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.680> we're<00:01:04.979> looking<00:01:05.070> at<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> very

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
whole map and we're looking at the very

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.719 
whole map and we're looking at the very
start<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.060> match<00:01:06.439> when<00:01:07.439> starting<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
start of the match when starting it's a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.240 
start of the match when starting it's a
really<00:01:09.000> good<00:01:09.060> strategy<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.720> take<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:11.010> lack<00:01:11.220> of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
really good strategy to take for lack of

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.969 
really good strategy to take for lack of
a<00:01:11.430> better<00:01:11.460> term<00:01:11.930> shock<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:12.960> awe<00:01:13.229> approach<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
a better term shock and awe approach and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.010 
a better term shock and awe approach and
get<00:01:14.280> behind<00:01:14.400> enemy<00:01:14.729> lines<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.390> quickly<00:01:15.810> as

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
get behind enemy lines as quickly as

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.359 
get behind enemy lines as quickly as
possible<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.619> stir<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.830> these<00:01:16.979> guys<00:01:17.220> from

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
possible to stir up these guys from

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.789 
possible to stir up these guys from
getting<00:01:17.460> settled<00:01:18.030> now<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.530> let's

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
getting settled now to do that let's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.749 
getting settled now to do that let's
first<00:01:19.979> take<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> look<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> high-traffic

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
first take a look at the high-traffic

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.490 
first take a look at the high-traffic
points<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> map<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.930> often<00:01:22.229> give<00:01:22.409> you

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
points of the map that often give you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.350 
points of the map that often give you
the<00:01:22.590> best<00:01:22.740> firing<00:01:23.100> lines<00:01:23.280> which<00:01:24.270> are

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
the best firing lines which are

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.929 
the best firing lines which are
highlighted<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.700> with<00:01:26.700> experience

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
highlighted now for you with experience

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.749 
highlighted now for you with experience
you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:28.049> begin<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.619> guesstimate<00:01:29.400> where<00:01:29.579> your

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
you can begin to guesstimate where your

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.490 
you can begin to guesstimate where your
opponents<00:01:30.119> are<00:01:30.180> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.570> when<00:01:31.470> they

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
opponents are going to be when they

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.690 
opponents are going to be when they
collide<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.159> rest<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.520> team

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
collide with the rest of your team

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.160 
collide with the rest of your team
because<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.119> usually<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.450> rat<00:01:33.750> race<00:01:33.930> for

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
because it's usually a rat race for

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.830 
because it's usually a rat race for
those<00:01:34.259> hot<00:01:34.409> traffic<00:01:34.829> points<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.750> with<00:01:36.750> the

and<00:02:58.959> there<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.650> three<00:03:00.459> additional<00:03:01.000> kills<00:03:01.239> that

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
and there is three additional kills that

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.150 
and there is three additional kills that
I<00:03:01.420> add<00:03:01.630> on<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.870> my<00:03:01.900> killstreak<00:03:02.500> based<00:03:02.709> off<00:03:02.890> over

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
I add on to my killstreak based off over

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.850 
I add on to my killstreak based off over
revenge<00:03:03.910> kills<00:03:04.239> alone<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.260> there's<00:03:05.530> two

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
revenge kills alone so there's two

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.990 
revenge kills alone so there's two
things<00:03:06.070> that<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.370> can<00:03:06.550> learn<00:03:06.640> from<00:03:06.700> this<00:03:07.000> one

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
things that you can learn from this one

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.520 
things that you can learn from this one
exercise<00:03:10.000> some<00:03:10.420> willpower<00:03:10.630> don't<00:03:11.200> go<00:03:11.320> back

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
exercise some willpower don't go back

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.680 
exercise some willpower don't go back
for<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.800> revenge<00:03:12.070> kill<00:03:12.340> unless<00:03:12.550> you're<00:03:12.880> very

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
for that revenge kill unless you're very

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.960 
for that revenge kill unless you're very
very<00:03:13.959> clever<00:03:14.260> about<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.650> if<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.430> way<00:03:15.550> back<00:03:15.790> to

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
very clever about it if the way back to

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.280 
very clever about it if the way back to
them<00:03:16.120> is<00:03:16.209> very<00:03:16.420> obvious<00:03:16.630> you're<00:03:17.049> just<00:03:17.200> gonna

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
them is very obvious you're just gonna

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.680 
them is very obvious you're just gonna
have<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.530> suck<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.860> up<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:18.420> find<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.540> way<00:03:19.630> to

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
have to suck it up and find a way to

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.110 
have to suck it up and find a way to
engage<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.140> enemy<00:03:20.230> on<00:03:20.530> your<00:03:20.709> own<00:03:20.799> terms<00:03:21.120> now

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
engage the enemy on your own terms now

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.280 
engage the enemy on your own terms now
the<00:03:22.180> second<00:03:22.570> thing<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:22.720> can<00:03:22.900> learn<00:03:23.079> from

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
the second thing you can learn from

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.920 
the second thing you can learn from
revenge<00:03:23.829> kills<00:03:24.130> is<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:25.480> when<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:25.720> kill

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
revenge kills is that when you kill

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.170 
revenge kills is that when you kill
somebody<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:27.430> see<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.760> they<00:03:27.880> spawn

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
somebody and you see that they spawn

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.199 
somebody and you see that they spawn
rather<00:03:28.989> close<00:03:29.489> go<00:03:30.489> ahead<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:30.820> exploit<00:03:31.180> it

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
rather close go ahead and exploit it

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.050 
rather close go ahead and exploit it
move<00:03:31.930> forward<00:03:32.290> just<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.590> little<00:03:32.620> bit<00:03:32.950> more<00:03:33.880> than

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
move forward just a little bit more than

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.729 
move forward just a little bit more than
you<00:03:34.180> were<00:03:34.299> before<00:03:34.480> don't<00:03:35.140> be<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:35.410> exact

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
you were before don't be in the exact

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.800 
you were before don't be in the exact
spot<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.340> killed<00:03:36.579> him<00:03:36.670> in<00:03:36.810> because

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
spot that you killed him in because

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.039 
spot that you killed him in because
camping<00:03:38.380> is<00:03:38.530> not<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.160> good<00:03:39.430> strategy<00:03:40.049> but

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
camping is not a good strategy but

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.410 
camping is not a good strategy but
getting<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.350> position<00:03:41.739> where<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:42.190> can<00:03:42.430> cut

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
getting a position where you can cut

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.910 
getting a position where you can cut
them<00:03:43.540> off<00:03:43.720> on<00:03:43.900> their<00:03:44.019> way<00:03:44.110> back<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.709> and

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
them off on their way back to you and

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.130 
them off on their way back to you and
you'll<00:03:45.640> be<00:03:45.790> surprised<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.360> make<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.660> can<00:03:46.989> get

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
you'll be surprised to make you can get

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.380 
you'll be surprised to make you can get
from<00:03:47.290> that<00:03:47.440> you'll<00:03:47.680> kill<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.040> same<00:03:48.280> person<00:03:48.519> 34

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
really not a hardcore gamer I like to

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.500 
really not a hardcore gamer I like to
consider<00:04:50.800> myself<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.370> casual<00:04:51.760> gamer<00:04:51.970> I<00:04:52.120> play<00:04:52.210> an

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
consider myself a casual gamer I play an

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.170 
consider myself a casual gamer I play an
hour<00:04:52.630> here<00:04:53.080> or<00:04:53.260> an<00:04:53.500> hour<00:04:53.620> there<00:04:53.919> and<00:04:54.070> I<00:04:54.940> really

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
hour here or an hour there and I really

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.279 
hour here or an hour there and I really
think<00:04:55.300> that's<00:04:55.510> what<00:04:55.660> these<00:04:55.750> videos<00:04:56.110> are

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
think that's what these videos are

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:57.900 
think that's what these videos are
paired<00:04:56.530> toward<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.340> type<00:04:57.490> of<00:04:57.520> person<00:04:57.729> that's

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
paired toward the type of person that's

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.110 
paired toward the type of person that's
that's<00:04:58.539> not<00:04:59.289> an<00:04:59.500> expert<00:05:00.190> at<00:05:00.400> least<00:05:00.580> if<00:05:00.970> you're

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
that's not an expert at least if you're

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.700 
that's not an expert at least if you're
already<00:05:01.210> an<00:05:01.389> expert<00:05:01.479> and<00:05:01.900> play<00:05:02.050> game<00:05:02.320> battles

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
already an expert and play game battles

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.850 
already an expert and play game battles
and<00:05:02.889> stuff<00:05:03.070> like<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.250> that's<00:05:03.669> great<00:05:04.740> this<00:05:05.740> is

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
and stuff like that that's great this is

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.290 
and stuff like that that's great this is
probably<00:05:06.039> stuff<00:05:06.340> you<00:05:06.460> already<00:05:06.639> know<00:05:06.880> this<00:05:07.120> is

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
probably stuff you already know this is

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.560 
probably stuff you already know this is
really<00:05:07.449> for<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:08.650> average<00:05:08.830> guy<00:05:09.190> who<00:05:09.970> gets<00:05:10.360> home

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570
