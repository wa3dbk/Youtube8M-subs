00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.170
 hello and welcome today in 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.940
 my report minutes for a new 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.190
 tutorial first two lawsuits this is the 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.840
 first trial is today we 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.850
 let's see how to decrease the size 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.180
 the image or the size of a cookie 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.140
 match 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.140
 here is an example 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.109
 now let's go to the counters and so 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.149
 you open a new sequence you 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.949
 import your spades and you put everything 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.250
 that's this timeline once this is 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.920
 done so I was selected so the first 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.619
 picture here so we were from 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.289
 double-click on the canvas here this 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.259
 window there optics and and you see 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.039
 appear points on the sides or 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.039
 in the middle 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.049
 amber middle and so that's you take 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.890
 your mouse your cursor and you 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.869
 lower your image alas the leaders 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.750
 now if we will do the same 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.179
 thing but with a picture group 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.940
 so we make the first foot 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.920
 that we have shrunk we frame what 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.420
 interested the rest of thailand and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.310
 we do that attributes so my 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.590
 ex trajectory and all that is 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:47.340
 hook you 're making poquet and now 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.259
 all my images have diminished which is 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.890
 for example between two types of white 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.899
 wanted to animate your images 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:01.170
 it is very simple you take 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:03.719
 worry about double click and move you 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.740
 like these for example 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.680
 it's an example it's because 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.259
 the aesthetics no no you want 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.190
 restore another picture 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.250
 So you have to click and move here 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.750
 like this here it is very simple and 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:26.900
 easy to stay for example in the middle 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.900
 so a little in rapido 6 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.900
 me so it's a very small tutorial 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.819
 simple but that can be very useful 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.340
 so be nice it's my second 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.379
 tutorial so I wish to have some 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.299
 comments to be able to improve my 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.159
 videos and especially if you like 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.250
