out applying false eyelashes can be a
little<00:04:06.440> bit<00:04:06.620> difficult<00:04:07.160> but<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.460> can<00:04:07.640> assure

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
little bit difficult but I can assure

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.040 
little bit difficult but I can assure
you<00:04:07.940> it's<00:04:08.180> worth<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.540> try

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
you it's worth the try

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.800 
you it's worth the try
look<00:04:09.530> at<00:04:09.680> my<00:04:09.800> eyes<00:04:09.980> one<00:04:10.700> has<00:04:10.910> them<00:04:11.090> on<00:04:11.240> one<00:04:11.600> has

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
look at my eyes one has them on one has

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.080 
look at my eyes one has them on one has
them<00:04:12.020> off<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.500> it's<00:04:12.620> a<00:04:12.770> big<00:04:13.100> big<00:04:13.400> difference<00:04:13.610> I

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
them off and it's a big big difference I

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.610 
them off and it's a big big difference I
think<00:04:14.540> it<00:04:14.660> really<00:04:14.870> pulls<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.260> look<00:04:15.440> together

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
think it really pulls the look together

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.550 
think it really pulls the look together
very<00:04:16.370> nicely<00:04:16.640> so<00:04:17.390> here<00:04:17.690> I<00:04:17.720> clearly<00:04:18.260> win

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
very nicely so here I clearly win

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.300 
very nicely so here I clearly win
