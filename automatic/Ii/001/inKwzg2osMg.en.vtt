00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.959 
okay cars in park there's positive is
negative<00:00:07.429> I'll<00:00:08.429> attach<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.269> jumper<00:00:09.719> wire<00:00:10.969> to

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
negative I'll attach the jumper wire to

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:21.050 
negative I'll attach the jumper wire to
the<00:00:12.480> pin<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.920> solenoid<00:00:19.670> okay<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:20.970> know

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the pin in the solenoid okay so we know

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.259 
the pin in the solenoid okay so we know
the<00:00:21.320> starter<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.410> good<00:00:22.850> you<00:00:23.850> know<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.090> battery

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the starter is good you know the battery

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.269 
the starter is good you know the battery
is<00:00:24.510> good<00:00:26.060> customer<00:00:27.060> was<00:00:27.240> saying<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:28.279> also

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
is good customer was saying that also

there's<00:00:46.530> your<00:00:46.770> LAN<00:00:46.950> module<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.520> there

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.920 

you<00:00:54.320> want<00:00:54.500> to<00:00:54.560> reach<00:00:54.710> up<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.840> disconnect<00:00:56.840> the

going to crank it this thing should

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.410 
going to crank it this thing should
light<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.289> up

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
light it up

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.100 
light it up

to<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.890> pull<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.780> plastic<00:02:18.780> trim<00:02:19.140> around

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
to do is to pull the plastic trim around

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.640 
to do is to pull the plastic trim around
the<00:02:19.500> column<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.670> then<00:02:21.300> check<00:02:21.630> power<00:02:22.320> out<00:02:22.620> of

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the column and then check power out of

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:35.199 
the column and then check power out of
the<00:02:22.860> switch

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:03:03.690 

yes<00:02:35.750> which<00:02:36.049> is<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> bit<00:02:36.379> barren<00:02:36.769> here

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.380 

simplest<00:03:04.420> thing<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.630> do<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:07.150> pull<00:03:07.360> a

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
simplest thing to do is to pull a

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:16.270 
simplest thing to do is to pull a
harness<00:03:07.630> plug

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.550 

pull<00:03:16.790> hard<00:03:17.150> look<00:03:17.540> forward

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.460 

now<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:21.620> can<00:03:21.770> either<00:03:21.890> bridge<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.930> two<00:03:24.170> red

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
now you can either bridge the two red

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.130 
now you can either bridge the two red
wires<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:25.070> two<00:03:25.250> heavy<00:03:25.490> ones<00:03:25.960> these<00:03:26.960> guys

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
wires the two heavy ones these guys

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.350 
wires the two heavy ones these guys
right<00:03:27.290> here<00:03:27.350> with<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:27.980> coat<00:03:28.550> hanger<00:03:28.580> uh<00:03:29.090> not<00:03:29.330> a

good<00:03:34.700> ignition<00:03:35.150> switch<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:38.720> then<00:03:38.870> use<00:03:39.020> a

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
good ignition switch and then use a

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.630 
good ignition switch and then use a
screw<00:03:39.350> driver<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.650> crank<00:03:40.900> key<00:03:41.900> on

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.320 

and<00:03:45.030> it's<00:03:45.330> cranky<00:03:45.980> engine<00:03:46.980> just<00:03:47.160> started<00:03:47.610> so

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
and it's cranky engine just started so

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.570 
and it's cranky engine just started so
it<00:03:48.450> needs<00:03:48.600> an<00:03:48.690> ignition<00:03:48.900> switch<00:03:52.310> if<00:03:53.310> we

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
it needs an ignition switch if we

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.020 
it needs an ignition switch if we
disconnect<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.720> starter<00:03:55.430> wire<00:03:56.430> here<00:03:56.790> that's

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
disconnect the starter wire here that's

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.490 
disconnect the starter wire here that's
the<00:03:57.210> one<00:03:57.330> from<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.630> connector<00:03:58.020> on<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.230> alarm
