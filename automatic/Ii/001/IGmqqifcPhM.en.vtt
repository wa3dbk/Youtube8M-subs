00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
like stereotype them but just interests

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.830 
like stereotype them but just interests
are<00:05:25.750> generally<00:05:26.750> sometimes<00:05:27.640> different<00:05:28.640> and<00:05:28.970> I

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
are generally sometimes different and I

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.920 
are generally sometimes different and I
have<00:05:30.350> interest<00:05:30.650> in<00:05:30.770> both<00:05:30.980> things<00:05:31.340> and<00:05:31.700> so<00:05:32.360> it

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
have interest in both things and so it

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.290 
have interest in both things and so it
just<00:05:32.990> gets<00:05:33.500> hard<00:05:33.950> and<00:05:34.220> complicated<00:05:34.550> sometimes

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
just gets hard and complicated sometimes

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.660 
just gets hard and complicated sometimes
when<00:05:35.660> they<00:05:35.780> like<00:05:35.960> assume<00:05:36.350> my<00:05:36.560> interests<00:05:37.130> or

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
when they like assume my interests or

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.670 
when they like assume my interests or

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
assume how I feel like at the end of the

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.040 
assume how I feel like at the end of the
day<00:05:39.770> I'm<00:05:40.010> me<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:40.280> into<00:05:41.210> whatever<00:05:41.360> I'm<00:05:41.660> into

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
day I'm me and into whatever I'm into

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
regardless memories but yeah I hope this

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.760 
regardless memories but yeah I hope this
made<00:05:46.760> sense<00:05:47.090> I<00:05:47.840> was<00:05:48.230> thinking<00:05:48.530> about<00:05:48.620> how<00:05:48.740> to

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
made sense I was thinking about how to

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.590 
made sense I was thinking about how to
wear<00:05:49.010> this<00:05:49.190> video<00:05:49.520> for<00:05:49.790> so<00:05:49.970> long<00:05:50.180> and<00:05:50.510> I<00:05:50.570> just

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
wear this video for so long and I just

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.030 
wear this video for so long and I just
decided<00:05:51.140> to<00:05:51.260> sit<00:05:51.440> down<00:05:51.560> and<00:05:51.710> do<00:05:51.830> it

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
decided to sit down and do it

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.159 
decided to sit down and do it
so<00:05:52.310> hopefully<00:05:53.030> this<00:05:53.240> made<00:05:53.450> sense<00:05:53.600> to<00:05:53.810> you<00:05:53.900> if

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169
