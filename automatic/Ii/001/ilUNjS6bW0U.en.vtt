00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.350
 I will not lie to sports 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.269
 fond of and that doesn't mean i'm gay so 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.769
 that shut up in general yes from sports i 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.780
 far we did not like the movie with 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.969
 half a million views there where during 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.170
 hockey match puck inadvertently 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.939
 pants hits 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.640
 goalkeeper learn and comment create 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.730
 makes a clear understanding of the rules of some 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.130
 juice or something like that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.380
 produce and now they will score one more time 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.160
 look see washers will fall now 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.219
 right here look she fell him right in 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.020
 pants oh my god yes there can be no 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.420
 forget that the teams at that time 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.270
 draw and goes about twirl so it is very 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.629
 important goal since the puck is still 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.239
 the goal was scored 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.670
 and here the most interesting thing begins 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.559
 I sometimes read what matters when there is 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.870
 the rule is that as soon as it loses for centuries 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.510
 the puck using not st should stop 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.970
 the game he did not and from the fans 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.790
 which started frantically frantic and a couple 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.860

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.590
 cool and fun to but this can 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.320
 be only in the cinema 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.869

 how not just I thought that I was already 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.379
 impossible to surprise but I was mistaken to me who 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.379

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.109
 like something really like it besides 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.120
 it helps a lot to release gas sometimes 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.739
 you can hear them scare or 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.530
 gas inside the abdomen 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.030
 sometimes they make funny sounds like 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.510

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:54.129
 and the gas comes out nice and slow in 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.199
 I never had rabbits so I 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.389
 I have no idea how important it is to help 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.340

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.370
