00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.290 
from cycle days 3 through 7
so<00:02:02.560> I'll<00:02:03.010> cycle<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.550> 3<00:02:03.790> 4<00:02:04.150> 5<00:02:04.510> 6<00:02:04.900> &amp;<00:02:05.170> 7<00:02:05.200> I'll<00:02:05.680> take

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
so I'll cycle a 3 4 5 6 &amp; 7 I'll take

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.710 
so I'll cycle a 3 4 5 6 &amp; 7 I'll take
100<00:02:07.300> milligrams<00:02:07.690> of<00:02:07.990> soya<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:10.300> really

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
100 milligrams of soya and just really

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.640 
100 milligrams of soya and just really
briefly<00:02:11.020> soy<00:02:11.830> isoflavones<00:02:12.070> are<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> plant<00:02:13.240> like

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
briefly soy isoflavones are a plant like

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.110 
briefly soy isoflavones are a plant like
estrogen<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:15.580> works<00:02:15.880> in<00:02:16.000> your<00:02:16.060> body

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
estrogen that works in your body

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.630 
estrogen that works in your body
similarly<00:02:16.870> similarly<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.890> how<00:02:17.980> clone<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.460> does

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
similarly similarly to how clone it does

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.210 
similarly similarly to how clone it does
so<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.780> soy<00:02:19.930> isoflavone<00:02:20.350> though<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.040> took

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
so the soy isoflavone though I just took

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.080 
so the soy isoflavone though I just took
it's<00:02:22.210> going<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.830> go<00:02:23.830> throughout<00:02:24.130> my<00:02:24.250> body<00:02:24.280> and

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
it's going to go throughout my body and

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.360 
it's going to go throughout my body and
it's<00:02:25.720> going<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.020> block<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.830> estrogen

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
it's going to block the estrogen

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.060 
it's going to block the estrogen
receptors<00:02:27.820> in<00:02:28.000> my<00:02:28.090> body<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.630> in<00:02:28.870> my<00:02:29.350> brain<00:02:29.650> my

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
receptors in my body so in my brain my

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.920 
receptors in my body so in my brain my
hypothalamus<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:30.910> pituitary<00:02:31.180> gland<00:02:31.750> are

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
hypothalamus and pituitary gland are

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.290 
hypothalamus and pituitary gland are
going<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.170> be<00:02:32.260> going<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:33.040> what<00:02:33.880> kinds<00:02:34.240> of

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
going to be going so what kinds of

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.150 
going to be going so what kinds of
hormones<00:02:34.660> do<00:02:34.810> we<00:02:34.870> need<00:02:34.960> to<00:02:35.050> produce<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.680> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
hormones do we need to produce and the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.960 
hormones do we need to produce and the
soy<00:02:36.340> isoflavone<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:37.270> saying<00:02:37.480> hey<00:02:38.730> yeah<00:02:39.730> the

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
soy isoflavone is saying hey yeah the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.570 
soy isoflavone is saying hey yeah the
Estrin<00:02:40.330> receptors<00:02:40.870> they're<00:02:41.110> blocked<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.920> we

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
Estrin receptors they're blocked so we

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.640 
Estrin receptors they're blocked so we
should<00:02:42.760> make<00:02:42.910> lots<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.180> estrogen<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:44.320> brand

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
should make lots of estrogen and I brand

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.150 
should make lots of estrogen and I brand
will<00:02:44.770> go

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
will go

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.680 
will go
okay<00:02:45.550> cool<00:02:45.730> let's<00:02:46.060> make<00:02:46.210> lots<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.510> estrogen

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
okay cool let's make lots of estrogen

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.860 
okay cool let's make lots of estrogen
and<00:02:47.050> then<00:02:47.230> tell<00:02:47.500> my<00:02:48.070> ovaries<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:48.910> wherever

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
and then tell my ovaries and wherever

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.530 
and then tell my ovaries and wherever
else<00:02:50.020> Estrin<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:50.980> produced<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.580> make<00:02:52.239> estrogen

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
else Estrin is produced to make estrogen

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.830 
else Estrin is produced to make estrogen
and<00:02:53.320> as<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.739> result<00:02:54.160> i'll<00:02:54.400> have<00:02:54.730> nice<00:02:55.180> big

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
and as a result i'll have nice big

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.470 
and as a result i'll have nice big
follicles<00:02:56.470> hopefully<00:02:57.100> instead<00:02:57.850> of<00:02:58.000> producing

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
follicles hopefully instead of producing

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.660 
follicles hopefully instead of producing
lots<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.560> lots<00:02:59.680> of<00:02:59.770> follicles<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:00.370> do

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
lots and lots of follicles that do

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.250 
lots and lots of follicles that do
nothing<00:03:01.030> hopefully<00:03:01.480> I'll<00:03:01.570> produce<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.989> few

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
nothing hopefully I'll produce a few

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.350 
nothing hopefully I'll produce a few
good<00:03:02.590> follicles<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.280> I'll<00:03:03.489> actually<00:03:03.910> ovulate

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
good follicles and I'll actually ovulate

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.210 
good follicles and I'll actually ovulate
because<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.290> other<00:03:05.410> thing<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.739> learned<00:03:05.890> in

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
because the other thing I learned in

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.460 
because the other thing I learned in
this<00:03:06.459> past<00:03:06.700> year<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.330> do<00:03:07.450> not<00:03:07.870> ovulate

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
this past year is that I do not ovulate

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.530 
this past year is that I do not ovulate
on<00:03:08.500> my<00:03:08.709> own<00:03:10.080> yep<00:03:11.110> I<00:03:11.260> just<00:03:11.530> don't<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:12.239> I'm<00:03:13.239> hoping

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
on my own yep I just don't so I'm hoping

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.930 
on my own yep I just don't so I'm hoping
that<00:03:13.630> these<00:03:14.020> soy<00:03:14.530> isoflavones<00:03:14.950> taken<00:03:15.760> from

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
that these soy isoflavones taken from

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.479 
that these soy isoflavones taken from
cycle<00:03:16.390> a's<00:03:16.480> 3<00:03:16.780> 3<00:03:17.019> 7<00:03:17.200> will<00:03:17.920> help<00:03:18.130> me

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
cycle a's 3 3 7 will help me

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.449 
cycle a's 3 3 7 will help me
ovulation<00:03:18.730> i<00:03:19.090> own<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:19.630> then<00:03:20.260> i<00:03:20.680> watched<00:03:21.250> a

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
ovulation i own and then i watched a

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.460 
ovulation i own and then i watched a
video<00:03:21.580> of<00:03:21.880> danielle<00:03:22.360> danielle<00:03:22.930> baby<00:03:23.200> bliss

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.120 
video of danielle danielle baby bliss
she<00:03:24.400> talked<00:03:24.670> about<00:03:24.760> evening<00:03:25.209> primrose<00:03:25.540> oil

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
she talked about evening primrose oil

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.670 
she talked about evening primrose oil
like<00:03:27.130> last<00:03:27.400> August<00:03:28.209> or<00:03:28.450> so<00:03:28.690> last<00:03:29.080> April<00:03:29.260> maybe

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
like last August or so last April maybe

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.370 
like last August or so last April maybe
so<00:03:30.370> I'm<00:03:30.610> going<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:30.910> take<00:03:31.090> evening<00:03:32.080> primrose

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
so I'm going to take evening primrose

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.330 
so I'm going to take evening primrose
oil<00:03:32.820> from<00:03:34.260> like<00:03:35.260> beginning<00:03:35.560> of<00:03:35.650> my<00:03:35.739> cycle<00:03:36.100> now

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
oil from like beginning of my cycle now

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.660 
oil from like beginning of my cycle now
cycle<00:03:36.760> day<00:03:36.850> 3<00:03:37.150> ish<00:03:37.380> until<00:03:38.380> about<00:03:38.769> cycle<00:03:39.130> day<00:03:39.250> 14

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
cycle day 3 ish until about cycle day 14

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.160 
cycle day 3 ish until about cycle day 14
so<00:03:39.970> just<00:03:40.239> from<00:03:40.360> this<00:03:41.140> is<00:03:41.320> just<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:43.450> be<00:03:43.570> used<00:03:43.840> to

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
so just from this is just to be used to

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.770 
so just from this is just to be used to
help<00:03:44.470> regulate<00:03:45.220> my<00:03:45.459> hormones<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.090> also<00:03:46.690> to

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
help regulate my hormones and also to

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.840 
help regulate my hormones and also to
help<00:03:46.959> encourage<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:48.040> production<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.550> egg

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
help encourage the production of egg

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.660 
help encourage the production of egg
white<00:03:49.150> cervical<00:03:49.630> mucus<00:03:50.190> for<00:03:51.190> around<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.489> time

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
white cervical mucus for around the time

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.090 
white cervical mucus for around the time
of<00:03:51.700> ovulation<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:53.230> that's<00:03:53.560> what<00:03:53.739> I'm<00:03:53.800> trying

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
of ovulation so that's what I'm trying

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.580 
of ovulation so that's what I'm trying
that's<00:03:54.160> different<00:03:54.610> I<00:03:54.850> might<00:03:55.480> also<00:03:55.780> throw<00:03:56.560> in

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
that's different I might also throw in

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.370 
that's different I might also throw in
some<00:03:56.740> progesterone<00:03:57.580> cream<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.180> be<00:03:58.330> tried<00:03:59.230> at

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
some progesterone cream to be tried at

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.200 
some progesterone cream to be tried at
the<00:03:59.470> end<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.770> my<00:03:59.860> cycle

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
the end of my cycle

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.420 
the end of my cycle
but<00:04:00.450> we'll<00:04:00.600> see<00:04:00.750> what<00:04:00.780> happens<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.560> that's

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
but we'll see what happens and that's
