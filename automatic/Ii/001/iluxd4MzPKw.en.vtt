 tribes and they are cousins follow a 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.940
 style our friends possesses as the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.490
 pigeon and the sparrow true because it gave 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.530
 for the pigeon and the sparrow to see then 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.810
 notice that we were taking songs and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.850
 according to age for example 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.800
 the pigeon and the sparrow are big 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.270
 singers they also started from 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.060
 small and they also started from 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.890
 small and fit the voices that 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.930
 we bring and leave very nice truth 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.640
 because they come out well it is very nice 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.200
 also here with us 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.090
 Solomon Guajardo that I will invite 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.700
 so that it happens 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.540
 Solomon Guajardo of the Baron of Apodaca 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.190
 true, it is a generation because 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.440
 intermediate true, that's what I say 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.479
 continues to give the kill as truth of 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.880
 musician that's because the guy is very 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.310
 heavy between the table 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.440
 to win the instruments that have the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.569
 ramones that was that true so many 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.470
 musicians and it has been a great inspiration 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.989
 since it does not leave veterans with children 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.930
 external and Julian the invaders Carlos 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.580
 son is right now they were with 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.890
 the new generations these children are 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.349
 very talented people play very beautiful and I 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.019
 I think he has a lot of future 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.000
 and what a pleasure it is for us to see which 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.640
 they are going to interpret us and what advice 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.400
 give that intermediate generation to the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.430
 boys and after they follow their dreams 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.560
 that you really want this is a 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.989
 apparently easy career but it's very 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.880
 difficult and it takes a lot of sacrifices on 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.680
 all dedication 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.360
 and especially the service with the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.860
 families because it 's a career that 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.299
 we are always outside we are always 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.420
 working the weekends 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.390
 Important dates then, you have to 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.060
 sacrificing all that well is because we will 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.709
 let's leave them because we want 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.450
 listen to those that help interpret 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.050

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.000
