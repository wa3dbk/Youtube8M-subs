00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.700 
about 5 hours to get in total I'll get
onto<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.179> later<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.230> video<00:00:16.379> i'm<00:00:16.560> just

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
onto that later on in the video i'm just

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.140 
onto that later on in the video i'm just
using<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.949> red<00:00:17.220> dot<00:00:17.430> sight<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:18.000> game

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
using the red dot sight on this game

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.670 
using the red dot sight on this game
which<00:00:18.330> was<00:00:18.539> really<00:00:18.750> good<00:00:18.960> fun<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.350> like<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
which was really good fun I like the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.960 
which was really good fun I like the
attachments<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.340> like<00:00:20.670> what<00:00:20.820> they've<00:00:20.939> done

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
attachments I like what they've done

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.609 
attachments I like what they've done
with<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.359> they<00:00:21.480> basically<00:00:21.840> toned<00:00:22.199> down<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
with it they basically toned down the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.109 
with it they basically toned down the
blast<00:00:22.949> radius<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.369> lot<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.730> let<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.000> have

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
blast radius a lot so you let you have

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.849 
blast radius a lot so you let you have
to<00:00:24.180> put<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.420> underneath<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.650> guy<00:00:25.800> to

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
to put it underneath on like that guy to

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.509 
to put it underneath on like that guy to
get<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> kill

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
get the kill

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
gameplay and basically the fire rate is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.870 
gameplay and basically the fire rate is
massively<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.189> good<00:00:32.369> fun<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.669> lot<00:00:32.820> of

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
massively up so it is good fun a lot of

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.370 
massively up so it is good fun a lot of
