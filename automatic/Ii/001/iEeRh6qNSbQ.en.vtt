00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
with the cover off I mean you don't have

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.310 
with the cover off I mean you don't have
to<00:02:12.190> take<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.400> off<00:02:12.610> but<00:02:13.180> it's<00:02:13.360> easier<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.930> have

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
to take it off but it's easier you have

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.740 
to take it off but it's easier you have
this<00:02:14.440> connection<00:02:14.710> which<00:02:15.220> goes<00:02:15.460> right<00:02:15.670> here

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.170 

this<00:02:19.750> connection<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.350> could<00:02:20.590> do<00:02:20.710> it<00:02:20.830> later

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
this connection you could do it later

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.610 
this connection you could do it later
because<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.210> have<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.510> cover<00:02:22.870> off<00:02:22.990> so<00:02:23.560> you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
because you have that cover off so you

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.020
