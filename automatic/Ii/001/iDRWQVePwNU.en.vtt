00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.450
 that the flamethrower must hold on again 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.450
 must hold on 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.860
 all mcca guys with you became a teller 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.100
 This is the eleventh issue of the review. 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.160
 Don went first don dogs and mice 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.440
 stepan 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.230
 yes you understood it again the lights 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.340
 I can see what I like to do them 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.340
 flamethrower different accuracy 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.690
 I really like his couple 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.360
 and by the way speaking if done like this 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.800
 then you can get burned and to some extent 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.140
 that's cool too 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.140
 unfortunately the saint does not give so of course 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.280
 hot but use a flashlight with features 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.600
 zombies he copes 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.469
 perfect 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.469
 almost and real 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.700
 so and he has infinite charges but 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.560
 in general, in fact, they end up really not 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.770
 not displayed but when it ends 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.530
 just gives us new unknown 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.940
 they take it 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.540
 and of course his range too 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.540
 kinda nice 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.340
 unlike this flamethrower 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.450
 well yes it is so it will be strangers 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.450
 this is already a plus 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.370
 this one is not 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.290
 what 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.700
 somewhere chadu called sirius sam question 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.960
 probably guessed that he himself 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.520
 presents 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.010
 and he is a weapon of 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.110
 cool game fought first weapon for 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.970
 This add-on shotgun to cool 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.290
 walking animation 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.540
 actually a shotgun just a pill 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.820
 nothing else represents 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.540
 how in range 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.540
 and power 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.000
 there is a feeling good 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.000
 and so basically nothing special 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.280
 Do not even think about it 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.530
 Thompson's next weapon does not stack 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.600
 the impression that this weapon is not at all 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.330
 It would give absolutely no 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.470
 in terms of power, it completely satisfies me 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.180
 like a machine 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.180
 the next weapon is a very dangerous knife 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.690
 why see yourself very dangerous 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.690
 how can simply incredible 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.460
 if you want to may well invest 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.460
 or this handsome 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.130
 already bleeding out and everything 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.020
 he's ready 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.610
 incredibly powerful weapon 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.440
 the next weapon will teach this 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.570
 steel it like this 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.820
 the longer you hold the mouse button 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.410
 beyond the pack that I am a zombie he copes 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.360
 fine just throw it under their feet 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.240
 grenade and all or all are ready 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.740
 candle guns then a shotgun is essentially small 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.850
 what are turning double-barrel 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.050
 so we will not be on it for long 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.170
 linger 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.060
 discover cheated 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.020
 and my favorite weapon from this don is this 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.569
 a gun 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.950
 where is it just power 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.780
 not only does she explode so she 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.310
 just still heavy 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.599
 by her own 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.599
 look it's just sick 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.590
 like skittles 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.590
 wonderful thing 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.520
 the next weapon is the gun with coffee 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.020
 devoid of any problem 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.220
 and you can two revolver skovill 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.220
 devoid of any return 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.890
 to kill a simple zombie 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.530
 you will need a little more than one 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.420
 charge let's say so pretty weak 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.860
 gun and change a little sad 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.860
 the next weapon is the zirgan 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.690
 he is quite powerful 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.190
 but when shooting it seems that the laser and 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.400
 crashes out of my area 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.400
 belly 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.130
 but not everything is much worse than imagined 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.569
 but you can imagine that a hand mask 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.920
 aliens 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.380
 or some kind of robot killer 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.130
 class- firing 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.410
 next weapon dominican beach tasks 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.800
 as I understand it, everything has already been decided and the problem 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.560
 look solid black spot 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.090
 he yes you are on the weak 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.329
 not as powerful as we would like 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.829
 of course 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.440
 but his view rather inspires and 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.150
 gives you some feeling 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.420
 not the last weapon of this danada the 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.750
 rocket launcher 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.729
 I think it is not necessary to explain that this is a monster 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.930
 not inferior to the usual 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.930
 yes even better in speed 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.120
 the next atom is called wabback and 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.500
 he represents himself wabbajok staff 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.510
 the elder scrolls universe 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.520
 handed a bag a mountain there something I eat 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.350
 those who met with Elena took 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.520
 revealed that I never know what 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.260
 can happen when you use 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.449
 this staff effect is absolutely 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.129
 unpredictable 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.289
 but I know one thing that sooner or later he 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:59.189
 all the same will kill you as well 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.189
 happened can and have fun 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.599
 parties 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.960
 basically everything that Wang didn't do 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.789
 associated with death 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.180
 a moment to me turning some 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.180
 about 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.560
 Oh 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.430
 unpredictable 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.430
 and uncontrollable 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.979
 not to you 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.480
 it's already dangerous 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.290
 from what 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.290
 i made it invisible 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.540
 cans 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.130
 and explosion 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.130
 your drives 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.950
 no no get out 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.950
 how annoying so 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:07.440
 caught fire and then became visible but then 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:07.440
 oh hell died and don't even think 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.740
 don't even think about it well i have done 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.689
 only things are worse overall this thing 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.449
 unpredictable thickness use with 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:23.479
 caution with extreme caution 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.710
 because you can always be a chair, 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.370
 last for today addon is a bow of 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.069
 krayzis games 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.469
 He has his own model of the hands that 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:34.319
 I am quite often saddened he shoots 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:35.029
 like an arrow as fly but 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.819
 hit 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:41.159
 she just sticks in for 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.319
 which is from the usual bullet on the right button 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:45.330
 of sight but we are not approaching so 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.159
 that I don't see the point of using it 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.710
 when you see your sight much 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:52.139
 more convenient but it is quite powerful and 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.830
 quick-fire i said powerful 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:54.830
 rate of fire 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.889
 but on this i think everyone thanks for 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.780
 I hope you enjoyed watching the guys 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:04.520

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.100
