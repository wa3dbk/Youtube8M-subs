so I decided for my main account me to
go<00:00:57.360> get<00:00:57.480> em<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> form<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.800> what<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> did

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
go get em in form and that's what I did

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.330 
go get em in form and that's what I did
immediately<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.789> went<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.180> got<00:01:00.420> him

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
immediately I went and got him

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.670 
immediately I went and got him
strategist<00:01:02.340> immediately<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.300> did<00:01:03.840> try<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.439> 42

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
strategist immediately I did try for 42

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.270 
strategist immediately I did try for 42
42<00:01:05.400> 22<00:01:06.060> formation<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.710> don't<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> just

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
42 22 formation and I don't know it just

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.890 
42 22 formation and I don't know it just
didn't<00:01:08.580> work<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.850> well<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.030> found<00:01:09.360> myself<00:01:09.570> doing

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
didn't work as well I found myself doing

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.570 
didn't work as well I found myself doing
really<00:01:10.140> well<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.619> RTG<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.310> formation

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
really well in the RTG in this formation

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.640 
really well in the RTG in this formation
so<00:01:11.850> i<00:01:11.909> swapped<00:01:12.180> her<00:01:12.360> back<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.049> i<00:01:13.470> did

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
so i swapped her back to this and i did

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.039 
so i swapped her back to this and i did
much<00:01:13.920> better<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.430> formation<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.960> if

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
much better in this formation and so if

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.789 
much better in this formation and so if
we<00:01:16.170> moved<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.530> dumb<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.340> fast<00:01:17.580> 92<00:01:18.420> pace

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
we moved a dumb be a really fast 92 pace

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.070 
we moved a dumb be a really fast 92 pace
99<00:01:19.799> finishing<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.610> he's<00:01:20.759> almost<00:01:21.060> always<00:01:21.360> gonna

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
99 finishing so he's almost always gonna

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.130 
99 finishing so he's almost always gonna
finish<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.590> which<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.040> awesome<00:01:24.049> then<00:01:25.049> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
finish it which is just awesome then you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.499
