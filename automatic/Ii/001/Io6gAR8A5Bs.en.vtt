00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:29.369
 to linz in terms of music we have two 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.710
 axes that will be important is 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.230
 the explosion of the techno music and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.080
 the rave parties the free parties so 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.190
 more freedom and is a mix of 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:44.010
 styles and we have in rock the movement 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.170
 that the press especially with barn is 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.510
 whoever does not get dressed is more 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.930
 everything is in the head and less and less 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.930
 in the pockets 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.649
 and there is a whole new generation 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:50.789
 also furniture designer is marc 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:53.259
 newson it's tom dixon in england 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.799
 well thought in new materials 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:02.560
 but if they fit in with the 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:05.890
 minimum of the nature of the solid bases 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.399
 and healthy imagining domestic of 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.399
 capital 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.480
 twingo was introduced for the 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.060
 first time to the public at the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.920
 paris in 1992 and she was 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.920
 marketed in 1993 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.500
 renault had been a pioneer with 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.780
 the space then then to decline 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.150
 scenic mid-range and twingo 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:21.610
 via completing this range of minivans 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.730
 with a small city car but very 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.330
 functional and with a boil 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.190
 extremely friendly 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.440
 so you see that this car is 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.140
 all round she does not really have any 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.390
 hood the the front is in the 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.550
 extension of the windshield and then she 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.080
 has two round headlights that make it 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.760
 look a bit like a batrachian a 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:59.340
 little frog and that gives him a 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:59.340
 looks eminently sympathetic choctaw 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.849
 during the presentation of the twingo in 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.259
 92 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:07.240
 I was a young journalist so I 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.400
 remember it very well she had a 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.060
 little surprised with those who loved those 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.650
 who hated 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.969
 but still is it that today I 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.810
 think the first twingo 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:18.610
 generation remains and will remain as a 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.919
 reference of his time 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.810
 me my first personal car that 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.229
 I bought nine it was that it was a 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.360
 twingo 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.919
 I think today is 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.330
 something of a separable from 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.949
 the history of renault and the team of 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.949
 Patrick Le QuÃ©ment years at that time
