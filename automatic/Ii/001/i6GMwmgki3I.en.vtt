00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:09.430
 Well now I make a video of how 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.980
 put the campaign to the genre just the 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.460
 edition but this only works in 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.010
 English 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.160
 I will leave a link in case you do not 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.210
 have a description of the video this 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.759
 video is not exactly what it was going to be 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.369
 me because I foolishly got confused and 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:35.460
 so I heard that the links that fell from 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.460
 a tutorial was from youtube of 2015 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.060
 and I happen to be the days of my video 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.550
 to compose at home and I have them 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:50.060
 I pass them, I confused 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:53.200
 Now I have to put on myself 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:57.220
 I started climbing I was going to take more 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.630
 they do not copy God I am already the 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.900
 I had 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:06.520
 it's more had more first these these 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.490
 3 ice maps for I do not know what to 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.909
 the other gender 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.829
 these maps are campaign maps so that 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.000
 the low cost or nation and also gives them 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:21.590
 an appearance of vision to the menu 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.590
 upon entering and all that 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.420
 and campaign 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.530
 this put these is exactly the same 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.080
 that the other video but I gave a 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.410
 annotation there and that the seen 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.500
 right now I just finished uploading all 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.850
 the maps as well as these maps 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.560
 some one 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.220
 of 2 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.220
 and so 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:02.080
 that is the map at 10 to 30 to 50 and 30 well 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.910
 how are they going 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.700
 are going to download all this is for 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.550
 have it with all 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.270
 what they are going to do is download the 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.270
 decompress 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.510
 and they're going to be all these are 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.750
 there are eleven the first ten are the maps 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.080
 of each campaign mission in style 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.990
 3 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.069
 and this is what gives to the one who 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.499
 add the button 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.079
 the campaign button to your hello custom 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.610
 edition but only English works ions 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:40.050
 from jalÃ³n 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:45.890
 well basically what they are going to do is 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.890
 they told how they want they can copy it 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.000
 copy the maps and then keep the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.650
 direct access to the folder open it or 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.480
 but even the list directors can 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.490
 open file location I change it 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.230
 the icon so as not to confuse it with the other 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.230
 there is a key in the location of the file 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.569
 o oat map map map map folder 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.750
 sorry 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.450
 they put you says maps 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.819
 here they are going to put you in a 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.890
 patient stuck 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.980
 I 'm going to put it copy and replace 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.170
 because the maps already had it but 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.269
 you will already have the wii it is also 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.840
 the one who has to start putting copy and 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.019
 place everything 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.819
 perform extension for the following 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.680
 conflicts you will only have one if 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.220
 they have never put campaign maps 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.970
 wants to replace 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.810
 is copying the elements are 3.17 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.810
 inah bytes 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.690
 they are copying 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.870
 an annotations that only works in 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.870
 I did not campaign limits to anyone not 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.480
 in ice campaign works in hello 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.900
 custom edition in English means 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.900
 sorry 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.239
 If you have already added the campaign, 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.400
 they have English I'm not 100% sure that 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.040
 will work for them but in case 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.750
 you want to try yours 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.420
 original that you have them 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.789
 I recommend that you co-pack it and save it 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.070
 where who before replacing it by 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.370
 everyone that I 'm going to the wiki 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.750
 spend and all that at home and if you do not 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.580
 was left 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.580
 If they did not fit, it was as ugly as it was 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.170
 grab your normal and put no longer leave 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.920
 his game as they have been tried by the 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:38.380
 mine can also apply this option 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.870
 in any other game 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.350
 you any other campaign that 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.350
 have 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.190
 the one that has an editing cost that 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.980
 go to do this and want to give a 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.110
 copy it 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.770
 but it only works in that the announcer 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.950
 English edition and I've checked it 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.770
 I recommend that I recommend you 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.270
 use in me or in which I will leave you my 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.020
 music 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.680
 good after they have done everything 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.620
 that 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.360
 they will have their gel or if they already have another 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.520
 halo or dedicated server 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.620
 and normal leds 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.710
 you can change the icon to not 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:27.750
 confuse them by default by bringing 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.750
 circles we go on properties 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.620
 And it's easy 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.620

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.860
