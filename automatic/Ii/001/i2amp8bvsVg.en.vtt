00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.940
 this is a small unpack session 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.550
 bestron pizza oven 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.130
 This is a small bike ride with one 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.910
 stones the lake and that stone cares 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.260
 make sure the pizza is well heated 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.080
 At the bottom 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.789
 it has two heating elements one 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.890
 above and one below 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.420
 under the stone and up and as a result 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.750
 can this about 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.239
 to heat up to 450 degrees that means 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.660
 that the pizza is ready much quicker than 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.309
 normal and by the stone would be the pizza 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.260
 also a very crispy base 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.789
 can we get a go look 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.789
 what's in the box 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.930
 first a manual 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:23.990
 nicely packed 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:27.909
 very normal we can just as knife so that 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.909
 we can get that right 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.340
 is very beautiful 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.300
 2 stainless steel to create the pizze so on to 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.780
 create 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.780
 look good 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.060
 the pizza stone 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.810
 and of course the bicycles themselves 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.670
 of course, is also the whole class in 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.670
 plastic 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.600
 the 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.300
 there it is then the outside is made 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.300
 made of metal 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.700
 there is a button here for the temperature 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.530
 to be adjusted 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.090
 minimum sit is no 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.530
 temperature itself at 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.290
 so that is drink a bit of sorting out 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.560
 a glass panel to see how far the 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.910
 how much baker pizza is 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.160
 and here you can set whether you like it 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.870
 upper element wants to use it below 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.550
 element or at the heating elements 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.200
 so of course it gets a little faster 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.950
 then go for the rest we go for a moment 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.710
 open up 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.050
 here can see the pizza stone that 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:43.310
 are we going to put in here than those that are 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.620
 the heating elements here number 2 and 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.150
 this should then ensure that the 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.360
 pizzas will become even tastier than will 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.830
 his cake is half this height 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.380
 use with 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.330
 frozen pizzas but of course we go 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.610
 try to get fresh pizzas in here 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.680
 but I hope you are just now 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.500
 have a small in the back because the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.240
 Bestron is pizza oven and I go 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.830
 post another movie soon how 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.840
 the baker goes 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.200
 brought it up and until the next 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.200
 times
