this corn so what I'm trying to do as
well

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
well

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.670 
well
he's<00:01:01.199> leave<00:01:01.469> one<00:01:01.680> leaves<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.550> side<00:01:03.470> with<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
he's leave one leaves this side with it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.609 
he's leave one leaves this side with it
and<00:01:06.710> this<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:08.990> with<00:01:10.340> with<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> weeds<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:12.619> they

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and this one with with the weeds on they

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.700 
and this one with with the weeds on they
are<00:01:13.680> pretty<00:01:14.159> much<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.700> same<00:01:15.210> size<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.200> I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
are pretty much the same size and I

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.450 
are pretty much the same size and I
think<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.460> weeds<00:01:17.700> when<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> corn<00:01:18.659> gets<00:01:18.900> tall

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
think the weeds when the corn gets tall

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.760 
think the weeds when the corn gets tall
they<00:01:20.460> don't<00:01:20.729> disturb<00:01:21.570> their<00:01:21.930> growth<00:01:22.259> that

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
they don't disturb their growth that

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.190 
they don't disturb their growth that
much<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.310> I'm<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> try<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.869> leave<00:01:25.020> them

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
much so I'm going to try to leave them

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.770 
much so I'm going to try to leave them
like<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.619> see<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.070> happens

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
like this and see what happens

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.480 
like this and see what happens

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
I'm not going to have time to eat them

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.330 
I'm not going to have time to eat them
all<00:01:29.700> these<00:01:30.450> ones<00:01:30.720> are<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.530> bit<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> little

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
all these ones are a little bit a little

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.469 
all these ones are a little bit a little
bit<00:01:32.520> small<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.950> weeds<00:01:35.159> are<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.700> eating

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
bit small and the weeds are like eating

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.590 
bit small and the weeds are like eating
them<00:01:37.130> but<00:01:38.130> these<00:01:38.700> are<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.970> huge<00:01:39.710> already<00:01:41.600> so

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
them but these are a huge already so

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.370 
them but these are a huge already so
let's<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:43.829> they<00:01:44.360> they<00:01:45.360> do<00:01:45.540> any<00:01:45.750> damage<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
let's see if they they do any damage to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.710 
let's see if they they do any damage to
them

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
them

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.380 
them
let's<00:01:48.720> water<00:01:49.020> them

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
let's water them

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.490 

I've<00:01:51.720> tried<00:01:52.530> two<00:01:52.770> ways<00:01:53.180> one<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.540> flood<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
I've tried two ways one is to flood the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.639 
I've tried two ways one is to flood the
Middle's<00:01:55.829> let<00:01:56.430> me<00:01:56.549> show<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.180> other<00:01:57.360> side

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
Middle's let me show you the other side

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.010 
Middle's let me show you the other side
it's<00:01:58.649> easier

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.690 

one<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.140> them<00:02:03.260> is<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.560> flood<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.400> Middle's

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
one of them is to flood the Middle's

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:14.770 
one of them is to flood the Middle's
with<00:02:05.119> this<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:09.470> is<00:02:09.500> tube<00:02:12.940> our<00:02:13.940> water<00:02:14.209> here<00:02:14.600> has

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
with this it is tube our water here has

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.460 
with this it is tube our water here has
a<00:02:15.020> lot<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.319> pressure<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:16.540> it's<00:02:17.540> really<00:02:17.930> quickly

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
a lot of pressure so it's really quickly

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.830 
a lot of pressure so it's really quickly
to<00:02:19.430> towards<00:02:19.940> them<00:02:20.180> like<00:02:20.360> this<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:23.300> we<00:02:23.690> don't

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
to towards them like this and we don't

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.840 
to towards them like this and we don't
we<00:02:24.230> don't<00:02:24.350> pay<00:02:24.590> here<00:02:24.860> for<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.160> water<00:02:25.340> we<00:02:25.670> pay

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
we don't pay here for the water we pay

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.550 
we don't pay here for the water we pay
for<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.180> like<00:02:26.900> electricity<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.130> pump<00:02:28.540> so

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
for the like electricity of the pump so

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.350 
for the like electricity of the pump so
the<00:02:30.560> last<00:02:30.739> time<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.160> takes<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.489> water<00:02:31.670> the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
the last time it takes to water the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.000 
the last time it takes to water the
better<00:02:32.569> for<00:02:32.750> me<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:35.060> other<00:02:35.209> way<00:02:35.420> I've<00:02:35.600> tried

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
better for me the other way I've tried

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.509 
better for me the other way I've tried
to<00:02:37.010> water<00:02:37.190> them<00:02:37.459> is<00:02:37.640> overhead<00:02:38.269> irrigation

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
to water them is overhead irrigation

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.920 
to water them is overhead irrigation
with<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.640> sprinkler<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.480> don't<00:02:41.750> have

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
with the sprinkler that I don't have

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.130 
with the sprinkler that I don't have
here<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.380> show<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.739> have<00:02:43.010> there<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:44.140> tubing

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
here to show you I have there the tubing

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.229 
here to show you I have there the tubing
in<00:02:45.260> everything<00:02:45.709> but<00:02:46.640> doesn't<00:02:47.060> have<00:02:47.180> the

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
in everything but doesn't have the

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.530 
in everything but doesn't have the
sprinkler<00:02:47.780> otherwise<00:02:48.730> someone<00:02:49.730> will<00:02:49.760> come

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
sprinkler otherwise someone will come

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.430 
sprinkler otherwise someone will come
here<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.430> steal<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.580> from<00:02:52.760> me<00:02:53.290> it's<00:02:54.290> very

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
here and steal it from me it's very

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.650 
here and steal it from me it's very
expensive<00:02:54.769> so<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.310> can't<00:02:55.550> ride<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.820> there<00:02:58.630> but<00:02:59.630> I

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
expensive so I can't ride it there but I

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.460 
expensive so I can't ride it there but I
think<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:01.130> best<00:03:01.310> way<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.690> water<00:03:02.690> them<00:03:03.050> as

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
think the best way to water them as

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.640 
think the best way to water them as
Koren<00:03:04.130> loves<00:03:04.340> water<00:03:04.819> is<00:03:05.330> by<00:03:05.870> flooding<00:03:06.410> the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
Koren loves water is by flooding the
