the<00:02:11.549> mind-body<00:02:12.439> contraction<00:02:13.439> time<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:14.099> I<00:02:14.129> do

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:14.249 
the mind-body contraction time that I do

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:16.399 
the mind-body contraction time that I do
to<00:02:15.120> really<00:02:15.450> because<00:02:15.749> the<00:02:15.930> more<00:02:16.139> that<00:02:16.260> you're

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
to really because the more that you're

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.230 
to really because the more that you're
under<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:17.010> contraction<00:02:17.639> time

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
under the contraction time

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.290 
under the contraction time
the<00:02:18.690> more<00:02:18.870> intense<00:02:19.320> and<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.890> more<00:02:20.130> uh<00:02:20.300> tissue

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
the more intense and the more uh tissue

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.090 
the more intense and the more uh tissue
you're<00:02:21.630> breaking<00:02:22.050> down<00:02:22.080> into<00:02:22.530> your<00:02:22.620> muscle

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
you're breaking down into your muscle

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.490 
you're breaking down into your muscle
which<00:02:23.820> equals<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.270> lactic<00:02:24.600> acid<00:02:25.020> which

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
which equals the lactic acid which

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.400 
which equals the lactic acid which
equals<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.160> pump<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:27.240> guys<00:02:27.510> here<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.930> go<00:02:28.200> I'm

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
equals a pump so guys here you go I'm

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.330 
equals a pump so guys here you go I'm

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
it contracted by my side and I'm just

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.320 
it contracted by my side and I'm just
going<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.610> start<00:02:54.330> by<00:02:54.390> my<00:02:54.720> hip<00:02:54.960> make<00:02:55.500> sure<00:02:55.680> your

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
going to start by my hip make sure your

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:08.130 
going to start by my hip make sure your
elbows<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.890> go<00:02:58.890> do<00:02:59.640> about<00:02:59.880> five<00:03:00.180> reps<00:03:01.050> each<00:03:01.410> arm

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.660 

there<00:03:09.140> were<00:03:09.350> you<00:03:09.440> know<00:03:09.470> what<00:03:09.710> that's<00:03:09.890> that

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
there were you know what that's that

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.820 
there were you know what that's that
mean<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.060> rep<00:03:11.270> you're<00:03:12.200> gonna<00:03:12.290> go<00:03:12.470> ahead<00:03:12.680> and

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
mean that rep you're gonna go ahead and

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.550 
mean that rep you're gonna go ahead and
hold<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.160> right<00:03:13.340> here<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:14.180> switch<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.600> an<00:03:14.750> arm

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
hold it right here and switch to an arm

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:25.000 
hold it right here and switch to an arm
well<00:03:16.520> this<00:03:16.760> one's<00:03:17.030> contracted<00:03:17.720> Midway<00:03:24.010> all

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
well this one's contracted Midway all

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.330 
well this one's contracted Midway all
right<00:03:25.250> so<00:03:25.910> after<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.890> we're<00:03:27.890> gonna<00:03:28.010> do<00:03:28.190> the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
right so after that we're gonna do the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.270 
right so after that we're gonna do the
resistance<00:03:28.820> curls<00:03:29.209> now<00:03:30.110> these<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:31.070> whole

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
resistance curls now these the whole

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.790 
resistance curls now these the whole
point<00:03:31.580> is<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.600> resistance<00:03:33.230> once<00:03:33.590> you're

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
point is the resistance once you're

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.070 
point is the resistance once you're
coming<00:03:34.160> down<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:34.850> it's<00:03:35.420> kind<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.720> like<00:03:35.900> a

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
coming down so it's kind of like a

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.040 
coming down so it's kind of like a
hammer<00:03:36.500> curl<00:03:36.830> into<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.640> resistance<00:03:38.090> curl<00:03:38.390> and

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
hammer curl into the resistance curl and

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.510 
hammer curl into the resistance curl and
it's<00:03:39.260> okay<00:03:39.590> if<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:39.770> swing<00:03:40.070> a<00:03:40.220> little<00:03:40.340> bit

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
it's okay if you swing a little bit

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.390 
it's okay if you swing a little bit
because<00:03:40.760> like<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.300> said<00:03:41.360> them<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.770> movement<00:03:43.220> up

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
because like I said them the movement up

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.729 
because like I said them the movement up
is<00:03:43.610> not<00:03:44.209> really<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.780> exercise<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:45.440> you're

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
is not really the exercise that you're

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.350 
is not really the exercise that you're
going<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:45.950> be<00:03:46.040> really<00:03:46.459> concentrating<00:03:47.180> on<00:03:47.239> when

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
going to be really concentrating on when

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.300 
going to be really concentrating on when
it<00:03:47.450> comes<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.750> muscles<00:03:48.200> so<00:03:49.100> you're<00:03:49.190> gonna

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
it comes to muscles so you're gonna

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.900 
it comes to muscles so you're gonna
hammer<00:03:49.910> curl<00:03:50.209> up<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.620> coming<00:03:51.920> down<00:03:52.070> try

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
hammer curl up and you coming down try

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:01.180 
hammer curl up and you coming down try
to<00:03:52.940> really<00:03:53.239> fight<00:03:53.570> it<00:03:55.959> does<00:03:56.959> this<00:03:57.170> resist<00:04:00.190> same

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
to really fight it does this resist same

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.470 
to really fight it does this resist same
with<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.430> other<00:04:01.550> one<00:04:03.610> resist<00:04:07.270> really<00:04:08.270> try<00:04:08.450> to

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
with the other one resist really try to

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.170 
with the other one resist really try to
focus<00:04:09.970> on<00:04:10.970> your<00:04:11.180> muscle<00:04:11.600> contracting<00:04:13.180> so

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
focus on your muscle contracting so

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.750 
focus on your muscle contracting so
again<00:04:14.390> you're<00:04:14.540> gonna<00:04:14.600> do<00:04:15.010> about<00:04:16.010> five<00:04:16.250> reps<00:04:16.549> on

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
again you're gonna do about five reps on

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.849 
again you're gonna do about five reps on
each<00:04:16.880> arm<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.390> like<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.109> stay<00:04:18.320> in<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.500> five<00:04:18.680> to

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
each arm I like to stay in the five to

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.400 
each arm I like to stay in the five to
eight<00:04:19.040> rep<00:04:19.729> range<00:04:20.060> because<00:04:20.870> for<00:04:21.109> me<00:04:21.200> that's

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
eight rep range because for me that's

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.250 
eight rep range because for me that's
when<00:04:21.680> you're<00:04:22.640> building<00:04:23.030> muscle<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.630> mean

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
when you're building muscle I mean

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.290 
when you're building muscle I mean
you're<00:04:24.410> building<00:04:24.680> strength<00:04:25.010> so<00:04:25.310> trying<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.210> go

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
you're building strength so trying to go

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.030 
you're building strength so trying to go
really<00:04:26.510> heavy<00:04:26.750> between<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.590> five<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:27.890> eight

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
really heavy between the five to eight

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.020 
really heavy between the five to eight
rep<00:04:28.610> range<00:04:28.910> or<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:30.320> next<00:04:30.560> exercise<00:04:31.030> after

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
rep range or the next exercise after

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.140 
rep range or the next exercise after
that<00:04:32.860> you're<00:04:33.860> going<00:04:33.979> to<00:04:34.040> finish<00:04:34.190> up<00:04:34.490> some

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
that you're going to finish up some

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.650 
that you're going to finish up some
concentration<00:04:35.810> curls<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:37.180> like<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.300> keep<00:04:38.479> my

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
concentration curls I like to keep my
