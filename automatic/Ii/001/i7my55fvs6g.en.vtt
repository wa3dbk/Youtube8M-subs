of the time touring around the UK I

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.380 
of the time touring around the UK I
don't<00:01:45.500> think<00:01:45.590> there's<00:01:45.920> any<00:01:46.009> orchestras<00:01:46.910> in<00:01:47.060> in

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
don't think there's any orchestras in in

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.020 
don't think there's any orchestras in in
London<00:01:47.900> that<00:01:48.110> could<00:01:48.350> survive<00:01:48.710> only<00:01:49.520> from

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
London that could survive only from

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.850 
London that could survive only from
playing<00:01:50.270> in<00:01:50.420> London<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:50.899> from<00:01:51.320> that<00:01:51.350> point<00:01:51.649> of

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
playing in London so from that point of

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.380 
playing in London so from that point of
view<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.100> soaring<00:01:52.550> is<00:01:52.670> very<00:01:52.880> important

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
view that soaring is very important

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.850 
view that soaring is very important
obviously<00:01:53.810> it's<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:54.050> big<00:01:54.380> source<00:01:54.619> of<00:01:54.740> income

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
obviously it's a big source of income

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.800 
obviously it's a big source of income
for<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.369> orchestra<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:55.970> therefore<00:01:56.300> for<00:01:56.539> the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
for the orchestra and therefore for the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.389 
for the orchestra and therefore for the

the really important thing about sewing

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.570 
the really important thing about sewing
