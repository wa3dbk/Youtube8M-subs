00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:13.940
 Connecting the main features of the new product rotational torque meter utm 2 series of uni pulse method 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:18.949
 We introduce the use case 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:23.990
 A rotational torque meter is a sensor to measure the force that the shaft twists 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:28.210
 Not only evaluation and shipping inspection such as opening and closing of water or engine doorknob or key 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:33.790
 It can be applied to output control of devices and robots 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:37.420
 The biggest attraction of utm 2 is its ultra-compact and lightweight compared to conventional products 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:41.860
 The size is a very small size that fits in the palm of your hand 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.379
 Also because the action does not use a slip ring like a conventional torque meter 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.200
 Not only is maintenance unnecessary 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:51.160
 When automating small sensory test even initial registration 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:57.280
 There are merits such as the equipment can be miniaturized 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:01:00.070
 It is impossible to detect the registration by using the USSR gauge on the axis of the signal processing circuit. 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.269
 Realized highly accurate measurement 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.050
 Measurement accuracy in Hisseru cis nonlinearity repeated production 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:12.480
 It is 0.03% 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:15.690
 Maximum speed is 25,000 rotation sleep ring for contactless Denso no 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:21.720
 There is only a bearing between the shaft and the body 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:25.350
 The registration in the early winter is small and the small motor does not disturb the measurement during the test. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.100
 Furthermore utm 2 should be analog 1khz 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:35.100
 High-speed response of the sampling frequency 6khz 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:40.200
 It can be used not only for monitoring high-speed phenomena but also for torque feedback 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.189
 It can withstand 500% overload, so it is safe against irregular overload. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.189
 Available 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.520

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:02.740
 Measurement is possible to a large torque for testing such as steering 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:07.990
 We will explain the installation and connection of utm 2 series 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:13.400
 Due to its small size and light weight, the sensor only needs to mount the coupling back between the axes 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:18.530
 Installation adjustment can be easily done by not fixing the main body 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.370
 Let's take a look at the actual installation First, adjust the axes of the device to be installed in advance.
