00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.429 

so<00:00:00.359> I<00:00:00.510> was<00:00:00.630> having<00:00:00.840> some<00:00:00.960> troubles<00:00:01.290> with<00:00:01.350> my

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
so I was having some troubles with my

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.740 
so I was having some troubles with my
old<00:00:01.860> super<00:00:02.520> monitor<00:00:02.909> here<00:00:03.120> this<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.540> first

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
old super monitor here this is the first

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.300 
old super monitor here this is the first
monitor<00:00:04.110> ever<00:00:04.319> done<00:00:04.470> it<00:00:04.799> was<00:00:04.890> back<00:00:05.100> when

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
monitor ever done it was back when

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.639 
monitor ever done it was back when
everyone<00:00:05.549> was<00:00:05.700> using<00:00:06.000> CRT<00:00:06.540> monitors<00:00:06.870> but

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
everyone was using CRT monitors but

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.830 
everyone was using CRT monitors but
recently<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:08.849> has<00:00:09.030> been<00:00:09.269> getting<00:00:09.660> very

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
recently it has been getting very

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.110 
recently it has been getting very
staticky<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:10.980> there's<00:00:11.160> been<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> lot<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.550> lines

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
staticky and there's been a lot of lines

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.299 
staticky and there's been a lot of lines
going<00:00:12.509> through<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.139> currently<00:00:13.799> have<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.190> off

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
going through it I currently have it off

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.890 
going through it I currently have it off
but<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.639> tracked<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.210> down<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.660> turned<00:00:15.839> out

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
but I tracked it down and it turned out

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.930 
but I tracked it down and it turned out
to<00:00:16.049> be<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.289> power<00:00:16.920> supply<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.760> was

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
to be the power supply for it was

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.540 
to be the power supply for it was
starting<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.510> go<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:19.020> was<00:00:19.170> getting<00:00:20.070> really<00:00:20.130> hot

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
starting to go it was getting really hot

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.630 
starting to go it was getting really hot
and<00:00:20.699> making<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.359> lot<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.720> buzzing<00:00:22.350> noises<00:00:22.609> so<00:00:23.609> I

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
and making a lot of buzzing noises so I

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.929 
and making a lot of buzzing noises so I
decided<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.150> stop<00:00:24.300> using<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.699> damn<00:00:26.699> cool

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
decided to stop using but that damn cool

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.179 
decided to stop using but that damn cool
with<00:00:27.150> an<00:00:27.240> alternative<00:00:27.720> solution<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.410> continue

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
with an alternative solution to continue

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.620 
with an alternative solution to continue
using<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.580> monitor<00:00:30.000> now<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.359> don't<00:00:30.539> have

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
using this monitor now that I don't have

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.450 
using this monitor now that I don't have
a<00:00:30.689> dedicated<00:00:31.199> power<00:00:31.619> supply<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:31.980> it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
a dedicated power supply for it

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.700 
a dedicated power supply for it
so<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> virtual<00:00:34.079> power<00:00:34.380> supply

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
so this is the virtual power supply

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.569 
so this is the virtual power supply
think<00:00:35.040> I've<00:00:35.130> cracked<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.700> them<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:38.250> just

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
think I've cracked it with them and just

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.160 
think I've cracked it with them and just
disconnected<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.989> original<00:00:41.270> hook<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.450> and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
disconnected the original hook up and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.670 
disconnected the original hook up and
I'm<00:00:43.350> actually<00:00:43.610> soldering<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.180> is

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
I'm actually soldering it in to is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.080 
I'm actually soldering it in to is
modular<00:00:46.680> hook<00:00:46.860> up<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.460> power<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
modular hook up so I can power it

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.819 
modular hook up so I can power it
directly<00:00:48.480> from<00:00:48.600> my<00:00:48.960> computer<00:00:49.200> power<00:00:49.500> supply

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
directly from my computer power supply

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.250 
directly from my computer power supply
using<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.309> 12<00:00:50.550> volt<00:00:50.760> supply<00:00:51.110> seeing<00:00:52.110> this

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
using the 12 volt supply seeing this

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.279 
using the 12 volt supply seeing this
this<00:00:53.190> takes<00:00:53.460> 12<00:00:54.000> volts<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.899> power<00:00:55.140> supply

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
this takes 12 volts in a power supply

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:17.990 
this takes 12 volts in a power supply
regular<00:00:55.860> ATX<00:00:56.730> power<00:00:57.090> supply<00:00:57.420> has<00:00:57.660> 12<00:00:58.020> volts

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.730 

well<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.720> certainly<00:01:18.900> isn't<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> cleanest

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
well it certainly isn't the cleanest

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.110 
well it certainly isn't the cleanest
thing<00:01:19.890> I've<00:01:20.010> ever<00:01:20.100> seen<00:01:20.370> but<00:01:20.610> it'll<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
thing I've ever seen but it'll get the

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.780 
thing I've ever seen but it'll get the
job<00:01:21.150> done<00:01:22.490> finish<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.730> a<00:01:23.880> bit<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> tape

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
job done finish it up with a bit of tape

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.670 
job done finish it up with a bit of tape
there<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:27.090> go<00:01:28.790> that<00:01:29.790> should<00:01:29.820> work<00:01:30.180> nicely<00:01:30.680> so

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
there we go that should work nicely so

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.360 
there we go that should work nicely so
I've<00:01:32.010> got<00:01:32.160> my<00:01:32.280> module<00:01:32.670> hooked<00:01:33.330> into<00:01:33.510> this

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
I've got my module hooked into this

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:46.760 
I've got my module hooked into this
modular<00:01:35.840> power<00:01:36.840> supply<00:01:37.190> hookup<00:01:40.550> play<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:45.770> now

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
modular power supply hookup play it now

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
modular power supply hookup play it now
this<00:01:46.980> has<00:01:47.250> active<00:01:47.820> power<00:01:48.120> on<00:01:48.300> it<00:01:48.450> 12<00:01:49.350> volts<00:01:49.790> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
this has active power on it 12 volts the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.469 
this has active power on it 12 volts the
rail<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> power<00:01:51.660> supply<00:01:51.840> has<00:01:52.700> 62<00:01:53.700> amps

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
rail on the power supply has 62 amps

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
rail on the power supply has 62 amps
which<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.900> more<00:01:55.170> than<00:01:55.530> enough<00:01:55.830> for<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.070> 15s

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
which is more than enough for the 15s

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.660 
which is more than enough for the 15s
required<00:01:57.090> or<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.420> monitor<00:01:58.190> so<00:01:59.190> let's<00:01:59.400> just

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
required or the monitor so let's just

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.749 
required or the monitor so let's just
see<00:01:59.910> well<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.180> works<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.770> powered<00:02:05.490> by

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
see well it works and it is powered by

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.449 
see well it works and it is powered by
empowering<00:02:06.920> my<00:02:07.920> monitor<00:02:08.660> with<00:02:09.660> my<00:02:09.869> computer

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
empowering my monitor with my computer

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.310 
empowering my monitor with my computer
this<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.640> awesome<00:02:12.090> there<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.840> no<00:02:13.140> noise

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
this is awesome there is no noise

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.150 
this is awesome there is no noise
whatsoever

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
whatsoever

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.920 
whatsoever
fortunately<00:02:14.790> do<00:02:14.910> not<00:02:15.060> take<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.240> video<00:02:15.420> clip<00:02:15.750> of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
fortunately do not take a video clip of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.360 
fortunately do not take a video clip of
when<00:02:16.080> there<00:02:16.290> was<00:02:16.440> noise<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:16.920> basically<00:02:17.160> there

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
when there was noise but basically there

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.770 
when there was noise but basically there
would<00:02:17.430> be<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.550> bunch<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.820> lines<00:02:18.090> going<00:02:18.270> for<00:02:18.660> us

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
would be a bunch of lines going for us

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.920 
would be a bunch of lines going for us
and<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.500> had<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> bit<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.950> hump<00:02:20.600> now<00:02:21.600> it's<00:02:21.780> all

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
and I had a bit of a hump now it's all

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.850 
and I had a bit of a hump now it's all
closed<00:02:22.200> up<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.640> got<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:25.140> modular

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
closed up and I just got the modular

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.690 
closed up and I just got the modular
coming<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.820> this<00:02:27.380> liquid<00:02:28.380> cooling<00:02:28.980> hole<00:02:29.430> and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
coming to this liquid cooling hole and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.430 
coming to this liquid cooling hole and
going<00:02:30.420> into<00:02:30.600> my<00:02:30.690> little<00:02:30.930> custom<00:02:31.530> adapter<00:02:33.440> so

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
going into my little custom adapter so
