00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
switch over to the upper looper take

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:06.859 
switch over to the upper looper take
your<00:00:55.440> thread<00:00:56.870> make<00:00:57.870> sure<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.289> down<00:00:58.559> into<00:01:05.869> to

your thread make sure it's down into to
the<00:01:07.049> thread<00:01:07.409> guides<00:01:09.200> same<00:01:10.200> thing<00:01:10.560> you'll<00:01:11.310> put

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the thread guides same thing you'll put

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.410 
the thread guides same thing you'll put
it<00:01:11.670> down<00:01:11.909> into<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.540> threading<00:01:13.409> port<00:01:14.420> make

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
it down into the threading port make

here's your two threads on the bottom
then<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.040> will<00:01:23.400> disengage<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.720> threading

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
then you will disengage the threading

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.780 
then you will disengage the threading
system<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> bottom<00:01:28.350> now<00:01:29.340> you'll<00:01:29.549> rotate

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
system for the bottom now you'll rotate

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.690 
system for the bottom now you'll rotate
the<00:01:30.180> wheel<00:01:30.420> two<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> green<00:01:31.470> marks<00:01:32.310> match

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the wheel two of the green marks match

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.300 
the wheel two of the green marks match
on<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.479> side<00:01:33.920> take<00:01:34.920> your<00:01:34.950> upper<00:01:35.400> thread<00:01:37.310> down

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
on the side take your upper thread down

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.050 
on the side take your upper thread down
into<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> thread<00:01:39.090> guides<00:01:40.640> around<00:01:41.640> these<00:01:41.820> two

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060
