00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.160
 hi he knows look today i have a back 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.509
 to school look for you and I have to 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.240
 I honestly say it's super 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.949
 found it hard to back this cool crowds 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.060
 I really want to do that because I do 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.100
 just know he is boy of yours 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.539
 still go to school and that is anyway 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.439
 always exciting the first school days 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.279
 because yes what do you put on who are you in 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.230
 the class 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.210
 which teachers do you get and so on 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.989
 and so on and yet a kind of impression that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.010
 you that you make with people but I found 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.719
 it's super awkward and I will just 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.379
 explain why I am very difficult 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.719
 found 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.579
 first because I don't know what you do 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.739
 is going to do next school year 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.640
 maybe you will go to the first year 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.739
 super exciting a whole new school 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.570
 whole new class whole new way of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.430
 to learn 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.500
 yes that's just very exciting 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.120
 very nice too if you go to the first year 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.219
 is going to enjoy especially because it is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.140
 was really a fun time for me Quincy 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.149
 a very nice time but maybe 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.129
 do you go to the second third I fourth 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.619
 don't know and you know the school okay you 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.049
 the children shed here 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.979
 yes that teenagers kids yes you 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.600
 you already know classmates and yes 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.430
 different again if you take a shot 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.960
 but maybe nobody is high 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.670
 school but go grandma 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.229
 continuing education mbo hbo and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.330
 university i do n't know 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.040
 then the video is very different again 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.409
 exciting new school new new 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.180
 people and yes for every phase in you 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.670
 miss living in my carry case 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.460
 other makeup in group 8 I wore 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.110
 at most on a special day whatever 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.960
 mascara 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.430
 but when I went to the bridge class wore 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.220
 I might just like something more 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.840
 eye shadow the bee or one or one and such 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.310
 transparent lip gloss was all about him 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.990
 hip that I tour 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.890
 but by the time I go to MBO 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.009
 went back a bit more though I already have 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.530
 my eyebrows thick eyeshadow mascara 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.560
 thick hand lines near my eyes and such 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.719
 and that is also a very different thing you 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.030
 and now I graduated and I 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:13.410
 work now I just wear a lot of makeup 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.260
 the past 3 3 years I think I do too 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.239
 just powder and blush and I enjoy too 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.239
 very much like makeup to do that 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.590
 I wear crown a little more makeup and that 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.730
 has also been over time 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.170
 changed 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.150
 And that's why I find it difficult to 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.069
 to make a look because I don't know if 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.410
 you have a mascara barrel or that you just 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.170
 is on the eyebrow phase or that you already 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.959
 floor faze does so found it there too 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.450
 difficult because I wanted to say 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.870
 you always only wear maaskade 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.280
 also wear it on your first day of school 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.220
 you never wear foundation go this too 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.959
 please don't do the most important thing 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.540
 is on your first day of school that you are mine 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.040
 foot feels in what you wear in what you put on 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.250
 you have to face what you do to your hair 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.170
 so you always walk in one 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.110
 jogging pants go in jogging pants 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.170
 me is the school day you always lay you 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.300
 loose her then wear loose and just do it 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.260
 where you fill in and I can do that 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.019
 not determine for you 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.879
 so go there myself get out of that roll 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.530
 I feel comfortable and because in the first 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.849
 school day you just have to be fine for you 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.209
 must be at ease for the and you must not 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.190
 to sit 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.720
 oh i have a skirt nice to have chips 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.970
 can but also year to eye see nobody 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.319
 my underpants and so on and so forth 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.799
 do something about me he has level that 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.000
 I really want to give in and I already have it 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.890
 once thought about not at all 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.360
 look but I do like this look 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.319
 I have filmed that now for you 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.030
 and this is more kind of inspiration i 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.200
 have used cheap products because of me 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.019
 know that when you go to school 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.470
 you don't have much money to spend yet 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.400
 So 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.010
 little products are always nice and 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.430
 yeah just do what you want now i really 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.519
 because I have my own style 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.530

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.280

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.400

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.260
 world in each other 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.200
 everyone is fun if they are themselves 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.660
 So please go on first school day 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.790
 to school as yourself where you feel now 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.139
 and I really just want to say that 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.540
 now let's start with the look i have 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.400
 would wear if i go to school again 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.100
 i start the day with my concealer 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.750
 bags and my pimples and something else 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.520
 you also get more coverage 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.169
 a little bibi cream 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.120
 this is from maybelline but use it 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.770
 the one you want then I want the whole 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.090
 finished with the catrice powder and he continued 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.740
 to the eyebrows do not use to 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.560
 catrice powder and 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.760
 cupboard for nice budget then go 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.919
 we move on to the eye look is what 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.660
 eye shadow base and then I put my 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.540
 arcade arc with a slightly darker one 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.960
 color and my moving eyelid with a 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.550
 pretty yes shimmery 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.410
 light color to give some depth 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:06.090
 to eyeliner and of course can 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.520
 mascara also not missing so then think 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.200
 I apply two coats 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.060
 then we continue to the blush and the 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.640
 highlighter I use is a blush of 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.080
 the action very cheap and very beautiful and 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.479
 highlighter of the elp again whole 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.590
 cheap and very beautiful and then just a little 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.720
 in my eyebrows 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.970
 so a place you have to bring for 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.640
 my lips i use this labello this one 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.380
 is great with great taste 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.390
 we move on to her brush 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.130
 my hair and I make a divorce and 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.660
 then i just make a simple one 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.090
 braid you can't see because I have 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.700
 I didn't film well but I think so 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.229
 you know how to braid 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.940
 I lips tight so that it is the 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.050
 stays in place all day and then 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.990
 set 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.870
 the complete look then we go further 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.669
 to the outfit and for the outfit I would 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.960
 advise you to go the day before 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.640
 think of what you want because on it 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.960
 moment itself 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.490
 you might know it when you then 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.930
 want to figure out what you want to do that 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.300
 you have nothing to do if you have the 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.210
 look at what you do the day before 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.680
 wanting that saves a lot 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.070
 I'll get you a simple top with the 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.350
 just kimono and the jeans 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.390
 simple and comfortable and the condition is nice 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.590
 and I feel good about them 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.330
 most important 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.010
 and that you also own the night before 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.630
 doing is packing your bag 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.730
 so that you have everything with you and that is 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.140
 the easiest way to do that quietly 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.370
 don't forget it you eat and you drink 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.940
 of course 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.940
 and then we can go
