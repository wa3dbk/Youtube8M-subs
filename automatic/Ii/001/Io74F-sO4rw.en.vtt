screenshot of the temps and all that
stuff<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.770> well<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.729> want<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
stuff here as well but I just want to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480 
stuff here as well but I just want to
show<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> chiller<00:01:22.560> set<00:01:22.979> at<00:01:23.189> about

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
show you I have the chiller set at about

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.480 
show you I have the chiller set at about
32<00:01:24.390> degrees<00:01:24.960> which<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.740> lowest<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.220> goes

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
32 degrees which is the lowest that goes

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.270 
32 degrees which is the lowest that goes
because<00:01:26.850> obviously<00:01:27.270> that's<00:01:27.810> freezing<00:01:28.280> so

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
because obviously that's freezing so

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.490 
because obviously that's freezing so
it'll<00:01:29.700> actually<00:01:29.790> shut<00:01:30.299> off<00:01:30.509> once<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.049> gets<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it'll actually shut off once it gets the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.820 
it'll actually shut off once it gets the
coolant<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> 32<00:01:32.790> degrees

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
coolant to 32 degrees

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.980 
coolant to 32 degrees
and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.100> it'll<00:01:35.280> cycle<00:01:35.640> back<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.300> once<00:01:36.750> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
and then it'll cycle back on once it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.090 
and then it'll cycle back on once it
goes<00:01:37.200> above<00:01:37.620> that<00:01:37.680> 32<00:01:38.580> degree<00:01:38.940> mark<00:01:40.100> but

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
goes above that 32 degree mark but

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.380 
goes above that 32 degree mark but
that's<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.490> chiller<00:01:41.790> right<00:01:42.300> there<00:01:42.770> dropping

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
that's the chiller right there dropping

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.430 
that's the chiller right there dropping
32<00:01:45.390> degrees<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.110> dropping<00:01:46.230> as<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:47.010> see

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
32 degrees and dropping as you can see

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.290 
32 degrees and dropping as you can see
this<00:01:49.440> is<00:01:49.620> kind<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.950> my<00:01:50.100> setup<00:01:50.460> here<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.150> know

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
this is kind of my setup here you know

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.410 
this is kind of my setup here you know
you<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.690> use<00:01:51.870> it<00:01:51.900> however<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:53.420> this

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
you can use it however you like but this

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.610 
you can use it however you like but this
is<00:01:54.600> kind<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.380> mine<00:01:55.650> set<00:01:56.010> up<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:58.320> it'll

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
is kind of I have mine set up and it'll

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.550 
is kind of I have mine set up and it'll
actually<00:01:58.910> it'll<00:01:59.910> actually<00:02:00.300> build

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
actually it'll actually build

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.870 
actually it'll actually build
condensation<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.920> water<00:02:02.190> block<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.820> know

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
condensation on that water block I know

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.880 
condensation on that water block I know
it<00:02:03.090> might<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.270> hard<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.690> see<00:02:03.900> in<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.170> video<00:02:04.290> but

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
it might be hard to see in the video but

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.230 
it might be hard to see in the video but
I<00:02:05.210> am<00:02:06.210> cooling<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.930> graphic<00:02:07.410> card<00:02:07.620> as<00:02:07.890> well

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
I am cooling the graphic card as well

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.669 
I am cooling the graphic card as well
that's<00:02:09.240> where<00:02:09.510> the<00:02:09.630> two<00:02:09.810> lines<00:02:10.080> come<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
that's where the two lines come in the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.510 
that's where the two lines come in the
back<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.100> PC<00:02:11.520> there<00:02:12.260> so<00:02:13.260> that's<00:02:13.680> that's<00:02:14.370> my

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
temperatures that focuses in there let's

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.490 
temperatures that focuses in there let's
see<00:02:20.340> we're<00:02:20.580> at<00:02:20.760> uh<00:02:20.790> well<00:02:21.540> about<00:02:21.990> zero<00:02:22.440> degrees

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
see we're at uh well about zero degrees

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.230 
see we're at uh well about zero degrees
on<00:02:23.130> one<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.490> cores<00:02:23.790> Celsius<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.610> as<00:02:27.060> you

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
on one of the cores Celsius and as you

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.430 
on one of the cores Celsius and as you
can<00:02:27.390> see<00:02:27.450> there<00:02:28.550> there's<00:02:29.550> my<00:02:29.910> detailed<00:02:30.450> specs

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
can see there there's my detailed specs

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.550 
can see there there's my detailed specs
on<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.430> processor<00:02:34.130> again<00:02:35.130> at

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
on the processor again at

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.520 
on the processor again at
4.4<00:02:38.060> gigahertz

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.170 

and<00:02:46.680> keeps<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.830> pretty<00:02:48.040> cold<00:02:48.310> as<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:48.760> can<00:02:48.940> see

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
and keeps it pretty cold as you can see

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.760 
and keeps it pretty cold as you can see
also<00:02:50.700> let's<00:02:51.700> see<00:02:51.940> my<00:02:52.180> GPUs<00:02:52.960> current

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
also let's see my GPUs current

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.790 
also let's see my GPUs current
temperature<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.520> 13<00:02:55.390> degrees<00:02:55.840> Celsius<00:02:56.500> on<00:02:56.680> the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
temperature is 13 degrees Celsius on the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.610 
temperature is 13 degrees Celsius on the
GPU<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.690> it's<00:02:58.990> keeping<00:02:59.320> a<00:02:59.440> GPU<00:03:00.240> GTX<00:03:01.240> 295<00:03:01.620> quad

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620
