00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.289
 another that also yellow as josephine baker and you too in the car you have to be 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:22.949
 only 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.579
 an exceptional impact on the brothers' dashboard started 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.380
 music you will have in your blood like all creatures 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.280
 if there is a god I swear that he is a musician who writes our lives are sports 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.030
 everyone has his melody and his premises to carry inside for years 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.460
 there are believed to be quiet as a song 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.570
 easy to learn to predict 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.570
 with love rhymes heart the flowers of sanremo 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.030
 there are symphonic existences orchestra strings 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.790

 they have become of great adagi long notes cosimo motion 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.290
 click and in the end when something happens they turn into an escape 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.290
 pressing with an almost raving rhythm 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.420
 there are travelers who look like soft-lit piano bars 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.170
 here instead inside they hide a virtuosity that makes an impression to know 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.580
 to recognize 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.900
 there are pivotal lives of the third millennium 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.610
 buttons like a heart 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.670
 yet full of emptiness 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.179
 low strokes in the stomach such as a pain if I can get closer 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.600
 and then there are the ears 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.860
 my readings 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.540
 what is needed and that is enough to understand 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.630
 put yourself in silence I go out 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.630
 it may be that out there or in here inside 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.260
 via passing the music
