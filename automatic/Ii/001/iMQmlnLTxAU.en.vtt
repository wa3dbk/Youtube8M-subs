00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.890 
it's because that's what they were like
back<00:01:28.550> then<00:01:28.760> and<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:28.970> is<00:01:29.030> kind<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.420> more<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.660> it

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
back then and this is kind of more of it

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.740 
back then and this is kind of more of it
I'm<00:01:30.410> a<00:01:30.470> similar<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.670> runs<00:01:31.910> on<00:01:32.030> supply<00:01:32.450> lines

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
I'm a similar it runs on supply lines

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.300 
I'm a similar it runs on supply lines
and<00:01:32.900> it's<00:01:33.080> quite<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.410> bit<00:01:33.620> different<00:01:33.650> from<00:01:34.040> any

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
and it's quite a bit different from any

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.770 
and it's quite a bit different from any
game<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:34.550> we<00:01:34.790> used<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.090> in<00:01:35.330> that<00:01:35.480> there<00:01:35.660> is<00:01:35.750> a

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
huge generals aspect to it as well as

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.450 
huge generals aspect to it as well as
the<00:01:38.480> hero<00:01:38.750> side<00:01:39.140> which<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.500> FPS<00:01:40.070> side<00:01:40.310> of
