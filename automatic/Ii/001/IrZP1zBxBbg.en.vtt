00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.340
 hello, i 'm ricardo trindade teacher 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.400
 University of SÃ£o Paulo and works with 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.170
 a pallium magnetism the use of magnetism 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.900
 was of great use to the large 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.090
 Navigating the compass allows you to cross 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.400
 oceans security and was instrumental 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.009
 for the expansion of Western society 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.499
 but at the same time that the 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.999
 browsers leave another legacy that 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.839
 are the magnetic field measurements of the 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.909
 past 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.550
 however to uncover the variations 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:33.829
 of the countryside before the great navigations 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.910
 when we do not have measures of the 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.920
 browsers 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.059
 We study rocks and artifacts. 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.739
 archaeological 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.809
 because the rocks and some materials 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.300
 both in archaeological and small 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.969
 quantities of rock magnetic material 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.260
 forms when a date is ceramic fact 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.000
 made 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.289
 this mineral this magnetism 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.460
 parallel to the magnetic field 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.550
 environment 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.460
 so we asked for the magnetism of rocks 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.769
 ceramics, we can infer which 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.199
 direction of the magnetic field of the past 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.500
 beyond the direction of the magnetic field 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.960
 we can also estimate its magnitude 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.119
 because the intensity of the magnetization 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.100
 of the rocks as the ceramic artifacts 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.509
 is directly proportional to the intensity 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.850
 of the environment field 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.460
 this discovery was worth the Nobel Prize for 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.710
 physics to french scientist daniel 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.799
 he showed that the capacity of the material 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.720
 in acquiring the magnetism depends 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.799
 directly from the competition between two 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.979
 energies 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.719
 the thermal energy magnetic energy in 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.060
 high temperatures inside the earth 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.549
 or even inside a ceramic kiln 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.860
 thermal energy wins and rock does not 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.479
 Vanessa shows Corinthians already 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.329
 when rocks or ceramics are the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.100
 created the magnetic energy wins the 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.890
 material can remain magnetized by 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.509
 thousands or even millions of years 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.210
 the availability of data for 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.590
 and magnetic arches depends on the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.630
 history of each region 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.630
 its geological history or history of 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.850
 occupation of your territory europe and asia 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.619
 for example has an extensive record 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.180
 that makes it possible to 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.660
 reconstruct the evaluation of the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.910
 field from a thousand students before Christ 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.190
 in Brazil, the research group and the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.349
 magnetism have reconstructed changes 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.100
 of the Earth's magnetic field using both 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.350
 rock 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.870
 archaeological artifacts our 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.610
 surveys cover all of South America 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.830
 the work involves the collection of samples 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.750
 in the field and these samples should be 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.340
 marked and oriented according to the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.920
 earth magnetic north 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.170
 then each show taken to the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.970
 laboratory your measurement move 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.770
 inside a special room 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.850
 completely isolated in the magnetic field 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.320
 terrestrial 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.770
 this to avoid interference from 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.770
 measures 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.760
 the equipment we use today and the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.010
 working conditions we have in our 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.990
 laboratory are much more modern and 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.790
 are much more efficient than those 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.100
 used by pioneers for magnetism 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.080
 the first magnetic measurements in 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.420
 rocks were made possible by 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.320
 professor blackhat seo magnetometers 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.360
 tactical 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.460
 this consists of a rather 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.860
 ingenious bar file and mirrors 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.990
 with this equipment group in cambridge 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.970
 in england began to study rocks 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.710
 around the world trying to trace the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.530
 paths the continents 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.750
 at the time that in the 50's still do not know 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.520
 if the continents were fixed that is if 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.400
 moved as forecasted theory of tectonics 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.560
 well plates with bags help 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.370
 browsers in the past to find your 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.260
 way 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.270
 the magnetism of our ancients could 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.490
 show the way of the continents 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.960
 so he could demonstrate that in the 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.100
 past South America and Africa 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.920
 were together 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.720
 australia were still neighbors and 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.080
 at that time you could even travel from 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.310
 car from europe north america 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.990
 today we continue the work 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.970
 started with the group the black hat 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.010
 we are discovering what the face of the 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.750
 land from its earliest days to four 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.940
 billion years when the continents 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.100
 were formed when the earth's core 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.510
 has come into existence and since when 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.510
 planet has a magnetic field
