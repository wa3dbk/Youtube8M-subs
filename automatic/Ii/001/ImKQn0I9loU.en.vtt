00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.890 
embedded into the thread you need to get
rid<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.440> otherwise<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:27.690> can't

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
rid of that to it otherwise you can't

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.110 
rid of that to it otherwise you can't
rectangle<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.620> bracelet<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.790> they're<00:02:29.940> just

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
rectangle a bracelet and they're just

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.350 
rectangle a bracelet and they're just
way<00:02:30.299> too<00:02:30.360> special<00:02:30.900> for<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.380> happen<00:02:31.560> just

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
way too special for that to happen just

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.870 
way too special for that to happen just
a<00:02:33.360> little<00:02:33.599> bit<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.840> life<00:02:34.019> brush<00:02:34.680> now<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.760> can

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
a little bit of a life brush now you can

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.520 
a little bit of a life brush now you can
see<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.329> solution<00:02:37.099> it's<00:02:38.099> just<00:02:39.049> turning<00:02:40.049> dirty

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
see the solution it's just turning dirty

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.119 
see the solution it's just turning dirty
as<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:42.660> say<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.079> my<00:02:43.260> mom's<00:02:43.470> bracelet<00:02:43.829> so

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
as I say this is my mom's bracelet so

00:02:44.129 --> 00:04:13.400 
as I say this is my mom's bracelet so
she's<00:02:44.310> just<00:02:44.340> got<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:59.269> brush<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:12.349> well<00:04:11.930> now<00:04:12.930> I'm

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
she's just got to brush it well now I'm

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.129 
she's just got to brush it well now I'm
going<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.650> click<00:04:14.340> race<00:04:14.639> and<00:04:15.180> then<00:04:15.870> what<00:04:16.019> I'll

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
going to click race and then what I'll

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.580 
going to click race and then what I'll
do<00:04:16.259> is<00:04:16.289> I'll<00:04:16.500> tip<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.769> solution<00:04:17.310> into<00:04:17.549> the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
do is I'll tip the solution into the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.199 
do is I'll tip the solution into the
tissue<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:20.009> then<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.310> can<00:04:20.459> get<00:04:20.609> an<00:04:20.729> idea<00:04:21.090> of

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
tissue so then you can get an idea of

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.499 
tissue so then you can get an idea of
how<00:04:21.539> much<00:04:21.780> do<00:04:22.669> you<00:04:23.669> get<00:04:23.820> out<00:04:23.970> of<00:04:24.000> your<00:04:24.120> bracelet

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
how much do you get out of your bracelet

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:25.850 
how much do you get out of your bracelet
even<00:04:24.750> when<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:24.900> think<00:04:25.050> it's<00:04:25.229> cleaning<00:04:25.530> and

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
even when you think it's cleaning and

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.200 
even when you think it's cleaning and
she<00:04:26.039> you<00:04:26.220> can<00:04:26.340> see<00:04:26.490> my<00:04:26.610> bench<00:04:26.880> I've<00:04:27.030> actually

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
she you can see my bench I've actually

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.969 
she you can see my bench I've actually
got<00:04:27.449> dirt<00:04:27.660> particles<00:04:28.139> all<00:04:28.440> over<00:04:28.740> right<00:04:28.800> now

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
got dirt particles all over right now

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.439 
got dirt particles all over right now
just<00:04:29.250> from<00:04:29.430> giving<00:04:29.669> it<00:04:29.759> a<00:04:29.820> slight<00:04:30.180> brush

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
just from giving it a slight brush

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:51.579 
just from giving it a slight brush
though<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:32.460> what<00:04:32.610> I'm<00:04:32.699> going<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.880> do

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:59.539 

now<00:04:57.959> it<00:04:58.169> doesn't<00:04:58.349> leave<00:04:58.589> a<00:04:58.649> portion<00:04:58.889> off<00:04:59.219> so<00:04:59.399> we

actually just show you how Jersey this

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.759 
actually just show you how Jersey this
solution<00:05:22.769> comes<00:05:23.039> up<00:05:24.019> so<00:05:25.019> much<00:05:25.139> tap<00:05:25.379> it<00:05:25.529> into<00:05:25.649> a

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:25.769 
solution comes up so much tap it into a

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:33.559 
solution comes up so much tap it into a
tissue<00:05:31.249> our<00:05:32.249> honey<00:05:32.519> probably<00:05:32.819> uses<00:05:33.149> solution

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 
tissue our honey probably uses solution

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.199 
tissue our honey probably uses solution
once<00:05:33.809> because<00:05:34.139> I<00:05:34.550> don't<00:05:35.550> know<00:05:35.610> if<00:05:35.729> you<00:05:35.849> can<00:05:35.999> see

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:36.209 
once because I don't know if you can see

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:38.629 
once because I don't know if you can see
in<00:05:36.360> there<00:05:36.509> but<00:05:36.659> there's<00:05:36.809> still<00:05:37.079> all<00:05:37.439> dirt<00:05:37.739> just

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
in there but there's still all dirt just

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:59.559 
in there but there's still all dirt just
sitting<00:05:38.969> in<00:05:39.149> the<00:05:39.239> bottom<00:05:39.569> of<00:05:39.689> that<00:05:39.839> container

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:03.110 

with<00:06:00.569> me<00:06:01.130> you<00:06:02.130> can<00:06:02.250> as<00:06:02.370> you<00:06:02.400> see<00:06:02.669> lumps<00:06:02.910> of<00:06:03.090> dirt

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
with me you can as you see lumps of dirt

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.090 
with me you can as you see lumps of dirt
that<00:06:03.330> have<00:06:03.930> come<00:06:04.199> out<00:06:04.229> I<00:06:04.410> don't<00:06:04.530> have<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:04.949> come

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
that have come out I don't have to come

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.610 
that have come out I don't have to come
to<00:06:05.130> be<00:06:05.250> able<00:06:05.370> to<00:06:05.580> see<00:06:05.729> them<00:06:05.910> in<00:06:06.060> this<00:06:06.440> but<00:06:07.440> this

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
to be able to see them in this but this

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.960 
to be able to see them in this but this
is<00:06:07.800> a<00:06:07.830> bracelet<00:06:08.310> that<00:06:08.340> my<00:06:08.580> mother<00:06:08.819> actually

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
is a bracelet that my mother actually

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.920 
is a bracelet that my mother actually
thought<00:06:09.300> was<00:06:09.449> clean<00:06:11.360> can<00:06:12.360> you<00:06:12.389> see<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:12.750> dirt

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
thought was clean can you see the dirt

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.580 
thought was clean can you see the dirt
on<00:06:13.110> that<00:06:14.479> you<00:06:15.479> can<00:06:15.630> actually<00:06:15.750> see<00:06:16.169> running

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
on that you can actually see running

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.379 
on that you can actually see running
chunks<00:06:17.099> but<00:06:17.220> running<00:06:17.400> down<00:06:17.669> my<00:06:17.699> bed<00:06:18.180> she's

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
chunks but running down my bed she's

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:19.400 
chunks but running down my bed she's
covered<00:06:18.810> with<00:06:18.960> it

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
covered with it

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.070 
covered with it
and<00:06:20.069> I<00:06:20.130> could<00:06:20.310> probably<00:06:20.729> stand<00:06:21.090> again<00:06:21.539> but<00:06:21.900> the

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
and I could probably stand again but the

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.710 
and I could probably stand again but the
solution<00:06:22.680> that<00:06:22.800> was<00:06:22.919> once<00:06:23.190> why<00:06:23.460> is<00:06:23.849> now<00:06:24.389> but

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
solution that was once why is now but

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.790 
solution that was once why is now but
dirty<00:06:26.720> muddy<00:06:27.720> color<00:06:27.990> I<00:06:28.080> can<00:06:28.229> show<00:06:28.470> you<00:06:28.530> there

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
dirty muddy color I can show you there

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.010 
dirty muddy color I can show you there
what<00:06:29.280> it<00:06:29.400> looks<00:06:29.580> like<00:06:29.819> so<00:06:30.419> there<00:06:30.569> just<00:06:30.750> goes<00:06:30.900> to

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
what it looks like so there just goes to
