is a 760 not a 760 m how in the hell do
they<00:01:55.510> fit<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:56.370> 7/16<00:01:57.370> here<00:01:57.550> this<00:01:57.700> is<00:01:57.760> not<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.940> 760<00:01:58.510> m

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
they fit a 7/16 here this is not a 760 m

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.570 
they fit a 7/16 here this is not a 760 m
I<00:01:58.840> don't<00:01:59.260> know<00:01:59.350> I<00:01:59.530> asked<00:01:59.979> him<00:02:00.070> like<00:02:00.190> five<00:02:00.369> times

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
I don't know I asked him like five times

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
he's like no dude it's a real 760 so

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.310 
he's like no dude it's a real 760 so
that<00:02:03.729> is<00:02:03.940> crazy<00:02:04.119> there's<00:02:04.450> also<00:02:04.540> MDOT<00:02:04.960> -<00:02:05.140> and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
that is crazy there's also MDOT - and

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.840 
that is crazy there's also MDOT - and
there's<00:02:05.440> one<00:02:05.619> SATA<00:02:06.040> port<00:02:06.280> so<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.400> can<00:02:06.550> expand

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
there's one SATA port so you can expand

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.400 
there's one SATA port so you can expand
that<00:02:06.880> way<00:02:07.180> but<00:02:07.330> right<00:02:07.420> now<00:02:07.540> there's<00:02:07.720> an<00:02:07.780> m2<00:02:08.170> SSD

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
that way but right now there's an m2 SSD

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.830 
that way but right now there's an m2 SSD
in<00:02:08.709> here<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.220> then<00:02:09.700> of<00:02:09.820> course<00:02:10.030> it's<00:02:10.209> even<00:02:10.630> got

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
in here and then of course it's even got

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.170 
in here and then of course it's even got
Wireless<00:02:11.610> everything<00:02:12.610> all<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.790> way<00:02:12.820> up<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.060> AC

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
Wireless everything all the way up to AC

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.530 
Wireless everything all the way up to AC
so<00:02:13.660> tiny<00:02:14.380> little<00:02:14.560> thing<00:02:14.739> like<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.070> is<00:02:15.310> uh

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
man I've really thought it was a 760 m I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.620 
man I've really thought it was a 760 m I
don't<00:02:22.000> know<00:02:22.060> how<00:02:22.120> they're<00:02:22.209> gonna<00:02:22.300> keep<00:02:22.510> it

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
don't know how they're gonna keep it

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.620 
don't know how they're gonna keep it
cool<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.160> they<00:02:24.160> say<00:02:24.370> they<00:02:24.520> can<00:02:24.730> we're<00:02:25.540> at<00:02:25.600> a

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
cool but they say they can we're at a

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.300 
cool but they say they can we're at a
LAN<00:02:25.810> party<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.350> of<00:02:26.560> course<00:02:26.800> they've<00:02:26.950> got<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.130> LAN

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
LAN party so of course they've got a LAN

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.949 
LAN party so of course they've got a LAN
system<00:02:27.610> here<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> CyberPower<00:02:28.600> but<00:02:28.870> it

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
system here this is a CyberPower but it

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.540 
system here this is a CyberPower but it
features<00:02:29.230> all<00:02:29.380> gigabyte<00:02:30.100> parts<00:02:30.370> on<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
features all gigabyte parts on the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.310 
features all gigabyte parts on the
inside<00:02:30.670> so<00:02:31.060> that's<00:02:31.510> your<00:02:31.630> nice<00:02:31.780> big<00:02:31.930> handle

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
inside so that's your nice big handle

inside so that's your nice big handle
here<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.680> got<00:02:32.800> your<00:02:32.830> lock<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.730> lock<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:34.000> down

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
here you got your lock and lock it down

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.130 
here you got your lock and lock it down
but<00:02:34.239> let's<00:02:34.360> open<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.630> up<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.750> see<00:02:34.900> what<00:02:35.020> it

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
but let's open it up and see what it

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.000 
but let's open it up and see what it
looks<00:02:35.260> like<00:02:35.320> on<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.590> inside

completely loaded got a couple I'll swap

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.130 
completely loaded got a couple I'll swap
them<00:02:45.940> I'm<00:02:46.000> gonna<00:02:46.150> pull<00:02:46.299> those<00:02:46.390> out<00:02:46.570> SSDs<00:02:47.110> in

ty<00:02:52.239> in<00:02:52.420> there<00:02:52.600> but<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.989> can<00:02:53.320> obviously<00:02:53.620> get<00:02:53.830> it

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
ty in there but you can obviously get it

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.330 
ty in there but you can obviously get it
in<00:02:54.070> lots<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.820> different<00:02:54.880> flavors<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.920> just

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
in lots of different flavors so I just

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.580 
in lots of different flavors so I just
think<00:02:57.459> it's<00:02:57.549> really<00:02:57.700> cool<00:02:57.820> that<00:02:57.880> it's<00:02:58.590> that's

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
think it's really cool that it's that's

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.580 
think it's really cool that it's that's

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.250 
going up there is through a water
channel<00:03:53.120> in<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.329> mid<00:03:53.569> plate<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:54.140> we

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
channel in the mid plate that we

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.920 
channel in the mid plate that we
custom-made<00:03:54.739> as<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.430> CM<00:03:55.700> storm<00:03:56.000> on<00:03:56.180> there<00:03:56.390> it's

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
custom-made as a CM storm on there it's

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.780 
custom-made as a CM storm on there it's
a<00:03:57.109> back<00:03:57.319> with<00:03:57.500> acrylic<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.159> then<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.549> letters

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
a back with acrylic and then the letters

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.240 
a back with acrylic and then the letters
I<00:03:58.819> put<00:03:59.299> on<00:03:59.420> there<00:03:59.629> using<00:04:00.290> acrylic<00:04:00.769> glue<00:04:01.040> and

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
I put on there using acrylic glue and

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.280 
I put on there using acrylic glue and
then<00:04:01.879> the<00:04:02.030> LEDs<00:04:02.389> on<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.599> top<00:04:02.780> shine<00:04:03.049> through

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
then the LEDs on the top shine through

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.199 
then the LEDs on the top shine through
the<00:04:03.379> letters<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:04.219> it<00:04:04.250> looks<00:04:04.400> pretty<00:04:04.609> nice<00:04:04.730> the

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209
