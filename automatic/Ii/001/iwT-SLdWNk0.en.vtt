 hello people and welcome back to one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.630
 new reaction video here on my channel 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.980

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.960
 respond to your responses that you 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.700
 I left last week 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.800
 again a lot of sense in the previous one 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.570
 Delivery to that explains very very well 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.920
 I think partly because of that 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.810
 because i already told a girlfriend 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.550

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.019

 at least let me feel right 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.090
 the very first questions you grab 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.860
 who is your favorite gamer denominator 2 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.600
 kind of contradictory when asking for mine 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.309
 favorite gamer and that I have two 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.820

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.980
 really still the channel that I follow 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.449
 many people know this too 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.030

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.100

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.860
 wanted youtube channel as work or ruby 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.930

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.000

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.650
 until many of you know I have arrived 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.870
 the year an in-between year and that year 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.210
 is now completely certain because I know that 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.890
 I have passed my VWO diploma and 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.090
 if you didn't know then you follow me 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.370
 probably not on twitter or 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.050
 instagram 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.090

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.130
 have an in-between year this year and ate the cia 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.930
 goat was busy with youtube full time 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.850
 in other words, that is my job 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.220
 then I will follow a study but 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.700

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.979
 I plan to do ICT HBO ie 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.870

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.400
 ship beach with youtube and with mine 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.340
 I study him is just a super 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.170
 awesome year ahead and yes I think 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.670
 that that was a complete answer 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.920
 kind of 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.260
 maybe please what is that 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.360
 painting above your bed of which 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.520
 painting 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.910
 ok i seriously 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.740
 way out ok people, the painting is true 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.600
 so the question about law asked you 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.430
 see it's a building you run this 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.320
 I have always been painting to 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.300
 My room is this painting that is 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.700
 cut out to my aunt was made by 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.020
 my aunt who unfortunately died 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.489
 I mean you do if someone 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.320
 cut it out as you see 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.330
 This one built there had more in the 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.830
 lower to just say that 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.300
 I mean by cutting out and like 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.790
 you can see are the behind 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.459
 written by Auntie ingested and 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.530
 for me 1604 2000 it is something 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.489
 unclear but yes this is it 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.950
 painting 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.720
 finds him somewhat yes in itself 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.120
 there is a little story behind it and 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.160
 because those sides are deceased I want it 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.030
 whats on my old room so at this 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.980
 please 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.950
 we continue with the response video 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.320
 would you choose and fire or water earth 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.790
 air to send melvin I do not know 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.850
 basically what I would choose if I did 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.580
 between the two had to choose from 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.480
 so it seems to be water or air 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.250
 namely two 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.290
 still the coolest but I never have 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.970
 really looked at avatar or something so what i got there 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.140
 it would just be endless but 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.790
 line funny for example 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.380
 flood a tap all the way into it 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.000
 glass on the other side of the room too 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.220
 can do to the air mine 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.860
 enough fun to fly or something 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.540
 yes this is a bit of a tricky issue 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.290
 if you ask me so I just prefer 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.800
 the night out 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.310
 most important point in the world well there 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.310
 do you have point 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.970
 melvin is following murder 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.400
 illuminati comfort well joost 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.660
 69 it comes up indeed take a moment 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.910
 delete it 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.900
 melvin is full- bodied wants to follow your mesh 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.100
 motion 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.100
 so will try to do that 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.970
 how youtube or your friends in the piece 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.069
 straw shit is indeed a very big one 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.780
 pieces but if I have to make a choice 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.489
 then he is not very difficult 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.770
 and of course I take forms myself 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.420
 but it's still something that I do 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.190
 then behind like youtube is also 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.050
 or simply a shared living but 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.849
 i think i'm much better without youtube 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.239
 want to live without the dear friend 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:23.889

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:26.189
