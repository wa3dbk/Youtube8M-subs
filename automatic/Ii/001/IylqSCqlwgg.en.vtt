00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:11.700
 In this time, respond to the question, 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:18.090
 While initially intended to Seoul 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:20.400
 4 The taxi went wrong and went wrong on the subway mistake. 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.609
 Look at me and the theme. 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.759
 I 'll go back to 2 places in Seoul. 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.150
 Yes. Let 's learn it once. 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:35.190
 The US called Rule tnc 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:39.870
 Learn to re-lend to countries in jyeotneunde I've bulryeojin Fuller 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:44.010
 I think that if you go to 2t, 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.210
 From watching my mom tried massage cc must be the sort of thing a minor Sean f 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:55.400
 So I lowered it to c 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.400
 It's easy to sing and I'll lower it to c and let me teach you a little bit . 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.800
 4. What one would like to be food prices, after 10 km your spa easy wonki 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.390
 If you would like to call 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:15.930
 No. 4, etc. No. 2 It is very important that you do it. 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:20.160
 So you change to a break and f goes to a and you change it that way. 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:25.170
 I'll try and do something with SimKey. I'll take a look at the code first. 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.980
 The code that comes out can be called the Shiji family code. 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.610
 Three 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:35.020
 cpu sho Shin Eunji 4 5 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.070
 I would like to see f next, but basically cfc is the default 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.610
 It's coming out. 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:45.880
 Then f &amp; f can go up like this at about 10 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.079
 Hold common lines at the same time 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.939
 Grab hold of the Bodhisattva give three remaining lines 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.939
 I will hold it briefly 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.010

 I have an errand. 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.760
 On your forehead, you are only in the code, but only in the fifth or fourth line. 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.620
 That's it. 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.310
 Then when the Bay Miner comes down from the code as a stock , 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.310
 Minor. 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.350

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.240

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.970

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.450
 Next time , you'll have to. 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:36.740
