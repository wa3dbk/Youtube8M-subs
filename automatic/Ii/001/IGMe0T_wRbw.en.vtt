comment<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.319> am<00:02:54.319> I<00:02:54.530> trying<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.920> poke<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:56.380> ok

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
comment and am I trying to poke you ok

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.100 
comment and am I trying to poke you ok
now<00:02:57.620> I'm<00:02:57.769> going<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:58.010> teach<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.370> how<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.580> do

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
now I'm going to teach you how to do

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.630 
now I'm going to teach you how to do
high-speed<00:03:00.110> race<00:03:00.410> which<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.190> much<00:03:01.670> different

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
high-speed race which is much different

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.370 
high-speed race which is much different
ok<00:03:04.640> first<00:03:05.030> thing<00:03:05.239> you<00:03:05.300> want<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.510> do<00:03:05.660> if<00:03:05.930> you've

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
ok first thing you want to do if you've

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.280 
ok first thing you want to do if you've
already<00:03:06.709> tuned<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.580> for<00:03:07.940> those<00:03:08.569> features<00:03:09.019> is

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
already tuned it for those features is

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.339 
already tuned it for those features is
your<00:03:09.590> set<00:03:09.769> your<00:03:09.920> default<00:03:10.750> then<00:03:11.750> you're<00:03:12.140> going

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
your set your default then you're going

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.680 
your set your default then you're going
to<00:03:12.440> do<00:03:12.620> this<00:03:12.890> again<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.489> know<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:14.030> jet<00:03:14.299> factor

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
to do this again you know you jet factor

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.990 
to do this again you know you jet factor
all<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.989> way<00:03:15.080> up<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:15.530> like<00:03:15.620> before<00:03:16.000> and

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
all the way up just like before and

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.569 
all the way up just like before and
traction<00:03:17.840> you<00:03:18.290> can<00:03:18.470> keep<00:03:18.739> in<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.069> middle<00:03:19.400> and

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
traction you can keep in the middle and

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:32.180 
traction you can keep in the middle and
friction<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.150> less<00:03:23.329> you<00:03:24.319> Justin

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.890 

now<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.370> should<00:03:33.580> usually<00:03:33.910> be<00:03:34.150> good<00:03:34.569> for<00:03:34.810> the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
now this should usually be good for the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.430 
now this should usually be good for the
viper<00:03:35.170> but<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.040> Viper<00:03:36.640> does<00:03:37.080> fishtail<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.110> lot

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
viper but the Viper does fishtail a lot

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.090 
viper but the Viper does fishtail a lot
so<00:03:39.430> if<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.720> have<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:40.870> different<00:03:41.290> car<00:03:41.530> it

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
so if you have a different car it

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.510 
so if you have a different car it
probably<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.260> housing<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.440> having<00:03:45.010> understeer

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
probably is housing is having understeer

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.610 
probably is housing is having understeer
problem<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:46.120> if<00:03:46.330> your<00:03:46.930> car<00:03:47.140> is<00:03:47.290> having

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
problem so if your car is having

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.059 
problem so if your car is having
understeer<00:03:48.220> palms<00:03:48.459> as<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.270> is<00:03:49.980> take<00:03:50.980> the

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
understeer palms as you is take the

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.990 
understeer palms as you is take the
traction<00:03:51.520> and<00:03:51.700> line<00:03:52.209> up<00:03:52.239> with<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.750> friction

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
traction and line up with the friction

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.290 
traction and line up with the friction
then<00:03:55.000> so<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.900> looks<00:03:56.110> like<00:03:56.170> this<00:03:59.760> then<00:04:00.760> do<00:04:00.970> test

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
then so it looks like this then do test

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.120 
then so it looks like this then do test
this<00:04:01.450> tune

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.730 

then<00:04:07.760> usually<00:04:08.270> again<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:09.050> should<00:04:09.290> be<00:04:09.500> good

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
then usually again it should be good

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.610 
then usually again it should be good
should<00:04:10.550> be<00:04:10.700> fine<00:04:11.110> but<00:04:12.110> if<00:04:12.260> you're<00:04:12.410> having

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
should be fine but if you're having

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.730 
should be fine but if you're having
oversteer<00:04:13.370> problems<00:04:14.200> what<00:04:15.200> you<00:04:15.230> want<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.620> do

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
oversteer problems what you want to do

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.300 
oversteer problems what you want to do
is<00:04:16.040> you<00:04:17.410> want<00:04:18.410> to<00:04:18.650> pause<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.570> go<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.630> this<00:04:20.840> and

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
is you want to pause it go to this and

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.860 
is you want to pause it go to this and
then<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.520> want<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:22.760> put<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:22.910> traction<00:04:23.420> one<00:04:23.720> to

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
then you want to put the traction one to

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.260 
then you want to put the traction one to
the<00:04:23.990> right<00:04:24.170> friction<00:04:25.040> two<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.760> left<00:04:25.850> and

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
the right friction two to the left and

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.230 
the right friction two to the left and
drift<00:04:27.170> one<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:27.890> left<00:04:28.040> so<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:28.940> should<00:04:29.120> look

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
drift one to the left so it should look

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:43.800 
drift one to the left so it should look
like<00:04:29.300> this<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:35.300> do<00:04:35.510> tests<00:04:35.840> sister

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.890 

then<00:04:45.160> one<00:04:46.160> of<00:04:46.190> those<00:04:46.490> handlings<00:04:47.120> did<00:04:47.420> not<00:04:47.600> work

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
then one of those handlings did not work

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.290 
then one of those handlings did not work
for<00:04:48.140> your<00:04:48.350> car<00:04:48.650> you<00:04:49.370> can<00:04:49.610> leave<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:49.940> comment

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
for your car you can leave a comment

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.800 
for your car you can leave a comment
using<00:04:51.170> hands<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:51.890> tips<00:04:52.160> oh<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:53.600> another

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
using hands and tips oh and another

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.140 
using hands and tips oh and another
thing<00:04:53.930> when<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:54.800> go<00:04:54.980> to<00:04:55.040> jet<00:04:55.430> make<00:04:55.880> sure<00:04:55.910> you

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
thing when you go to jet make sure you

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.360 
thing when you go to jet make sure you
don't<00:04:56.300> use<00:04:56.570> ebrake<00:04:57.110> or<00:04:57.410> normal<00:04:58.100> brakes

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
don't use ebrake or normal brakes

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.160 
don't use ebrake or normal brakes
because<00:04:58.610> it<00:04:59.180> will<00:04:59.450> definitely<00:04:59.750> throw<00:05:00.110> off

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
because it will definitely throw off

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.710 
because it will definitely throw off
your<00:05:00.200> just<00:05:00.590> like<00:05:00.950> that<00:05:01.160> though<00:05:01.820> you<00:05:02.450> will<00:05:02.570> not

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
your just like that though you will not

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.630 
your just like that though you will not
be<00:05:02.900> able<00:05:02.930> to<00:05:03.170> get<00:05:03.350> to<00:05:03.500> debrief<00:05:03.950> with<00:05:04.160> a<00:05:04.310> church
