white zebra finches and normally what I
do<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.140> output<00:00:22.830> between<00:00:23.460> two<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.150> three<00:00:24.240> nest

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
do is output between two and three nest

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.380 
do is output between two and three nest
boxes<00:00:25.050> per<00:00:25.289> breeding<00:00:25.710> pair<00:00:25.920> oh<00:00:26.160> no<00:00:26.699> sorry<00:00:27.000> I'll

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
boxes per breeding pair oh no sorry I'll

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.109 
boxes per breeding pair oh no sorry I'll
put<00:00:27.570> two<00:00:27.750> nest<00:00:27.990> boxes<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:29.279> breeding<00:00:29.519> pair<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
put two nest boxes for breeding pair and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.669 
put two nest boxes for breeding pair and
if<00:00:30.570> they're<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:30.900> expensive<00:00:31.289> breeding

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
if they're really expensive breeding

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.170 
if they're really expensive breeding
pair<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:32.009> boolean<00:00:32.219> type<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:32.759> three<00:00:32.969> nest

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
pair like boolean type for three nest

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.450 
pair like boolean type for three nest
boxes<00:00:33.630> per<00:00:33.960> breeding<00:00:34.290> pair<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.070> reason<00:00:35.370> why

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
boxes per breeding pair the reason why

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.770 
boxes per breeding pair the reason why
is<00:00:35.520> because<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.880> want<00:00:36.090> them<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> choose<00:00:36.750> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
is because you want them to choose a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.080 
is because you want them to choose a
nest<00:00:37.170> site<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:38.129> they<00:00:38.370> may<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
nest site because they may not like it

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.940 
nest site because they may not like it
here<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.600> side<00:00:39.840> they<00:00:40.290> may<00:00:40.440> not<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.800> it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
here on this side they may not like it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.920 
here on this side they may not like it
on<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.250> side<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:42.270> may<00:00:42.390> not<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
on this side and they may not like it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.000 
on this side and they may not like it
anywhere<00:00:43.200> else<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.590> might<00:00:43.710> put<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
anywhere else that you might put the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.380 
anywhere else that you might put the
nest<00:00:44.219> boxes<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:46.579> have<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:47.850> breeding<00:00:48.180> pair

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
nest boxes so I have one breeding pair

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.470 
nest boxes so I have one breeding pair
of<00:00:48.480> breeding<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.730> I<00:00:50.730> had<00:00:51.180> another

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
of breeding in here and I had another

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.029 
of breeding in here and I had another
one<00:00:51.690> breeding<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.890> made

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
one breeding in there but they just made

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.220 
one breeding in there but they just made
the<00:00:53.190> nests<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.730> stopped<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.870> what

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the nests and then they stopped so what

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.369 
the nests and then they stopped so what
they<00:00:55.379> decided<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.780> make<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> nest<00:00:58.140> in

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
they decided to do is make a nest in

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.119 
they decided to do is make a nest in
here<00:00:58.710> their<00:00:59.699> food<00:01:00.000> dish<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:01.980> what<00:01:02.100> I

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
here their food dish so you see what I

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.860 
here their food dish so you see what I
mean<00:01:02.340> sometimes<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.420> don't<00:01:03.600> want<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
mean sometimes they just don't want to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.969 
mean sometimes they just don't want to
make<00:01:04.159> nests<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:06.180> areas<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.979> put

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
make nests in the areas that you put

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.910 
make nests in the areas that you put
nest<00:01:08.189> boxes<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:10.020> English<00:01:10.409> pair<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.860> I

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
nest boxes so this English pair that I

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130 
nest boxes so this English pair that I
have<00:01:11.130> down<00:01:11.340> below<00:01:11.450> they're<00:01:12.450> about<00:01:12.720> two<00:01:12.960> years

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140

babies now the pair up there they

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
babies now the pair up there they
actually<00:01:28.470> will<00:01:28.619> produce<00:01:29.240> about<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:31.140> see<00:01:31.380> 5<00:01:31.619> 10

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
actually will produce about it see 5 10

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.649 
actually will produce about it see 5 10
15<00:01:32.310> 20<00:01:32.340> about<00:01:33.119> 20<00:01:33.299> finches<00:01:35.090> every<00:01:36.090> six<00:01:36.329> months

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
15 20 about 20 finches every six months

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.210 
15 20 about 20 finches every six months
but<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.600> just<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:40.049> too<00:01:40.259> many<00:01:40.409> zebra<00:01:40.829> finches

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
but I just have too many zebra finches

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.399 
but I just have too many zebra finches
I've<00:01:41.490> got<00:01:41.790> chestnut<00:01:42.390> cheek<00:01:42.630> type<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.079> just

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
I've got chestnut cheek type that I just

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.770 
I've got chestnut cheek type that I just
don't<00:01:43.710> breed<00:01:43.920> them<00:01:44.009> anymore<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> decided

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
don't breed them anymore but I decided

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.310 
don't breed them anymore but I decided
to<00:01:46.820> give<00:01:47.820> them<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.180> try<00:01:48.420> since<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.840> haven't<00:01:49.049> bred

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
to give them a try since I haven't bred

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.800 
to give them a try since I haven't bred
for<00:01:49.470> about<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> year<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> got<00:01:51.570> them<00:01:51.689> in

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
for about a year and so I got them in

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.179 
for about a year and so I got them in
here<00:01:51.960> with<00:01:52.079> my<00:01:52.200> English<00:01:52.350> breeding<00:01:52.799> pair<00:01:53.009> which

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
here with my English breeding pair which

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.800 
here with my English breeding pair which

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:35.729 
per breeding pair to use like maybe one

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.360

the day and property and then probably

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.869
