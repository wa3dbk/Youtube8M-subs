00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:17.289
 who would say that since the green of this land 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.619
 of this material 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:25.119
 I was born of these hands so much that 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:28.750
 involves the lives of people in the house 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:32.349
 Asphalt of the profession the tool gives 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:37.600
 strength to the comfort of production 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:40.030
 sustainability is the interconnected dream 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.579
 with reality through the work of 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.579
 one of the best steel companies in the country 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.220
 so Brazil 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.410
 the quiet theme 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.680
 and the workforce of employees 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.700
 value that literally builds a 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.190
 present and the future of Brazil and 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:07.130
 effects of this construction go 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:11.880
 steel change lives sustain projects 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:18.090
 which protect nature and saddle strong 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:21.149
 commitments with parents - steel is vital 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.070
 so the carrot products are in the 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.000
 daily life of all people 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.649
 mainly in the civil construction of 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 roads of homes and buildings and 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.720
 so many other ventures 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.509
 the market's preference for the products 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.440
 is explained by the portfolio of 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.979
 custom line flexibility products 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.020
 and well-structured logistics for 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.080
 achieve this trust 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.490
 symbiosis is always investing in 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.850
 technology 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.630
 the operational process is automated and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.420
 safe 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.299
 its production has certificates 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.979
 throughout the world and meets the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.759
 all the requirements of the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.080
 quality of work 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.990
 done with both 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.670
 I have got to get to the customers at 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.920
 right time 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.590
 structured logistics SINOBRAS 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.290
 guarantees delivery of the product on time 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.060
 combined anywhere in the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.570
 Brazilian territory 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.210
 where the customer is alone with the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.520
 collaboration and commitment of people 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.800
 this work can be done 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.220
 thousands of jobs are generated in 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.350
 units of the five works 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.150
 well-trained people to 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.160
 develop activities in a 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.260
 productive and therefore made the 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.620
 work is above any 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.900
 objective of the organization and 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.560
 investments in training are 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.020
 the best results 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.340
 achieved with much more 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.030
 commitment 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.920
 the value that people's company will 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.130
 Besides the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.970
 teaching itself to construct a 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.270
 world with cultural initiatives 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.010
 sports and socio-environmental 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.770
 commitments on a daily basis with 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.100
 society and nature 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.190
 so nahas is associated with important 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.250
 organizations such as the brazilian steel institute 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.140
 and the development program for 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.930
 suppliers of par 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.810
 this with great emphasis the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.900
 positioning demonstrates 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.930
 still esteem for the human being through the 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.239
 scrap recycling and taking nature 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.930
 harmful waste that could 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.790
 turn into rain 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.489
 use renewable resources throughout the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.549
 production chain are many of the 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:01.540
 because today the development of 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.370
 has to be a sustainability partner 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.400
 doing their own reforestation 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.750
 guarantee self-sufficiency in energy 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.910
 renewable 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.910
 reduce the co2 levels of the atmosphere 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.260
 but not paid SINOBRAS and focused on 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.940
 future has already foreseen new 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.460
 investments that increased even more 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.220
 its production capacity 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.610
 This implies more job creation and 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.910
 economic growth for the country 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.320
 behind the steel syrups there is 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.960
 development of citizenship and 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.569
 sustainability 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.509
 because in addition to quality products that 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:48.960
 dreams come true other strings 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:51.569
 productive nature itself in a 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.560
 fairer and more balanced future for the 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.650
 men 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.280
 are part of the work that this company 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.280
 develops 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.120
 the idea is that in Brazil plantar 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.120
 every day
