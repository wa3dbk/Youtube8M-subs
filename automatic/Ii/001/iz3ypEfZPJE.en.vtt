to<00:01:04.610> complain<00:01:04.640> about<00:01:05.119> I<00:01:05.509> think<00:01:05.960> everything<00:01:06.409> the

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
to complain about I think everything the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.199 
to complain about I think everything the
staff<00:01:07.790> are<00:01:08.119> very<00:01:08.180> good<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:10.159> food<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.549> good

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:11.209 
staff are very good and the food is good

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:17.020

and attendance everything is good for me

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.059 
and attendance everything is good for me
probably<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.630> most<00:01:17.780> fulfilling<00:01:17.990> thing<00:01:18.350> is<00:01:18.679> to

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
probably the most fulfilling thing is to

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.399 
probably the most fulfilling thing is to
know<00:01:19.189> that<00:01:19.399> you're<00:01:19.819> going<00:01:20.090> home<00:01:20.359> and<00:01:20.630> you

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
know that you're going home and you

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:22.449 
know that you're going home and you
couldn't<00:01:21.649> have<00:01:21.770> done<00:01:21.799> any<00:01:22.069> more<00:01:22.249> for<00:01:22.369> the

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
couldn't have done any more for the

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:26.139 
couldn't have done any more for the
residents<00:01:22.969> I<00:01:23.229> think<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:24.499> actually<00:01:25.459> feel<00:01:25.939> that

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
residents I think to actually feel that

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.219 
residents I think to actually feel that
at<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.359> end<00:01:26.479> of<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.689> day<00:01:26.840> you've<00:01:27.020> made<00:01:27.200> a

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
at the end of the day you've made a

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.590 
at the end of the day you've made a
difference<00:01:27.649> to<00:01:27.740> someone's<00:01:28.159> life<00:01:28.340> we<00:01:28.609> we<00:01:29.329> can't

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
difference to someone's life we we can't

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.769 
difference to someone's life we we can't
get<00:01:29.719> it<00:01:29.840> all<00:01:30.679> right<00:01:31.219> all<00:01:31.459> the<00:01:31.700> time<00:01:31.729> but<00:01:32.479> that

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:32.779 
get it all right all the time but that

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:34.179 
get it all right all the time but that
we're<00:01:32.899> actually<00:01:33.049> always<00:01:33.560> striving<00:01:33.889> for<00:01:34.130> that

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
we're actually always striving for that

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.999 
we're actually always striving for that
excellence<00:01:34.700> it's<00:01:35.630> I<00:01:36.109> sometimes<00:01:36.770> think<00:01:36.920> that

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
excellence it's I sometimes think that

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.779 
excellence it's I sometimes think that
it's<00:01:37.840> relatively<00:01:38.840> easy<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.349> get<00:01:39.679> to<00:01:40.279> good<00:01:40.459> or

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
it's relatively easy to get to good or

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.149 
it's relatively easy to get to good or
excellent<00:01:41.029> but<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.539> maintain<00:01:41.689> it<00:01:42.159> actually

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
excellent but to maintain it actually

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.730 
excellent but to maintain it actually
people<00:01:43.459> I<00:01:43.670> think<00:01:43.729> then<00:01:44.119> can<00:01:45.109> become<00:01:45.439> a<00:01:45.469> little

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
people I think then can become a little

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.989 
people I think then can become a little
bit<00:01:45.770> complacent<00:01:46.159> but<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:46.609> have<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:46.849> keep

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
bit complacent but you have to keep

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.429 
bit complacent but you have to keep
looking<00:01:47.359> at<00:01:48.079> new<00:01:48.259> ways<00:01:48.289> bringing<00:01:49.069> new<00:01:49.279> ideas

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
looking at new ways bringing new ideas
