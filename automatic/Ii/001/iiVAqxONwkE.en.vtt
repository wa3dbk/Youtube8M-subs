00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
individually or it's a much better value

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.800 
individually or it's a much better value
to<00:00:28.890> get<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.160> three<00:00:29.460> pack<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> did<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> video

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
to get a three pack so I did a video

to get a three pack so I did a video
showing<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> sidekicks<00:00:31.679> pack<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.669> there's

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
showing the sidekicks pack but there's

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.520 
showing the sidekicks pack but there's
also<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.120> villains<00:00:33.630> pack<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.140> here's<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
also a villains pack so here's the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.479 
also a villains pack so here's the
villains<00:00:34.800> pack<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.130> these<00:00:35.280> three

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
villains pack with these three

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.490 
villains pack with these three
characters<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.090> again<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.170> get<00:00:37.320> them

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
characters here again you can get them

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.740 
characters here again you can get them
individually<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.239> them<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> pack

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
individually but I got them as a pack

individually but I got them as a pack
and<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> think<00:00:40.200> they're<00:00:40.290> also<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.500> better<00:00:40.710> value

and I think they're also a better value

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.830 
and I think they're also a better value
as<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> pack<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.760> I'm<00:00:42.120> reviewing<00:00:42.570> them<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.809> a

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
he's pretty similar to the other

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.280 
he's pretty similar to the other
characters<00:03:24.420> you'll<00:03:24.600> see<00:03:24.750> he<00:03:24.870> kind<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.110> has<00:03:25.260> a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
characters you'll see he kind of has a

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.500 
characters you'll see he kind of has a
bit<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.830> different<00:03:26.100> walk<00:03:26.280> slightly<00:03:26.820> but<00:03:27.420> he

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
bit of a different walk slightly but he

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.720 
bit of a different walk slightly but he
can<00:03:27.660> jump<00:03:28.700> X<00:03:30.290> has<00:03:31.290> his<00:03:31.560> sword<00:03:31.800> but<00:03:32.459> he<00:03:32.519> also

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
can jump X has his sword but he also

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.009 
can jump X has his sword but he also
kind<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.120> kicks<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.480> little<00:03:33.510> bit<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:33.840> don't<00:03:33.900> think

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
kind of kicks a little bit I don't think

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.810 
kind of kicks a little bit I don't think
the<00:03:34.200> other<00:03:34.350> characters<00:03:34.830> do<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.280> he<00:03:35.400> hits<00:03:35.730> like

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
the other characters do and he hits like

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.040 
the other characters do and he hits like
that

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
that

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.699 
that
so<00:03:37.500> he's<00:03:37.800> slightly<00:03:38.070> different<00:03:38.870> he<00:03:39.870> does<00:03:40.110> shoot

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
so he's slightly different he does shoot

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.610 
so he's slightly different he does shoot
the<00:03:40.830> gun<00:03:40.980> as<00:03:41.220> well<00:03:42.019> with<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.140> Zr<00:03:43.470> button<00:03:43.769> I

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
the gun as well with the Zr button I

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.340 
the gun as well with the Zr button I
think<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.709> can<00:03:46.830> hold<00:03:46.920> on<00:03:47.100> Z<00:03:47.280> L<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.640> aim<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.680> I

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
think you can hold on Z L to aim and I

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.030 
think you can hold on Z L to aim and I
was<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.380> little<00:03:52.500> off<00:03:52.709> but<00:03:53.720> BAM<00:03:54.720> there<00:03:55.080> we<00:03:55.230> go<00:03:55.380> so

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
was a little off but BAM there we go so

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.070 
was a little off but BAM there we go so
so<00:03:56.910> there<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.150> have<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.330> so<00:03:57.600> that's<00:03:57.750> kind<00:03:57.989> of

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
so there you have it so that's kind of

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.830 
so there you have it so that's kind of
his<00:03:58.230> little<00:03:58.500> functionality<00:03:59.540> pretty<00:04:00.540> similar

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
his little functionality pretty similar

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.759 
his little functionality pretty similar
to<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.989> other<00:04:01.110> parts<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.560> Caribbean

energy as they call it let me see if I
can<00:06:05.940> zoom<00:06:05.970> in<00:06:06.449> I<00:06:06.720> don't<00:06:06.900> know<00:06:06.990> if<00:06:07.110> I<00:06:07.199> can<00:06:07.260> do

that<00:06:07.560> on<00:06:07.710> boxes<00:06:08.690> no<00:06:09.690> I<00:06:10.340> think<00:06:11.340> I<00:06:11.460> have<00:06:11.520> to<00:06:11.639> do<00:06:11.760> an

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
that on boxes no I think I have to do an

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:13.219 
that on boxes no I think I have to do an
actual<00:06:12.180> villain<00:06:12.570> but<00:06:12.660> I<00:06:12.720> think<00:06:12.930> it<00:06:12.990> what<00:06:13.139> it

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
actual villain but I think it what it

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.770 
actual villain but I think it what it
does<00:06:13.260> is<00:06:13.530> it<00:06:13.680> grabs<00:06:14.280> the<00:06:14.490> villain<00:06:14.910> and<00:06:15.120> like

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
does is it grabs the villain and like

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.510 
does is it grabs the villain and like
throws<00:06:16.199> them<00:06:16.470> or<00:06:16.710> attached<00:06:16.949> them<00:06:17.220> something

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
throws them or attached them something

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.290 
throws them or attached them something
like<00:06:17.699> that<00:06:18.139> that's<00:06:19.139> basically<00:06:19.500> what<00:06:19.740> it<00:06:19.860> does

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
like that that's basically what it does

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.460 
like that that's basically what it does
yeah<00:06:21.300> so<00:06:21.510> he's<00:06:21.630> kind<00:06:21.840> of<00:06:21.870> an<00:06:21.990> interesting

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470

buy them individually but I think the

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.730 
buy them individually but I think the
3-pack<00:06:48.490> is<00:06:48.520> more<00:06:48.880> worth<00:06:49.060> it<00:06:49.240> and<00:06:49.450> you<00:06:50.380> do<00:06:50.530> get

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
3-pack is more worth it and you do get

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.140 
3-pack is more worth it and you do get
all<00:06:50.890> of<00:06:51.010> these<00:06:51.130> and<00:06:51.370> you<00:06:51.430> can<00:06:51.580> do<00:06:51.640> multiplayer

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
all of these and you can do multiplayer

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.690 
all of these and you can do multiplayer
in<00:06:52.390> their<00:06:52.510> respective<00:06:52.900> playsets<00:06:53.710> as<00:06:53.890> well<00:06:54.130> so

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
in their respective playsets as well so

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.510 
in their respective playsets as well so
that's<00:06:54.880> definitely<00:06:55.120> a<00:06:55.450> bonus<00:06:56.070> and<00:06:57.070> you<00:06:57.430> know

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
that's definitely a bonus and you know

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.740

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
if you have multiple characters you can

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.210 
if you have multiple characters you can
always<00:06:58.900> interchange<00:06:59.440> them<00:06:59.710> and<00:06:59.950> then<00:07:00.040> use
