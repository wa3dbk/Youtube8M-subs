no<00:01:56.880> increases<00:01:57.510> at<00:01:57.780> all<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:59.630> nitrates<00:02:00.630> I'm

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
no increases at all the nitrates I'm

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.800 
no increases at all the nitrates I'm
sorry<00:02:01.620> nitrites<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.430> ammonia<00:02:02.820> was<00:02:03.120> still<00:02:03.450> 0

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
sorry nitrites and ammonia was still 0

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.059 
sorry nitrites and ammonia was still 0
and<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.980> nitrates<00:02:05.550> were<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.900> think<00:02:07.550> point

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
and the nitrates were I think point
