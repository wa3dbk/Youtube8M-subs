00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.120
Hi everyone! 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.960
My name is Valera and I #wannafly

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.560
At some point, you might decide to start skydiving.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.100
And that's when paranoia begins.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.940
What if it doesn't open?

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.560
What if I lose the ability to think?

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.540
If these are your thoughts,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.660
then shut yourself in the bathroom and start crying.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.660
What do people normally do?

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.660
Instead of asking professionals,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.920
they turn to someone who made one tandem jump

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.440
a billion years ago.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.320
And that person, of course, has lots of stories to share.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.800
'You might lose control and start spinning 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.740
and flipping 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.260
and rolling.'

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.340
Modern parachute sistem is state-of-the-art.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.520
It will guard you and save you. 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.160
The parachute rig is hi-tech equipment.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.280
Learn how to use it.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.620
And make sure you are taught by professionals.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.740
As for me, I've finally completed a packing course.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.840
Now I'm planning to jump with the chute I packed myself.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.580
It's gonna make me a more confident skydiver.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.640
At first it looks like a pile of rags 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.100
and you have no idea what to do with it.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.760
But then you figure it out and fewer and fewer mistakes,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.020
which probably you won't even notice when opening the chute.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.360
You'll be feeling comfortable and enjoying the sky.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.720
Even though the rig is a great invention,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.180
you still need to be in control of the situation. 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.740
You will also have to learn how to pilot your canopy 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.580
and land safely.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.520
Let the pros teach you.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.260
And I'm gonna go see how well I've packed this.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.340
Yeah, baby!

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.340
I'm Valera, I #wannafly See ya!
