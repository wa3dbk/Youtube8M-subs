00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.179
 imagine an ecological park in the middle of a colleague in the south of bogota 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.589
 is the protagonist in this first day of today made it possible 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.530
 my name is edgar vine 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.170
 I am the director of the national of Colombia a school located in bolivar city 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.890
 was founded twenty-one years ago 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.790
 in that search for green spaces 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.620
 more or less when he was 13 years old we organized an ecological group in 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.720
 our block 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.730
 with another group of children from six neighbors 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.140
 in or towards monarch a lot of ecological work 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.840
 awaken tectura go I contacted some with them to 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.670
 organize 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.650
 literacy in the ecological area 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.290
 but I also saw that 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.700
 2 boys finish their 80 hours of literacy 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.060
 they did not want to work anymore on any occasion and I kept the holes for 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.430
 plant trees seen in china and that will help me 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.300
 to plant the thinking of an ecological group of children was very difficult 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.560
 that a pope will make a boy go 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.170
 with four years 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.100
 to a meeting with a man 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.220
 that day the ecology children 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.380
 therefore we think about the option of having an institution 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.740
 in which the base was ecology 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.150
 the nations college highly ing in the year 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.830
 390 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.470
 we started this year with a degree 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.100
 of transition the first 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.610
 a very difficult year because I was holding one for it 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.610
 in which it works to our device 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.919
 in the economic aspect because in Spanish 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.369
 moment 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:15.740
 the silver put 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.810
 sookoo very difficult because we did not have money we did not have faria boys 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.170
 they will enroll tactically to work on the outside, including 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.789
 pay salaries to teachers 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:29.939
 and a second time there has been some stability and a third moment that in 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.689
 the tenth year to date fortunately he appeared on the scene 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.689
 the cooperation agreement 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.090
 politics the national of colombia has always been to build spaces 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:49.249
 green 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:53.569
 per cent we have always tried to leave a large area for the green part 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.219
 in these parties we have managed to build each is a new space 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:01.459
 almost every little patio becomes one of the generating spaces of a 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.459
 good atmosphere at school is how we have today 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.290
 the Japanese card we have the synthetic grass court we have our 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.219
 active 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.969
 we have the butterfly 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.529
 we have the corner of the aquariums 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.009
 we have the observatory 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:22.139
 and another would be ecological space is that on the one hand they make children feel 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.369
 happy and on the other hand does not serve as a pretext to help them form 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:30.269
 the aquariums 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.969
 ep we had before they were aquarium were the kitchens and bathrooms of a 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:38.159
 tenancy that works the house that we acquired we did not know what to do with 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.789
 that space 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:44.749
 We analyze if we consider that the ideal was an exhibition space of 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:48.679
 event more and in small ones and then they made the empire drawers filled up 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:52.749
 of water got little fish and I want the beautiful space faith is today the 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.749
 Aquarius 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:03.279
 other spaces such as the observatory and the butterfly garden because it has been a bit 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:07.799
 caprice but natural whim and not others we think that 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.799
 you have to teach children to fly 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.049
 that we have to get them out of this world offered to bolívar pcia bolívar is not 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.259
 he the ones of the whole world that we have to make him know the universe 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.750
 that we have to speak rooms and that is why we have also created our 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.210
 butterfly garden is a way to teach them 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.169
 philosophy of life to children you have to take into account for example that 15 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.569
 olive grove erosion is very large that these lands not only 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.879
 I go and towns to cultivate however because we have made such a place 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.879
 green like this 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.710
 beyond the money that is invested in building an aquarium by salary 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.090
 or the forest 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.090
 the most important thing for this work 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.330
 many of these things 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.400
 We have done them personally with our own hands 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.210
 the sectors or for example of conscience that have given us nothing of housing 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.210
 sector did not take advantage of resources very well 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.380
 the nature of the business entity and beautiful and to that extent 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:18.979
 he has given us a birth water 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.060
 because he knows that we are not here that I love him to take very well florida is 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:24.639
 a locality very close 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.720
 however the páramo of sumapaz tianjin very close towards the south 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:34.519
 we had the opportunity to enjoy the water the moor seagate birth and 

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:37.999
 you can see reflected the puddle exterior 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.999
 Muñoz also takes a lot of profit 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:47.270
 our model the color and with 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.159
 it is not well seen by everyone I know why not 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.439
 especially the people who think a lot in economic terms 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:57.539
 who asks some they said why mount a banana tree instead of riding 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.770
 some also think that it is to waste the time that called to make them suddenly 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.849
 better a children canchita a concrete square 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.729
 but definitely there will be no more extensions to twist 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.729
 and here we are with our project strong 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.360
 I want to take this opportunity to invite all the institutions 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.749
 educational 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:25.229
 to face little the way to work the certain thing is that the control of all the 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.839
 powers through neruda comfortable facilities
