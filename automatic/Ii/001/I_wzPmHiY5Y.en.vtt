00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
how I really feel the game needs to be

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.849 
how I really feel the game needs to be
done<00:00:56.120> with<00:00:56.359> these<00:00:56.839> current<00:00:57.170> fixes<00:00:57.499> I<00:00:57.620> still

see some issues that are prevalent that

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.610 
see some issues that are prevalent that
cannot<00:00:59.600> be<00:00:59.659> fixed<00:00:59.929> without<00:01:00.230> a<00:01:00.289> major<00:01:00.499> overhaul

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
cannot be fixed without a major overhaul

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.849 
cannot be fixed without a major overhaul
of<00:01:01.280> two<00:01:01.699> major<00:01:02.030> things<00:01:02.559> we're<00:01:03.559> in<00:01:03.620> talk<00:01:03.710> about

of two major things we're in talk about
one<00:01:04.010> quick<00:01:04.250> bug<00:01:04.519> Before<00:01:04.879> we<00:01:04.909> jump<00:01:05.000> into<00:01:05.269> the

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
one quick bug Before we jump into the

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.630 
one quick bug Before we jump into the
model<00:01:06.440> size<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:06.950> why<00:01:07.040> I<00:01:07.070> think<00:01:07.190> it's<00:01:07.370> an<00:01:07.520> issue

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
model size and why I think it's an issue

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.450 
model size and why I think it's an issue
and<00:01:08.110> Before<00:01:09.110> we<00:01:09.170> jump<00:01:09.229> into<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.650> sound<00:01:09.860> and

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
and Before we jump into the sound and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.190 
and Before we jump into the sound and
how<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:11.150> all<00:01:11.450> know<00:01:11.600> it's<00:01:11.750> an<00:01:11.810> issue<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.140> I'm

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
how you all know it's an issue and I'm

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.100 
how you all know it's an issue and I'm
not<00:01:12.380> sure<00:01:12.500> valve<00:01:12.710> knows<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.659> so<00:01:14.659> let's<00:01:14.930> jump

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
not sure valve knows that so let's jump

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.350 
not sure valve knows that so let's jump
into<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.620> flash<00:01:15.979> flashes<00:01:16.729> for<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:16.909> second<00:01:17.240> and

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
into the flash flashes for a second and

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.450 
into the flash flashes for a second and
it's<00:01:17.719> gonna<00:01:17.810> be<00:01:17.869> very<00:01:17.990> quick<00:01:18.350> number<00:01:18.920> one<00:01:19.130> the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
it's gonna be very quick number one the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.999 
it's gonna be very quick number one the
flashes<00:01:19.880> we<00:01:20.060> need<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.450> number<00:01:21.140> two<00:01:21.350> I<00:01:21.560> don't

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
flashes we need to number two I don't

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.649 
flashes we need to number two I don't
know<00:01:22.100> how<00:01:22.250> long<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.520> flashes<00:01:22.850> last<00:01:23.090> because<00:01:23.540> I

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
know how long the flashes last because I

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.179 
know how long the flashes last because I
keep<00:01:23.840> wanting<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.110> count<00:01:24.469> every<00:01:24.710> time<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.009> get

going to be the model sizes the model
sizes<00:01:43.549> are<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.700> major<00:01:43.880> issue<00:01:44.180> right<00:01:44.420> now

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
sizes are a major issue right now

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.990 
sizes are a major issue right now
because<00:01:44.960> what<00:01:45.500> I<00:01:45.530> see<00:01:45.890> on<00:01:45.920> maps<00:01:46.280> like<00:01:46.490> de<00:01:46.640> dust2

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
because what I see on maps like de dust2

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.039 
because what I see on maps like de dust2
we're<00:01:47.210> gonna<00:01:47.299> is<00:01:47.420> use<00:01:47.630> it<00:01:47.780> as<00:01:47.869> an<00:01:47.990> example

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
we're gonna is use it as an example

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.779 
we're gonna is use it as an example

going<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.220> molotov<00:02:59.670> the<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.420> tunnels<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.430> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
going to molotov the the tunnels and the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.560 
going to molotov the the tunnels and the
T's<00:03:02.610> are<00:03:02.640> stuck<00:03:02.970> there<00:03:03.150> all<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.360> sudden

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
T's are stuck there all the sudden

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.470 
T's are stuck there all the sudden
whoops<00:03:04.380> they<00:03:04.830> can't<00:03:05.010> do<00:03:05.070> anything<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.640> then

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
whoops they can't do anything and then

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.700 
whoops they can't do anything and then
once<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.660> multi<00:03:06.930> was<00:03:07.020> about<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.230> go<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.470> flash

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
once that multi was about to go to flash

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.020 
once that multi was about to go to flash
it<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.070> then<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.340> whole<00:03:08.460> team<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.700> blind<00:03:08.880> for

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
it and then the whole team is blind for

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.760 
it and then the whole team is blind for
like<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.300> bajillion<00:03:09.450> seconds<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.170> it'll<00:03:10.500> smoke

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
like a bajillion seconds and it'll smoke

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.170 
like a bajillion seconds and it'll smoke
it<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.040> smokes<00:03:11.280> are<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:11.490> thick<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.970> you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
it the smokes are so thick that you

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.070 
it the smokes are so thick that you
don't<00:03:12.330> want<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.510> go<00:03:12.570> through<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:12.810> they're<00:03:12.960> just

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
don't want to go through it they're just

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.940 
don't want to go through it they're just
gonna<00:03:13.170> spray<00:03:13.350> through<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.650> kill<00:03:13.800> all<00:03:13.920> of

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
gonna spray through it and kill all of

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.070 
gonna spray through it and kill all of
you<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:15.030> issue<00:03:15.120> right<00:03:15.330> now<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.540> in

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
you so the issue right now is in

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.810 
you so the issue right now is in
counter-strike<00:03:16.320> 1.6<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:17.070> had<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> very<00:03:17.490> wide

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
counter-strike 1.6 you had a very wide

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.240 
counter-strike 1.6 you had a very wide
exit<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.450> be<00:03:18.570> bomb<00:03:18.750> site<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.650> feel<00:03:19.980> that

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
exit to the be bomb site and I feel that

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.100 
exit to the be bomb site and I feel that
that<00:03:20.400> was<00:03:20.610> an<00:03:20.730> absolutely<00:03:21.300> great<00:03:21.690> way<00:03:22.050> to

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
that was an absolutely great way to

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.080 
that was an absolutely great way to
introduce<00:03:22.710> this<00:03:23.100> all<00:03:23.400> he's<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.610> battlefield<00:03:23.880> 3

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
introduce this all he's a battlefield 3

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.910 
introduce this all he's a battlefield 3
example<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.690> can't<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.020> simply<00:03:25.350> run<00:03:25.710> around

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
example you can't just simply run around

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.530 
example you can't just simply run around
with<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.100> shotgun<00:03:26.340> at<00:03:26.640> point<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.000> click<00:03:27.150> or<00:03:27.450> an

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
with a shotgun at point and click or an

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.180 
with a shotgun at point and click or an
automatic<00:03:27.960> weapon<00:03:28.260> because<00:03:28.800> that's<00:03:28.950> not<00:03:29.070> how

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
automatic weapon because that's not how

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.400 
automatic weapon because that's not how
it<00:03:29.340> works<00:03:29.580> it's<00:03:29.790> an<00:03:29.880> open<00:03:30.330> playing<00:03:30.810> field<00:03:30.960> I

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
it works it's an open playing field I

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.450 
it works it's an open playing field I
don't<00:03:31.770> think<00:03:31.920> that's<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.100> counter-strike

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
don't think that's a counter-strike

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.100 
don't think that's a counter-strike
needs<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:33.030> it's<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.210> good<00:03:33.300> example<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.960> needs

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
needs but it's a good example it needs

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.260 
needs but it's a good example it needs
to<00:03:34.260> be<00:03:34.350> more<00:03:34.560> open<00:03:35.070> I'm<00:03:35.580> sure<00:03:35.790> we<00:03:35.970> have<00:03:36.090> linear

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
to be more open I'm sure we have linear

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.790 
to be more open I'm sure we have linear
paths<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.840> bomb<00:03:36.990> sites<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.320> only<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.560> few

window door and the tunnels but there

window door and the tunnels but there
needs<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.570> be<00:03:42.600> more<00:03:42.840> accessibility<00:03:43.410> if<00:03:43.800> we

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
needs to be more accessibility if we

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.110 
needs to be more accessibility if we
need<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.100> shrink<00:03:44.310> those<00:03:44.460> model<00:03:44.730> sizes<00:03:45.000> down

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
need to shrink those model sizes down

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.060 
need to shrink those model sizes down
also<00:03:45.540> de<00:03:45.900> nuke<00:03:46.200> we<00:03:46.350> cannot<00:03:46.650> make<00:03:46.770> it<00:03:46.920> the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.730 
game will see some new maps there may be

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
bigger that's fine as well but I would

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.100 
bigger that's fine as well but I would
rather<00:04:01.890> see<00:04:02.220> things<00:04:02.790> shrunk<00:04:03.150> down<00:04:03.390> like<00:04:03.990> the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
rather see things shrunk down like the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.230 
rather see things shrunk down like the
models<00:04:04.440> then<00:04:05.370> have<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.670> make<00:04:05.820> bigger<00:04:06.000> maps

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
models then have to make bigger maps

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.910 
models then have to make bigger maps
because<00:04:06.390> that's<00:04:06.660> harder<00:04:06.990> to<00:04:07.020> do<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.620> mean<00:04:07.830> this

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
because that's harder to do I mean this

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.800 
because that's harder to do I mean this
is<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.190> simple<00:04:08.520> solution<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.210> think<00:04:09.630> this

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
is the simple solution and I think this

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.210 
is the simple solution and I think this
has<00:04:09.930> been<00:04:10.020> discussed<00:04:10.140> meeting<00:04:10.590> pardon<00:04:11.040> me<00:04:11.130> if

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
has been discussed meeting pardon me if

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.800 
has been discussed meeting pardon me if
I'm<00:04:11.340> wrong<00:04:11.520> but<00:04:11.580> it<00:04:12.060> sounds<00:04:12.390> like<00:04:12.450> after

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
I'm wrong but it sounds like after

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.090 
I'm wrong but it sounds like after

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
Aztec and I mean it's not a map thing

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.360 
Aztec and I mean it's not a map thing
it's<00:04:51.900> not<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.080> glitch<00:04:52.350> thing<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:52.770> just<00:04:52.950> happens

it's not a glitch thing it just happens
a<00:04:53.490> lot<00:04:53.870> not<00:04:54.870> only<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.110> if<00:04:55.470> there<00:04:55.620> are<00:04:55.680> three

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
a lot not only that if there are three

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.160 
a lot not only that if there are three
terrorists<00:04:56.610> remaining<00:04:57.030> I<00:04:57.150> always<00:04:57.720> think

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
terrorists remaining I always think

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.620 
terrorists remaining I always think
they're<00:04:58.740> in<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:58.950> same<00:04:59.130> place<00:04:59.340> because<00:05:00.030> once

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
they're in the same place because once

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.330 
they're in the same place because once
one<00:05:00.840> person<00:05:00.870> moves<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.410> echo<00:05:01.650> is<00:05:01.770> so<00:05:01.890> terrible

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
one person moves the echo is so terrible

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.890 
one person moves the echo is so terrible
that<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.700> think<00:05:03.030> there's<00:05:03.270> three<00:05:03.420> people<00:05:03.750> there

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
that I think there's three people there

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.300 
that I think there's three people there
if<00:05:04.050> there<00:05:04.350> are<00:05:04.440> three<00:05:04.650> people<00:05:04.740> there<00:05:05.010> I<00:05:05.040> think

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
if there are three people there I think

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.710 
if there are three people there I think
it's<00:05:05.460> one<00:05:05.670> because<00:05:06.060> I've<00:05:06.300> been<00:05:06.330> tricked<00:05:06.630> so

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
it's one because I've been tricked so

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.540 
it's one because I've been tricked so
many<00:05:06.900> times<00:05:07.110> that<00:05:07.260> that's<00:05:07.800> what<00:05:07.980> I<00:05:08.010> think<00:05:08.280> so

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
many times that that's what I think so

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.280 
many times that that's what I think so
