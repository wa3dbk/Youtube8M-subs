00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:26.839 
looks like any any other 911 but there's

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.470 
looks like any any other 911 but there's
some<00:00:27.019> very<00:00:27.320> unique<00:00:27.560> features<00:00:27.849> about<00:00:28.849> this<00:00:29.210> car

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
that in my opinion make it want to be

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.450 
that in my opinion make it want to be
very<00:00:33.890> best<00:00:34.220> 911s<00:00:35.080> horses<00:00:36.080> ever<00:00:36.230> built

very best 911s horses ever built
so<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.420> Targa<00:00:40.310> well<00:00:41.310> a<00:00:41.550> Targa

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
so what is it Targa well a Targa

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.740 
so what is it Targa well a Targa
initially<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.200> Porsche<00:00:43.530> was<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.360> pop-up<00:00:45.360> roof

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
initially with Porsche was a pop-up roof

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.590 
initially with Porsche was a pop-up roof
section<00:00:46.430> it<00:00:47.430> doesn't<00:00:47.730> look<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:47.970> a<00:00:48.060> pop-up<00:00:48.450> roof

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
section it doesn't look as a pop-up roof

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.020 
section it doesn't look as a pop-up roof
here<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.130> you<00:00:50.220> look<00:00:50.370> closely<00:00:50.610> you'll<00:00:50.940> see

here but if you look closely you'll see

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.200 
here but if you look closely you'll see
this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> glass<00:00:52.110> panel<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.850> my<00:00:53.940> hand

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210

underneath<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> glass<00:00:56.270> for<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.330> ninth<00:00:57.800> 9-3

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
underneath the glass for the ninth 9-3

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.490 
underneath the glass for the ninth 9-3
Targa<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.300> last<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> air-cooled<00:01:00.900> car<00:01:01.350> is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
Targa the last of the air-cooled car is

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.930 
Targa the last of the air-cooled car is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
came up with this glass panel system

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.670 
came up with this glass panel system
where<00:01:05.550> you<00:01:05.670> basically<00:01:05.850> got<00:01:06.210> two<00:01:06.479> glass<00:01:07.170> panels

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
where you basically got two glass panels

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.109 
where you basically got two glass panels
on<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.550> roof<00:01:08.700> here

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
on the roof here

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.400 
on the roof here
they<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:09.960> two<00:01:10.260> different<00:01:10.619> things<00:01:11.690> on<00:01:12.690> this<00:01:13.110> car

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
they do two different things on this car

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.280 
they do two different things on this car
the<00:01:13.850> center<00:01:14.850> section<00:01:15.090> will<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:16.050> drop

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
the center section will actually drop

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.550 
the center section will actually drop
down<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.860> pull<00:01:17.790> back<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.750> very<00:01:19.200> large

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
down and pull back like a very large

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.070 
down and pull back like a very large
sunroof<00:01:20.399> so<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.720> doing<00:01:21.930> here

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
sunroof so that's what I'm doing here

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.020 
sunroof so that's what I'm doing here
now<00:01:22.290> I'm<00:01:22.710> activating<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.430> off<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> switch

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
now I'm activating that off the switch

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.219 
now I'm activating that off the switch
just<00:01:24.300> right<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:24.830> it's<00:01:25.830> pretty<00:01:25.920> dark<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.460> here

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
just right here it's pretty dark in here

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.359 
just right here it's pretty dark in here
and<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.649> sudden<00:01:28.740> you've<00:01:28.950> got<00:01:29.130> a

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and then all the sudden you've got a

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.540 
and then all the sudden you've got a
very<00:01:29.729> large<00:01:29.880> sunroof<00:01:30.479> opening<00:01:31.280> that's<00:01:32.280> pretty

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
very large sunroof opening that's pretty

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.810 
very large sunroof opening that's pretty
cool<00:01:33.140> but<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.560> does<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.399> bit<00:01:35.520> more<00:01:35.580> than

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
cool but it does a little bit more than

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.510 
cool but it does a little bit more than
that<00:01:35.910> so<00:01:35.970> let's<00:01:36.119> retract<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:37.800> glass<00:01:38.039> panel

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
that so let's retract the glass panel

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.330 
that so let's retract the glass panel
and<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.960> might<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.229> thinking<00:01:40.259> well<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.039> don't

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
and you might be thinking well I don't

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.080 
and you might be thinking well I don't
know<00:01:41.399> that<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.550> want<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.850> inside<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
know that I want to be inside a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
know that I want to be inside a
greenhouse<00:01:43.040> when<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.130> driving<00:01:44.369> around<00:01:44.580> in

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
greenhouse when I'm driving around in

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.210 
greenhouse when I'm driving around in
sunny<00:01:45.060> California<00:01:45.690> so<00:01:46.290> you've<00:01:46.619> also<00:01:46.770> got<00:01:47.040> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
sunny California so you've also got this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.899 
sunny California so you've also got this
sunshade<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.210> also<00:01:48.360> works<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:50.430> block<00:01:50.640> about

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
sunshade that also works to block about

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.160 
sunshade that also works to block about
90%<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.659> UV<00:01:52.020> rays<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.170> goes

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
90% of UV rays so just like that goes

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.190 
90% of UV rays so just like that goes
dark<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:57.780> looks<00:01:57.900> like<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.080> regular

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
dark and it just looks like a regular

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.920 
dark and it just looks like a regular
911<00:01:58.770> coupe

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
911 coupe

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.000 
911 coupe
