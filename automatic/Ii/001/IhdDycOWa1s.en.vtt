my<00:00:27.079> opinion<00:00:27.230> a<00:00:27.710> very<00:00:27.739> special<00:00:28.699> character<00:00:29.239> to

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
my opinion a very special character to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.530 
my opinion a very special character to
the<00:00:29.509> DBZ<00:00:30.079> universe<00:00:30.919> I<00:00:31.130> personally<00:00:31.759> like<00:00:32.329> him

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
the DBZ universe I personally like him

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.049 
the DBZ universe I personally like him
very<00:00:32.720> much<00:00:33.230> I<00:00:33.769> think<00:00:34.399> that<00:00:34.460> its<00:00:34.699> ultimate

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
very much I think that its ultimate

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.899 
very much I think that its ultimate
attack<00:00:35.510> is<00:00:35.750> really<00:00:36.440> cool<00:00:36.680> especially<00:00:37.190> because

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:37.909 
attack is really cool especially because

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:40.210 
attack is really cool especially because
it's<00:00:38.089> done<00:00:38.360> by<00:00:38.629> one<00:00:38.989> hand<00:00:39.409> although

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
it's done by one hand although

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.649 
it's done by one hand although
unfortunately<00:00:40.850> it<00:00:41.690> is<00:00:41.930> very<00:00:42.379> weak<00:00:42.710> as<00:00:43.659> shown

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:44.659 
unfortunately it is very weak as shown
