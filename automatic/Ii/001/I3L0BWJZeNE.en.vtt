00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
probably show you so as you can tell by

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.570 
probably show you so as you can tell by
total<00:00:12.600> video<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:13.020> the<00:00:13.199> fastest<00:00:14.100> way<00:00:14.279> to<00:00:14.309> go

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
total video it's the fastest way to go

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.400 
total video it's the fastest way to go
to<00:00:14.699> travel<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.240> Minecraft<00:00:15.660> it's<00:00:15.930> faster<00:00:16.289> than

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
to travel in Minecraft it's faster than

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.890 
to travel in Minecraft it's faster than
a<00:00:16.440> horse<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:17.400> faster<00:00:17.760> than<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.030> minecart<00:00:18.630> all

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
a horse it's faster than a minecart all

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.490 
a horse it's faster than a minecart all
on<00:00:19.280> powered<00:00:20.280> rails<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.940> then<00:00:21.870> really<00:00:22.170> fastest

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
on powered rails and then really fastest

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500 
on powered rails and then really fastest
ways<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.800> know<00:00:22.950> of<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.490> it's<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.120> lot<00:00:24.330> faster

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
ways I know of but it's a lot faster

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.060 
ways I know of but it's a lot faster
than<00:00:24.750> all<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.170> their<00:00:25.289> mists<00:00:25.500> faster<00:00:25.890> than<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
than all of their mists faster than the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.480 
than all of their mists faster than the
swiftness<00:00:26.490> potion<00:00:26.970> if<00:00:27.150> that's<00:00:27.330> any<00:00:27.690> faster

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
swiftness potion if that's any faster

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.220 
swiftness potion if that's any faster
and<00:00:29.490> all<00:00:30.210> you're<00:00:30.330> gonna<00:00:30.390> need<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.690> do<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:30.960> is

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
and all you're gonna need to do this is

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.330 
and all you're gonna need to do this is
water<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.720> wood<00:00:33.720> and<00:00:33.989> that's<00:00:34.650> that's<00:00:34.980> all<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
water and wood and that's that's all the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.040 
water and wood and that's that's all the
resources<00:00:35.910> you'll<00:00:36.090> need<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.870> you're

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
resources you'll need and if you're

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.870 
resources you'll need and if you're
gonna<00:00:37.140> do<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.280> second<00:00:38.610> you'll<00:00:38.730> just

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
gonna do this in a second you'll just

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.069 
gonna do this in a second you'll just
need<00:00:39.060> a<00:00:39.090> bit<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.360> ice<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.720> I'll<00:00:39.780> show<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:39.989> that

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
need a bit of ice but I'll show you that

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.639 
need a bit of ice but I'll show you that
in<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.200> second

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
in a second

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.400 
in a second
but<00:00:41.280> all<00:00:41.370> you'll<00:00:41.520> need<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> do<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.060> is<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
but all you'll need to do this is have a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.770 
but all you'll need to do this is have a
hole<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> floor<00:00:44.130> and<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:44.760> put<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.180> bucket

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
hole in the floor and then put a bucket

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.660 
hole in the floor and then put a bucket
of<00:00:45.960> water<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.380> and<00:00:46.559> that's<00:00:47.220> probably<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> most

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
of water in and that's probably the most

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.370 
of water in and that's probably the most
cost-effective<00:00:48.390> thing<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.290> the

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
cost-effective thing in this is the

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.710 
cost-effective thing in this is the
actual<00:00:49.739> bucket<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.510> can

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
actual bucket so because you can you can

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.770 
actual bucket so because you can you can
farm<00:00:52.170> would<00:00:52.440> easily<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.390> there's<00:00:54.390> no<00:00:54.510> problem

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
farm would easily and there's no problem

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.000 
farm would easily and there's no problem
with<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.170> get<00:00:55.290> water<00:00:55.500> from<00:00:55.860> an

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
with that you can get water from an

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.459 
with that you can get water from an
infinitely<00:00:56.610> water<00:00:56.880> pool<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.780> only<00:00:58.260> real

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
infinitely water pool the only real

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.139 
infinitely water pool the only real
problem<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.160> little<00:00:59.370> three<00:00:59.820> bits<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
problem is that little three bits of

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.229 
problem is that little three bits of
iron<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.489> set<00:01:03.090> them

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
iron and all you do is you just set them

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.169 
iron and all you do is you just set them
up<00:01:03.409> these<00:01:04.409> water<00:01:04.710> blocks<00:01:05.129> two<00:01:05.700> blocks<00:01:05.999> apart

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:06.179 
up these water blocks two blocks apart

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:08.120 
up these water blocks two blocks apart
from<00:01:06.509> each<00:01:06.659> other<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.079> you<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.770> go<00:01:07.889> I'll<00:01:08.009> do

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
from each other and you just go I'll do

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.550 
from each other and you just go I'll do
that<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.609> long<00:01:08.789> as<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.119> want<00:01:09.380> no<00:01:10.380> matter

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
that for as long as you want no matter

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.959 
that for as long as you want no matter
how<00:01:10.740> far<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.100> want<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> go<00:01:11.429> this<00:01:11.609> will<00:01:11.789> work

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969 
how far you want to go this will work

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.039 
how far you want to go this will work
forever<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.289> ever<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:14.359> the<00:01:15.359> crucial<00:01:15.569> part<00:01:15.929> is

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
forever and ever and the crucial part is

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.629 
forever and ever and the crucial part is
the<00:01:16.170> two<00:01:16.319> blocks<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.859> then<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.399> you're<00:01:17.520> done

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:17.639 
the two blocks and then when you're done

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:19.580 
the two blocks and then when you're done
with<00:01:17.789> that<00:01:17.819> you<00:01:17.999> just<00:01:18.119> put<00:01:18.299> boats<00:01:18.569> all<00:01:18.899> along

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
with that you just put boats all along

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.679 
with that you just put boats all along
the<00:01:19.799> top<00:01:19.829> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.249> water<00:01:20.459> and<00:01:20.759> I'm<00:01:21.539> actually

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the top of the water and I'm actually

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.359 
the top of the water and I'm actually
going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.109> show<00:01:22.289> you<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.529> it's<00:01:22.679> a<00:01:22.770> lot<00:01:22.950> faster

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
going to show you that it's a lot faster

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.219 
going to show you that it's a lot faster
than<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.700> powered<00:01:24.149> minecart<00:01:24.719> all<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.170> way

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
than a powered minecart all the way

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.489 
than a powered minecart all the way
going<00:01:25.439> down<00:01:25.679> here<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:27.329> I<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.779> try<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.139> show

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499 
going down here so if I can try and show

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:31.099 
going down here so if I can try and show
you<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.740> real<00:01:29.100> fast<00:01:29.929> I'll<00:01:30.929> actually

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
you this real fast I'll actually

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:34.249 
you this real fast I'll actually
overtake<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.979> minecart<00:01:32.429> and<00:01:32.689> achey<00:01:33.689> jump<00:01:34.109> out

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
overtake the minecart and achey jump out

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.529 
overtake the minecart and achey jump out
and<00:01:34.469> beef<00:01:34.950> here<00:01:35.249> faster<00:01:35.789> than<00:01:35.819> the<00:01:36.119> minecart

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
and beef here faster than the minecart

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.349 
and beef here faster than the minecart
gets<00:01:36.779> there<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.219> all<00:01:38.219> you<00:01:38.369> got<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.999> as

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
gets there and all you got to do is as

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:40.940 
gets there and all you got to do is as
you<00:01:39.450> saw<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.689> right<00:01:40.139> click<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.679> way

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
you saw just right click all the way

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.289 
you saw just right click all the way
along<00:01:41.219> and<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:41.700> when<00:01:41.849> something<00:01:42.179> like<00:01:42.240> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
along and then when something like that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.690 
along and then when something like that
happens<00:01:42.389> you<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.840> got<00:01:42.959> to<00:01:43.020> replace<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> boat

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
happens you just got to replace the boat

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.819 
happens you just got to replace the boat
you<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.909> click<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.749> the<00:01:46.109> way<00:01:46.229> along<00:01:46.469> on<00:01:46.709> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
you just click all the way along on to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.069 
you just click all the way along on to
the<00:01:46.919> next<00:01:47.099> boat<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:48.389> actually<00:01:48.810> faster

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the next boat and it's actually faster

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.499 
the next boat and it's actually faster
than<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.499> horse<00:01:49.709> the<00:01:50.069> minecart<00:01:50.549> swiftness<00:01:51.179> if

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
than the horse the minecart swiftness if

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.499 
than the horse the minecart swiftness if
yeah<00:01:51.959> if<00:01:52.079> that's<00:01:52.229> even<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.590> contender<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.729> it's

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
yeah if that's even a contender but it's

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.870 
yeah if that's even a contender but it's
really<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.560> cheap<00:01:55.919> to<00:01:56.099> do<00:01:56.219> because<00:01:56.429> wood

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
really really cheap to do because wood

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.010 
really really cheap to do because wood
is<00:01:57.319> super<00:01:58.319> easy<00:01:58.349> to<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:58.799> water<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.489> can<00:01:59.639> get

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
is super easy to get water you can get

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.219 
is super easy to get water you can get
Arion<00:02:01.020> three<00:02:01.529> ingots<00:02:02.489> is<00:02:02.789> nothing<00:02:03.209> and<00:02:03.389> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
Arion three ingots is nothing and the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.959 
Arion three ingots is nothing and the
cool<00:02:04.409> thing<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.799> do<00:02:05.069> with<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.669> if

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
cool thing you can do with this is if

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.789 
cool thing you can do with this is if
you've<00:02:06.119> got<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.389> a<00:02:06.450> sky<00:02:06.840> base<00:02:07.139> or<00:02:07.499> you<00:02:07.619> want

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
you've got like a sky base or you want

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.170 
you've got like a sky base or you want
to<00:02:07.889> make<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> sky<00:02:08.369> base<00:02:08.610> or<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.880> want<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> make<00:02:09.149> a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
to make a sky base or you want to make a

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.840 
to make a sky base or you want to make a
a<00:02:09.509> mob<00:02:09.990> proof<00:02:10.380> bridge<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.700> is

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
a mob proof bridge then this is

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.150 
a mob proof bridge then this is
definitely<00:02:12.440> something<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.590> could<00:02:13.860> do<00:02:14.010> right

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
definitely something you could do right

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.809 
definitely something you could do right
here

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
here

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.849 
here
and<00:02:14.909> all<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.180> got<00:02:15.269> to<00:02:15.329> do<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.659> put<00:02:15.900> ice<00:02:16.109> up<00:02:16.590> in

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
and all you got to do is put ice up in

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.459 
and all you got to do is put ice up in
the<00:02:17.209> up<00:02:18.209> in<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.480> sky<00:02:18.689> right<00:02:18.989> here<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.379> then

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
the up in the sky right here and then

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.379 
the up in the sky right here and then
wait<00:02:19.709> for<00:02:19.799> it<00:02:19.859> to<00:02:20.010> melt<00:02:20.159> and<00:02:20.459> put<00:02:20.879> boats<00:02:21.120> all

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:21.389 
wait for it to melt and put boats all

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:22.729 
wait for it to melt and put boats all
along<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.689> top<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.079> you<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.319> actually<00:02:22.409> have

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
along the top and you can actually have

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.610 
along the top and you can actually have
a<00:02:22.950> float<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:24.120> floating<00:02:24.900> bridge<00:02:25.200> or<00:02:25.590> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
a float in a floating bridge or the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.949 
a float in a floating bridge or the
fastest<00:02:26.159> way<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.549> travel<00:02:26.819> in<00:02:27.359> the<00:02:27.450> air<00:02:27.569> as<00:02:27.810> well

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
fastest way to travel in the air as well

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.520 
fastest way to travel in the air as well
so<00:02:28.349> that's<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.849> right<00:02:30.030> there<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.409> could

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
so that's that right there and you could

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.869 
so that's that right there and you could
also<00:02:31.650> use<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:33.319> ascending<00:02:34.319> tall<00:02:34.879> tall

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
also use it for like ascending tall tall

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.759 
also use it for like ascending tall tall
stories<00:02:36.329> I<00:02:36.510> guess<00:02:36.689> like<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.409> almost<00:02:37.530> do

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
stories I guess like you can almost do

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.129 
stories I guess like you can almost do
it<00:02:37.889> like<00:02:38.189> a<00:02:38.430> staircase<00:02:38.939> and<00:02:39.359> it's<00:02:39.750> same<00:02:39.900> again

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
it like a staircase and it's same again

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.309 
it like a staircase and it's same again
you<00:02:40.230> just<00:02:40.439> travel<00:02:40.859> up<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.810> just<00:02:42.810> jump<00:02:43.109> out<00:02:43.260> at

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
you just travel up and just jump out at

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.349 
you just travel up and just jump out at
the<00:02:43.650> required<00:02:44.579> destination<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.269> you've

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
the required destination that you've

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.209 
the required destination that you've
stopped<00:02:45.569> at<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.650> that's<00:02:46.739> another<00:02:47.040> cool<00:02:47.189> thing

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
stopped at and that's another cool thing

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.300 
stopped at and that's another cool thing
with<00:02:47.489> this<00:02:47.609> is<00:02:47.959> say<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.019> want<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.349> go<00:02:49.500> all<00:02:50.250> the

with this is say you want to go all the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.039 
with this is say you want to go all the
way<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.909> the<00:02:51.120> end<00:02:51.239> but<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.659> there's<00:02:51.840> something

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
way to the end but you there's something

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.689 
way to the end but you there's something
you<00:02:52.260> want<00:02:52.409> to<00:02:52.469> stop<00:02:52.680> off<00:02:52.859> halfway<00:02:53.099> all<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.609> got

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:53.699 
you want to stop off halfway all you got

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:55.909 
you want to stop off halfway all you got
to<00:02:53.790> do<00:02:53.879> is<00:02:54.060> stop<00:02:54.389> off<00:02:54.599> halfway<00:02:55.019> jump<00:02:55.500> out<00:02:55.680> get

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
to do is stop off halfway jump out get

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.020 
to do is stop off halfway jump out get
back<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.489> then<00:02:56.579> go<00:02:56.909> off<00:02:57.269> again<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.730> my<00:02:59.730> god

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
back in and then go off again and my god

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.490 
back in and then go off again and my god
is<00:03:00.209> this<00:03:00.389> the<00:03:00.510> fastest<00:03:00.900> way<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.049> travel<00:03:01.349> I'll

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
is this the fastest way to travel I'll

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.729 
is this the fastest way to travel I'll
show<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.799> again<00:03:02.159> right<00:03:02.400> here<00:03:03.290> I'll<00:03:04.290> even<00:03:04.530> let

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
show you again right here I'll even let

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.589 
show you again right here I'll even let
the<00:03:04.859> mind<00:03:05.099> car<00:03:05.370> go<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:05.549> bit<00:03:05.730> ahead<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:06.419> can

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
the mind car go a bit ahead and I can

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.390 
the mind car go a bit ahead and I can
still<00:03:06.870> catch<00:03:07.079> up<00:03:07.139> with<00:03:07.409> it<00:03:07.469> and<00:03:07.739> jump<00:03:08.219> out

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
still catch up with it and jump out

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.939 
still catch up with it and jump out
before<00:03:08.669> it's<00:03:09.150> even<00:03:09.449> made<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.750> halfway<00:03:10.260> roughly

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:10.949 
before it's even made it halfway roughly

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:14.899 
before it's even made it halfway roughly
so<00:03:11.669> this<00:03:12.480> trick<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:13.489> definitely<00:03:14.489> one<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.760> the
