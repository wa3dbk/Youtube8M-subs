00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:17.460
 not very useful but who can be funny 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.070

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.790
 a small studio 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.920
 for example 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.750

 you have it confirmed confirm 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.780
 in the immediate future so I will not do it 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.800
 and after 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.130
 you go into settings 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.910
 and we will go 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.790
 you have december 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.360
 then Catherine Scheffler 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.120
 and after 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120
 c

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.630
 and for 100 m 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.000
 but each of them 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.400
 standing 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.980
 christened 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.980
 bullock or skate because for example at 8 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.689
 it is the object unlock if I do that 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.119
 it will not unfold 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.839
 so what if jacky 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.369
 which is rusty 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:23.129
 on time 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.870
 that she had not taken off for young active 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.289
 I can do it too 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.719
 but I can not disavow it 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.469
 while m 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.399
 and for the celebration I do not know what is it 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.389
 the story 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.609
 it does not vibrate 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.119
 Furthermore 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:45.329
 they indeed signed Sunday his victory 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.399
 so we do not know why 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.399
 then the destination 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.829
 when 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:01.999
 an example 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:02.999
 and I'm going back 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.169
 his passion for this crime 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.019
 and so difficult that it means that in fact he will exactly close it 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.019
 we had to post the most searched on the web 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.730
 but on the script the farms he puts this date while the dollar gets 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.509
 directly questioned 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.649
 on the small difference 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.649
 and activating hunted party methods 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.229
 I am in prison neither 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.389
 in this sense we do not really care together 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.549
 each timesheet on the status bar 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.549
 8:02 p.m. 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.929
 already cited illicit 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.429
 Alger 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.229
 not satisfied with the labors 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:49.489
 in fact that and when my son he must like this one is here used 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.489
 serra 06 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:56.200
 yes the only left 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.459
 ranked right on the left picture but they use sites like his 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.169
 bandwidth series 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.599
 philippe pissier to the boulevard 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.699
 from the bar of what makes us sarko or mestizo to what you 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.699
 said without a doubt 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.090
 he was holding a seven-island bar 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.439
 he was driving 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:24.180
 I still learn josÃ© then twice on the tour we vote door 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.770
 once on two continents 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.770
 it's purchasing power 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.800
 if you hold 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.819
 strongly 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.819
 all this for high stick 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.330
 where stood a little loved it's going 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.879
 Saint-Nazaire where the screen retha a little game 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.879
 the button so little show 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.050
 you tap the web 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.379
 the volume indicator 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.879
 him who wanted any criticism 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.800
 sierre 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.930
 so we do 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.559

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.960
 crawley 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.919
 and downstairs 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.930
 here a mail 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.930
 in 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.710
 I am surprised 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.400
 I am convinced about Israel since the band 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.319
 not too much about the spa 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.499
 I did not understand 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:47.499
 so what the device could touch is like that 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.800
 and this one not here we are 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.869
 I'm going to roll I said the roads 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:01.869
 on the other hand nothing 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.279
 that's why this 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:07.279
 it is 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.389
 ah yes it's from bush applications can same time 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.610

 Saturday draw by taking his task for example 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.080
 stuff like that 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.129
 here we are 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.590
 it's pretty much everyone that it was to show how to shake 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:30.040
 for you 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.580

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.719
 She is like that 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:43.529
