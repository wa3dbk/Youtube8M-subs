hello welcome to how to draw Celtic

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.730 
hello welcome to how to draw Celtic
knots<00:00:03.000> run<00:00:03.840> out<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> little<00:00:04.170> bit<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.440> space<00:00:04.589> on

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
knots run out a little bit of space on

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.490 
knots run out a little bit of space on
the<00:00:04.830> camera<00:00:05.220> but<00:00:05.400> as<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.150> can<00:00:06.270> see<00:00:06.480> here<00:00:06.779> I've

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the camera but as you can see here I've

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.370 
the camera but as you can see here I've
completed<00:00:07.950> half<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:09.300> our<00:00:09.690> double<00:00:09.990> triskele

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
completed half of our double triskele

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.280 
completed half of our double triskele
from<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.429> book<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.730> kells<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.809> on<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> chiro

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
from the book of kells it's on the chiro

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.499 
from the book of kells it's on the chiro
page<00:00:13.620> I'm<00:00:14.429> going<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.639> do<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.030> just<00:00:15.179> lightly

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
page I'm going to do is just lightly

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.740 
page I'm going to do is just lightly
erase<00:00:16.100> the<00:00:17.100> pencil<00:00:17.310> spine<00:00:17.910> from<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.570> one

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
erase the pencil spine from this one

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:28.130 
erase the pencil spine from this one
half<00:00:21.830> and<00:00:23.600> start<00:00:24.600> hatching<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:27.689> negative

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
half and start hatching in the negative

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.680 
half and start hatching in the negative
space<00:00:28.289> here<00:00:32.000> it's<00:00:33.000> interesting<00:00:33.300> because<00:00:33.540> this

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
space here it's interesting because this

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.549 
space here it's interesting because this
pattern<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.760> a<00:00:35.760> variant<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.809> trillium

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
pattern is a variant of to trillium

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.420 
pattern is a variant of to trillium
shapes<00:00:38.510> you<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.629> see<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> one<00:00:40.140> spot<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:41.010> if

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
shapes you can see the one spot here if

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.940 
shapes you can see the one spot here if
this<00:00:41.670> was<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.180> by<00:00:42.840> itself<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.500> joined<00:00:43.770> up

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
this was just it by itself and joined up

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.310 
this was just it by itself and joined up
you<00:00:44.070> could<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.570> that<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.629> would<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you could see that it would be a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.029 
you could see that it would be a
Trillium<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.820> we've<00:00:48.530> doubled<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.620> over<00:00:49.829> here

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
Trillium but we've doubled it over here

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920 
Trillium but we've doubled it over here
so<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:50.700> connect<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.449> that's<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:51.899> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
so that they connect and that's one of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.479 
so that they connect and that's one of
the<00:00:52.050> beautiful<00:00:52.350> things<00:00:52.530> about<00:00:52.770> Celtic<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the beautiful things about Celtic to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.380 
the beautiful things about Celtic to
science<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:55.129> think<00:00:56.129> Celtic<00:00:56.370> knots<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.969> really

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
science I think Celtic knots are really

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.139 
science I think Celtic knots are really
inspired<00:00:57.960> by<00:00:59.480> nature<00:01:01.820> there<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:02.850> like

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
inspired by nature there are like

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.020 
inspired by nature there are like
footsteps<00:01:03.979> they're<00:01:04.979> like<00:01:05.250> dance<00:01:05.519> steps<00:01:05.850> but

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
footsteps they're like dance steps but

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.870 
footsteps they're like dance steps but
they're<00:01:06.180> also<00:01:06.470> like<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> branches<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.850> tree

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
they're also like the branches of a tree

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.870 
they're also like the branches of a tree
or<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.869> roots<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> tree<00:01:13.530> or<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.979> plant<00:01:14.340> even

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.620 

right<00:01:18.350> I'm<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.630> soft

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
right I'm just going to do like a soft

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.010 
right I'm just going to do like a soft
edge<00:01:22.759> around<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:26.540> double<00:01:27.540> hatch<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.900> when

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
edge around here double hatch is when

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.190 
edge around here double hatch is when
you<00:01:28.110> draw<00:01:28.290> one<00:01:28.470> way<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.829> then<00:01:29.130> cross<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.670> way

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
you draw one way and then cross this way

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.100 
you draw one way and then cross this way
I'm<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.350> doing<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> single<00:01:32.100> hatch<00:01:33.320> slowly

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
I'm just doing the single hatch slowly

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.530 
I'm just doing the single hatch slowly
with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.380> small<00:01:38.220> marker<00:01:38.610> will<00:01:39.210> get<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
with the small marker will get to the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.510 
with the small marker will get to the
fat<00:01:39.720> marker<00:01:40.140> once<00:01:40.350> we've<00:01:41.060> doubled<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:43.520> let's

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
fat marker once we've doubled this let's

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.880 
fat marker once we've doubled this let's
get<00:01:44.790> down<00:01:45.000> here

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.469 

alright<00:01:49.890> let's<00:01:50.219> just<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.609> like<00:01:50.850> another<00:01:51.149> bit

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
alright let's just do like another bit

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.050 
alright let's just do like another bit
of<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.659> hatch<00:01:51.869> around<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:52.820> one<00:01:53.820> thing<00:01:53.969> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
of a hatch around here one thing I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.919 
of a hatch around here one thing I
noticed<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.719> design<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:56.929> the

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
noticed about this design is that the

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.130 
noticed about this design is that the
book<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.289> kells<00:01:59.600> there's<00:02:00.600> little<00:02:00.840> dots

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
book of kells there's little dots

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.809 
book of kells there's little dots
there's<00:02:01.679> one<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:02.960> circle<00:02:03.960> there's<00:02:04.920> one<00:02:05.009> here

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
there's one here circle there's one here

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.710 
there's one here circle there's one here
and<00:02:06.950> there's<00:02:07.950> one<00:02:08.220> here<00:02:11.209> they<00:02:12.209> just<00:02:12.239> added

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and there's one here they just added

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.000 
and there's one here they just added
those<00:02:13.019> I'm<00:02:13.650> sure<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.400> fill<00:02:14.670> up<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.150> space

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
those I'm sure just to fill up the space

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.729 
those I'm sure just to fill up the space
it<00:02:17.010> balances<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.730> out<00:02:17.879> a<00:02:18.150> bit<00:02:18.560> if<00:02:19.560> you've<00:02:19.709> got

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
it balances it out a bit if you've got

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.319 
it balances it out a bit if you've got
too<00:02:19.980> much<00:02:20.099> negative<00:02:20.310> space<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:22.530> draws<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:22.950> eye

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
too much negative space it draws the eye

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.430 
too much negative space it draws the eye
towards<00:02:24.329> it<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:26.760> want<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.810> focus<00:02:28.079> to<00:02:28.290> be

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
towards it and you want the focus to be

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.229 
towards it and you want the focus to be
not<00:02:28.860> on<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.099> negative<00:02:29.400> space<00:02:29.459> but<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
not on the negative space but on the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.520 
not on the negative space but on the
design<00:02:30.599> itself<00:02:32.329> so<00:02:33.329> you<00:02:33.989> can<00:02:34.140> start<00:02:34.349> to<00:02:34.440> see

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
design itself so you can start to see

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.900 
design itself so you can start to see
what<00:02:34.739> we're<00:02:34.829> going<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.010> do<00:02:35.099> in<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:35.700> next

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
what we're going to do in the next

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.400 
what we're going to do in the next
several<00:02:36.209> segments<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.780> actually<00:02:37.230> going

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
several segments is actually going

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.550 
several segments is actually going
through<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:38.069> making<00:02:38.280> these<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:39.560> uniform

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
through and making these a uniform

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.610 
through and making these a uniform
thickness<00:02:40.829> like<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:42.590> great<00:02:45.319> alright<00:02:46.319> let's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
thickness like this great alright let's

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.490 
thickness like this great alright let's
finish<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.370> design<00:02:47.879> of<00:02:48.150> here<00:02:49.129> worn<00:02:50.129> under

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
finish this design of here worn under
