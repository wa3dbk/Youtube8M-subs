00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:45.669 
I really liked about this game is like
The<00:01:44.840> Walking<00:01:44.960> Dead<00:01:45.259> game<00:01:45.289> you've<00:01:45.649> got

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
The Walking Dead game you've got

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.429 
The Walking Dead game you've got
decisions<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.490> matter<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:48.200> have

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
decisions that matter and you have

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.529 
decisions that matter and you have
dialogue<00:01:48.950> choices<00:01:49.159> that<00:01:49.520> matter<00:01:49.819> I<00:01:50.090> feel<00:01:50.450> that

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
dialogue choices that matter I feel that

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.410 
dialogue choices that matter I feel that
having<00:01:50.719> decisions<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:51.469> matter<00:01:51.679> and<00:01:51.979> games

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
having decisions that matter and games

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.819 
having decisions that matter and games
it<00:01:53.420> really<00:01:53.780> increases<00:01:53.959> the<00:01:54.439> replayability

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
it really increases the replayability

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.949 
it really increases the replayability
because<00:01:55.579> Jen<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.149> want<00:01:56.329> to<00:01:56.390> replay<00:01:56.659> it<00:01:56.750> again

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
because Jen you want to replay it again

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.410 
because Jen you want to replay it again
and<00:01:57.319> see<00:01:57.380> what's<00:01:58.250> gonna<00:01:58.549> be<00:01:58.819> different<00:01:59.000> if<00:01:59.390> you

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
and see what's gonna be different if you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.059

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.690 
on the other thing I really like about
this<00:03:32.750> game<00:03:32.990> is<00:03:33.170> that<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.770> is<00:03:33.920> a<00:03:33.950> mystery<00:03:34.370> and

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
this game is that it is a mystery and

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.340 
this game is that it is a mystery and
you<00:03:34.850> are<00:03:35.180> cleaning<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.480> role<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.840> detectives

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
you are cleaning the role the detectives

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.200 
you are cleaning the role the detectives
so<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.560> got<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.770> figure<00:03:36.950> out<00:03:37.190> what<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.790> pieces

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
so you got to figure out what the pieces

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.670 
so you got to figure out what the pieces
are<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:38.570> got<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.810> put<00:03:38.930> them<00:03:39.020> together<00:03:39.110> the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
are and you got to put them together the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.380 
are and you got to put them together the
only<00:03:39.860> thing<00:03:40.070> I<00:03:40.160> could<00:03:40.220> find<00:03:40.370> that<00:03:40.820> was<00:03:40.940> bad

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
only thing I could find that was bad

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.420 
only thing I could find that was bad
about<00:03:41.750> this<00:03:42.080> game<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:42.500> know<00:03:42.560> when<00:03:42.890> reviews<00:03:43.280> are

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
about this game I know when reviews are

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.350 
about this game I know when reviews are
supposed<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.700> kind<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:44.000> weigh<00:03:44.060> out<00:03:44.210> the<00:03:44.240> pros

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
supposed to kind of weigh out the pros

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.690 
supposed to kind of weigh out the pros
and<00:03:44.540> cons<00:03:44.720> was<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:45.710> had<00:03:45.740> a<00:03:45.860> choppy<00:03:46.250> frame

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
and cons was that it had a choppy frame

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.160 
and cons was that it had a choppy frame
rate<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.240> was<00:03:47.330> a<00:03:47.390> little<00:03:47.630> laggy<00:03:47.870> and

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
rate and that it was a little laggy and

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.570 
rate and that it was a little laggy and
they're<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.320> couple<00:03:48.560> glitches<00:03:48.830> but<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.340> didn't

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
they're a couple glitches but I didn't

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.890 
they're a couple glitches but I didn't
really<00:03:49.610> see<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:50.000> as<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.150> big<00:03:50.330> problem<00:03:50.780> and

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
really see that as a big problem and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.900 
really see that as a big problem and
it's<00:03:51.560> also<00:03:51.710> something<00:03:52.010> that<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:52.250> believe<00:03:52.640> not

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
it's also something that I believe not

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.640 
it's also something that I believe not
