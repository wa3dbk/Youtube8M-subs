00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:15.420
 the service manager and in the background 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.240
 are a crunchy solo in the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.950
 muur whether with the mp 7 on dom of one 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.740
 clear co-leader I'm like I'm the one 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.510
 leader in the other shows left and yes that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.480
 Word still with his old gamertag 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.000
 krax better and yes that's yes 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.860
 the well-known commentary contest 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.650
 video leads matter of gameplay to the god 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.710
 quite a set where the three guys 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.440
 once michelle abrupt job and gogo's 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.750
 asked a few questions that were 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.090
 By the way , I believe that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.280
 expects four questions the first question is 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.880
 why I am in the comments contest 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.829
 participate 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.420
 So that's really for me 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.120
 simply because i am a commentator of 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.130
 really with a lot of heart soul what you are 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.810
 Anything can be calculated, too 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.370
 the pc puts the microphone in front of him 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.350
 and then just start 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.570
 commented on special topics in call 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.610
 of duty in general so to the content of 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.229
 call of duty or just about others 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.360
 themes that we watch from my audience 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.520
 get asked and that is mine 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.720
 main reason why I comment on that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.460
 want to participate in the contest 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.770
 The second reason is, of course, too 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.330
 nor do I want my grasp hold 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 even to expand a few people 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.350
 that understand my humor and also 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.170
 I hope I could at least share 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.340
 and yes that was the first question why me 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.600
 Participate in the comments contest 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.450
 want or or 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.250
 why I join in and the second 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.840
 question is why do I comment call of 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.640
 Duty so that's easy too 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.049
 i have been really for mw2 times 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.190
 active call of duty player under the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.640
 week not quite as much as on 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.799
 Beginning 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.080
 because the call of duty is everybody knows 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.640
 is call of duty great this will be 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.470
 any new collective somehow 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.510
 a bit slower than the one of the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.400
 investigated factor ago that parties no longer 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.799
 that's why I just moved mine 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.689
 clear is well known that we 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.299
 almost only mw3 bring chemnitz and that 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.830
 but is still the case today and the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.080
 is simply my passion in call 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.310
 of duty of this mw3 i stop playing 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.720
 really quite a long time 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.280
 pretty long that my third account 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.359
 with whom I have the game with the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.580
 account with which I am here right now 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:13.770
 So comment on that with me 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.510
 yes with one with mum and sunrise have 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.040
 I'm starting to lose 20,000 now 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.840
 SchÃ¼ÃŸler completed 70,000 deals 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.690
 60,000 degrees with the two 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.150
 Accounts because before and why wanted 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.340
 I mean passion call of duty 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.100
 once and comment that i have 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.840
 connected a few months ago and have 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.220
 then just started me a video 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.360
 and just put it together 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.400
 on youtube and it's up 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.570
 now also very good always arrived and 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.420
 I do not care about any 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.520
 win prizes this as one 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.140
 microphone because I believe myself belongs 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.690
 i have a pretty good microphone and 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.520
 therefore does not need another one yet 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.959
 maybe I could not do that there 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.110
 You could know that, too 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.400
 give away that you know 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.720
 and yes that was the second question 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.440
 why I come with call of duty 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.100
 comment 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.170
 And that is definitely as I said 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.880
 I just think I'm a bit 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.890
 meeting would be brought about 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.630
 I say and yes why I commentator 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.850
 wants to become german top game face 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.830
 So that's very simple there is 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.270
 many many German commentators must 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.040
 you will always say there are many 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.950
 German commentators find that 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.750
 youtube small are still correct 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.940
 make really good videos and the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.660
 People like the people I want the 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.220
 give a chance with their gameplays 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.989
 at least a few spectators too 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.519
 yes it is clear you get 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.290
 no thousand subscribers to none 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.840
 Thousands of spectators but I want 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.730
 at least give the people the chance 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.390
 a bit too much on youtube 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.200
 enlarge 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.850
 And that's complex, I think, perfect 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.580
 suitable because it is a pure community 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.830
 channel is and therefore I take it 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.239
 also quite a part would like the 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.070
 really a German community 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.070
 hunk help the very young 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.290
 youtuber the chance to give a little 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.400
 to enlarge as I said and yes that the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.140
 point why i comment on jump 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.090
 gameplays will be because 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.890
 Maybe now listen to me too 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:14.400
 I comment on my opinion 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:18.630
 right on the right and then to the 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.570
 Last question why I do not want that 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.110
 special and my god why so 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.819
 a few personal dates to me 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.870
 I have just got many here 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:27.400
 That 's why I'm writing 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.409
 a bit confused to me 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.599
 am 16 years living in north germany 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.710
 and I have no strong German 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.069
 accent does not matter 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.150
 and yes I'm 16 years old 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:41.590
 Currently , secondary school and 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.009
 I'm definitely more passionate 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.169
 Commentator with heart and soul and 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.789
 That was also my fourth question 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.409
 can that in the next comments 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.889
 I would have looked at everyone who looked at me 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:56.319
 fall again a few yes I say 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.240
 a few more info to me if you 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:01.270
 but that's okay, that was mine 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.960

 community show that the little ones 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:14.889
 youtube also have fun commenting 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.990

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.370
 spectators so what then of mine 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.590
