game this year I believe they're 10 and
all<00:03:43.420> right<00:03:43.600> now<00:03:44.220> encouraging<00:03:45.220> though<00:03:45.340> because

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
all right now encouraging though because

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.550 
all right now encouraging though because
they<00:03:45.640> only<00:03:45.790> beat<00:03:45.940> Winston<00:03:46.360> 27-17<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:47.500> we

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
they only beat Winston 27-17 and we

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.500
