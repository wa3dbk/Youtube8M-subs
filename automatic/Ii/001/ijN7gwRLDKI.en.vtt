one<00:05:44.979> of<00:05:45.430> the<00:05:45.729> I<00:05:46.000> think<00:05:46.180> they<00:05:46.300> bought<00:05:46.449> not<00:05:46.719> out

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:46.839 
one of the I think they bought not out

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:48.869 
one of the I think they bought not out
of<00:05:46.870> Liverpool<00:05:47.409> they<00:05:47.860> actually<00:05:48.219> bought<00:05:48.490> one<00:05:48.520> of

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:48.879 
of Liverpool they actually bought one of

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.209 
of Liverpool they actually bought one of
the<00:05:49.139> Premier<00:05:50.139> League<00:05:50.349> teams<00:05:50.680> over<00:05:51.039> there

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
the Premier League teams over there

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.610 
the Premier League teams over there
unfortunately<00:05:51.839> they've<00:05:52.839> been<00:05:53.050> doing<00:05:53.349> well

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
unfortunately they've been doing well

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.320 
unfortunately they've been doing well
but<00:05:54.430> I<00:05:54.460> thought<00:05:54.699> that<00:05:54.849> they<00:05:54.939> weren't<00:05:55.089> trying

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
but I thought that they weren't trying

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.540 
but I thought that they weren't trying
to<00:05:55.419> siphon<00:05:55.629> off<00:05:55.930> some<00:05:56.169> of<00:05:56.199> that<00:05:56.319> money<00:05:56.620> to<00:05:57.370> try

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
to siphon off some of that money to try

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.389 
to siphon off some of that money to try
and<00:05:57.789> pay<00:05:57.969> for<00:05:58.469> some<00:05:59.469> more<00:05:59.620> talent<00:06:00.099> over<00:06:00.219> here

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:00.399 
and pay for some more talent over here

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:01.920 
and pay for some more talent over here
but<00:06:00.729> it<00:06:00.819> seems<00:06:00.969> like<00:06:01.180> both<00:06:01.330> the<00:06:01.479> Red<00:06:01.599> Sox<00:06:01.839> and

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
but it seems like both the Red Sox and

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.790 
but it seems like both the Red Sox and
Yankees<00:06:02.050> have<00:06:02.529> kind<00:06:02.770> of<00:06:02.889> cooled<00:06:03.159> off<00:06:03.399> of<00:06:03.669> that

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
Yankees have kind of cooled off of that

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.980 
Yankees have kind of cooled off of that
you<00:06:05.800> know<00:06:05.949> just<00:06:06.759> buying<00:06:07.120> everybody<00:06:07.539> you<00:06:07.899> know

there was a period about ten years ago
there<00:06:09.639> was<00:06:09.729> nothing<00:06:09.909> the<00:06:10.180> Yankees<00:06:10.569> like

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
there was nothing the Yankees like

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.929 
there was nothing the Yankees like
