00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.839
 the replica of the Spanish on set pieces 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.579
 picking up a rejection at the borders 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.629
 after a corner the hook goes from 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.629
 First Viktor Sanchez 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.240
 in a new corner kick came the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.609
 best chance of espanyol in the

 first part shot of colotto headdress 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.079

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.189
 immediately after in action 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.799
 immediately after just about 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.110
 seconds later buckle works from 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.179
 this way to Edgar Mendez was the second 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.700
 yellow for the former of the Vallecano ray and 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:35.899
 Espanyol after half an hour of play 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.899
 I was left with one less soccer player 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.860
 from there the group led by 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.080
 Francisco Rodríguez intensified his 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.670
 domain and had the best opportunity to 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.740
 the first part in this hand in hand that 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.340
 tomer Hemer sent away from the goal 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.340
 perica 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.010
 the pass is in the background 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.250
 there is no offside of genet that just 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.550
 finishing badly before kiko 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.550
 box 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.090
 and one of the men that he put 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.930
 spicy put party morbid 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.450
 it warmed up from the start of the second 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.010
 part and end up participating before the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.750
 box that owns your 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.060
 rights in the last minutes of 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.069
 shock 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.310
 images already of the second part with that 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.319
 first approach for Spanish and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.290
 almost immediately this would come 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.230
 édgar méndez carrerón for the 1 to 0 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.239
 of the sporting union almeria starting 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.920
 of the own field pisa rival area is 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.620
 get rid of all the adversaries that 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.349
 come out and combine with soriano to 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.489
 that the veteran captain marquez after 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.920
 of the chut touch on the post here 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.470
 we see the bright repeated action the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.769
 individual play by édgar méndez that 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.910
 just associating with soriano for the 1 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.910
 to 0 from the local team 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.260
 Edgar titular in the match against 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.730
 espanyol player who played in the 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.730
 tenerife last season 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.860
 and that is called to make one forget 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.360
 of the important players of the year 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.190
 past in the Almería players who have 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.950
 abandoned the entity as is the case 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.020
 for example from de aleix vidal from 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.750
 of being 10 the Almeria domain was 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.970
 total but was slowed down or cut in 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.640
 certain way by a circumstance how much 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.390
 least strange a blackout that affected only 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.910
 half of the stadium half of the 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.590
 stadium lighting turrets 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.310
 the mediterranean games went out 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.970
 and the game was suspended for 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.970
 approximately 15 minutes 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.660
 from there always with control of 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.180
 almeria merry-go-round came through 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.500
 the team of local basil batch 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.420
 replacing fernando soriano 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.420
 becoming the first player 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.510
 of Thai nationality that plays the 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.470
 league bbva little later that left me 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.470
 its place to thievy 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.139
 already in the final minutes and despite 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.850
 numerical inferiority Spanish 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.070
 looked in a desperate draw here the 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.419
 had david lopez that ends up finishing off 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.419
 rubén very innocent 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.190
 this action took place within 12 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.080
 minutes of addition that hernandez decreed 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.310
 Hernandez considering of course is 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.720
 the break very prolonged by the blackout in 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.250
 the stadium of the Mediterranean games and 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.870
 in the last play of the match and when 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.430
 we say the last one is the last one arrived 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.860
 the tie of espanyol sergio garcía 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.150
 he lowered that ball into the area with the 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.240
 it locked a shot that played on a 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.640
 defender who also took a thread a 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.860
 unpredictable effect for Ruben and after 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.250
 hit the post the ball ended 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.250
 inside 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.660
 lucky maneuver at the same time 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.820
 meritorious by the parakeet captain 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.400
 Sergio Garcia to save a point in the 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.960
 premiere of sergio gonzález as a technician 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.580
 of the blue and white team at the end 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.500
 disappointment for the locals saved a 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.970
 point in extremis the parakeet team 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.970
 almeria one spanish one
