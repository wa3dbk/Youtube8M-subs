00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.390
 it would be until next Monday when it 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.009
 would have a more accurate forecast of the 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.290
 trajectory of the tropical storm 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.970
 ernesto and if it could represent a 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.220
 danger for the national territory 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.140
 informed sergio peña cerro chief of 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.760
 Conagua projects indicated that the 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.890
 conagua is constantly monitoring the 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.749
 meteor that represents the fifth cyclone 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.599
 tropical of the hurricane season in 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:25.960
 the Atlantic is entering what 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.359
 it's the Caribbean Sea according to the forecasts 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.489
 of his trajectory to continue with this 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.650
 speed that is moving to a 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.630
 speed of 33 kilometers per hour 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.770
 approximately with a movement towards 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.200
 the west would be coming in front of 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.530
 the coasts of the yucatan peninsula 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.440
 out there on Wednesday morning this is 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.980
 yes yes if it does not change its trajectory, 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.440
 It is still premature to say that with that 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.440
 attitude why not because it can vary 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.870
 its 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.030
 his career the official pointed out that 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.070
 the meteorological phenomenon is at 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.079
 2 thousand 600 kilometers east of the coast 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.180
 of quintana roo and when reaching the height 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.610
 of Jamaica could acquire the category 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.229
 of hurricane this depending on the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.330
 sea temperature conditions 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.890
 Caribbean or the temperature of the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.920
 surface of the sea ​​right now in the sea 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.920
 caribe this one goes around of the 28 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.920
 degrees celsius is important winds 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.070
 at the height of the week here 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.340
 enter if they intensify if they are maintained 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.429
 this affect the high winds very much 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.869
 the development of a system can not 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:37.909
 you can do it that varies then right now 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.399
 I insist then it's just a forecast 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.899
 trajectory can not change 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.460
 it might be more towards the northwest 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:48.640
 it might be more towards the west 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.000
 towards Central America that is very is very 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.670
 premature now still say that if 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.229
 will impact on the peninsula by seizing 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.240
 meanwhile he specified that for this purpose 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.740
 of week the tropical wave number 9 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.930
 will affect the yucatan peninsula 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.780
 generating moderate rainfall of 5 20 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.790
 millimeters and the temperatures that 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.630
 We are waiting for this weekend 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:14.040
 maximum of 34 to 36 degrees Celsius and 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.940
 minimum between 20 to 22 degrees Celsius 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.220
