and Dean and I jumped on a flight got
out<00:01:14.920> there<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.400> scope<00:01:16.120> of<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.270> car<00:01:16.420> was<00:01:16.630> in

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
out there and scope of the car was in

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.260 
out there and scope of the car was in
fact<00:01:17.590> her<00:01:17.770> flat<00:01:18.250> as<00:01:18.370> a<00:01:18.430> pancake<00:01:18.580> in<00:01:18.850> terms<00:01:19.150> of

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
fact her flat as a pancake in terms of

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.760 
fact her flat as a pancake in terms of
the<00:01:19.330> battery<00:01:19.660> somebody<00:01:20.050> takes<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.440> trickle

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
the battery somebody takes the trickle

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.830 
the battery somebody takes the trickle
charger<00:01:21.130> out<00:01:21.250> so<00:01:22.120> we<00:01:22.330> charged<00:01:22.630> it<00:01:22.690> up

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
charger out so we charged it up

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.870 
charger out so we charged it up
eventually<00:01:23.170> got<00:01:24.070> down<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:24.280> first<00:01:24.550> petrol

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
eventually got down to first petrol

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.450 
eventually got down to first petrol
station<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:26.290> was<00:01:26.530> still<00:01:26.950> flat<00:01:27.310> as<00:01:27.430> a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
station and it was still flat as a

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.640 
station and it was still flat as a
pancake<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:28.180> we<00:01:28.300> had<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.479> bump<00:01:28.750> start<00:01:28.900> an<00:01:29.200> f40

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
pancake so we had to bump start an f40

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.499 
pancake so we had to bump start an f40
which<00:01:29.830> is<00:01:30.009> some<00:01:30.280> not<00:01:30.940> something<00:01:31.240> like<00:01:31.360> ever

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
which is some not something like ever

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.510 
which is some not something like ever
thought<00:01:31.750> I'd<00:01:31.930> do<00:01:32.140> my<00:01:32.350> life<00:01:32.500> but<00:01:32.800> there<00:01:33.340> we<00:01:33.400> go

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
thought I'd do my life but there we go

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.859 
thought I'd do my life but there we go
and<00:01:33.759> then<00:01:33.850> have<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.030> fairly<00:01:34.210> nervous<00:01:34.479> journey

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
and then have a fairly nervous journey

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.170 
and then have a fairly nervous journey
back<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.380> Zurich<00:01:35.560> where<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.100> local<00:01:36.880> Ferrari

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
back to Zurich where the local Ferrari

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.780 
back to Zurich where the local Ferrari
dealer<00:01:37.509> switch<00:01:38.470> batteries<00:01:38.950> anyway<00:01:39.430> after

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
dealer switch batteries anyway after

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.930 
dealer switch batteries anyway after
that<00:01:39.820> we<00:01:40.180> headed<00:01:40.330> south<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:42.160> set<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.430> passes

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
that we headed south to a set of passes

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.580 
that we headed south to a set of passes
that<00:01:42.970> in<00:01:43.390> fact<00:01:43.540> I'd<00:01:43.690> cycled<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.290> couple<00:01:44.530> of

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
that in fact I'd cycled a couple of

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.120 
that in fact I'd cycled a couple of
years<00:01:44.800> previously<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.490> they<00:01:46.390> are<00:01:46.570> just

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
years previously and they are just

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.670 
years previously and they are just
phenomenally<00:01:48.130> spectacular<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.750> roads<00:01:50.200> in

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
phenomenally spectacular the roads in

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.920 
phenomenally spectacular the roads in
Switzerland<00:01:51.160> well<00:01:51.550> sort<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.119> known<00:01:52.390> for<00:01:52.420> being

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
Switzerland well sort of known for being

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.249 
Switzerland well sort of known for being
I<00:01:53.200> suppose<00:01:54.060> heavily<00:01:55.060> policed<00:01:55.420> they<00:01:56.080> don't

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
I suppose heavily policed they don't

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.890 
I suppose heavily policed they don't
like<00:01:56.410> speed<00:01:56.680> out<00:01:56.860> there<00:01:56.890> but<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.150> passes<00:01:58.630> in

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
like speed out there but the passes in

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.899 
like speed out there but the passes in
the<00:01:59.050> early<00:01:59.290> morning<00:01:59.620> are<00:02:00.010> just<00:02:00.340> too<00:02:00.610> good<00:02:00.850> not

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
the early morning are just too good not

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.030 
the early morning are just too good not
to<00:02:01.120> go<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.479> visit<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.870> be<00:02:01.960> honest<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.800> the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
to go and visit to be honest so the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.000 
to go and visit to be honest so the
system<00:02:03.520> pass<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.780> fur<00:02:05.020> coat<00:02:05.260> pass<00:02:05.440> be<00:02:05.710> careful

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
system pass the fur coat pass be careful

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.699 
system pass the fur coat pass be careful
I<00:02:06.040> say<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:07.360> grimille<00:02:07.720> pass<00:02:08.140> are

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
I say that and the grimille pass are

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.130 
I say that and the grimille pass are
just<00:02:09.190> amazing<00:02:10.060> loop<00:02:10.269> that<00:02:10.510> you<00:02:10.570> can<00:02:10.720> do<00:02:10.869> round

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
just amazing loop that you can do round

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.650 
just amazing loop that you can do round
as<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.100> see<00:02:12.250> from<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.489> photos<00:02:12.850> it's<00:02:13.180> just

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
as you can see from the photos it's just

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.650 
as you can see from the photos it's just
the<00:02:13.900> most<00:02:14.110> magical<00:02:14.980> place<00:02:15.450> there's<00:02:16.450> one

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
the most magical place there's one

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.960 
the most magical place there's one
section<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.590> furka<00:02:18.070> pass<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.610> sort<00:02:18.940> of

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
section of the furka pass the sort of

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.430 
section of the furka pass the sort of
eastern<00:02:19.420> side<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:19.870> that's<00:02:20.110> probably<00:02:20.380> a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
eastern side of that that's probably a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.960 
eastern side of that that's probably a
bit<00:02:20.620> too<00:02:20.830> narrow<00:02:21.070> really<00:02:21.459> for<00:02:21.610> something<00:02:21.850> like

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
bit too narrow really for something like

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.810 
bit too narrow really for something like
an<00:02:22.090> f40<00:02:22.680> but<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.769> rest<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.700> really

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
an f40 but the rest of it is is really

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.810 
an f40 but the rest of it is is really
wide<00:02:25.150> it's<00:02:25.510> smooth<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.290> it's<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.310> scenery<00:02:27.730> is

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
wide it's smooth and it's the scenery is

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.410 
wide it's smooth and it's the scenery is
stunning<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.530> it's<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.920> it's<00:02:30.790> just<00:02:30.850> one<00:02:31.299> of

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
stunning and it's just it's just one of

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.759 
stunning and it's just it's just one of
the<00:02:31.480> most<00:02:31.660> amazing<00:02:32.230> things<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.530> think<00:02:32.590> I've

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
the most amazing things I think I've

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.520 
the most amazing things I think I've
ever<00:02:32.799> done<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:34.180> f40<00:02:34.570> itself<00:02:34.900> as<00:02:35.110> we've<00:02:35.350> said

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
ever done the f40 itself as we've said

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.890 
ever done the f40 itself as we've said
before<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:37.209> takes<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.450> bit<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:37.630> getting<00:02:37.720> used

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
before is it takes a bit of getting used

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.840 
before is it takes a bit of getting used
to<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.230> think<00:02:38.320> if<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.830> drove<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.280> for<00:02:39.519> a<00:02:39.549> sort<00:02:39.790> of

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
to I think if you drove it for a sort of

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.490 
to I think if you drove it for a sort of
you<00:02:40.150> know<00:02:40.209> just<00:02:40.570> drove<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.840> for<00:02:40.959> an<00:02:41.049> hour<00:02:41.140> or<00:02:41.290> so

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
you know just drove it for an hour or so

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.039 
you know just drove it for an hour or so
you<00:02:41.560> would<00:02:41.860> probably<00:02:42.340> be<00:02:42.810> intimidated<00:02:43.810> by<00:02:43.989> it

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
you would probably be intimidated by it

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.800 
you would probably be intimidated by it
frustrated<00:02:44.890> by<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.400> probably<00:02:46.330> walk<00:02:46.570> away

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
frustrated by it and probably walk away

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.900 
frustrated by it and probably walk away
not<00:02:47.080> really<00:02:47.560> liking<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.040> very<00:02:48.250> much<00:02:48.400> because

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
not really liking it very much because

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.300 
not really liking it very much because
all<00:02:49.209> controls<00:02:49.780> are<00:02:50.019> extremely<00:02:50.170> heavy<00:02:51.130> the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
all controls are extremely heavy the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.970 
all controls are extremely heavy the
pedals<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:51.850> feel<00:02:52.030> like<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.269> need<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.980> think

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
pedals you feel like you need I think

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.259 
pedals you feel like you need I think
I've<00:02:54.040> said<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.280> before<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.760> need<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.030> sort<00:02:55.239> of

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
I've said it before you need the sort of

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.900 
I've said it before you need the sort of
the<00:02:55.390> quads<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.930> Chris<00:02:56.170> Hoy<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.790> operate<00:02:57.790> the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
the quads of Chris Hoy to operate the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.090 
the quads of Chris Hoy to operate the
clutch<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:59.019> gearshift<00:02:59.500> feels<00:02:59.680> really

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
clutch and the gearshift feels really

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.920 
clutch and the gearshift feels really
sticky<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:00.489> we've<00:03:00.730> got<00:03:00.850> dogleg<00:03:01.239> first<00:03:01.540> but

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
sticky so we've got dogleg first but

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.170 
sticky so we've got dogleg first but
then<00:03:02.139> it's<00:03:02.530> it's<00:03:02.889> fine<00:03:03.250> across<00:03:03.639> the<00:03:03.850> game<00:03:04.000> you

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
then it's it's fine across the game you

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.100 
then it's it's fine across the game you
get<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.359> nice<00:03:04.480> plant<00:03:04.780> clout

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
get the nice plant clout

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.870 
get the nice plant clout
but<00:03:05.200> actually<00:03:05.500> getting<00:03:05.680> in<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.340> out<00:03:06.460> of<00:03:06.700> the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
but actually getting in and out of the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.850 
but actually getting in and out of the
gears<00:03:07.630> just<00:03:07.780> feels<00:03:08.200> really<00:03:08.500> sort<00:03:08.830> of

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
gears just feels really sort of

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.880 
gears just feels really sort of
obstreperous<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:11.410> trying<00:03:11.710> to<00:03:11.800> make

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
obstreperous and so trying to make

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.740 
obstreperous and so trying to make
smooth<00:03:12.340> progress<00:03:12.790> down<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.000> road<00:03:13.270> doesn't

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
smooth progress down the road doesn't

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
smooth progress down the road doesn't
really<00:03:14.020> feel<00:03:14.200> like<00:03:14.230> it's<00:03:14.530> something<00:03:14.680> that's

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
really feel like it's something that's

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.260 
really feel like it's something that's
very<00:03:14.950> easy<00:03:15.100> particularly<00:03:15.820> so<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:15.940> added<00:03:16.180> to

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
very easy particularly so you added to

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.490 
very easy particularly so you added to
that<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.510> engine<00:03:16.840> which<00:03:16.990> does<00:03:17.140> really<00:03:17.320> wake

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
that the engine which does really wake

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.850 
that the engine which does really wake
up<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.830> 4000<00:03:18.370> rpm<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.470> driving<00:03:20.470> position

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
up to 4000 rpm and driving position

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.980 
up to 4000 rpm and driving position
which<00:03:20.950> is<00:03:21.130> bizarre<00:03:21.880> got<00:03:22.510> your<00:03:22.660> knees<00:03:22.810> around

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
which is bizarre got your knees around

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.470 
which is bizarre got your knees around
your<00:03:23.290> earholes<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.800> then<00:03:23.890> sort<00:03:24.100> of<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.480> bus

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
your earholes and then sort of you bus

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.450 
your earholes and then sort of you bus
drivers<00:03:25.900> position<00:03:26.740> with<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.100> steering<00:03:27.310> wheel

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
drivers position with the steering wheel

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.300 
drivers position with the steering wheel
and<00:03:28.080> if<00:03:29.080> you're<00:03:29.230> lanky<00:03:29.560> like<00:03:29.710> me<00:03:29.890> then<00:03:30.070> it<00:03:30.190> all

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
and if you're lanky like me then it all

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.570 
and if you're lanky like me then it all
just<00:03:30.340> feels<00:03:30.670> totally<00:03:31.150> odd<00:03:31.480> anyway<00:03:32.550> after<00:03:33.550> a

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
just feels totally odd anyway after a

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.000 
just feels totally odd anyway after a
while<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:34.090> realize<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:35.380> only<00:03:35.410> thing<00:03:35.890> to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
while you realize that the only thing to

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.790 
while you realize that the only thing to
do<00:03:36.100> with<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.310> car<00:03:36.490> it's<00:03:36.880> just<00:03:37.270> to<00:03:37.590> drive<00:03:38.590> it

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
do with the car it's just to drive it

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.450 
do with the car it's just to drive it
apart<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:39.820> cannot<00:03:40.270> be<00:03:40.420> timid<00:03:40.720> with<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:41.020> and<00:03:41.460> to

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
apart you cannot be timid with it and to

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.270 
apart you cannot be timid with it and to
that<00:03:42.580> extent<00:03:42.700> once<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.840> get<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.440> car<00:03:44.650> moving

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
that extent once you get the car moving

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.190 
that extent once you get the car moving
around<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.060> actually<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.720> work<00:03:46.959> out

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
around and you actually you work out

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.680 
around and you actually you work out
what<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.740> wants<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:48.040> do<00:03:48.250> then<00:03:48.970> suddenly<00:03:49.570> it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
what it wants to do then suddenly it

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.990 
what it wants to do then suddenly it
comes<00:03:49.810> alive<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:51.370> biggest<00:03:51.670> thing<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.820> get

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
comes alive the biggest thing to get

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.270 
comes alive the biggest thing to get
used<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.360> really<00:03:52.570> is<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:53.110> engine<00:03:53.320> because

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
used to really is that engine because

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.880 
used to really is that engine because
this<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:55.000> just<00:03:55.330> nothing<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:55.810> say<00:03:56.020> below<00:03:56.290> 4,000

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
this is just nothing and say below 4,000

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.800 
this is just nothing and say below 4,000
rpm<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.430> you<00:03:58.090> come<00:03:58.240> to<00:03:58.330> some<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.660> hair

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
rpm and you come to some of the hair

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.510 
rpm and you come to some of the hair
pins<00:03:59.050> and<00:03:59.320> you<00:03:59.410> really<00:03:59.890> do<00:04:00.040> need<00:04:00.220> first

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
pins and you really do need first

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.460 
pins and you really do need first
otherwise<00:04:00.910> you'll<00:04:01.120> be<00:04:01.240> sort<00:04:01.570> of<00:04:01.630> halfway<00:04:02.260> to

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
otherwise you'll be sort of halfway to

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.780 
otherwise you'll be sort of halfway to
the<00:04:02.620> next<00:04:02.830> one<00:04:02.950> before<00:04:03.130> anything<00:04:03.550> and<00:04:03.670> she

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
the next one before anything and she

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.570 
the next one before anything and she
happened<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.180> believe<00:04:04.450> it<00:04:04.540> at<00:04:04.630> second<00:04:04.990> and<00:04:05.580> so

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
happened to believe it at second and so

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.940 
happened to believe it at second and so
back<00:04:07.090> down<00:04:07.270> like<00:04:07.720> first<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:08.380> then<00:04:08.590> you're

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
back down like first and then you're

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.320 
back down like first and then you're
just<00:04:09.130> waiting<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.580> feel<00:04:09.850> quite<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.120> lot<00:04:10.239> of

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
just waiting you feel quite a lot of

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.449 
just waiting you feel quite a lot of
push<00:04:10.510> at<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:10.750> front<00:04:10.989> end<00:04:11.280> without<00:04:12.280> heavy

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
push at the front end without heavy

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.759 
push at the front end without heavy
steering<00:04:12.790> and<00:04:13.060> then<00:04:13.180> it's<00:04:13.600> it's<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:14.140> stiff<00:04:14.530> so

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
steering and then it's it's so stiff so

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:15.720 
steering and then it's it's so stiff so
you<00:04:14.830> said<00:04:15.070> if<00:04:15.160> you'll<00:04:15.370> get<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.519> bit<00:04:15.640> of

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
you said if you'll get a bit of

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.250 
you said if you'll get a bit of
understeer<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.330> then<00:04:16.450> you<00:04:16.570> need<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:16.959> be<00:04:17.080> on

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
understeer and then you need to be on

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.900 
understeer and then you need to be on
the<00:04:17.380> throttle<00:04:17.709> really<00:04:17.980> early<00:04:18.220> in<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.609> corner

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
the throttle really early in the corner

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.280 
the throttle really early in the corner
if<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.000> want<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.269> get<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.390> decent<00:04:19.780> exit<00:04:20.080> and

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
if you want to get a decent exit and

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.230 
if you want to get a decent exit and
then<00:04:20.919> of<00:04:21.010> course<00:04:21.040> revs<00:04:21.489> build<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.000> build<00:04:22.090> and

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
then of course revs build and build and

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.520 
then of course revs build and build and
build<00:04:22.390> and<00:04:22.540> you<00:04:22.660> know<00:04:22.810> it's<00:04:22.990> coming<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:23.380> then

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
build and you know it's coming and then

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.400 
build and you know it's coming and then
suddenly<00:04:23.980> everything<00:04:24.700> just<00:04:25.090> well<00:04:25.960> just<00:04:26.230> let's

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
suddenly everything just well just let's

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.640 
suddenly everything just well just let's
loosen<00:04:26.620> 4000<00:04:27.310> rpm<00:04:27.790> as<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.540> turbo<00:04:28.900> spool<00:04:29.169> up<00:04:29.350> at

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
loosen 4000 rpm as the turbo spool up at

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.300 
loosen 4000 rpm as the turbo spool up at
2.9<00:04:30.340> liter<00:04:30.610> v8<00:04:31.450> just<00:04:31.840> becomes<00:04:32.310> completely

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
2.9 liter v8 just becomes completely

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.060 
2.9 liter v8 just becomes completely
different<00:04:33.700> animal<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.650> at<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:35.770> point

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
different animal and at that point

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.890 
different animal and at that point
you've<00:04:36.310> really<00:04:36.550> got<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.790> be<00:04:36.820> on<00:04:37.120> your<00:04:37.330> guard

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
you've really got to be on your guard

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.909 
you've really got to be on your guard
because<00:04:38.140> you're<00:04:38.350> going<00:04:38.500> to<00:04:38.560> have<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.770> then

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
because you're going to have to then

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.190 
because you're going to have to then
with<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:39.820> odds<00:04:40.180> during<00:04:40.570> position<00:04:40.900> obviously

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
with the odds during position obviously

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.290 
with the odds during position obviously
still<00:04:41.440> then<00:04:41.919> catch<00:04:42.220> any<00:04:42.520> resulting<00:04:43.030> slides

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
still then catch any resulting slides

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.659 
still then catch any resulting slides
lucky<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.290> rear<00:04:44.440> end<00:04:44.650> is<00:04:44.830> really<00:04:45.220> stiff<00:04:45.460> so

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
lucky the rear end is really stiff so

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.790 
lucky the rear end is really stiff so
actually<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.180> feels<00:04:46.330> very<00:04:46.660> precise<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.650> easy

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
actually it feels very precise and easy

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.110 
actually it feels very precise and easy
to<00:04:48.070> catch<00:04:48.220> because<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.580> even<00:04:48.729> got<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:48.910> rolls

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
to catch because you even got the rolls

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.750 
to catch because you even got the rolls
to<00:04:49.270> sort<00:04:49.510> of<00:04:49.570> deal<00:04:50.110> with<00:04:50.140> an<00:04:50.380> account<00:04:50.650> for<00:04:50.919> but

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
to sort of deal with an account for but

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.300 
to sort of deal with an account for but
yeah<00:04:52.479> doing<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:53.050> high<00:04:53.590> up<00:04:53.710> in<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.890> mountains

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
yeah doing that high up in the mountains

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.480 
yeah doing that high up in the mountains
is<00:04:54.900> it's<00:04:55.900> fun<00:04:56.229> it's<00:04:56.590> really<00:04:56.979> really<00:04:57.190> good<00:04:57.340> fun

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490

is it's fun it's really really good fun
actually<00:04:57.960> it's<00:04:58.960> a<00:04:59.350> yeah<00:04:59.860> it<00:05:00.010> feels<00:05:00.780> tricky<00:05:01.780> but

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
actually it's a yeah it feels tricky but

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.690 
actually it's a yeah it feels tricky but
that's<00:05:02.169> that's<00:05:02.560> half<00:05:02.890> of<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.130> enjoyment<00:05:03.610> I

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
that's that's half of the enjoyment I

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.230 
that's that's half of the enjoyment I
suppose<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:05.470> other<00:05:05.500> part<00:05:05.950> our<00:05:06.430> journey<00:05:06.850> was
