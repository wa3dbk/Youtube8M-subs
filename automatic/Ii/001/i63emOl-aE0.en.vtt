00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
like if you try to dance nothing will

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.170 
like if you try to dance nothing will
happen<00:00:53.879> you'll<00:00:54.660> still<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.440> there<00:00:56.180> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
happen you'll still just be there and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.720 
happen you'll still just be there and
apparently<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:58.109> other<00:00:58.469> people's<00:00:58.829> screen<00:00:59.100> see

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
apparently on other people's screen see

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.549 
apparently on other people's screen see
it<00:00:59.910> looks<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.329> there's<00:01:00.660> no<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:01.020> there<00:01:01.289> I

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
it looks like there's no one there I

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.020 
it looks like there's no one there I
guess<00:01:02.100> I'm<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.399> sure<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.609> only<00:01:02.820> four

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
guess I'm not sure if it's only four

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.369 
guess I'm not sure if it's only four
members<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.750> looks<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:03.989> there's<00:01:04.229> no

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
members that it looks like there's no

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.039 
members that it looks like there's no
one<00:01:04.530> going<00:01:04.680> there<00:01:05.189> or<00:01:05.630> will<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.659> work<00:01:06.840> from

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
one going there or will it work from

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.320 
one going there or will it work from
non-members<00:01:07.590> too<00:01:08.130> because<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.060> can

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
non-members too because here it I can

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
non-members too because here it I can
actually<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.869> them<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> eyes<00:01:10.920> are

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
actually see them this one the eyes are

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.700 
actually see them this one the eyes are
just<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.090> eyes<00:01:12.210> also<00:01:12.479> turn<00:01:12.780> magenta<00:01:13.260> so

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
just like the eyes also turn magenta so

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.800 
just like the eyes also turn magenta so
that's<00:01:13.890> also<00:01:14.130> weird<00:01:14.490> glitch<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that's also weird glitch so this is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.090 
that's also weird glitch so this is
really<00:01:15.990> simple<00:01:16.229> because<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> need<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
really simple because all you need is a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.890 
really simple because all you need is a
water<00:01:17.340> only<00:01:17.490> animal<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.119> best<00:01:18.659> guess

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
water only animal and the best guess

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.050 
water only animal and the best guess
game<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.520> possibly<00:01:20.700> look

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
game to be on then you can possibly look

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.530 
game to be on then you can possibly look
invisible<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> tiger<00:01:24.270> eat

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
invisible and just be a tiger eat

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.240 
invisible and just be a tiger eat
whether<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> tiger<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.100> have

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
whether you have a tiger or not so have

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.280 
whether you have a tiger or not so have
fun<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.850> guys<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:28.110> prove

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290
