00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
application disables that as well if you

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.259 
application disables that as well if you
need<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.650> use<00:02:15.769> things<00:02:16.010> like<00:02:16.129> windows<00:02:16.700> run<00:02:17.000> or

something like that and you just right
click<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.430> then<00:02:19.519> say<00:02:19.700> suspend<00:02:20.209> hotkeys<00:02:20.870> so

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
click and then say suspend hotkeys so

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.920

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
run dialog now and that is just removing

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.390 
run dialog now and that is just removing
the<00:02:27.470> start<00:02:27.709> bar

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
the start bar

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.789

this<00:02:29.329> sorry<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.840> taskbar<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.439> the<00:02:30.560> start

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
this sorry the taskbar and the start

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.339 
this sorry the taskbar and the start
menu<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:32.180> then<00:02:32.360> what<00:02:32.810> happens<00:02:33.110> about

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
menu so then what happens about

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.050 
menu so then what happens about
minimizing<00:02:33.769> windows<00:02:34.340> because<00:02:34.579> as<00:02:34.760> I've<00:02:34.879> got

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
minimizing windows because as I've got

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.479 
minimizing windows because as I've got
no<00:02:35.269> task<00:02:35.569> bar<00:02:35.810> now<00:02:36.290> rocketdock<00:02:37.010> has<00:02:37.310> the

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
no task bar now rocketdock has the

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.940 
no task bar now rocketdock has the
option<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:38.120> minimize<00:02:38.989> windows<00:02:39.409> to<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.650> doc

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
option to minimize windows to the doc

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.100 
option to minimize windows to the doc
which<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:40.879> really<00:02:41.120> really<00:02:41.269> good<00:02:41.510> I've<00:02:41.870> also

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
which is really really good I've also

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.600 
which is really really good I've also
got<00:02:42.530> as<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.829> noticed<00:02:43.189> because<00:02:43.340> I've<00:02:43.489> got

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
got as you noticed because I've got

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.069 
got as you noticed because I've got
Firefox<00:02:44.030> open<00:02:44.329> it's<00:02:44.480> got<00:02:44.599> a<00:02:44.629> little<00:02:44.780> arrow

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
Firefox open it's got a little arrow

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.970 
Firefox open it's got a little arrow
underneath<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.829> very<00:02:46.099> very<00:02:46.189> similar<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.849> Mac

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
underneath that very very similar to Mac

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.750 
underneath that very very similar to Mac
tiger<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.220> leopard<00:02:50.739> basically<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:51.980> ticked

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
tiger and leopard basically I ticked

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.000 
tiger and leopard basically I ticked
running<00:02:53.120> application<00:02:53.720> indicators<00:02:54.379> and<00:02:54.829> it

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
running application indicators and it

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.170 
running application indicators and it
basically<00:02:55.159> shows<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.640> underneath<00:02:55.849> and<00:02:56.120> it

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
basically shows it underneath and it

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.199 
basically shows it underneath and it
shows<00:02:56.359> ones<00:02:56.659> that<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.079> open<00:02:57.579> so<00:02:58.579> I've<00:02:58.970> got

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
shows ones that I have open so I've got

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.270 
shows ones that I have open so I've got
minimize<00:02:59.629> windows<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.109> the<00:03:00.200> doc<00:03:00.379> so<00:03:00.650> when<00:03:01.159> I

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
minimize windows to the doc so when I

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.330 
minimize windows to the doc so when I
minimize<00:03:01.700> this<00:03:02.480> video<00:03:02.870> die<00:03:03.139> just<00:03:03.440> shoot<00:03:03.650> it

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
minimize this video die just shoot it

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.789 
minimize this video die just shoot it
basically<00:03:05.180> minimizes<00:03:05.959> itself<00:03:06.349> to<00:03:06.709> the

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
basically minimizes itself to the

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.500 
basically minimizes itself to the
right-hand<00:03:07.159> side<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:08.180> can<00:03:08.299> see<00:03:08.480> the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
right-hand side and you can see the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.750 
right-hand side and you can see the
shows<00:03:08.959> in<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.440> label<00:03:09.829> it<00:03:10.040> shows<00:03:10.190> exactly<00:03:10.489> what

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
shows in the label it shows exactly what

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.789 
shows in the label it shows exactly what
i<00:03:10.790> have<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:11.329> i<00:03:11.569> can<00:03:11.930> have<00:03:12.049> loads<00:03:12.409> of<00:03:12.530> different

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
i have so i can have loads of different

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.399 
i have so i can have loads of different
applications<00:03:13.010> open<00:03:13.579> minimize<00:03:14.569> them<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.049> they

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
applications open minimize them and they

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.740 
applications open minimize them and they
come<00:03:15.650> here<00:03:15.980> now<00:03:16.430> this<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.939> great<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.420> love<00:03:17.599> this

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
come here now this is great I love this

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.110 
come here now this is great I love this
feature<00:03:17.989> because<00:03:18.549> there's<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:19.700> many<00:03:19.790> times

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
feature because there's so many times

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.160 
feature because there's so many times
I've<00:03:20.299> been<00:03:20.420> wanting<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:20.659> have<00:03:20.810> open

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
I've been wanting to have open

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.050 
I've been wanting to have open
applications<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.099> minimize<00:03:22.519> them<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.939> my

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
applications and minimize them to my

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.390 
applications and minimize them to my
tray<00:03:23.389> without<00:03:24.170> using<00:03:24.409> software<00:03:24.859> or<00:03:25.099> anything

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
tray without using software or anything

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.030 
tray without using software or anything
like<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.750> but<00:03:26.750> this<00:03:26.930> enables<00:03:27.500> me<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.680> do<00:03:27.920> it

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
like that but this enables me to do it

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.280 
like that but this enables me to do it
inside<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.489> dock<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.629> those<00:03:30.019> are<00:03:30.260> the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
inside the dock so those are the

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.080 
inside the dock so those are the
