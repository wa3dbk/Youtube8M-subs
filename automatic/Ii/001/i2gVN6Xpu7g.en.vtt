00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.749 

okay<00:00:01.979> it's<00:00:02.280> not<00:00:02.550> quite<00:00:03.980> time<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.040> check<00:00:05.460> these

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
okay it's not quite time to check these

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.280 
okay it's not quite time to check these
but<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.870> voltage<00:00:07.080> has<00:00:07.500> came<00:00:07.859> up<00:00:08.130> some<00:00:09.290> it's

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
but the voltage has came up some it's

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.180 
but the voltage has came up some it's
starting<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.710> push<00:00:13.070> 26<00:00:14.330> volts<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.920> it's<00:00:16.920> not

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
starting to push 26 volts and it's not

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:27.080 
starting to push 26 volts and it's not
going<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.550> come<00:00:17.789> up<00:00:18.000> real<00:00:18.359> fast<00:00:18.690> with<00:00:19.730> only<00:00:26.090> on

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
going to come up real fast with only on

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.299 
going to come up real fast with only on
the<00:00:27.990> amp<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.619> half<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.340> two<00:00:29.550> amps<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.179> vibe

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
the amp and a half to two amps of vibe

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:38.270 
the amp and a half to two amps of vibe
pushing<00:00:32.750> your<00:00:33.750> amps<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.350> pushes<00:00:37.280> that's

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
pushing your amps is what pushes that's

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.819 
pushing your amps is what pushes that's
why<00:00:38.489> people<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.910> more<00:00:39.149> than<00:00:39.210> one<00:00:39.420> panel<00:00:40.170> now

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
why people have more than one panel now

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.560 
why people have more than one panel now
if<00:00:40.860> added<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.340> another<00:00:41.489> panel<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> other

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
if added in another panel like the other

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.950 
if added in another panel like the other
church<00:00:42.899> twice<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.500> fast<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.510> also<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> only

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
church twice as fast and also I only

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.540 
church twice as fast and also I only
have<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.649> 28<00:00:48.079> volts<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.260> my<00:00:49.710> panel<00:00:50.010> anyway

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
have like 28 volts on my panel anyway

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.080 
have like 28 volts on my panel anyway
and<00:00:50.879> these<00:00:51.809> batteries<00:00:52.050> are<00:00:52.289> near<00:00:52.649> fool<00:00:53.090> anyway

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and these batteries are near fool anyway

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.020 
and these batteries are near fool anyway
so<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:55.620> were<00:00:55.680> down<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.280> 22<00:00:56.760> volts

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
so like if they were down to 22 volts

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.569 
so like if they were down to 22 volts
and<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:58.109> were<00:00:58.260> charging<00:00:58.800> you'd<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.250> them<00:00:59.340> come

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and we were charging you'd see them come

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.160 
and we were charging you'd see them come
up<00:00:59.760> real<00:01:00.030> fast<00:01:00.559> but<00:01:01.559> since<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.949> started<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.640> was

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
up real fast but since we started it was

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.130 
up real fast but since we started it was
before<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> hooked<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.720> panel<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.869> was

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
before I hooked up the panel it was

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.730 
before I hooked up the panel it was
exactly<00:01:07.920> 25<00:01:08.400> volts<00:01:09.200> then<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.320> hooked<00:01:10.530> up<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
exactly 25 volts then I hooked up the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.280 
exactly 25 volts then I hooked up the
panel<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.340> twenty<00:01:11.549> five<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> quarter

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
panel I was twenty five and a quarter

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.499 
panel I was twenty five and a quarter
it's<00:01:13.290> kind<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.500> floating<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> voltage<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.580> but

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it's kind of floating the voltage up but

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.929 
it's kind of floating the voltage up but
anyway<00:01:15.990> yesterday<00:01:16.920> when<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.340> picked<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.700> film

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
anyway yesterday when I picked that film

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.420 
anyway yesterday when I picked that film
it<00:01:18.090> said<00:01:18.240> 25<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> quarter<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.350> now<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.159> says

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it said 25 and a quarter and now it says

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.899 
it said 25 and a quarter and now it says
almost<00:01:21.350> 26<00:01:22.350> volts<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.729> yeah<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.390> coming<00:01:24.689> up

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
almost 26 volts so yeah it's coming up

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.840 
almost 26 volts so yeah it's coming up
it's<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> come<00:01:27.509> up<00:01:27.689> fast<00:01:27.960> because

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
it's not going to come up fast because

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.300 
it's not going to come up fast because
one<00:01:29.850> thing<00:01:30.229> one<00:01:31.229> easing<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.799> panel<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
one thing one easing one panel the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.780 
one thing one easing one panel the
charts<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:34.220> another<00:01:35.220> thing<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
charts with and another thing is the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.690 
charts with and another thing is the
batteries<00:01:36.150> are<00:01:36.299> almost<00:01:36.509> full<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.520> mean<00:01:38.520> that's

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
batteries are almost full I mean that's

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.760 
batteries are almost full I mean that's
almost<00:01:39.180> full<00:01:39.689> charge<00:01:39.990> half<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.250> 26<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.770> 13

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
almost full charge half of 26 is 13

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
almost full charge half of 26 is 13
volts<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:46.530> each<00:01:46.920> battery<00:01:47.490> has<00:01:47.670> 13<00:01:48.149> volts<00:01:48.420> on

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
volts so each battery has 13 volts on

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
volts so each battery has 13 volts on
there<00:01:48.720> fully<00:01:49.020> charged<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
there fully charged it's not going to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.850 
there fully charged it's not going to
come<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.909> lot<00:01:51.149> more<00:01:51.360> what<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.899> need<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.290> do<00:01:52.470> is

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
come up a lot more what I need to do is

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.389 
come up a lot more what I need to do is
turn<00:01:53.490> plug<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> television<00:01:55.070> tonight<00:01:56.070> to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
turn plug in the television tonight to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.219 
turn plug in the television tonight to
it<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.670> run<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.880> down<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:58.009> real<00:01:59.009> far<00:01:59.310> to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it and run it down and real far to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.289 
it and run it down and real far to
20<00:02:02.070> volts<00:02:02.460> or<00:02:02.580> something<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:02.970> which

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
20 volts or something like that which

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.109 
20 volts or something like that which
would<00:02:03.330> be<00:02:04.280> twenty<00:02:05.280> four<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.700> half<00:02:05.729> volts

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
would be twenty four and a half volts

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.910 
would be twenty four and a half volts
and<00:02:07.009> then<00:02:08.030> that's<00:02:09.030> not<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.569> way<00:02:09.920> empty

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
and then that's not all the way empty

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.190 
and then that's not all the way empty
but<00:02:13.760> then<00:02:14.760> we<00:02:15.000> charge<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.630> up<00:02:15.720> from<00:02:15.930> there<00:02:16.170> and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
but then we charge it up from there and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.160 
but then we charge it up from there and
come<00:02:16.560> up<00:02:16.770> you'd<00:02:17.069> see<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.400> come<00:02:17.550> up<00:02:17.700> faster<00:02:18.239> but

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
come up you'd see it come up faster but

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.699 
come up you'd see it come up faster but
anyway<00:02:19.560> yeah<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.790> pan<00:02:21.330> works<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:22.020> actually

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
anyway yeah the pan works it actually

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.780 
anyway yeah the pan works it actually
charges<00:02:23.330> four<00:02:24.330> batteries<00:02:25.310> all<00:02:26.310> right<00:02:26.489> thanks

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
charges four batteries all right thanks

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.330 
charges four batteries all right thanks
for<00:02:26.850> watching
