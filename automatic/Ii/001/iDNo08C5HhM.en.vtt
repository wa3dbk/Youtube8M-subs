it<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.100> also<00:01:35.549> acceptable<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.659> spray<00:01:36.990> that

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
it is also acceptable to spray that

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.770 
it is also acceptable to spray that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.200 
volume of water into all of three
beakers<00:01:40.290> now<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.520> conduct<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
beakers now we can conduct the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.690 
beakers now we can conduct the
experiment<00:01:42.990> take<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.500> cups<00:01:43.770> with<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.310> first

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
experiment take the cups with the first

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.480 
experiment take the cups with the first
and<00:01:44.909> first<00:01:45.299> solution<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.049> merge<00:01:46.470> them<00:01:46.829> into<00:01:47.040> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and first solution and merge them into a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.429 
and first solution and merge them into a
large<00:01:47.820> glass<00:01:48.119> with<00:01:48.450> all<00:01:48.659> second<00:01:49.110> solution

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
large glass with all second solution

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.800 
large glass with all second solution
after<00:01:50.130> doing<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.939> liquid<00:01:51.270> should<00:01:51.450> become

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
after doing so the liquid should become

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.960 
after doing so the liquid should become
white<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.649> happens<00:01:53.159> because<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.549> silver

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
white this happens because the silver

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.020 
white this happens because the silver
iodide<00:01:54.270> has<00:01:54.750> been<00:01:55.229> formed<00:01:55.680> furthermore<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
iodide has been formed furthermore the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.090 
iodide has been formed furthermore the
silver<00:01:57.450> iodide<00:01:57.719> reacts<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.860> sodium

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
silver iodide reacts with the sodium

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.179 
silver iodide reacts with the sodium
metabisulfite<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:01.290> from<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.619> silver

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
metabisulfite and this from the silver

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:02.780 
metabisulfite and this from the silver
iodide

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
iodide

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.539 
iodide
now<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.960> solution<00:02:04.290> eventually<00:02:05.130> becomes

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
now the solution eventually becomes

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.449 
now the solution eventually becomes
black<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.020> because<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.740> free<00:02:08.069> iodine

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
black and it is because of free iodine

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.090 
black and it is because of free iodine
which<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.270> fun

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
which is fun

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.670 
which is fun
acting<00:02:10.520> with<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.850> starch<00:02:11.180> stash<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.290> very

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
acting with the starch stash is a very

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.000 
acting with the starch stash is a very
good<00:02:12.980> indicator<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.850> iodine<00:02:14.590> let's<00:02:15.590> do<00:02:15.830> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
good indicator of iodine let's do the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.460 
good indicator of iodine let's do the
reaction<00:02:16.220> again<00:02:16.820> but<00:02:17.480> just<00:02:17.840> making<00:02:18.140> it

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
reaction again but just making it

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.170 
reaction again but just making it
slightly<00:02:18.800> more<00:02:19.010> interesting

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
slightly more interesting

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.900 
slightly more interesting
I<00:02:20.210> am<00:02:20.870> draining<00:02:21.440> free<00:02:21.740> solution<00:02:22.370> into<00:02:22.730> one

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
I am draining free solution into one

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.810 
I am draining free solution into one
glass<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.660> now<00:02:24.320> we<00:02:24.770> will<00:02:24.860> try<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:25.190> pour<00:02:25.610> this

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
glass and now we will try to pour this

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.810 
glass and now we will try to pour this
solution<00:02:26.060> into<00:02:26.690> another<00:02:27.080> cup<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.680> see<00:02:28.340> how

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
solution into another cup and see how

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.210 
solution into another cup and see how
the<00:02:28.880> color<00:02:29.330> will<00:02:29.630> change<00:02:29.960> here<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.740> can<00:02:30.920> see

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
the color will change here you can see

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.790 
the color will change here you can see
that<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.970> solution<00:02:32.300> first<00:02:32.780> turns<00:02:33.140> white<00:02:33.530> and

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
that the solution first turns white and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.950 
that the solution first turns white and
then<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.460> gradually<00:02:34.730> turns<00:02:35.390> your<00:02:40.960> eventually

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
then it gradually turns your eventually

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.770 
then it gradually turns your eventually
the<00:02:42.380> solution<00:02:42.890> becomes<00:02:43.220> black<00:02:43.660> during<00:02:44.660> the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
the solution becomes black during the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.410 
the solution becomes black during the
second<00:02:45.170> time<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.920> black<00:02:46.160> color<00:02:46.490> doesn't

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
second time the black color doesn't

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.020 
second time the black color doesn't
appear<00:02:47.750> immediately<00:02:48.250> draw<00:02:49.250> gradually

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
appear immediately draw gradually

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.550 
appear immediately draw gradually
because<00:02:50.600> we<00:02:50.840> haven't<00:02:51.110> stood<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.980> solution
