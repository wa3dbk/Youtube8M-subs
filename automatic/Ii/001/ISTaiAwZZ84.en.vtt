00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
just wasn't working for me I tried to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.789 
just wasn't working for me I tried to
punch<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.939> see<00:01:39.090> how<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.479> would<00:01:39.600> look

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
punch it up to see how that would look

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.859 
punch it up to see how that would look
but<00:01:40.799> again<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.670> don't<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.540> good<00:01:42.570> look

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.810 
but again I don't think it's a good look
and<00:01:43.189> then<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.220> think<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.820> start<00:01:45.060> dancing<00:01:46.820> yep

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820

this next thing is probably my favorite
thing<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.350> tried<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.270> lace

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
and it's attached to the neckline so you

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.390 
and it's attached to the neckline so you
don't<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.550> wear<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> necklace<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:25.400> here's

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.340 

had<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.210> lace<00:02:33.510> t-shirt<00:02:33.930> with<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.200> from

had a lace t-shirt with this from
forever<00:02:34.620> 21<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:34.980> couple<00:02:35.190> years<00:02:35.370> ago<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:35.850> wore

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
forever 21 a couple years ago and I wore

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.490 
forever 21 a couple years ago and I wore
it<00:02:36.240> all<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.450> time<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.900> went<00:02:37.170> with<00:02:37.320> everything

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
it all the time I went with everything

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.370 
it all the time I went with everything
looks<00:02:38.010> really<00:02:38.220> cute<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.870> think<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.140> would

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
looks really cute and I think this would

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.320 
looks really cute and I think this would
look<00:02:40.410> really<00:02:40.860> really<00:02:41.250> good<00:02:41.370> tucked<00:02:42.060> into<00:02:42.210> a

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
look really really good tucked into a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.140 
look really really good tucked into a
skater<00:02:42.630> skirt<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:44.340> last<00:02:44.640> thing<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:44.940> another

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
skater skirt this last thing is another

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.430 
skater skirt this last thing is another
thing<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.330> looked<00:02:45.570> really<00:02:45.780> good<00:02:46.020> on<00:02:46.080> the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
thing that looked really good on the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.200 
thing that looked really good on the
hanger<00:02:46.800> but<00:02:47.040> then<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:48.030> kind<00:02:48.120> of

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
hanger but then just kind of

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.900 
hanger but then just kind of
underwhelming<00:02:48.660> once<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.110> put<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.410> on<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.910> think

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
underwhelming once I put it on I think

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.000 
underwhelming once I put it on I think
it<00:02:51.000> was<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.150> little<00:02:51.450> too<00:02:51.720> baggy<00:02:51.990> on<00:02:52.260> me<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.950> I

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
it was a little too baggy on me and I

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.290 
it was a little too baggy on me and I
don't<00:02:53.130> really<00:02:53.280> know<00:02:53.400> where<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.640> should<00:02:53.790> sit<00:02:54.090> if

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
don't really know where it should sit if

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.640 
don't really know where it should sit if
you<00:02:54.420> can<00:02:54.540> see<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:54.900> kind<00:02:55.020> of<00:02:55.110> riding<00:02:55.350> low<00:02:55.590> on

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
you can see it's kind of riding low on

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.700 
you can see it's kind of riding low on
my<00:02:55.800> back<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.690> did<00:02:57.690> like<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.410> was<00:02:58.500> long

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
my back I did like that it was long

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.890 
my back I did like that it was long
enough<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.280> hit<00:02:59.400> me<00:02:59.550> where<00:03:00.210> I<00:03:00.240> like<00:03:00.510> my

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
enough that it hit me where I like my

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.370 
enough that it hit me where I like my
you<00:03:00.960> sure<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.260> hit<00:03:01.470> me<00:03:01.590> on<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.710> waist<00:03:03.320> then<00:03:04.320> I

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
you sure to hit me on the waist then I

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.990 
you sure to hit me on the waist then I
tried<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:04.860> see<00:03:05.040> if<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.280> would<00:03:05.340> sit<00:03:05.580> differently

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
tried to see if it would sit differently

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.030 
tried to see if it would sit differently
if<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.210> was<00:03:06.300> pulled<00:03:06.570> lower<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.260> if<00:03:07.770> you<00:03:07.890> did

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
if it was pulled lower and if you did

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.260 
if it was pulled lower and if you did
this<00:03:08.160> he'd<00:03:08.340> probably<00:03:08.490> have<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.730> wear<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.880> tank

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
this he'd probably have to wear a tank

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.270 
this he'd probably have to wear a tank
top<00:03:09.300> under<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:10.020> did<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:11.010> think<00:03:11.190> it

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
top under it like I did and I think it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.460 
top under it like I did and I think it
looks<00:03:11.310> better<00:03:11.490> this<00:03:12.090> way<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.660> little<00:03:12.870> longer<00:03:13.320> in

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
looks better this way a little longer in

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.080 
looks better this way a little longer in
the<00:03:13.530> front<00:03:13.560> but<00:03:13.980> then<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.250> know<00:03:14.430> put<00:03:14.970> it

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
the front but then I you know put it

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.520 
the front but then I you know put it
back<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.540> kind<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:15.900> played<00:03:16.110> with<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.350> a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
back I just kind of played with it a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.460 
back I just kind of played with it a
little<00:03:17.130> more<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.990> probably<00:03:18.990> wouldn't<00:03:19.320> buy<00:03:19.410> this

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
little more I probably wouldn't buy this

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.260 
little more I probably wouldn't buy this
shirt<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:20.010> wear<00:03:20.130> on<00:03:20.370> its<00:03:20.520> own<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.090> can

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
shirt to wear on its own but I can

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.540 
shirt to wear on its own but I can
definitely<00:03:21.420> see<00:03:21.780> myself<00:03:21.980> pairing<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.100> with<00:03:23.130> a

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
definitely see myself pairing it with a

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.540 
definitely see myself pairing it with a
blazer<00:03:24.210> or<00:03:24.510> something<00:03:25.130> alright<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.340> was<00:03:26.400> my

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
blazer or something alright that was my

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.220 
blazer or something alright that was my
first<00:03:26.700> time<00:03:26.910> using<00:03:27.060> voiceover<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:27.990> hopefully
