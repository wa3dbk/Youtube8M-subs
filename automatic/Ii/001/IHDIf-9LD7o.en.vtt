00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.000
Argentina is undoubtedly known for,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
among other things,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.770
the high quality of its beef.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.770
For the past few years, however,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.440
the multimillion soybean industry

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.900
has been threatening

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.300
traditional livestock production,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.780
from which the

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.960
high-quality beef comes from.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.060
The great expansion of

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.040
soy production

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.000
has driven a great deal of livestock

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.900
out of the fields.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.900
Today,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.900
around 6 million animals

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.000
are the target of an

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.350
intensive meat production system

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.670
known as "feedlot."

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.000
This system is giving way to a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.200
sharp cultural change

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.200
in a country that

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.410
has always been used to

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.420
eating meat from

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.070
pasture-fed cattle.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.090
Jeronimo Oviedo is 66 years old and

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.930
has been working with cattle

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.350
in the fields for almost his entire life.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.820
I keep these cattle

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.580
through great sacrifice.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:15.570
The cattle I sell is grass-fed only

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.080
and it's really good beef,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.230
because they aren't in feedlots.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.660
One could say that

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.470
Argentina has traditionally been

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.160
a producer and consumer of

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.270
bovine meat -- or cow meat, as we call it --

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.270
that is, beef whose origin is pasture-fed cattle.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.730
Dario Torres, like very few others,

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.220
knows the job of a butcher.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.890
That's why we've asked him

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.200
for his opinions on the subject,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.560
from inside his butcher's shop.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.840
Almost all the livestock

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.350
that's produced today

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.410
comes from feedlot production practices.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.480
Almost none of the beef

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.100
comes from pasture-fed cattle.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.170
I'd say this feedlot beef amounts to 90 percent

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.630
of the beef consumed in our country.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.460
People have started to

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.460
realize that the meat tastes

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.460
different.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.460
Many are refusing to eat

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.600
this feedlot beef.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600
I've had problems myself.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.900
Yes, Argentine beef has changed

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.160
a great deal in the past few years.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.150
Argentine beef is no longer what it was,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.200
because of feedlots.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.040
It doesn't taste the same.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.120
Feedlot grain isn't the same.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.820
You notice the difference

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.610
when you eat this beef,

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.150
when you put it on the barbecue

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.150
or cook it in a pot.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.920
The taste of "natural" beef,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.680
from pasture-fed cattle,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.860
is completely different.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.250
I'd say that the Argentine favorite --

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.600
the beef that is preferred

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.070
by the average Argentine --

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.950
is the one that comes from
pasture-fed cattle.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.310
Many people reject the beef

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.000
that comes from confined cattle

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.580
because they say it tastes like pork,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.190
which is a way of describing

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.770
the taste of the meat,

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.120
but which has a logical explanation.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.990
The explanation is related to

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.280
the fatty acids that are formed when

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.800
grain is used as feed, and
the fatty acids formed

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.040
when cattle are fed with pasture.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.030
One tastes different from the other.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.200
In addition to talking about

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.860
the taste of the meat,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.420
Carlos Ramos, an engineer,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.070
warns us that the beef

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.900
that results from confinement-feeding technology

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.480
is less healthy than pasture-based beef.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.100
And in turn, this is related to

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.900
human health issues

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.400
concerning meat that originates in

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.510
pasture-fed cattle vs.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.400
meat that comes from grain-fed cattle in feedlots,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.230
which is what Europeans value.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.910
Europeans appreciate not only

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.320
the "natural" side of pasture-based beef,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.640
but they also appreciate
pasture-based beef

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.720
because they know that,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.440
from a human health perspective,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.800
pasture-based beef
has many advantages

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.800
that the beef produced in feedlots

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.960
does not have.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.920
Here, they have a lot of space --

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.790
all the fields --

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.590
to be at ease and to walk,

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.880
which they can't do

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.880
in a feedlot.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.190
They are simply all crammed together.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.450
Despite the unchecked expansion
of soy production

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.000
and the difficulties he faces in doing his job,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.780
Jeronimo states that he won't give up

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.100
the traditional livestock
production practices

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.200
he has followed all of his life.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.340
While more than 70 percent of cattle head

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.980
in Argentina today end up in feedlots,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.610
Jeronimo is set on keeping

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.000
the "gaucho" culture alive

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.400
in the hope that the famous

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.300
Argentine beef will live on.
