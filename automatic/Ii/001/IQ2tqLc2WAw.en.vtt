video like this before and in the last
video<00:00:15.929> essentially<00:00:16.859> what<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.010> was<00:00:17.190> trying<00:00:17.430> to

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
video essentially what I was trying to

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.220 
video essentially what I was trying to
tell<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.699> guys<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.000> do<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.869> use<00:00:18.900> an

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
tell you guys to do was to use an

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.010 
tell you guys to do was to use an
enderchest<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.189> by<00:00:21.119> using<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.990> can

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
enderchest and by using that you can

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.080 
enderchest and by using that you can
just<00:00:22.350> carry<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.680> around<00:00:23.070> with<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.670> it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
just carry one around with you and it

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.730 
just carry one around with you and it
would<00:00:24.210> give<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.390> extra<00:00:24.810> space<00:00:25.019> however<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
would give you extra space however the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.019 
would give you extra space however the
way<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.160> worked<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.699> couldn't

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
way that that worked is you couldn't

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.029 
way that that worked is you couldn't
actually<00:00:27.269> use<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> normal<00:00:28.349> pickaxe<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:28.949> you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
actually use a normal pickaxe like you

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.500 
actually use a normal pickaxe like you
see<00:00:29.189> I'm<00:00:29.310> trying<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.580> use<00:00:29.670> right<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:29.939> you

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
see I'm trying to use right now you

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.820 
see I'm trying to use right now you
couldn't<00:00:30.810> use<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:30.990> because<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.529> would<00:00:31.650> just

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
couldn't use that because it would just

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.350 
couldn't use that because it would just
break<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.309> turn<00:00:32.460> into<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.759> piece<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.090> obsidian

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
break and turn into a piece of obsidian

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.190 
break and turn into a piece of obsidian
however<00:00:34.079> apparently<00:00:34.760> even<00:00:35.760> now<00:00:36.180> even<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.930> a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
however apparently even now even with a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100 
however apparently even now even with a
silk<00:00:37.890> touch<00:00:38.070> pickaxe<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.820> some<00:00:39.390> reason<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
silk touch pickaxe for some reason it

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.110 
silk touch pickaxe for some reason it
doesn't<00:00:40.620> actually<00:00:40.800> give<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.730> chest

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
doesn't actually give you the in chest

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.790 
doesn't actually give you the in chest
now<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.629> don't<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.320> just

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
now I don't know if this is just

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.400 
now I don't know if this is just
strictly<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.579> Xbox<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.300> edition<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.289> they

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
strictly on Xbox one edition or if they

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.930 
strictly on Xbox one edition or if they
patched<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> different

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
patched it for all of the different

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.299 
patched it for all of the different
console<00:00:48.329> editions<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:49.320> people<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.100> say

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
console editions but people is to say

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.250 
console editions but people is to say
you<00:00:50.370> cannot<00:00:50.910> carry<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.629> ender<00:00:51.870> test<00:00:52.110> around

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
you cannot carry and ender test around

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.830 
you cannot carry and ender test around
anymore<00:00:52.890> or<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.699> least<00:00:53.910> not<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.270> same<00:00:54.480> exact

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
anymore or at least not the same exact

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.840 
anymore or at least not the same exact
one<00:00:55.079> because<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:55.980> breaks<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.610> turns

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
one because it just breaks and turns

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.389 
one because it just breaks and turns
into<00:00:57.149> nothing<00:00:57.449> however<00:00:57.840> there<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:59.160> thing

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399
