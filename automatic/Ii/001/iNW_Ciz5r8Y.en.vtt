00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.039
 wheel brakes 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:15.309
 Perhaps began transmission probably 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:17.429
 the word comes from the word of his father 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.549
 children what does transmission mean 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.139
 rear wheel effort 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.419
 and lead in cycling 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:25.929
 movements 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:28.929
 the price 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.339
 so accommodates dinner star 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:40.029
 sometimes several or until may 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:42.739
 if the annual fee is several and the bike 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.649
 switch turn 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:47.169
 i.e. calls cassettes 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.259
 availability of speeds allows for more accurate 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.459
 dispense your pedal effort 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.689

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.689
 which is called goals 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.109
 if there is a switch that is 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.659
 governing body 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:11.659
 to the people 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.659
 they call it a coin 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:20.069
 why a coin and they are a hottie and an elite 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.460
 father roll yourself and don't know 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.460
 but the coin has buttons 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.669
 sometimes the coin looks in manners 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.840
 but gas on a motorcycle 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.699
 so here but 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.860
 as he says he tries it 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.270
 the terrible few of the modern Judas 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.219

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.270
 less and less common 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.470
 There is usually an adjustment for a coin 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.219
 not 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.080
 sometimes he has other switch 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.300
 and I will tell you why he 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.979
 Transaero Pashkin difficult to transfer 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.979
 increased coins on the switch 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.650
 this time the spot turned out to be checking 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.620
 shirts 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.199
 microsoft if any 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.199
 damage and should be replaced with new ones 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.699
 then check the operation of the switch 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.229
 if the switch does not work correctly 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.389
 let's vote 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.990
 we will upshift 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.020
 this is the smallest news star 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.560
 however adjusting

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.900
 and loosened adjusting and 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.550
 until it happens 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.309
 switching 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:58.999
 if the switch happens even before 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.499
 how about the allocation of the site switching 

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:04.430
 up to the characteristic click 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.440
 In general, you got too
