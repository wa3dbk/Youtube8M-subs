 pass the fillet through an egg that we have 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.739

 once we have battered our 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.580
 steaks let's catch the most art and 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.590
 let's throw an egg with a little 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.590
 of salt and we're going to make it grilled 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.990
