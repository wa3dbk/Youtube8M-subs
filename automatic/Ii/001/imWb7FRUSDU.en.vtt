00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
bomber has a nice knife on it which I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.399 
bomber has a nice knife on it which I
noticed

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
noticed

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.319 
noticed
so<00:01:47.369> I'm<00:01:47.460> guessing<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.880> were<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.119> combat

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
so I'm guessing if you were in combat

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.920 
so I'm guessing if you were in combat
can<00:01:49.079> easy<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.500> jab<00:01:50.009> someone<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.930> with

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
can easy just jab someone you know with

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.649 
can easy just jab someone you know with
that<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.729> said<00:01:53.909> earlier<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.509> a

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that so as I said earlier this is a

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.030 
that so as I said earlier this is a
viable<00:01:55.079> when<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.439> comes<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:55.740> an<00:01:55.829> emergency

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
viable when it comes with an emergency

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.100 
viable when it comes with an emergency
survival<00:01:56.670> kit<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.360> we're<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.509> unscrew<00:01:57.990> the
