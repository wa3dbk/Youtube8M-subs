00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.730 
but they're their skin scales are a
little<00:03:17.540> fragile<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.110> it's<00:03:18.230> not<00:03:18.350> really<00:03:18.410> good

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
little fragile so it's not really good

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.020 
little fragile so it's not really good
to<00:03:18.860> hold<00:03:19.010> them<00:03:19.280> although<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.550> can't<00:03:19.820> hold

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
to hold them although you can't hold

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.510 
to hold them although you can't hold
them<00:03:20.270> you<00:03:20.600> just<00:03:20.720> have<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.870> be<00:03:21.020> careful<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:22.370> not

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
them you just have to be careful and not

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.000 
them you just have to be careful and not
hold<00:03:22.730> them<00:03:22.880> too<00:03:23.060> much<00:03:23.500> but<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.620> problem<00:03:24.920> with

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
hold them too much but the problem with

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.500 
hold them too much but the problem with
them<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.280> they're<00:03:25.610> actually<00:03:25.940> painted<00:03:26.390> about

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
them is they're actually painted about

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.740 
them is they're actually painted about
the<00:03:26.750> hold<00:03:26.930> because<00:03:27.250> they<00:03:28.250> just<00:03:28.580> kind<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:28.910> kind

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
the hold because they just kind of kind

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.710 
the hold because they just kind of kind
of<00:03:29.900> like<00:03:30.020> how<00:03:30.140> they<00:03:33.700> move<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.000> easily<00:03:35.030> through

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
of like how they move so easily through

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.170 
of like how they move so easily through
the<00:03:35.870> substrate<00:03:36.590> they<00:03:37.040> pretty<00:03:37.760> much<00:03:37.850> move

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
the substrate they pretty much move

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.810 
the substrate they pretty much move
through<00:03:38.390> your<00:03:38.450> fingers<00:03:38.780> as<00:03:38.990> well<00:03:39.580> you<00:03:40.580> can<00:03:40.610> be

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
through your fingers as well you can be

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.880 
through your fingers as well you can be
holding<00:03:41.000> on<00:03:41.240> as<00:03:41.480> tight<00:03:41.750> as<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:41.930> want<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.680> oh

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
holding on as tight as you want and oh

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.600

the lizard's god so I found that out the
hard<00:03:46.760> way<00:03:46.970> when<00:03:47.300> I<00:03:47.360> was<00:03:47.750> taking<00:03:47.900> care<00:03:48.080> of<00:03:48.290> my

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.850 

we<00:04:14.690> should<00:04:14.870> do<00:04:14.989> some<00:04:15.140> more<00:04:15.290> chasing<00:04:15.560> it's

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
we should do some more chasing it's

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.050 
we should do some more chasing it's
really<00:04:16.100> funny<00:04:16.280> when<00:04:16.400> they<00:04:16.489> get<00:04:16.609> away<00:04:16.760> from<00:04:16.820> him

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
really funny when they get away from him

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.020 
really funny when they get away from him
and<00:04:17.269> they<00:04:17.870> change<00:04:18.139> any<00:04:18.320> jumps<00:04:18.620> around<00:04:19.030> because

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
and they change any jumps around because

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.450 
and they change any jumps around because
he<00:04:20.269> is<00:04:20.359> fast<00:04:20.690> he<00:04:20.989> reacts<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.889> as<00:04:22.010> quickly<00:04:22.220> as

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
he is fast he reacts that as quickly as

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.400 
he is fast he reacts that as quickly as
obviously<00:04:23.389> more<00:04:23.540> quickly<00:04:23.810> than<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.110> crickets

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
obviously more quickly than the crickets

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.409 
obviously more quickly than the crickets
do<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:25.580> when<00:04:25.760> they<00:04:25.850> start<00:04:26.030> really<00:04:26.210> running
