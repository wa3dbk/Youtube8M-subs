00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
we're doing without kits and died

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.750 
we're doing without kits and died
armoring<00:00:07.649> kits<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.010> did<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.250> before<00:00:08.460> but

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
armoring kits I did this before but

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.589 
armoring kits I did this before but
wasn't<00:00:09.059> HD<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.630> now<00:00:10.110> it's<00:00:10.260> Hg<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.389> let's<00:00:12.389> get

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
wasn't HD and now it's Hg and let's get

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.680 
wasn't HD and now it's Hg and let's get
into<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.580> this<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.790> great<00:00:14.969> website<00:00:15.240> to

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
into it so this is a great website to

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.810 
into it so this is a great website to
use<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.139> shows<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.590> all<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.770> ID<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.580> let's

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
use it shows you all the ID so let's

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.670 
use it shows you all the ID so let's
grab<00:00:18.210> an<00:00:19.160> iron<00:00:20.810> spades<00:00:22.010> copy<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.310> ID<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
grab an iron spades copy this ID and

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.029 
grab an iron spades copy this ID and
let's<00:00:25.699> plug<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.849> chug<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.359> here<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
let's plug and chug it in here so the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.070 
let's plug and chug it in here so the
first<00:00:29.429> number<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:29.970> put<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.480> always<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> ID

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
first number you put in is always the ID

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.080 
first number you put in is always the ID
the<00:00:31.380> second<00:00:31.740> number<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.130> amount<00:00:32.579> let's

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the second number is the amount let's

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.620 
the second number is the amount let's
have<00:00:33.380> six<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.590> five<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.010> them<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.399> then<00:00:36.180> now

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
have six at five of them and then now

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.150 
have six at five of them and then now
you<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:36.960> start<00:00:37.230> adding<00:00:37.410> enchantment<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:40.160> for

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
you can start adding enchantment so for

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.810 
you can start adding enchantment so for
example<00:00:41.360> efficiency<00:00:42.680> colon<00:00:43.969> six<00:00:46.820> unbreaking

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
example efficiency colon six unbreaking

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.580 
example efficiency colon six unbreaking
a<00:00:48.440> hundred<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.649> maybe<00:00:50.039> four<00:00:50.579> tune<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.590> hundred

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
a hundred and maybe four tune a hundred

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.160 
a hundred and maybe four tune a hundred
because<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.750> time<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
because we can and now it's time to

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.490 
because we can and now it's time to
other<00:00:55.289> name<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.949> do<00:00:56.100> name<00:00:56.340> colon<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.500> now

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
other name so you do name colon and now

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.260 
other name so you do name colon and now
you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.739> use<00:00:58.890> color<00:00:59.160> codes<00:00:59.430> which<00:00:59.820> make<00:01:00.239> it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you can use color codes which make it

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.520 
you can use color codes which make it
look<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:00.690> nice<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:02.660> subscribe<00:01:03.660> subscribe

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
look really nice so subscribe subscribe

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.690 
look really nice so subscribe subscribe
subscribe<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:07.260> also<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:07.979> also<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.670> other

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
subscribe and also you can also do other

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.910 
subscribe and also you can also do other
things<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.450> um<00:01:10.070> bold<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:12.770> inverted<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
things like um bold and inverted and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.910 
things like um bold and inverted and
stuff<00:01:14.420> it<00:01:15.420> Alex<00:01:15.960> that's<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.350> one<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.710> now<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
stuff it Alex that's the one and now you

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.760 
stuff it Alex that's the one and now you
can<00:01:17.040> add<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> law<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.689> put<00:01:18.840> law<00:01:19.170> colon

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
can add a law so you just put law colon

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.920 
can add a law so you just put law colon
but<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.400> important<00:01:20.850> part<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.540> want<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
but this is important part if you want a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.230 
but this is important part if you want a
space<00:01:22.229> using<00:01:22.590> underscore<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.320> let's<00:01:25.580> test<00:01:28.159> kit

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
space using underscore so let's test kit

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.109 
space using underscore so let's test kit
so<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.829> space<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.939> won't

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
so here there is a space and that won't

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.550 
so here there is a space and that won't
actually<00:01:33.360> appear<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.110> that's<00:01:34.320> good<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
actually appear so that's good and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.410 
actually appear so that's good and
you're<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:37.680> allowed<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.890> use<00:01:38.070> tab<00:01:38.490> because<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
you're not allowed to use tab because it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.840 
you're not allowed to use tab because it
breaks<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.290> found<00:01:40.500> out<00:01:40.770> which<00:01:41.549> wire

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
breaks it which I found out which wire

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.980 
breaks it which I found out which wire
recording<00:01:42.329> video<00:01:42.600> again<00:01:43.040> but<00:01:44.040> yeah<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.939> 299<00:01:45.720> is

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
recording video again but yeah so 299 is

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.830 
recording video again but yeah so 299 is
a<00:01:46.020> leather<00:01:46.320> something<00:01:47.040> or<00:01:47.130> other<00:01:47.329> so<00:01:48.329> let's

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
a leather something or other so let's

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.920

give<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.950> color<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.329> go<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> this

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
give this a color so you go to this

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
give this a color so you go to this
website<00:01:52.170> coal<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.369> schemer<00:01:54.060> online<00:01:54.950> it's

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
website coal or schemer online it's

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.830 
website coal or schemer online it's
spelled<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> american<00:01:56.790> way<00:01:56.939> because<00:01:57.420> they
