jam guitar and today we're gonna be
talking<00:00:09.820> about<00:00:10.030> pentatonic<00:00:10.990> scales<00:00:11.260> we<00:00:11.770> have

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
talking about pentatonic scales we have

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.100 
talking about pentatonic scales we have
dealt<00:00:12.220> before<00:00:12.460> with<00:00:12.910> the<00:00:13.090> C<00:00:13.300> major<00:00:13.480> scale<00:00:13.750> and

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
dealt before with the C major scale and

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.320 
dealt before with the C major scale and
the<00:00:14.440> a<00:00:14.590> minor<00:00:14.889> scale<00:00:15.250> so<00:00:15.849> today<00:00:16.119> we're<00:00:16.270> gonna

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
the a minor scale so today we're gonna

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.269 
the a minor scale so today we're gonna
be<00:00:16.450> talking<00:00:16.630> about<00:00:16.869> the<00:00:17.110> C<00:00:17.380> major<00:00:17.800> pentatonic

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
be talking about the C major pentatonic

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.660 
be talking about the C major pentatonic
scale<00:00:19.119> in<00:00:19.330> the<00:00:19.599> a<00:00:19.779> minor<00:00:20.109> pentatonic<00:00:20.590> scale<00:00:21.190> so

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
scale in the a minor pentatonic scale so

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.130 
scale in the a minor pentatonic scale so
let's<00:00:21.850> get<00:00:22.000> to<00:00:22.180> it<00:00:22.210> so<00:00:22.600> let's<00:00:22.630> start<00:00:22.869> to<00:00:23.109> talk

let's get to it so let's start to talk
about<00:00:23.439> the<00:00:23.650> pentatonic<00:00:24.220> scales<00:00:24.699> here<00:00:24.970> okay<00:00:25.180> so

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
about the pentatonic scales here okay so

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.120 
about the pentatonic scales here okay so
I'm<00:00:25.930> gonna<00:00:26.080> start<00:00:26.350> with<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:26.650> C<00:00:26.920> major

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
I'm gonna start with the C major

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.519 
I'm gonna start with the C major
pentatonic<00:00:27.490> scale<00:00:28.119> and<00:00:28.420> for<00:00:28.900> right<00:00:29.050> now<00:00:29.080> I'm

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
pentatonic scale and for right now I'm

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.729 
pentatonic scale and for right now I'm
just<00:00:29.890> gonna<00:00:30.099> be<00:00:30.310> talking<00:00:30.609> about<00:00:30.699> frets<00:00:31.739> let's

and three five so one more time okay now
let's<00:00:50.440> do<00:00:50.680> that<00:00:50.800> a<00:00:51.039> minor<00:00:51.340> pentatonic<00:00:51.670> scale

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
let's do that a minor pentatonic scale

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.229 
let's do that a minor pentatonic scale

five eight and then five eight one more

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.859 
five eight and then five eight one more
time<00:01:03.190> from<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.460> top<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.450> let's<00:01:07.479> talk<00:01:07.810> about

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
time from the top so let's talk about

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.649 
time from the top so let's talk about
some<00:01:08.380> theory<00:01:08.950> here<00:01:09.220> too<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.210> past<00:01:10.240> we

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
some theory here too in the past we

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.780 
some theory here too in the past we
dealt<00:01:10.930> with<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.200> C<00:01:11.409> major<00:01:11.619> scale<00:01:11.950> in<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.549> a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
dealt with the C major scale in the a

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.300 
dealt with the C major scale in the a
minor<00:01:13.150> scale<00:01:13.439> remember<00:01:14.439> both<00:01:14.710> scales<00:01:15.100> they

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
minor scale remember both scales they

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.550 
minor scale remember both scales they
are<00:01:15.369> related<00:01:16.119> so<00:01:16.420> they<00:01:16.570> share<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.110> same<00:01:17.140> notes

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
are related so they share the same notes

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.310 
are related so they share the same notes
remember<00:01:18.460> that<00:01:18.640> for<00:01:18.850> C<00:01:19.060> major<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.689> minor<00:01:19.900> we

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
remember that for C major and a minor we

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.999 
remember that for C major and a minor we
only<00:01:20.590> play<00:01:20.950> natural<00:01:21.880> notes<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:23.110> what's<00:01:23.830> the

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
only play natural notes so what's the

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.469 
only play natural notes so what's the
main<00:01:24.250> difference<00:01:24.700> between<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:25.090> C<00:01:25.299> major

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
main difference between the C major

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.160 
main difference between the C major
scale

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
scale

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.620 
scale
ney<00:01:26.530> minor<00:01:26.890> scale<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.549> C<00:01:27.880> major<00:01:28.090> pentatonic

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
ney minor scale and C major pentatonic

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.410 
ney minor scale and C major pentatonic
scale<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.350> an<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.799> minor<00:01:30.100> pentatonic<00:01:30.580> scale

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
scale and an a minor pentatonic scale

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.600 
scale and an a minor pentatonic scale
well<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.140> pentatonic<00:01:32.619> scales<00:01:33.040> are<00:01:33.250> basically

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
well the pentatonic scales are basically

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.270 
well the pentatonic scales are basically
the<00:01:33.970> same<00:01:34.000> thing<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:35.439> without<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:35.979> half

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
the same thing just without the half

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.520 
the same thing just without the half
steps<00:01:36.700> so<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.479> kind<00:01:37.750> of<00:01:37.810> know<00:01:38.110> what<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.290> play

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
steps so you kind of know what to play

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.380 
steps so you kind of know what to play
those<00:01:38.710> scales<00:01:39.070> already<00:01:39.369> it's<00:01:39.790> just<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.180> matter

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
those scales already it's just a matter

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.569 
those scales already it's just a matter
of<00:01:40.479> taking<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.930> half<00:01:41.140> steps<00:01:41.470> up<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:42.369> in<00:01:42.490> the

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
of taking the half steps up so in the

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.480 
of taking the half steps up so in the
case<00:01:42.759> of<00:01:42.939> C<00:01:43.270> major<00:01:43.479> scale<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.259> you<00:01:45.070> make<00:01:45.250> that

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
case of C major scale that you make that

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.910 
case of C major scale that you make that
scale<00:01:45.820> become<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.150> pentatonic<00:01:46.930> scale<00:01:47.200> all<00:01:47.619> that

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
scale become a pentatonic scale all that

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.340 
scale become a pentatonic scale all that
you<00:01:48.009> have<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.340> do<00:01:48.490> is<00:01:48.790> take<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.240> F<00:01:49.659> notes<00:01:50.079> and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
you have to do is take that F notes and

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.700 
you have to do is take that F notes and
the<00:01:50.530> B<00:01:50.770> notes<00:01:51.040> out<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.600> C<00:01:53.020> major<00:01:53.259> pentatonic

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
the B notes out so a C major pentatonic

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.370 
the B notes out so a C major pentatonic
scale<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.700> nothing<00:01:55.600> more<00:01:55.840> than<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.110> same

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
scale is nothing more than the same

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.260 
scale is nothing more than the same
scale<00:01:56.829> that<00:01:57.009> you<00:01:57.130> have<00:01:57.280> been<00:01:57.460> playing<00:01:57.670> without

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
scale that you have been playing without

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.270 
scale that you have been playing without
the<00:01:58.689> apps<00:01:58.899> in<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.590> B<00:01:59.890> notes<00:02:00.700> okay<00:02:01.439> since<00:02:02.439> C

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
the apps in the B notes okay since C

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.609 
the apps in the B notes okay since C
major<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.759> a<00:02:03.880> minor<00:02:04.090> are<00:02:04.450> related<00:02:05.259> they're

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
major and a minor are related they're

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.669 
major and a minor are related they're
both<00:02:05.890> they<00:02:06.729> both<00:02:06.759> share<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.329> same<00:02:07.360> notes<00:02:07.780> all

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
both they both share the same notes all

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.480
