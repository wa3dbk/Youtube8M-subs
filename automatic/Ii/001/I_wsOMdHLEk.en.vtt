but let's make this somewhat relevant to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.729 
but let's make this somewhat relevant to
codys<00:01:02.280> channel<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:02.940> not<00:01:03.090> an<00:01:03.300> immediate

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
codys channel so it's not an immediate

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.550 
codys channel so it's not an immediate
difference<00:01:04.739> let's<00:01:05.670> make<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> segue<00:01:06.689> because
