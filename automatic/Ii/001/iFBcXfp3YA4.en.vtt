gun the new assault rifle you know and
yeah<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.490> first<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.969> all<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.240> my<00:00:12.360> attachments

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
yeah so first of all to my attachments

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.020 
yeah so first of all to my attachments
i'm<00:00:13.290> using<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.679> holographic<00:00:14.130> sight<00:00:14.519> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
i'm using the holographic sight the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.590 
i'm using the holographic sight the
recoil<00:00:15.570> booster<00:00:16.130> ergonomic<00:00:17.130> grip<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.789> i

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
recoil booster ergonomic grip and i

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.630 
recoil booster ergonomic grip and i
think<00:00:18.990> i'm<00:00:19.080> using<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> compact<00:00:19.890> stock<00:00:20.250> but

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
think i'm using the compact stock but

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.910 
think i'm using the compact stock but
i'm<00:00:20.760> not<00:00:20.880> sure<00:00:20.939> here<00:00:21.560> i<00:00:23.480> think<00:00:24.619> the<00:00:25.619> best<00:00:25.800> way

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
i'm not sure here i think the best way

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.250 
i'm not sure here i think the best way
on<00:00:26.279> how<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.519> play<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.970> weapon<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.420> from<00:00:27.720> close

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
on how to play this weapon is from close

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.019 
on how to play this weapon is from close
to<00:00:28.529> medium<00:00:28.800> range<00:00:29.070> because<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.580> has<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> high

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
to medium range because it has a high

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.130 
to medium range because it has a high
fire<00:00:30.330> rate<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.199> has<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.740> high<00:00:32.309> recoil<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.180> if

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
fire rate and it has a high recoil so if

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.990 
fire rate and it has a high recoil so if
you<00:00:34.350> are<00:00:34.469> able<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.800> control<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.340> recoil<00:00:35.520> then

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
you are able to control the recoil then

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.540 
you are able to control the recoil then
you're<00:00:36.480> pretty<00:00:36.750> well<00:00:37.649> armed<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.280> gun

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
you're pretty well armed with this gun

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.420 
you're pretty well armed with this gun
but<00:00:39.450> actually<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.290> pretty<00:00:40.440> difficult<00:00:40.800> to

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
but actually it's pretty difficult to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.610 
but actually it's pretty difficult to
hit<00:00:42.000> every<00:00:42.360> single<00:00:42.750> bullet<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.410> target<00:00:43.980> so

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
hit every single bullet on target so

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.770 
hit every single bullet on target so
definitely<00:00:46.620> try<00:00:47.010> some<00:00:47.969> combinations<00:00:48.539> out

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
definitely try some combinations out

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.420 
definitely try some combinations out
it's<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.289> difficult<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.860> find<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.280> one

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
it's really difficult to find a good one

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.330 
it's really difficult to find a good one
but<00:00:51.390> i<00:00:51.420> think<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.989> weapon<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.559> kind<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
but i think this weapon is kind of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.979 
but i think this weapon is kind of
overpowered<00:00:53.940> actually<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.780> has<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
overpowered actually because it has a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.680 
overpowered actually because it has a
high<00:00:55.230> damage<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.829> high<00:00:56.309> fire<00:00:56.610> rate<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.180> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
high damage and high fire rate and this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.240 
high damage and high fire rate and this
is<00:00:57.780> usually<00:00:57.899> what<00:00:58.199> makes<00:00:58.230> weapons<00:00:58.800> pretty

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
is usually what makes weapons pretty

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.450 
is usually what makes weapons pretty
good<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.730> sometimes<00:01:00.120> even<00:01:00.449> opie<00:01:01.370> example<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
good and sometimes even opie example the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.530 
good and sometimes even opie example the
chart<00:01:02.730> check<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:04.430> saw<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.880> goes<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.330> our

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
chart check I saw was this goes on our

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.719 
chart check I saw was this goes on our
attachment<00:01:07.080> some<00:01:07.290> things<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.189> how<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> use<00:01:08.580> it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
attachment some things on how to use it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.060 
attachment some things on how to use it
i<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> best<00:01:09.900> weapon<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.950> hip

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
i think it's not the best weapon for hip

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.620 
i think it's not the best weapon for hip
firing<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:11.939> pretty<00:01:12.210> inaccurate

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
firing because it's pretty inaccurate

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.710 
firing because it's pretty inaccurate
there<00:01:14.540> well<00:01:15.540> i<00:01:16.110> think<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.939> aim<00:01:18.180> down<00:01:18.210> sight

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
there well i think if you aim down sight

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.870 
there well i think if you aim down sight
you<00:01:18.990> will<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> big<00:01:20.040> advantage<00:01:20.220> because

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you will have a big advantage because

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
you will have a big advantage because
like<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.360> see<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.960> not<00:01:22.799> really

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
like you can see here it's not really

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.499 
like you can see here it's not really
the<00:01:23.159> best<00:01:23.250> weapon<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.970> firing<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the best weapon for it firing the you

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.310 
the best weapon for it firing the you
fire<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:25.020> example<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.500> much<00:01:25.680> better<00:01:25.890> um<00:01:27.320> but

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
fire for example is much better um but

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.429 
fire for example is much better um but
nowadays<00:01:29.100> i<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.119> many<00:01:30.299> guys<00:01:30.509> using<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.110> so

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
nowadays i see so many guys using it so

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.130 
nowadays i see so many guys using it so
i<00:01:32.270> think<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.570> worth<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.750> price<00:01:34.140> actually<00:01:34.890> so

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
i think it's worth the price actually so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.429 
i think it's worth the price actually so
um<00:01:37.759> sometimes<00:01:38.759> i'm<00:01:38.880> even<00:01:39.180> seeing<00:01:39.509> level<00:01:39.900> eight

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
um sometimes i'm even seeing level eight

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.700 
um sometimes i'm even seeing level eight
guys<00:01:40.860> who<00:01:41.220> are<00:01:41.400> always<00:01:41.700> using<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.200> gun<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.619> i

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
guys who are always using this gun and i

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.149 
guys who are always using this gun and i
think<00:01:44.149> guys<00:01:45.149> stop<00:01:45.479> buying<00:01:45.960> credits<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
think guys stop buying credits is

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.359 
think guys stop buying credits is
retarded<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:48.479> now<00:01:49.200> back<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> theme<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
retarded but now back to the theme the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.030 
retarded but now back to the theme the
topic<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.030> video<00:01:51.229> this<00:01:52.229> gun<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.960> i

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
topic of this video this gun so i

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.260 
topic of this video this gun so i
wouldn't<00:01:56.040> go<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> normal<00:01:56.700> iron<00:01:56.880> sight

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
wouldn't go with the normal iron sight

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.069 
wouldn't go with the normal iron sight
because<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.829> has<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.850> big<00:02:00.540> thing<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
because it has like a big thing in the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.429 
because it has like a big thing in the
middle<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.560> scope<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.750> yeah<00:02:03.750> that's<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
middle of the scope and yeah that's a

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.609 
middle of the scope and yeah that's a
little<00:02:04.680> bit<00:02:04.799> irritating<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.299> definitely<00:02:07.290> go

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
little bit irritating so definitely go

with another one the record for example
or<00:02:09.629> i'm<00:02:09.869> using<00:02:10.170> google<00:02:10.200> rafic<00:02:10.770> like<00:02:10.920> i<00:02:10.950> said

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
or i'm using google rafic like i said

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.830 
or i'm using google rafic like i said
before<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
before and

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.690 
before and
yeah<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.470> think<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:13.980> much<00:02:14.190> better<00:02:14.400> though

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
yeah I think this is much better though

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.670 
yeah I think this is much better though
umm<00:02:16.310> hmm<00:02:17.629> secondary<00:02:18.629> weapon<00:02:18.930> i<00:02:18.989> think<00:02:19.200> this

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
umm hmm secondary weapon i think this

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.229 
umm hmm secondary weapon i think this
weapon<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.069> pretty<00:02:20.340> good<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:20.730> you're<00:02:20.940> not

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
weapon is pretty good and you're not

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.180 
weapon is pretty good and you're not
really<00:02:21.420> running<00:02:21.810> out<00:02:21.989> of<00:02:22.050> ammo<00:02:22.379> all<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.950> time

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
really running out of ammo all the time

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.390 
really running out of ammo all the time
so<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:24.690> can<00:02:24.720> choose<00:02:25.080> whatever<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.500> want<00:02:25.560> and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
so you can choose whatever you want and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.500 
so you can choose whatever you want and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
um yeah i'm going with the tiger here

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.830 
um yeah i'm going with the tiger here
because<00:02:30.870> i<00:02:31.849> think<00:02:32.849> that's<00:02:33.239> very<00:02:33.299> good<00:02:33.660> weapon

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
because i think that's very good weapon

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.570 
because i think that's very good weapon
and<00:02:34.319> you're<00:02:35.069> able<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.489> play<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:37.519> yeah<00:02:38.519> you

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
and you're able to play it and yeah you

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.490 
and you're able to play it and yeah you
could<00:02:39.030> also<00:02:39.299> go<00:02:39.569> with<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.780> rocket<00:02:40.049> launcher

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
could also go with the rocket launcher

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.339 
could also go with the rocket launcher
for<00:02:40.680> example<00:02:41.250> or<00:02:41.519> yeah<00:02:42.390> something<00:02:42.690> else<00:02:43.080> just

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
for example or yeah something else just

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.250 
for example or yeah something else just
just<00:02:44.280> choose<00:02:44.549> wherever<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:45.390> wanted<00:02:45.780> it

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
just choose wherever we wanted it

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.380 
just choose wherever we wanted it
doesn't<00:02:46.590> really<00:02:46.739> make<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.340> difference<00:02:48.060> there

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
doesn't really make a difference there

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.789 
doesn't really make a difference there
yeah<00:02:51.390> what<00:02:51.569> go<00:02:51.690> with<00:02:52.079> intervention<00:02:52.590> because

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
yeah what go with intervention because

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.740 
yeah what go with intervention because
this<00:02:53.069> gun<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.280> pretty<00:02:53.640> light<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.180> if<00:02:54.510> you're

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
this gun is pretty light and if you're

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.580 
this gun is pretty light and if you're
even<00:02:55.739> able<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.280> run<00:02:56.540> even<00:02:57.540> more<00:02:57.720> faster<00:02:58.260> that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
even able to run even more faster that

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.300 
even able to run even more faster that
would<00:02:58.799> be<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> big<00:02:59.250> advantage<00:03:01.010> saco<00:03:02.010> streaks

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
would be a big advantage saco streaks

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.610 
would be a big advantage saco streaks
