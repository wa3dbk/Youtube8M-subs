00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.990
 this screen 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:20.829
 that 's all. see at 7. the door is and 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:22.770
 here came the contract they called yesterday 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.390
 when when him 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.739
 reset us contacts from the store home 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.800
 depot and agreed that for thirty 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:34.180
 will come pick this up and put a new one 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.030
 there are actually very cheap because 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.050
 that called another one who spoke 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.700
 that any one costs 75 dollars an hour is needed 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.900
 will be there for him almost three hours not 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.820
 significant to surgeons 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.680
 so that a normal man is adequate 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.590
 now we will do everything 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.530
 and it's crustacean watts and here we've got 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:58.300
 street and here we have people drive today 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:01.899
 because they have blocked the street and some 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.850
 bicycle race 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.159
 with a flag 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.350
 so that he does not let anyone in two people 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:17.920
 one such 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:23.009
 and the other one is created 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.009
 traffic jams from unfolding cars 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:36.760
 cyclists all ride and ride straight 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:38.940
 disaster as it is chosen in contentment 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.430
 Is not only himself 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.430
 purpose and how are we going to gas. 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:57.150
 so that this thing should be reconciled 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:59.870
 suited to how this fit there should 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.870
 come true 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.220
 the question still remains whether 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.950
 size like yes when you bought this 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.690
 the frame means we were told to adjust 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.030
 go down on 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.530
 look for arranges and here often i want 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.460
 show how it adapts to this 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.120
 Here is the detail 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.660
 their 2 on one side of the frame and on the other 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.090
 side of the frame here it is worn and 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.970
 accordingly it means you can here on here 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.470
 such a distance increase here and a 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.150
 inch 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.210
 but this piece turned out to be superfluous to us 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.770
 so we removed from this side we 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.510
 Now there we are removing stand already 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.760
 shot mono back there pushing 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.000
 and now she needs the wheels back 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.720
 fasten here is the brown house here 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.330
 the wheels here they are these wheels over their 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.700
 screw back should get up easily 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.110
 that is, this frame is so much more complicated than 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.560
 just came and set 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.430
 it is adjusted to the size of the well that friends 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.430
 here in the end 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.290
 the thing got into place is the only thing that I 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.510
 I want to say this for myself 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:15.630
 I understood from these screenshots of the nets all the same 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.959
 there is like an original pair of door and well 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.270
 frame so let's say here it turns out that's 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.780
 number is such a subtlety here if we 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.480
 look at how this hook 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.300
 how he should have caught and here 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.360
 lock on this one 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.880
 Fits it turns out that the old ramis here 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.400
 so horizontally this thing and she 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.800
 scream well clung and this is China 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.130
 need need another mate here 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.530
 so called this item means 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.220
 so here is the only we 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.420
 try it separately 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.420
 heal but so everything is fine
