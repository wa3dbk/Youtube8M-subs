the<00:06:11.849> map<00:06:12.179> here<00:06:12.509> we're<00:06:12.809> in<00:06:12.959> a<00:06:13.079> stage<00:06:13.409> am<00:06:13.769> I<00:06:14.360> see

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
the map here we're in a stage am I see

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:22.339 
the map here we're in a stage am I see
it<00:06:15.509> looks<00:06:15.779> very<00:06:17.539> weird<00:06:18.979> oddly<00:06:19.979> oddly<00:06:21.349> spread

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349 
it looks very weird oddly oddly spread

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.869 
it looks very weird oddly oddly spread
out<00:06:22.589> clutter<00:06:24.860> you<00:06:25.860> can<00:06:26.009> make<00:06:26.189> some<00:06:26.459> sense<00:06:26.669> of

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:26.879 
out clutter you can make some sense of

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:30.709 
out clutter you can make some sense of
it<00:06:26.969> if<00:06:27.089> you<00:06:27.209> really<00:06:27.869> try<00:06:28.369> but<00:06:29.369> it's<00:06:29.969> not<00:06:30.360> all

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:30.719 
it if you really try but it's not all

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:38.209 
it if you really try but it's not all
that<00:06:31.319> simple<00:06:34.219> I'm<00:06:35.219> thinking<00:06:37.189> now<00:06:38.189> that

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:38.219 
that simple I'm thinking now that

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:42.260 
that simple I'm thinking now that
wouldn't<00:06:38.669> be<00:06:38.789> right<00:06:38.909> what

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.210 

now<00:06:43.270> that<00:06:43.540> couldn't<00:06:43.900> be<00:06:43.930> right<00:06:44.200> I<00:06:44.560> was

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
now that couldn't be right I was

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.530 
now that couldn't be right I was
thinking<00:06:45.520> down<00:06:45.700> there<00:06:45.880> in<00:06:46.000> the<00:06:46.060> lower<00:06:46.210> right

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
thinking down there in the lower right

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.900 
thinking down there in the lower right
was<00:06:46.750> the<00:06:46.890> underwater<00:06:47.890> passage<00:06:48.460> we<00:06:48.610> took<00:06:48.760> to

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
was the underwater passage we took to

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.200 
was the underwater passage we took to
get<00:06:49.090> here<00:06:49.200> but<00:06:50.200> I<00:06:50.620> don't<00:06:51.160> think<00:06:51.520> so<00:06:51.760> I<00:06:52.000> don't

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
get here but I don't think so I don't

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.880 
get here but I don't think so I don't
you<00:06:52.420> wouldn't<00:06:52.840> think<00:06:53.080> that<00:06:53.170> would<00:06:53.320> be<00:06:53.590> on<00:06:53.710> map

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
you wouldn't think that would be on map

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.800 
you wouldn't think that would be on map
of<00:06:56.890> course<00:06:57.130> we<00:06:57.280> have<00:06:57.400> our<00:06:57.430> starting<00:06:57.940> area<00:06:58.270> here

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
of course we have our starting area here

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.250 
of course we have our starting area here
I<00:06:59.730> remember<00:07:00.730> that<00:07:00.850> two-fold<00:07:01.720> thing<00:07:01.810> there<00:07:02.170> in

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
I remember that two-fold thing there in

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.850 
I remember that two-fold thing there in
the<00:07:02.610> middle<00:07:03.610> Center<00:07:04.140> is<00:07:05.140> if<00:07:05.380> you<00:07:05.470> enter<00:07:05.770> it

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
the middle Center is if you enter it

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.680 
the middle Center is if you enter it
from<00:07:05.890> the<00:07:06.220> left<00:07:06.460> you<00:07:06.700> can't<00:07:06.940> hit<00:07:07.090> the<00:07:07.360> right<00:07:07.510> if

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
from the left you can't hit the right if

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.060 
from the left you can't hit the right if
you<00:07:07.810> enter<00:07:07.990> from<00:07:08.020> the<00:07:08.230> right<00:07:08.320> you<00:07:08.680> can't<00:07:08.890> get

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
you enter from the right you can't get

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.220 
you enter from the right you can't get
to<00:07:09.160> the<00:07:09.250> left<00:07:09.600> you<00:07:10.600> almost<00:07:10.780> didn't<00:07:11.170> even

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.230 
to the left you almost didn't even

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.930 
to the left you almost didn't even
notice<00:07:11.710> that<00:07:11.860> they<00:07:11.950> were<00:07:12.010> so<00:07:12.220> well<00:07:12.430> separated

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
notice that they were so well separated

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.490 
notice that they were so well separated
but<00:07:13.480> it<00:07:13.600> was<00:07:13.840> one<00:07:14.170> home<00:07:14.350> at<00:07:14.530> I<00:07:15.960> do<00:07:16.960> believe<00:07:17.290> that

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
but it was one home at I do believe that

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.590 
but it was one home at I do believe that
to<00:07:17.680> the<00:07:17.800> lower<00:07:17.980> left<00:07:18.460> is<00:07:18.700> our<00:07:18.880> passage<00:07:19.360> way<00:07:19.540> to

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:19.600 
to the lower left is our passage way to

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.800 
to the lower left is our passage way to
foo-foo<00:07:20.230> up<00:07:21.780> um<00:07:24.150> anything<00:07:25.150> else<00:07:25.420> here<00:07:25.660> your

foo-foo up um anything else here your

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.630 
foo-foo up um anything else here your
guess<00:07:26.020> is<00:07:26.050> as<00:07:26.230> good<00:07:26.350> as<00:07:26.470> mine<00:07:26.590> I<00:07:27.070> think<00:07:27.550> that

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:27.640 
guess is as good as mine I think that

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.220
