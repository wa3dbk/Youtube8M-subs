00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.550
 fifth position so that it is added to those that had previously 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.490

 in extreme length to the corresponding zone 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.200
 the notice does not come out 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.730
 the resolution 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.870
 we see that they are 81% 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.960
 With which 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.440

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.610
 while you have more than 60 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.610
 disappears said in yellow indicating the resolution 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.850
 and we also see that what the area 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.130
 with these lines 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.470
 it tells us that it is the side of what the day will be at zero 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.539
 those who realize that this part will be the one that will be seen laterally 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.580
 gelasio motto was 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.690
 keep in mind that we have 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.310
 of six types of templates 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.530
 or if we want to do another type of assembly 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.320
 click on one of them 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.660
 larraz stretches to the composition 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.940
 and we see that we can add 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.940
 two more photographs 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.100

 let's continue to preview 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.509
 we check that everything is correct as we want it 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.809
 and we will proceed to place the order 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.319
 Periz and we fall without help 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.190
 records that we have entered the correct code to be able to perform 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.359
 shipments 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.939

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.329
 remember layer that this moment we can not when making a change in the 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.529
 design 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:50.789
 afraid to make sure that everything was 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:53.699
 our taste before moving forward 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.699
 since the factory can not be modified 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.049
 if we find out an error later
