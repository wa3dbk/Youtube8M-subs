 Stone. Good morning. You know the shuttle bus that runs on campus. 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.280
 I'm using a lot of these students have a convenient shuttle bus more than anyone 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.449
 Are the students with disabilities necessary to use them conveniently? 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.359
 The 4 settings were not the same either. 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:27.260
 Most students with disabilities were not able to use it 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.500
 It is the report of Choi Choi reporter . 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:37.220
 A new student college student 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:41.239
 Every week from Songdo to Shincho Perth, there are numerous lifts and door polls during the subway. 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:45.379
 It takes more than 2 hours to pass 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:50.330
 With the school shuttle bus an hour to get to the street 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:52.220
 However , it is difficult to get students with disabilities because of the high number of regular shuttle buses . 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:57.080
 It is a reality 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:02.060
 Also tandago bijopah if space is not yet all the way to Iron Hill 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.530
 After all, when you get to the school on the subway without any condition, you become exhausted 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:09.649
 It's all right. 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:15.290
 When I moved to the wit, I was always exposed to the water level, and it took a lot of time. 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:19.360
 I had a lot of interest, so that part was hard. 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:25.039
 Lee Byung-Soo , a researcher of a university shuttle bus in Seoul 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.680
 The lack of a low-rise Perth Knife course available for people with disabilities 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:31.390

 After a review of nine downtown Seoul National University, which has campuses currently rootstock 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:39.850
 Tonghagi students with disabilities and low-floor buses and shuttle lifts required to move on campus 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:44.350
 There is only one place where there is a bus. 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:50.350
 There are special shootings for students with disabilities, 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:55.600
 It's available, and it's hard to use it on campus 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:58.420
 Therefore, most students with disabilities use their own car 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.970
 We have to take the time to move. 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.970
 Why is this happening? The shuttle bus , 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:11.550
 Because they are left to university autonomy.

 Students with disabilities who evaluate the environment of students with disabilities every three years Education Welfare Office 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:26.650
 At the time of evaluation, the content related to the move is not evaluated. 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.170
 Therefore, the university has to purchase low-floor buses or lifts 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.600
 I do not buy a car . 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.600

 It is the student with a disability who is discriminated against by the education authorities and the university side 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:51.880
