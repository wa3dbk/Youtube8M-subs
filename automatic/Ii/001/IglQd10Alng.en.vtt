/ if the killer was using hardline

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.240

because<00:03:04.150> there<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> ac-130<00:03:05.410> or<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> c-130

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
because there is a ac-130 or a c-130

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.370 
because there is a ac-130 or a c-130
circling<00:03:06.880> my<00:03:07.000> school<00:03:07.300> like<00:03:07.959> non-stop

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
circling my school like non-stop

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.710 
circling my school like non-stop
circling<00:03:09.160> they'd<00:03:09.520> shoot<00:03:09.910> anything<00:03:10.239> at<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.510> so

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
circling they'd shoot anything at it so

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.960 
circling they'd shoot anything at it so
I<00:03:10.750> think<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.140> was<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.310> c-130<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.610> for<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.850> guys

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
I think it was a c-130 and for you guys

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.960 
I think it was a c-130 and for you guys
that<00:03:13.209> don't<00:03:13.239> know<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:14.280> c-130<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.610> thing

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
that don't know a c-130 is the thing

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.390 
that don't know a c-130 is the thing
that<00:03:16.000> drops<00:03:16.420> down<00:03:16.510> um<00:03:17.040> emergency<00:03:18.040> air<00:03:18.160> drops

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
that drops down um emergency air drops

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.330 
that drops down um emergency air drops
so<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.060> got<00:03:19.270> an<00:03:19.360> ac-130<00:03:20.020> from<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.380> c-130<00:03:20.860> which<00:03:21.220> I

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
so I got an ac-130 from a c-130 which I

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.120 
so I got an ac-130 from a c-130 which I
think<00:03:21.489> it's<00:03:21.610> pretty<00:03:21.730> cool<00:03:21.970> huh<00:03:22.830> at<00:03:23.830> least<00:03:24.040> I

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
think it's pretty cool huh at least I

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.830 
think it's pretty cool huh at least I
think<00:03:24.190> it's<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.610> thing<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.239> drops<00:03:25.750> down

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
think it's the thing that drops down

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.050 
think it's the thing that drops down
