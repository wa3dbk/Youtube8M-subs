00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.210
 Mainz indices also work with Media Interface MMI or Medic and 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.689
 Have templates 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:13.129
 to remotely control the software later, I'll show it all 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.809
 first turn it work lightly is a thrust you want to have too 

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:19.809
 go back to the default setting 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.380
 we are back up here 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.720
 open on 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.019
 but this time on the 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.019
 like the kick 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.250
 Euro 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.060
 the software tested on dena surfaces is already a whole lot to choose from 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.790
 this is in the foreground 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.770
 the usual asked 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.269
 This is a little scary to club 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.409
 your GW is not there now it is not there at all 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.639
 continue to do so dramatically is then set only manually 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:00.450
 there are still too 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.110
 if you go now the ranks Finders once set otherwise 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.450
 always make sure that all purpose is and that also the remote control 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.110
 a Renault with 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110
 how the 1 of the ETN works 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.840
 there are many to eat 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.159
 the other hand, not only on the cook but also a microphone on 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.740
 or collaborate with other animals singer or singer and want 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.040
 like that they are still controllable 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.040
 have the microphone that is not a problem at all 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.620
 at any time Â«Nico in front of me or in additional 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.689
 a cd-player 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.320
 now there are LR and an iPod or whatever and just over there 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.319
 f Arbon play classes like that 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.050
 just set it once 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.390
 Now if we look at it from connected it says 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.120
 Of course you have to go back to the default setting Kiel 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.260
 on audio 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.710
 on even one of the culprits 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.319
 and, of course, say 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.289
 on which of these channels through her 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:16.299
 the microphone reception wiko Phones thrives months best so banal so 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.619
 let's do 1 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:19.059
 2 on 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.959
 OK 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.289
 Aachen's presetting springs so 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:25.879
 and say here 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.840
 Goodyear told me Bonner times play who else than play now 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.109
 Neo Channel Pina needs more practical second too up here on the second 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.889
 on track also generate 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.089
 and there were a second one 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:43.479
 Here is a microphone to be connected 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:45.799
 that is, if Bureau ever 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.990
 also microphone so we know that 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.990
 over rename or from r 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:58.599
 a good tip Stock market makes it easy to label everything because often 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.009
 if you look for the tracks 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:02.959
 currently you get confused quickly where not what 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.039
 Now you can see it here in the section from you from 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.039
 hire the law firm from where you get yours 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.979
 Signals get stacks perceive 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.599
 is clearly Werner Nico before 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.269
 one ours but the need of a bazaar 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.690
 Now you can say what is a station on the input single entry 2 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.079
 depending on where you have the microphone connected here so set 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:31.639
 and most importantly monitor on percent because he wanted to hear what was there 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.049
 comes out 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.399
 now statements 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:39.409
 Of course I can find the microphone as well as an mp3 player 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.499
 still connect or a cd player also goes that 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:47.769
 Quite simply now, of course, the resulting signals are back in 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.769
 the default 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:59.319
 at the beginning of the initial configuration and 1 2 stereo or 3 4 posts that depends on 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.110
 Aral, Kat Raps can also be that she has more inputs or only one 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.640
 a Steher entrance definitely choose Rheinland 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.779
 to make cities betray Nico 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:19.379
 Nicola in addition to the Nicola what a conciliator create new track 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:23.449
 Audio 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.340
 Audio drive now call external 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.340
 I could already and now 1 2 or 3 4 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.279
 Molitor on 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.969
 and pretty 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.229
 then he also found external signal you see sees their income and can 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.430
 The volume is easy to follow rules like Raich with broad signals 

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:46.889
 regulated and of course can work bitterly with effects on it 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.240
 as soon as something technical 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.430
 Now his computer has progressed significantly and he just missed 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.460
 the music 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.260
 Interval alone could have now and if you have to go 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.090
 Thank you for listening and have fun trying it out
