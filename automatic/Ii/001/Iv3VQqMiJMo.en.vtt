00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 we always look at the current market is 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.780
 very very critical 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.540
 not that everything was perfectly 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.860
 well maybe it's a little better in 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.170
 comics in the iron and steel industry 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.940
 example to say but hey he never 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.710
 has been so easy for a young author of 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.029
 to be published and never so 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.830
 hard to find readers 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.390
 I think that today the booksellers a 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.849
 role to play in overproduction 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.439
 then the plethora of output in me to them 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.000
 booklet tips become essential again 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.529
 I put myself in the place today of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.820
 someone who does not read the wind and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.170
 mambed the blacks nor regular when he has 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.880
 in the politically designed idea he 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.340
 can flee it's possible and we 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.960
 does more of the same work before read from 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.360
 comic book now on august of 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.219
 cartons yes today everything is done on 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.129
 an excel spreadsheet tells very little about 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.530
 story we talk about numbers compared 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.320
 quantity in talking would put him some 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.850
 compare cleanable it's better to be 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.239
 on the side of the pros of the little ones too 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.590
 slow 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.210
 wade was a comic do not have to 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.600
 only print heroes must be 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.989
 yourself elsewhere you make a book you are 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.200
 paid for this book and you are paid us 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.210
 not according to your working time 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.020
 and you are paid according to your value 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.000
 on the market 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.830
 I was lucky in the good 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.869
 earth I arrived during the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.900
 paradoxical overproduction I took advantage 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.189
 and I'm paying a little bit for the baton 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.020
 d'anton it's a bit cold a bit but 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.700
 it's trade yes we're in a 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.930
 ultra liberal world above the band 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.909
 comic you do not bump you're me I'm 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.280
 say I participate in this overproduction 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.340
 because I have to make myself 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.659
 two three albums a year to live 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.250
 to be able to live so I participate 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.390
 in autarky with sir koala 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.470
 we meet people who have enough 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.759
 galley for me right now it's up to 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.390
 plug in a few balls and a 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.490
 discovered a fan I know galley 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.310
 it's not it's not all shit and 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.180
 goat 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.770
 sold unsaleable his coach I 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.520
 do not understand but I would like 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.000
 understand 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.240
 I would like to understand this mechanism 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.590
 from opening to anything today 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.230
 I happen to make the decision 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.319
 reasonable to stop a collaboration 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.090
 on a series after the first album me 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.590
 it hurts my stomach I do not know 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.700
 how do young people live to others 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.590
 suppose they have another job 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.599
 obviously our role is to do in 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.000
 so that the authors can live 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.290
 what is your possible but role 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.360
 authors also know how to adapt 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.709
 there is a surrealist side to say about this 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.870
 kind of things as if those who do 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.850
 low shit jobs blames us 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.519
 to do nice jobs in us 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.950
 forbidding in living so in us 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.540
 forbidding to have protection 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.190
 which we forbid to have 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.410
 unemployment protection or things 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.590
 like that short we have that slab but in 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.590
 height
