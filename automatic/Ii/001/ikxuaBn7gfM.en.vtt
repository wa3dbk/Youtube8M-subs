skills<00:00:14.849> tutorial<00:00:15.410> this<00:00:16.410> footage<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.859> from<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
skills tutorial this footage is from the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.640 
skills tutorial this footage is from the
same<00:00:17.699> gameplay<00:00:18.060> but<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.109> felt<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:19.439> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
same gameplay but I just felt like the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.200 
same gameplay but I just felt like the
video<00:00:19.859> would<00:00:19.980> be<00:00:20.010> too<00:00:20.250> long<00:00:20.430> if<00:00:20.640> i<00:00:20.730> add<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
video would be too long if i add it to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.779 
video would be too long if i add it to
it<00:00:21.359> but<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.410> basically<00:00:22.710> use<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> same<00:00:23.609> place

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
it but I basically use the same place

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.790 
it but I basically use the same place
than<00:00:24.029> here<00:00:24.210> where<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.080> all<00:00:25.260> about<00:00:25.439> moving

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
than here where it's all about moving

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.160 
than here where it's all about moving
around<00:00:26.039> kiting<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.029> trying<00:00:27.720> as<00:00:27.840> much<00:00:27.869> as

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170

from<00:01:06.450> enemy<00:01:06.840> fire<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.710> need<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.100> able<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
from enemy fire you need to be able to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.700 
from enemy fire you need to be able to
deal<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.270> people<00:01:09.450> who<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:10.080> using<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.530> same

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
deal with people who are using the same

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.440 
deal with people who are using the same
tactics<00:01:11.189> against<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.729> now<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> light

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
tactics against you now the light

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.390 
tactics against you now the light
assault<00:01:12.750> class<00:01:12.960> obviously<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.010> class

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
assault class obviously is the class

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.399 
assault class obviously is the class
that<00:01:14.430> uses<00:01:14.790> mobility<00:01:15.479> mostly<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.229> their

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
that uses mobility mostly to their

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.960 
that uses mobility mostly to their
advantage<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.100> they<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:17.700> also<00:01:17.850> very

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
advantage and they are also very

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.480 
advantage and they are also very
unpredictable<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.220> take<00:01:20.460> that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
unpredictable so you have to take that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580 
unpredictable so you have to take that
in<00:01:20.790> consideration<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:21.509> well<00:01:21.540> one<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.500> the
