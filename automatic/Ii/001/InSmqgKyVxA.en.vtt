00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.380 
League and we do try to play the right
way<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.950> place<00:01:39.189> nice<00:01:39.460> book<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.820> I<00:01:39.880> think<00:01:39.939> it's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
way and place nice book and I think it's

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.730 
way and place nice book and I think it's
getting<00:01:40.539> stronger<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.289> stronger<00:01:41.439> every<00:01:41.590> year

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
getting stronger and stronger every year

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.440 
getting stronger and stronger every year
I<00:01:42.100> know<00:01:42.399> everyone<00:01:42.670> keeps<00:01:42.789> saying<00:01:42.880> about<00:01:43.329> the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
I know everyone keeps saying about the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.029 
I know everyone keeps saying about the
European<00:01:43.899> performances<00:01:44.500> but<00:01:44.619> I<00:01:44.710> think<00:01:44.890> that's

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
European performances but I think that's

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.540 
European performances but I think that's
been
