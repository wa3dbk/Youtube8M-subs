00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
solidity in the second half and the way

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.940 
solidity in the second half and the way
they<00:02:49.420> ground<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:49.989> out<00:02:50.170> when<00:02:50.440> things<00:02:50.650> weren't

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
they ground it out when things weren't

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.740 
they ground it out when things weren't
going<00:02:51.220> their<00:02:51.519> way<00:02:51.550> they<00:02:51.850> got<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.180> clean<00:02:52.420> sheet

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
to me an improvement in the mentality

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.750 
to me an improvement in the mentality
because<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.860> amount<00:03:03.070> of<00:03:03.160> times<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.580> season

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
because the amount of times this season

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.190 
because the amount of times this season
we've<00:03:04.060> consider<00:03:04.450> goals<00:03:04.660> in<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.870> last<00:03:04.959> 10

minutes<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.530> game<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.860> its<00:03:06.010> cost<00:03:06.250> as<00:03:06.519> big

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
time and there was that feeling was it

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.440 
time and there was that feeling was it
that<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.580> know<00:03:09.670> in<00:03:09.820> a<00:03:09.880> second<00:03:10.180> off<00:03:10.269> because

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
that you know in a second off because

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.820

West<00:03:10.630> have<00:03:10.780> made<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.959> couple<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.290> changes<00:03:11.680> in

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
West have made a couple of changes in

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.320 
West have made a couple of changes in
the<00:03:11.920> game<00:03:12.040> was<00:03:12.190> little<00:03:12.340> bit<00:03:12.430> difficult<00:03:12.580> I<00:03:13.030> mean

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
the game was little bit difficult I mean

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.070 
the game was little bit difficult I mean
really<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.570> thought<00:03:13.750> we<00:03:13.810> should<00:03:13.840> have<00:03:13.930> been

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
really I thought we should have been

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.270 
really I thought we should have been
outside<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.440> half<00:03:14.620> time<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:14.920> thought<00:03:15.130> we

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
outside a half time I thought we

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.160 
outside a half time I thought we
completely<00:03:15.820> dominated<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.630> first<00:03:16.870> half

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.840 
didn't didn't read score enough goals
for<00:03:19.810> our<00:03:19.900> for<00:03:20.530> what<00:03:20.650> our<00:03:20.850> possession

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
for our for what our possession

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.550 
for our for what our possession
warranted<00:03:22.299> but<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> second<00:03:23.170> half<00:03:23.260> we<00:03:23.410> made

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
warranted but the second half we made

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.140 
warranted but the second half we made
changes<00:03:23.590> brought<00:03:24.010> song<00:03:24.310> on<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.610> any<00:03:24.790> on<00:03:24.970> and

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
changes brought song on and any on and

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.420 
changes brought song on and any on and
they<00:03:25.209> looked<00:03:25.390> a<00:03:25.480> bit<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.690> threat<00:03:25.959> now<00:03:26.829> early

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
they looked a bit of a threat now early

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.550
