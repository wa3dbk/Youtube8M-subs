00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.950
 all the time on target with you again ment 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.910
 bulin in this video I will tell you about 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:24.240
 how to learn to play even faster for 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.740
 for you to pass that threshold 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.439
 the speed that you already have 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.230
 rise from any pace to more 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.540
 quick need to remember that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:42.030
 he is all musicians have a best friend and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:45.030
 his name is metronome information in this video 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.930
 will be very useful for those who love 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.480
 seams who wants to play super-fast but for 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.879
 to make her hair even better for you 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.210
 head needs to subscribe to my 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.210
 channel 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.660
 how can we overcome that threshold 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.030
 speeds that we already have how 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.430
 learn to play fast how to play 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.700
 faster pace and play freely 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.430
 At the same time, many of their cool guys 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.979
 video school they say guys are playing 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.020
 first slowly then you will feel 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.619
 to win sure in this sky 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.630
 continue to play a faster pace and so 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.979
 gradually raise raise raise 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.780
 for there tempos 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.380
 important point maybe many of you 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.280
 also do and have already done but somebody all 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.979
 we have conceived a tussle I can play 160 but 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:46.340
 I have to play at a pace of 200 ira 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:49.039
 honesty and how do i make an answer 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.690
 there is a very interesting feature 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.289
 works with metronome 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.649
 she called put faster 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.860
 pace 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.960
 what can you do now i will show you how 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.789
 it works on the example of one 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.039
 a small fragment from my 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.190
 own etude in A minor on the development 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.110
 such techniques variable stroke 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.450
 I presented there I borrowed melodies 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.629
 very famous works one of 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.980
 of these pieces is called the flight of the bumblebee 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:22.250
 the great composer of the roman korsakov 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:26.030
 and so the flight of the bumblebee 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.360
 I will play at an pace of 160 right away without 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.360
 snot 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.120
 but 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.950
 So it was a fragment of the flight of the Bumblebee Aktobe 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.140
 160 basically play him not pretty 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.140
 difficult so i can figure it out even 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.689
 up to 180 will do as they say cool guys 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.609
 now and played 160 it is roughly speaking 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.609
 slower take 108 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.120
 but 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.120
 Mama 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.890
 it was already there 108 and I already was 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.260
 a little harder 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.070
 for example , the 180 for me is the ceiling 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.470
 my speed 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.170
 what do i do how can i overcome 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.740
 he hasn't been anyone but I think john 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.310
 petrucci 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.110
 in one of my school videos I say that 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.420
 in order for you to overcome the threshold 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.970
 speed must be set 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.550
 the tempo to say nothing at all 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.360
 can't really sound absurd 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:57.680
 but in my opinion it gives the result for example 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:01.580
 180 for me is the ceiling of my speed 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.610
 I want to play for example 200 ira 16 and 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.250
 now try to put 202 and 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.760
 lose the flight of the bumblebee see what 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.760
 will turn out 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.690
 but 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.820
 do not rush to throw me heavy objects 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.800
 in fact it was very difficult and 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.660
 you yourself have heard that I have very bad 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.330
 it turns out to play at this pace 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.840
 let's try to see what happens 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.840
 on second try 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.000
 it turned out too not very well okay 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.000
 try 3 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.330
 third time turned out, too, but so-so 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.530
 in fact it was really difficult for me 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.680
 play at this pace 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.250
 it was that 220 but i was saying i want 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.610
 play at 200 to nothing i play like that 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.590
 dirty so dumb so disgusting it 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.900
 do in order to just 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.390
 feel this pace to my body 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.090
 accustomed to playing at this pace to 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.600
 the melody made its way through this 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.960
 tag 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:50.210
 Now I will try to reduce the price by 20 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.210
 units and were tater tempera drink 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.340
 exactly 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.160
 it was already there 200 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.639
 honestly it wasnâ€™t as easy for me as 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:36.180
 I would like to but you will play not so tournament 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:39.090
 at a pace of 220 so you should do 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:42.900
 output if you like to increase 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:45.720
 your pace your ceiling at speed 20 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.440
 units or pain and try adding 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.900
 on the metro number is 40 or 50 more 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.060
 and try to take it at that pace 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.849
 which you got as a result 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.819
 yes you will probably play wrong 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:02.639
 beautiful you might want fingers 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.449
 will fall nowhere hand about will 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:07.139
 play by 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:08.699
 overall there will be a lot of stocks but the most 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:12.000
 the main thing that you can feel and 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:12.960
 understand it then how those or may sound 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.560
 other passages 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:19.800
 certain types of technology faster 1 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.710
 that is, they walked, but they will begin to expand 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:26.520
 after this work you can try 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:30.150
 lower there by 20 or 30 units less 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.870
 and try the dishes at that rate that 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.289
 we sought 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:37.259
 initially if you feel some 

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:38.849
 improvement that you are closer to 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:41.729
 results that came out 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:44.639
 it means you do everything right hope
