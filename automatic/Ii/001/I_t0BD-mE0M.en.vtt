00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 i 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.620
 do not 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.809
 look 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.630
 first of all we have to make a 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.300
 study of the person 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.310
 to know exactly his physical state is 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.560
 has done sport at night sport and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.000
 state of health when this started already 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.430
 to prepare a plan totally 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.680
 customized depends on the state of the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.380
 person of the time available and their 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.840
 objectives really how fast you want 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.180
 control this weight with this already 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.930
 we started working on the plan the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.930
 training plan 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.920
 first of all what I recommend 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.080
 it is always having a lot of patience to have 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.750
 a lot of patience and above all to make him see 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.370
 that there is no magic wand of 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.210
 that nobody is going to give him anything and that 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.610
 she is the one who is going to win 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:01.879
 win the the trump a lot of patience 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:04.250
 tranquility and work to me what gives me 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.530
 a better result and they are proven 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.700
 that varied work is never the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.400
 same exercises or with the same 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.950
 intensity there will be training that is done 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.840
 then work the resistance races 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.520
 continues for a while and change 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.070
 others because they are very short exercises 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.220
 high intensity varied above all 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.930
 vary and have always motivated the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.970
 person never know what we're going to do 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.350
 neither what is touching today or what is not touching and not 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.390
 we never build the body to a 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.410
 exercise and work all resistance 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.410
 speed power 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.000
 basic factor apart from training 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.549
 it is the feeding to carry a 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.580
 varied feeding does not need a 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.759
 strict diet but a diet with 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.560
 really healthy habits incorporate 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.649
 new habits to our our life 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.899
 normal avoid elevators avoid or catch 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.720
 the car when necessary and walk and 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.390
 use our body as much as possible 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.409
 these eating habits and the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.899
 training to be done this 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.990
 person is really the complement 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.990
 ideal
