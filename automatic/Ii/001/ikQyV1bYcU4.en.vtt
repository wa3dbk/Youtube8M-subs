video or my first guest my nosy videos
so<00:00:12.000> it's<00:00:12.300> pretty<00:00:12.480> straightforward<00:00:12.780> pretty

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
so it's pretty straightforward pretty

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.600 
so it's pretty straightforward pretty
easy<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.769> what<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.950> want<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.130> do<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.460> want

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
easy so what you want to do is you want

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.620 
easy so what you want to do is you want
to<00:00:14.639> go<00:00:14.730> 1<00:00:14.910> 2<00:00:15.210> 3<00:00:15.320> 4<00:00:16.320> 5<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.460> want<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.699> go<00:00:17.789> 8<00:00:18.029> so

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
to go 1 2 3 4 5 and you want to go 8 so

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
to go 1 2 3 4 5 and you want to go 8 so
go<00:00:19.350> right<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:19.710> 1<00:00:20.279> 2<00:00:20.730> 3<00:00:20.760> 4<00:00:21.720> 5<00:00:22.939> 6<00:00:23.939> 7<00:00:24.840> 8<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.529> then

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
go right here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and then

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.509 
go right here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and then
we<00:00:25.740> go<00:00:25.949> 1<00:00:26.279> 2<00:00:26.789> 3<00:00:26.820> 4<00:00:27.439> 5<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.859> hopefully<00:00:29.160> if<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.369> did

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
we go 1 2 3 4 5 and hopefully if I did

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.990 
we go 1 2 3 4 5 and hopefully if I did
my<00:00:29.640> math<00:00:29.670> right<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.179> should<00:00:30.359> line<00:00:30.510> up<00:00:31.009> by<00:00:32.009> 1

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
my math right it should line up by 1

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.440 
my math right it should line up by 1
block<00:00:33.360> here<00:00:33.570> yes<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.110> did<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.489> now<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.239> next

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
block here yes it did so now the next

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.889 
block here yes it did so now the next
step<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:37.020> go<00:00:37.110> down<00:00:37.290> 1<00:00:37.680> 2<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> then<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> have

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
step is to go down 1 2 so then you have

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.950 
step is to go down 1 2 so then you have
a<00:00:39.930> total<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.500> 3<00:00:40.770> right<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.399> 1<00:00:42.090> 2<00:00:42.329> 3<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
a total of 3 right here so 1 2 3 and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.720 
a total of 3 right here so 1 2 3 and
then<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.500> want<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.710> clear<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.010> out<00:00:44.190> into<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
then you want to clear this out into a

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.790 
then you want to clear this out into a
big<00:00:45.000> gigantic<00:00:45.360> square<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.170> what<00:00:46.379> we<00:00:46.530> are<00:00:46.649> going

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
big gigantic square so what we are going

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.279 
big gigantic square so what we are going
to<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.190> skip<00:00:48.090> ahead<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.809> will<00:00:48.989> jump<00:00:49.200> back

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
to do is skip ahead and I will jump back

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.650 
to do is skip ahead and I will jump back
once<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:51.030> cleared<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.449> you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
and throw down blocks so that you can

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.249 
and throw down blocks so that you can
you<00:01:22.710> know<00:01:22.799> jump<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.490> need<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.259> the

other thing you want to do is throw

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.649 
other thing you want to do is throw
blocks<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.130> top<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.420> does

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
blocks up here on top and what this does

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.200 
blocks up here on top and what this does
is<00:01:30.920> say<00:01:31.920> zombie<00:01:32.310> jumps<00:01:32.640> down<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.150> he

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
is say zombie jumps down here and he

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.460 
is say zombie jumps down here and he
comes<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.570> tries<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.810> tackle<00:01:34.110> when<00:01:34.380> you're

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
comes and tries to tackle when you're

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.920 
comes and tries to tackle when you're
inside<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.860> bunker<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.509> he<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.630> only<00:01:36.720> do

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
inside this bunker here he can only do

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.719 
inside this bunker here he can only do
this<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.799> makes<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> easier<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.490> shoot

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
this and it makes it easier to shoot

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.249 
this and it makes it easier to shoot
them<00:01:38.939> instead<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.509> trying<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.990> shoot<00:01:40.140> them

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
them instead of trying to shoot them

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.679 
them instead of trying to shoot them
when<00:01:40.350> they're<00:01:40.470> jumping<00:01:40.740> around<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.280> um

so<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.549> mean<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> said<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:57.840> pretty<00:01:57.990> easy

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
so I mean like I said it's pretty easy

so I mean like I said it's pretty easy
nothing<00:01:58.560> fancy<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.060> went<00:02:00.270> three<00:02:00.659> back

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
nothing fancy I think we went three back

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.410 
nothing fancy I think we went three back
in<00:02:01.320> depth<00:02:01.710> I'm<00:02:01.979> not<00:02:02.189> totally<00:02:02.430> sure<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:03.119> think

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
in depth I'm not totally sure I think

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.450 
in depth I'm not totally sure I think
that's<00:02:03.600> how<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.840> went<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.860> don't<00:02:05.070> screw

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
that's how it went but so I don't screw

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.800 
that's how it went but so I don't screw

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
you guys how to build that but it was an

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.000 
you guys how to build that but it was an
escape<00:03:08.430> route<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.500> dragon<00:03:10.500> came<00:03:10.709> and

escape route so that the dragon came and

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.280 
escape route so that the dragon came and
we<00:03:11.609> could<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:11.969> bail<00:03:12.329> down<00:03:12.569> these<00:03:12.719> stairs<00:03:12.989> and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
we could just bail down these stairs and

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.959 
we could just bail down these stairs and
go<00:03:13.379> into<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.650> safe<00:03:13.919> room<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.549> dragon

go into the safe room and dragon
couldn't<00:03:15.239> hit<00:03:15.329> us<00:03:15.450> because<00:03:15.719> it<00:03:15.810> was<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.139> deep

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
and then we also had a quick escape

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.890 
and then we also had a quick escape
