00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello everyone got the site today 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.880
 aliexpress to send here is obtained 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.250
 I have headphones for s 3 and here 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.139
 rikel type 2a and 3a batteries 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.029
 Let's start with the batteries I have them 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.970
 opened opened because 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.070
 It turns out I ordered the store in two 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.390
 order times that is in one order from me 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.000
 was on these batteries 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.769
 and the second order was for these on my 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.689
 the seller issued one track number two 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.899
 orders I was therefore confused 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.200
 something like that is sent to all 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.760
 just decided to save and in one package 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.820
 put two orders at once 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.469
 so I opened it all looked at 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.120
 place 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:49.890
 so here we see some batteries 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.890
 which type 2a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:00.449
 they are at 2,200 milliamps so here 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.260
 1000 recharges written by authors on 850 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.159
 milliampere which is type 3a too 1000 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.830
 recharging voltage of 12 volts and how 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.950
 those and others and it turns out these 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.630
 nickel metal hydride batteries 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.670
 that the reverse side of the battle here 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.380
 probably written characteristics now 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.180
 I'll bring it closer so I can see that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.810
 I can say more prosecutors 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.479
 I have n't used it yet but read 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.020
 on the aliexpress dedicated forum 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.360
 these batteries are decent all praise 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.110
 that is, they have a real declared capacity 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.060
 they work long and well soon for me 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.390
 charger will come then I will test 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.810
 This these batteries already precisely 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.460
 I will know whether to remove or not but I will 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.670
 believe for the time being on words to people who 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.710
 wrote so here is the second parcel here 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.719
 cat zr headphones faster recently i 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.750
 I ordered myself this three headphones 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.719
 can look at me in my past 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.469
 video but I then had headphones company 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.069
 Nick for 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.200
 it turns out a miracle here they are completely different 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.550
 packaging 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.680
 some kind of fish is drawn here 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.440
 characteristics I do not know as they 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.050
 Do not written as here can be compared 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.120
 although not the fact that it is written here real 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.630
 specifications 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.930
 we will open who came well 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.480
 Of course I will compare these headphones 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.430
 which ones would be better not so much 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.910
 sign that those seven dollars were that 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.459
 these packaging for all products are kozyavka 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.170
 I donâ€™t want to receive such a view 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:51.349
 headphones such a package without a difference 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:54.380
 what d2 and d3 or others open here 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:58.370
 package we have, I should be the pads 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:02.329
 replaceable yes there are replaceable pads like 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.239
 see big and small get 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:10.640
 middle pads are worn on themselves 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:16.600
 headphones are the same headphones 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:19.459
 firms dark d3a behind written d3 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.859
 metal wire is exactly the same 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.280
 Here are the differences noticed that these headphones 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:29.060
 the wire is twisted with velcro is usually just 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:34.130
 twist some wires so necessary 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.950
 unravel well here it is the wire as in 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.980
 Silicone to like 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.310
 dense is usually not confused in the cold 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.100
 freeze in general goat headphones all 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.040
 I like them pretty high quality 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:52.780
 All sound good think not 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.780
 worse so here's the plug letter g 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.030
 how many here are three contacts on bayonets well 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.790
 right because here mikrafona 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.139
 no just headphones 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.889
 Well, what about them need to tell 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.030
 test 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:09.650
 Now I will test in the player in the phone 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.440
 then I will tell you my impressions as 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.329
 They are sounding so including the video I'm leaving for 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.030
 headphone testing and so 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:20.150
 tested these headphones to zoe d3 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.720
 what anime thought did not disappoint with 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.050
 sound is not okay 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:29.120
 the bass are high too 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.620
 the sound is clear 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.230
 so detailed when their immediately 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.970
 started listening to it was a feeling that i 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.490
 as if i can hear it playing separately 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.370
 each instrument in general headphones 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.730
 good for your money if you compare them 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.590
 After all, id3 food supply service is the third difference 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.350
 especially not noticed that these play well 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.240
 what these 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.840
 only difference I can say that there is 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.670
 only performed by these models from 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.820
 different manufacturers get here 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.670
 on the plug with the letter g in those plug straight 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.550
 i have more ticks 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.610
 noticeable data headphones to me 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.590
 If you like it, who needs headphones 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.590
 I recommend to buy for $ 7 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.290
 quite good purchase 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.010
 that's all thanks to everyone for watching and 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.010
 bye everyone
