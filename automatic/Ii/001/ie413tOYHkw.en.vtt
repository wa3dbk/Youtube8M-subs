 dragon that this guy is asking for beauty

 so come on, I'll explain explain 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.100
 for you more or less like you 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.380
 should follow 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.780
 Here I am. I'll show you one. 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.570
 replay of an attack of mine but before 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.940
 replay I'll show you 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.610
 is something that is crucial right before 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.860
 of you to make some kind of attack 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.130
 thing you have to get into the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.720
 life of your opponent and see where is 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.740
 What are you going to start this attack on? 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.270
 okay first was that year that indicated 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.670
 by the game itself 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.580
 is that the game itself provided me and me 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.220
 I analyzed what his defense I 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.550
 first would have to destroy to begin 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.630
 to do is to make a good attack 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.520
 effective right? 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.369
 in this case, which could disrupt the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.440
 his barbarian king is that he alone 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.160
 can deal a lot of damage there as I go 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.830
 use mages so I need to finish 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.200
 he is quick to stay alert in the 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.990
 aerial defenses like I'm going to use dragon 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.280
 you also need to be running with them 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.140
 a very quick way there and as the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.840
 center of the village he was out I do not know 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.680
 if it was inactive it would not put 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.260
 inside 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.630
 I'm going to start the attack right here is 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.350
 so what you should do is always 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.790
 plan what your attack is going to 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.510
 start and what are the dangers of your 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.510
 attack 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.420
 here in the most dangerous case here 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.019
 mine is my opponent's will be the barbarian king 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.430
 his 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.019
 the castle of the clan that I'm sure 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.850
 that has a dragon 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.100
 even before attacking he knew that he had 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.810
 a dragon and the air defense then I 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.950
 I started, of course, I 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.770
 this way I would put a 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.330
 the magician here isolated to reach 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.239
 this castle than this 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.910
 this center give life to it like no other. 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.519
 of his defenses is how you can see 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.590
 none of the defenses covers the castle of 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.200
 his clan then I was going to leave the wizard to 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.050
 was just to take away 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.830
 already the castle the center of his life 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.920
 combat 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.900
 It's after I wanted to do it was some 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.709
 barbarians attract the king's noise to 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.190
 out 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.040
 and release all the magicians together after 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.870
 a healer can do is finish 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.630
 with him and the magicians and were going down 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.010
 melting all this part right there 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.819
 while I let go of all my 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.519
 dragons is composition of fury to power 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.579
 accelerate the process and vimar 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.920
 even with the village of this enemy of mine 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.470
 generally what we do not plan 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.530
 Whatis not what happens at the moment 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.780
 What are you going to do with the attack? 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.959
 another right wrong then I will 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.680
 show you what happened is this 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.680
 my attack 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.180
 the first thing I said to you 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.670
 I put here my mage're 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.580
 he has already begun to harm the anthem in the 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.170
 right castle in the center of his life 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.470
 Dude, I'm talking about castle all the time. 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.380
 old the center of Vila Perneta then I 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.570
 I only have mine is my boat to be able to 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.040
 call his barang 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:25.100
 the barbarian king only that he ignored the 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.730
 my my barbarian because he saw that 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.890
 the village center of the castle was being 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.530
 destroyed 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.470
 So he went to be able to do this 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.480
 attack, and then I put all my 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.320
 wizards to finalize a report 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.470
 and I let my my healer loose 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.050
 so the wizards have an extra time 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.120
 life and with that you only have all the 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.340
 dragons next to a lot of fury 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.890
 to accelerate this from here and finalize 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.380
 soon with this air defense his tac will go 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.440
 to give a time to more than a thousand cars has only 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.110
 plus a dragon here of the clan team of the air and 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.190
 with that as you can see the lamb 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.800
 she like the air defense is half 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.890
 far in he is with sky is 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.550
 able to take is and healing some 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.150
 magicians 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.040
 even so I put 10 magicians 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.500
 have left one or two but even so they 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.229
 they managed to make a good year and soon 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.810
 then he can see that the village is 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.690
 being totally destroyed here I just 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.060
 I have a 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:35.720
 a portion of healing but wrong 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.530
 because it ended up dying 11 11 dragon 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.950
 before 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.500
 Then I already released my my my king 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.500
 barbarian as I told you, the 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.600
 his dragon from the castle and like me 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.440
 had two dragons here doing the defense 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.480
 then there was a was almost useless for 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.200
 he this dragon team managed to take the 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.360
 life of my barbarian king plus one not 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.570
 You made a lot of 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.060
 then only harmless defenses remained 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.190
 and four of the dragons still to power 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:12.050
 finish the job 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:15.169
 this from here is was a 100% attack right 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:20.800
 It's explaining more or less to you. 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:23.930
 It's like you behave in a certain way. 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.910
 determined certain types of 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.950
 battle is because sometimes you program 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.990
 one thing but nothing happens 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.979
 the other and you have to know what to do 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.979
 at the time understand 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:38.000
 sometimes it shakes but it's not just 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:39.410
 keep calm and do the attack of 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.380
 best possible way 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.229
 but the biggest tip even is you enter 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.660
 before sure analyze well where you 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:49.550
 will start the attack and whatever with 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.700
 sure will work out very well 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.250
 beauty people, this is it, I hope so 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:59.990
 bring a few more videos of one 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:03.160
 little more but simpler than sometimes 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.630
 How do I have the staff here in the clan? 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.310
 new then it's good sometimes to spend some 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.500
 Some tips 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.600
 even if it is a bit simpler but 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.570
 that in the end, right? 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.919
 I ended up bringing victory to the clan who 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:20.479
 reality what matters for us 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:23.110
 so beauty is worth even one more 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:23.110
 hug
