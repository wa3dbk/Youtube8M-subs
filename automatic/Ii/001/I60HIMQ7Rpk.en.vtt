with the fire punch here as and then I'm
gonna<00:01:23.040> I'm<00:01:23.369> gonna<00:01:23.490> whirlwind<00:01:23.880> them<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.150> into

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
gonna I'm gonna whirlwind them out into

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.240 
gonna I'm gonna whirlwind them out into
his<00:01:24.570> Rotom<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.259> actually<00:01:25.350> risking<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
his Rotom and I was actually risking the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.429 
his Rotom and I was actually risking the
switch<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> thought<00:01:27.780> he<00:01:28.049> might<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
switch here I thought he might go with a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.840 
switch here I thought he might go with a
Edinburgh<00:01:28.710> grass<00:01:29.009> because<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.430> was<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
Edinburgh grass because it was it was a

he<00:04:21.970> /<00:04:22.300> predicted<00:04:22.750> last<00:04:22.930> time<00:04:23.260> at<00:04:23.590> like<00:04:23.860> at<00:04:23.980> the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
he / predicted last time at like at the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.730 
he / predicted last time at like at the
situation<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.900> new<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.230> best<00:04:26.410> buy<00:04:26.530> frame

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
situation and a new the best buy frame

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.050 
situation and a new the best buy frame
is<00:04:26.890> to<00:04:26.980> go<00:04:27.070> is<00:04:27.160> to<00:04:27.250> go<00:04:27.280> for<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.550> safe<00:04:27.760> attack

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
is to go is to go for the safe attack

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.630 
is to go is to go for the safe attack
but<00:04:28.570> that<00:04:28.960> did<00:04:29.620> not<00:04:29.650> work<00:04:29.800> out<00:04:30.010> from<00:04:30.220> very<00:04:30.460> well

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
but that did not work out from very well

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.550 
but that did not work out from very well
so<00:04:30.880> I<00:04:30.910> go<00:04:31.120> into<00:04:31.240> my<00:04:31.390> gastro<00:04:31.660> dog<00:04:31.810> he's<00:04:32.320> heating

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
so I go into my gastro dog he's heating

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.690 
so I go into my gastro dog he's heating
out<00:04:32.770> this<00:04:32.860> was<00:04:33.010> going<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.250> go<00:04:33.460> into<00:04:33.580> his

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
out this was going to go into his

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.610 
out this was going to go into his
reuniclus<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.540> this<00:04:34.750> crate<00:04:35.140> was<00:04:35.290> actually

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
reuniclus and is this crate was actually

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.560 
reuniclus and is this crate was actually
look<00:04:35.770> pretty<00:04:35.800> crucial<00:04:36.250> because<00:04:36.580> I<00:04:37.000> didn't

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
look pretty crucial because I didn't

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.670 
look pretty crucial because I didn't
quit<00:04:37.690> him<00:04:37.810> there<00:04:37.990> he<00:04:38.140> would've<00:04:38.290> been<00:04:38.410> inclined

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
quit him there he would've been inclined

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.040 
quit him there he would've been inclined
to<00:04:38.770> go<00:04:38.860> for<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.010> trick<00:04:39.310> room<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:40.050> probably

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
to go for the trick room and probably

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.010 
to go for the trick room and probably
like<00:04:41.710> like<00:04:42.010> take<00:04:42.490> my<00:04:42.670> team<00:04:42.910> very<00:04:43.450> eat<00:04:43.750> very

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
like like take my team very eat very

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.990 
like like take my team very eat very
easily<00:04:44.200> but<00:04:44.680> he's<00:04:45.310> going<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.580> be<00:04:45.670> forced<00:04:45.910> to

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
easily but he's going to be forced to

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.460 
easily but he's going to be forced to
switch<00:04:46.180> at<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:46.510> point<00:04:46.750> because<00:04:46.960> he<00:04:47.290> knows<00:04:47.440> he

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
switch at this point because he knows he

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.440 
switch at this point because he knows he
can't<00:04:47.770> live<00:04:47.890> another<00:04:48.040> scald<00:04:48.460> go<00:04:49.120> back<00:04:49.300> into

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
can't live another scald go back into

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.720 
can't live another scald go back into
the<00:04:49.540> road<00:04:49.720> I'm<00:04:49.840> wash<00:04:50.140> and<00:04:50.530> I<00:04:51.190> know<00:04:51.250> at<00:04:51.580> this

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
the road I'm wash and I know at this

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.820 
the road I'm wash and I know at this
point<00:04:51.790> that<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.390> hidden<00:04:52.630> power<00:04:52.810> of<00:04:52.840> grass<00:04:53.620> is

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
point that the hidden power of grass is

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.830 
point that the hidden power of grass is
coming<00:04:54.160> because<00:04:54.640> I<00:04:54.940> think<00:04:55.210> he<00:04:55.270> thought<00:04:55.480> that<00:04:55.810> I

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
coming because I think he thought that I

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.720 
coming because I think he thought that I
was<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.080> very<00:04:56.260> risky<00:04:56.650> player<00:04:56.890> and<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.430> thought

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
was a very risky player and I thought

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.610 
was a very risky player and I thought
that<00:04:57.970> he<00:04:58.570> thought<00:04:58.720> that<00:04:58.870> I<00:04:58.900> over<00:04:59.200> predict<00:04:59.560> a

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
that he thought that I over predict a

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.950 
that he thought that I over predict a
lot<00:04:59.800> but<00:05:00.700> I'm<00:05:01.030> think<00:05:01.330> that's<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.600> case<00:05:01.780> at

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
lot but I'm think that's the case at

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.810 
lot but I'm think that's the case at
this<00:05:02.080> point<00:05:02.350> so<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.590> go<00:05:02.800> in<00:05:02.830> right<00:05:02.980> jirachi<00:05:03.400> and

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
this point so I go in right jirachi and

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.460 
this point so I go in right jirachi and
I<00:05:03.880> take<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.210> Empire<00:05:04.510> grass<00:05:04.750> very<00:05:05.200> nicely

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
I take the Empire grass very nicely

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.290 
I take the Empire grass very nicely
because<00:05:05.770> I<00:05:05.950> do<00:05:06.010> have<00:05:06.190> a<00:05:06.250> lot<00:05:06.550> it's<00:05:06.730> a<00:05:07.120> lot<00:05:07.150> of

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
because I do have a lot it's a lot of

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.420 
because I do have a lot it's a lot of
special<00:05:07.690> defense<00:05:07.930> investment<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:09.130> I<00:05:09.280> thought

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
special defense investment and I thought

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.680 
special defense investment and I thought
four<00:05:09.640> I<00:05:09.670> thought<00:05:09.730> he<00:05:09.910> might<00:05:10.030> gonna<00:05:10.210> just<00:05:10.420> drag

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
four I thought he might gonna just drag

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.510 
four I thought he might gonna just drag
and<00:05:10.750> I<00:05:10.930> thinking<00:05:11.290> he<00:05:11.470> could<00:05:12.010> take<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.340> iron

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
and I thinking he could take the iron

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.520 
and I thinking he could take the iron
head<00:05:12.760> and<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.690> like<00:05:13.960> it's<00:05:14.110> happening<00:05:14.260> with

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
head and and like it's happening with

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.400 
head and and like it's happening with
with<00:05:15.190> anything<00:05:15.580> he<00:05:15.730> has<00:05:15.940> but<00:05:16.810> he<00:05:16.840> actually

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
with anything he has but he actually

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.470 
with anything he has but he actually
stays<00:05:17.860> in<00:05:18.190> just<00:05:18.700> a<00:05:18.730> pretty<00:05:18.910> good<00:05:19.060> plan<00:05:19.210> on<00:05:19.330> his

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
stays in just a pretty good plan on his

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.200 
stays in just a pretty good plan on his
part<00:05:20.010> and<00:05:21.010> at<00:05:21.250> that<00:05:21.370> point<00:05:21.730> all<00:05:21.880> I<00:05:21.940> wanted<00:05:22.150> to

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
part and at that point all I wanted to

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.570 
part and at that point all I wanted to
do<00:05:22.390> was<00:05:22.419> was<00:05:22.930> like<00:05:23.860> I'm<00:05:24.040> like<00:05:24.190> iron<00:05:24.430> had

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
do was was like I'm like iron had

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.430 
do was was like I'm like iron had
flinched<00:05:24.970> the<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:25.540> road<00:05:25.690> on<00:05:25.840> wash<00:05:26.020> because<00:05:26.290> i

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
flinched the the road on wash because i

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.830 
flinched the the road on wash because i
took<00:05:26.890> my<00:05:27.040> best<00:05:27.250> bet<00:05:27.490> at<00:05:27.610> this<00:05:27.760> point<00:05:28.000> and<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:28.630> he

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
took my best bet at this point and I he

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.630 
took my best bet at this point and I he
not<00:05:29.380> all<00:05:29.530> he's<00:05:29.650> doing<00:05:29.860> now<00:05:29.980> he's<00:05:30.130> saying<00:05:30.340> he<00:05:30.460> no

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
not all he's doing now he's saying he no

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.159 
not all he's doing now he's saying he no
go<00:05:30.669> ahead<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.240> power<00:05:31.330> of<00:05:31.450> grass<00:05:31.690> and<00:05:31.960> then<00:05:32.110> he

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
go ahead and power of grass and then he

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.450 
go ahead and power of grass and then he
finally<00:05:32.350> switches<00:05:32.890> going<00:05:33.100> on<00:05:33.190> to<00:05:33.340> his

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
finally switches going on to his

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.450 
finally switches going on to his
Dragonite<00:05:34.000> seeing<00:05:34.750> as<00:05:35.020> now<00:05:35.380> all<00:05:35.680> i'm<00:05:36.100> doing<00:05:36.130> is

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
Dragonite seeing as now all i'm doing is

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.770 
Dragonite seeing as now all i'm doing is
going<00:05:36.550> for<00:05:36.729> iron<00:05:36.880> head<00:05:37.120> by<00:05:37.300> do<00:05:37.360> go<00:05:37.600> for<00:05:37.720> the
