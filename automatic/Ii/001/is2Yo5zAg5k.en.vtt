00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
when you're driving and moving that

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.860 
when you're driving and moving that
shank<00:03:41.430> would<00:03:41.610> move<00:03:41.790> back<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.240> forth<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
shank would move back and forth in the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.930 
shank would move back and forth in the
receiver<00:03:43.260> when<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.680> does<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:44.520> would<00:03:44.670> sometimes

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.530 
receiver on the bottom put the pin and
clip<00:04:56.130> in<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:56.550> then<00:04:57.060> you'd<00:04:57.210> have<00:04:57.300> these

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
clip in and then you'd have these

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.180 
clip in and then you'd have these
collars<00:04:58.080> right<00:04:58.290> here<00:04:58.530> with<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.830> nuts<00:04:59.040> and

collars right here with the nuts and

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.190 
collars right here with the nuts and
bolts<00:04:59.340> again<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.360> would<00:05:00.479> slide<00:05:00.690> this<00:05:00.750> back

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
bolts again you would slide this back

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.750 
bolts again you would slide this back
and<00:05:01.440> this<00:05:01.560> up<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:01.950> then<00:05:02.070> just<00:05:02.280> tighten<00:05:02.490> those

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
and this up and then just tighten those

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.490 
and this up and then just tighten those
down<00:05:02.820> so<00:05:03.270> it<00:05:03.360> holds<00:05:03.510> those<00:05:03.750> two<00:05:03.960> together<00:05:04.110> and

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
down so it holds those two together and

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.650 
down so it holds those two together and
then<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.370> would<00:05:05.490> install<00:05:05.790> your<00:05:06.000> chains<00:05:06.330> as

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
then you would install your chains as

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.050 
then you would install your chains as
you<00:05:06.780> can<00:05:06.930> see<00:05:07.110> they<00:05:07.260> hook<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:08.060> torklift

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
you can see they hook to the torklift

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.490 
you can see they hook to the torklift

have<00:05:10.740> holes<00:05:10.979> drilled<00:05:11.370> in<00:05:11.490> them<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:11.729> you<00:05:11.790> just

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
have holes drilled in them so you just

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.659 
have holes drilled in them so you just
mount<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.450> chains<00:05:13.350> to<00:05:13.620> there<00:05:13.830> then<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:14.550> have

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
mount the chains to there then you have

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.340 
mount the chains to there then you have
your<00:05:14.790> turn<00:05:15.060> buckles<00:05:15.510> and<00:05:15.660> they<00:05:16.110> would<00:05:16.229> be

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
your turn buckles and they would be

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.080 
your turn buckles and they would be
mounted<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.860> plate<00:05:17.070> up<00:05:17.250> here<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.970> then

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
mounted to the plate up here and then

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.430 
mounted to the plate up here and then

you just tighten down this nuts to hold
it<00:05:26.850> into<00:05:27.000> place<00:05:28.160> that<00:05:29.160> should<00:05:29.460> do<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:29.639> for<00:05:30.240> the
