00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.650 
though that are having the problem are
using<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:21.980> same<00:03:22.130> technology<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:23.390> either

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
using the same technology so either

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.030 
using the same technology so either
Apple's<00:03:24.260> got<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.500> use<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.620> different

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
Apple's got to use a different

they've got to completely advance the
