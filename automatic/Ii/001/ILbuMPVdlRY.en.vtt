you

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.820 

and<00:01:08.659> they<00:01:09.659> are<00:01:09.720> super<00:01:10.020> easy<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> remove

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and they are super easy to remove

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.880 
and they are super easy to remove
because<00:01:11.340> they're<00:01:12.170> sitting<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.259> top<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> nail

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
because they're sitting on top of nail

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.399 
because they're sitting on top of nail
polish<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.790> gives<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.240> nails<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.020> extra

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
polish so that gives the nails and extra

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.010 
polish so that gives the nails and extra
barrier<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:17.190> protection<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:18.479> usually<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.960> I

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
barrier of protection so usually what I

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.350 
barrier of protection so usually what I
use<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:20.780> metal<00:01:21.780> file<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:24.030> want<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> make

use is a metal file and you want to make

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.430 
use is a metal file and you want to make

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.950 
sure that you go very very slow and that
you're<00:01:28.619> very<00:01:29.009> gentle<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.659> don't
