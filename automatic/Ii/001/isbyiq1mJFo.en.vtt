00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
something at a simmer what happens is a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.400 
something at a simmer what happens is a
lot<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.370> flavor<00:02:41.670> compounds<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.690> meat

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
lot of the flavor compounds in the meat

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.830 
lot of the flavor compounds in the meat
itself<00:02:43.560> end<00:02:44.130> up<00:02:44.730> leaching<00:02:45.209> into<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.600> liquid

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
itself end up leaching into the liquid

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
the meat to settle down and actually

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.010 
the meat to settle down and actually
reabsorb<00:02:52.790> those<00:02:53.790> flavor<00:02:54.120> compounds<00:02:54.480> it

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
reabsorb those flavor compounds it

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.510 
reabsorb those flavor compounds it
actually<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.530> also<00:02:55.770> makes<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.100> meat<00:02:56.340> much

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
actually it also makes the meat much

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.280 
actually it also makes the meat much
more<00:02:56.760> succulent<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.570> way<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.110> when<00:02:58.260> i

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
more succulent this way this is when i
