color<00:01:43.900> from<00:01:44.200> Milani<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.619> think<00:01:44.860> it's<00:01:44.979> really

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
color from Milani I think it's really

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.420 
color from Milani I think it's really
really<00:01:45.550> pretty<00:01:45.930> i'm<00:01:46.930> using<00:01:47.380> my<00:01:47.410> NYX<00:01:47.830> jumbo<00:01:47.950> eye

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
really pretty i'm using my NYX jumbo eye

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.850 
really pretty i'm using my NYX jumbo eye
shadow<00:01:48.700> pencil<00:01:49.000> in<00:01:49.360> milk<00:01:49.630> as<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:49.960> base<00:01:50.380> for<00:01:50.680> this

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
shadow pencil in milk as a base for this

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.800 
shadow pencil in milk as a base for this
look<00:01:51.100> just<00:01:51.400> to<00:01:51.520> reduce<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.090> fallout<00:01:52.479> from<00:01:52.630> the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
look just to reduce the fallout from the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.020 
look just to reduce the fallout from the
shadows<00:01:53.229> as<00:01:53.500> well<00:01:53.830> as<00:01:54.070> just<00:01:54.220> have<00:01:54.400> a<00:01:54.430> nice<00:01:54.700> base

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
shadows as well as just have a nice base

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.330 
shadows as well as just have a nice base
so<00:01:55.660> the<00:01:55.810> eyeshadows<00:01:56.350> definitely<00:01:56.979> have<00:01:57.100> more

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
so the eyeshadows definitely have more

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.279 
so the eyeshadows definitely have more
pigmentation<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.119> I'm<00:01:58.630> using<00:01:58.899> my<00:01:59.050> Urban

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.789 
so thin and it is it was straight in
this<00:03:47.489> day<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.540> wanted<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> give<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.650> little

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
this day so I wanted to give it a little

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.410 
this day so I wanted to give it a little
bit<00:03:50.010> more<00:03:50.130> texture<00:03:50.549> so<00:03:50.819> that<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.060> would<00:03:51.150> hold

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
bit more texture so that it would hold

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.479 
bit more texture so that it would hold
better<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:52.349> if<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:52.680> already<00:03:52.890> have<00:03:53.099> textured

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
better so if you already have textured

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.740 
better so if you already have textured
here<00:03:53.640> you<00:03:53.760> definitely<00:03:54.120> don't<00:03:54.239> have<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.630> do

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
here you definitely don't have to do

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.330 
here you definitely don't have to do
that<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.110> then<00:03:55.290> I'm<00:03:55.530> just<00:03:55.739> putting<00:03:55.920> in<00:03:56.099> some

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
that and then I'm just putting in some

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.120 
that and then I'm just putting in some
dry<00:03:56.640> shampoo<00:03:57.120> again<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.750> add<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.530> texture

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
dry shampoo again to add to the texture

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.150 
dry shampoo again to add to the texture
then<00:03:59.880> I'm<00:04:00.239> spraying<00:04:00.660> some<00:04:01.019> hairspray<00:04:01.470> again

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
then I'm spraying some hairspray again

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.240 
then I'm spraying some hairspray again
so<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.579> it<00:04:02.849> holds<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.650> this<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:04.860> what<00:04:05.010> i<00:04:05.040> have

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
so that it holds and this is what i have

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.890 
so that it holds and this is what i have
to<00:04:05.340> do<00:04:05.459> since<00:04:05.640> my<00:04:05.790> hair<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.060> so<00:04:06.239> fine<00:04:06.569> and<00:04:06.840> so

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
to do since my hair is so fine and so

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.949 
to do since my hair is so fine and so
thin<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.530> then<00:04:08.160> i<00:04:08.220> put<00:04:08.579> my<00:04:08.730> hair<00:04:09.000> up<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.690> high

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610
