um so the editor that had he canceled on
me<00:00:31.410> um<00:00:32.450> he<00:00:34.040> didn't<00:00:35.040> really<00:00:35.250> talk<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.550> me<00:00:35.640> that

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.920 
me um he didn't really talk to me that
much<00:00:35.820> when<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> asked<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:36.480> questions<00:00:36.510> about

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
much when I asked some questions about

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.569 
much when I asked some questions about
my<00:00:37.230> episode<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.770> how<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.010> was<00:00:38.160> going<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
my episode like how it was going and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.220 
my episode like how it was going and
stuff<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.750> guess<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.989> doesn't<00:00:40.110> really

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
stuff but I guess it doesn't really

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.900 
stuff but I guess it doesn't really
matter<00:00:40.469> now<00:00:40.590> since<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.070> threw<00:00:41.399> away<00:00:41.489> all<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
matter now since I it threw away all the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.350 
matter now since I it threw away all the
clips<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:43.579> um<00:00:46.370> but<00:00:47.370> um<00:00:47.579> what<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.059> did<00:00:48.239> do
