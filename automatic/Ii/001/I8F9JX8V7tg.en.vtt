my big cannon camera so um I think it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.719 
my big cannon camera so um I think it
turned<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.290> pretty<00:01:04.439> well<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:05.010> actually<00:01:05.430> opted

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.490 
turned out pretty well I actually opted
to<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> voiceover<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:06.930> opposed<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.350> just

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
to do a voiceover as opposed to just

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.899 
to do a voiceover as opposed to just
like<00:01:07.590> talking<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> camera<00:01:08.670> really

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
like talking to the camera really

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.460 
like talking to the camera really
through<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> camera<00:01:09.659> because<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.960> didn't<00:01:10.320> know

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
