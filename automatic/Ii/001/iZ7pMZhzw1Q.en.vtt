and<00:03:48.030> see<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.209> gps<00:03:49.750> status<00:03:50.609> GPS<00:03:51.609> not<00:03:52.000> fix<00:03:52.419> and

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
and see the gps status GPS not fix and

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.470 
and see the gps status GPS not fix and
satellite<00:03:53.769> zero<00:03:54.250> because<00:03:54.430> we<00:03:54.760> are<00:03:54.940> inside<00:03:55.419> a

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
satellite zero because we are inside a

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.360 
satellite zero because we are inside a
building<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:57.989> we<00:03:58.989> have<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.410> velocity<00:03:59.590> the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
building and we have the velocity the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.879 
building and we have the velocity the
speed<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:00.940> quad<00:04:01.359> the<00:04:01.989> altitude<00:04:02.620> of<00:04:02.769> the

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
speed of the quad the altitude of the

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.479 
speed of the quad the altitude of the
quad<00:04:03.419> using<00:04:04.419> barometer<00:04:05.079> or<00:04:05.230> using<00:04:05.620> GPS<00:04:06.129> and

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
quad using barometer or using GPS and

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.689 
quad using barometer or using GPS and
the<00:04:07.060> battery<00:04:07.540> with<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.709> number<00:04:09.069> of<00:04:09.280> cells

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
the battery with the number of cells

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:13.890 
the battery with the number of cells
that<00:04:10.440> use<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.829> quad<00:04:12.639> a<00:04:12.790> multi<00:04:13.120> pilot<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.690> quad

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
that use the quad a multi pilot the quad

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.939 
that use the quad a multi pilot the quad
so<00:04:14.769> you<00:04:14.829> have<00:04:15.129> also<00:04:15.669> raw<00:04:16.449> peach<00:04:17.139> and<00:04:17.590> your

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
so you have also raw peach and your

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:24.089 
so you have also raw peach and your
information<00:04:18.849> if<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.570> change<00:04:22.860> so<00:04:23.860> it's

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
information if you change so it's

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.920 
information if you change so it's
important<00:04:24.729> at<00:04:24.909> the<00:04:25.030> moment<00:04:25.090> we<00:04:25.539> are<00:04:25.570> not

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
important at the moment we are not

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.159 
important at the moment we are not
connected<00:04:26.650> by<00:04:27.010> wire<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.270> quad<00:04:28.630> but<00:04:28.930> it's

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
connected by wire to the quad but it's

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.839 
connected by wire to the quad but it's
only<00:04:29.470> connecting<00:04:30.130> busey<00:04:30.610> DJ<00:04:31.150> 2ft<00:04:31.659> x<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:33.340> if<00:04:33.610> you

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
only connecting busey DJ 2ft x so if you

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.719 
only connecting busey DJ 2ft x so if you
change<00:04:34.380> their<00:04:35.380> role<00:04:35.669> this<00:04:36.669> is

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
change their role this is

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.950 
change their role this is
the<00:04:38.469> referee<00:04:39.469> Freight<00:04:39.830> update<00:04:40.520> rate<00:04:40.909> of<00:04:41.270> the

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
the referee Freight update rate of the

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.879 
the referee Freight update rate of the
telemetry<00:04:42.529> box<00:04:43.539> okay<00:04:45.339> so<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:48.050> is<00:04:48.319> the<00:04:48.559> speed

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
telemetry box okay so this is the speed

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.749 
telemetry box okay so this is the speed
of<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.870> rate<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:51.199> update<00:04:51.529> you<00:04:52.249> can<00:04:52.490> change

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
of the rate the update you can change

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.110 
of the rate the update you can change
also<00:04:53.089> they<00:04:53.539> hittin<00:04:54.309> you<00:04:55.309> can<00:04:55.580> change<00:04:55.879> the

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
also they hittin you can change the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.719 
also they hittin you can change the
eating<00:04:56.569> and<00:04:56.839> see<00:04:57.229> they<00:04:57.469> eating<00:04:57.830> changing<00:04:58.460> on

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
eating and see they eating changing on

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.379 
eating and see they eating changing on
your<00:04:59.050> jetty<00:05:00.050> box<00:05:00.379> so<00:05:01.249> we<00:05:01.279> are<00:05:01.639> working<00:05:01.909> also<00:05:02.389> to

your jetty box so we are working also to
hitting<00:05:05.389> altitude<00:05:06.219> and<00:05:07.219> status<00:05:07.939> of<00:05:08.150> flight

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
hitting altitude and status of flight

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.379 
hitting altitude and status of flight
but<00:05:09.110> in<00:05:09.319> the<00:05:09.439> future<00:05:09.650> will<00:05:10.069> be<00:05:10.249> possible<00:05:10.729> also

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
but in the future will be possible also
