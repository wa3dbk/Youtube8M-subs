00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.859 
yourself to add these foods in instead
of<00:01:58.920> focusing<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.549> what<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.909> can't<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.479> it's

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
of focusing on what you can't have it's

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.920 
of focusing on what you can't have it's
so<00:02:01.110> much<00:02:01.290> more<00:02:01.500> fun<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.979> focus<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.689> foods

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
so much more fun to focus on the foods

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.969 
so much more fun to focus on the foods
that<00:02:04.020> are<00:02:04.170> delicious<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.770> nourishing

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
that are delicious and nourishing

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.039 
that are delicious and nourishing
instead<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.969> thinking<00:02:06.149> about<00:02:06.329> what<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.750> can't

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
instead of thinking about what you can't

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.070 
instead of thinking about what you can't
or<00:02:07.320> shouldn't<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.740> or<00:02:08.009> bad<00:02:08.160> foods<00:02:08.599> so<00:02:09.599> that's

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
or shouldn't have or bad foods so that's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.400 
or shouldn't have or bad foods so that's
what<00:02:10.229> we'll<00:02:10.319> do<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> program<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.430> then

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
what we'll do in the program and then

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.320 
what we'll do in the program and then
ending<00:02:12.680> out<00:02:12.830> from<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.280> because<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.730> really

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
ending out from that because I really

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.690 
ending out from that because I really
believe<00:02:14.600> that<00:02:15.050> whole<00:02:15.680> body<00:02:15.920> wellness<00:02:16.190> takes

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
believe that whole body wellness takes

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.360 
believe that whole body wellness takes
into<00:02:17.060> account<00:02:17.090> many<00:02:17.570> factors<00:02:18.110> will<00:02:18.800> also<00:02:19.130> look

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
into account many factors will also look

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.850 
into account many factors will also look
at<00:02:19.840> managing<00:02:20.840> stress<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.500> not<00:02:21.680> necessarily

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
at managing stress so not necessarily

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.160 
at managing stress so not necessarily
reducing<00:02:22.760> stress<00:02:23.060> or<00:02:23.300> getting<00:02:23.600> rid<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:23.810> stress
