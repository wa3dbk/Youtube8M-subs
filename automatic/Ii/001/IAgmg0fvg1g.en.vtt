you<00:02:34.080> are<00:02:34.290> still<00:02:34.560> going<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.739> be<00:02:34.890> able<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.190> train

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
you are still going to be able to train

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.199 
you are still going to be able to train
with<00:02:36.120> decent<00:02:36.629> intensity<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:38.010> again<00:02:38.790> not

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
with decent intensity but it's again not

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.920 
with decent intensity but it's again not
going<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.629> anywhere<00:02:40.049> near<00:02:40.349> their<00:02:41.310> peak

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
going to be anywhere near their peak

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.479 
going to be anywhere near their peak
alright<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.410> let's<00:02:43.650> look<00:02:43.799> at<00:02:43.920> somebody<00:02:44.280> who's

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
alright so let's look at somebody who's

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.030 
alright so let's look at somebody who's
doing<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.790> full<00:02:45.030> body<00:02:45.269> routine<00:02:45.750> okay<00:02:46.170> they

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
doing a full body routine okay they

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.990 
doing a full body routine okay they
train<00:02:47.489> their<00:02:48.180> entire<00:02:48.599> body<00:02:49.129> three<00:02:50.129> times<00:02:50.430> per

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
train their entire body three times per

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.080 
train their entire body three times per
week<00:02:51.079> okay<00:02:52.079> so<00:02:52.140> this<00:02:52.470> means<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:52.950> on<00:02:53.310> day<00:02:53.819> one

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
week okay so this means that on day one

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.949 
week okay so this means that on day one
they're<00:02:54.660> doing<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.230> chest<00:02:56.129> exercise<00:02:56.489> for<00:02:57.120> four

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
they're doing a chest exercise for four

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.520 
they're doing a chest exercise for four
sets<00:02:58.290> on<00:02:58.530> day<00:02:59.370> two<00:02:59.780> another<00:03:00.780> four<00:03:01.079> sets<00:03:01.349> and

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
sets on day two another four sets and

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.199 
sets on day two another four sets and
then<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.829> day<00:03:02.010> three<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.400> other<00:03:02.549> four<00:03:02.819> sets

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
then on day three and other four sets

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.110 
then on day three and other four sets
here's<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.079> difference<00:03:04.470> they're<00:03:05.220> both<00:03:05.459> doing

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
here's the difference they're both doing

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.400 
here's the difference they're both doing
twelve<00:03:06.780> sets<00:03:07.170> on<00:03:07.799> their<00:03:08.519> chest<00:03:08.910> however<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
twelve sets on their chest however the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.830 
twelve sets on their chest however the
person<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:10.980> full<00:03:11.190> body<00:03:11.430> split<00:03:11.819> is<00:03:12.090> always

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
person on the full body split is always

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.869 
person on the full body split is always
going<00:03:13.109> to<00:03:13.230> be<00:03:13.319> more<00:03:13.739> primed<00:03:14.540> during<00:03:15.540> their

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
going to be more primed during their

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.170 
going to be more primed during their
chest<00:03:17.879> exercise<00:03:19.069> over<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.400> person<00:03:20.819> with<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
chest exercise over the person with the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.330 
chest exercise over the person with the
button<00:03:21.480> part<00:03:21.930> split<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.799> overall

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
button part split so the overall

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.849 
button part split so the overall
workload<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.420> person<00:03:24.870> during<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.620> full

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
workload of the person during the full

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.670 
workload of the person during the full
body<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.489> going<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.329> be<00:03:27.510> slightly<00:03:28.170> higher<00:03:28.410> than

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
body is going to be slightly higher than

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.059 
body is going to be slightly higher than
the<00:03:29.129> person<00:03:29.549> doing<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:30.260> body<00:03:31.260> part<00:03:31.650> splits

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
the person doing the body part splits

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.809 
the person doing the body part splits
okay<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.790> there's<00:03:33.540> no<00:03:33.599> physiological<00:03:34.819> reason

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
okay and there's no physiological reason

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.289 
okay and there's no physiological reason
as<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.030> why<00:03:36.359> we<00:03:36.540> should<00:03:36.569> stuff<00:03:37.019> all<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.739> our

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
as to why we should stuff all of our

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.509 
as to why we should stuff all of our
training<00:03:39.299> or<00:03:39.480> in<00:03:39.989> for<00:03:40.500> one<00:03:40.650> muscle<00:03:41.010> group<00:03:41.040> into

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
training or in for one muscle group into

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.150 
training or in for one muscle group into
one<00:03:41.549> day<00:03:41.970> all<00:03:42.840> right<00:03:43.109> we<00:03:43.560> know<00:03:43.769> this<00:03:43.950> because

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
one day all right we know this because

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.580 
one day all right we know this because
of<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.609> repeated<00:03:44.910> bout<00:03:45.269> effect<00:03:45.690> being<00:03:46.349> more

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
of the repeated bout effect being more

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.020 
of the repeated bout effect being more
frequently<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.220> train<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.549> muscle<00:03:47.910> the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
frequently you train the muscle the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.360 
frequently you train the muscle the
faster<00:03:48.450> or<00:03:48.690> recover<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.590> adapt<00:03:49.889> and<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.220> know

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
faster or recover and adapt and you know

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.129 
faster or recover and adapt and you know
that<00:03:50.579> that's<00:03:50.760> what<00:03:50.910> we're<00:03:51.060> aiming<00:03:51.209> for<00:03:51.660> when

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
that that's what we're aiming for when

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.770 
that that's what we're aiming for when
we're<00:03:52.319> trying<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.680> build<00:03:52.889> muscle<00:03:53.359> alright<00:03:54.359> so

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
we're trying to build muscle alright so

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.920 
we're trying to build muscle alright so
and<00:03:55.700> more<00:03:56.700> specifically<00:03:57.329> with<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:58.190> beginner

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
and more specifically with a beginner

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.050 
and more specifically with a beginner
because<00:04:00.930> we're<00:04:01.200> lifting<00:04:01.470> I'm<00:04:02.099> sorry<00:04:02.430> I'm<00:04:02.880> not

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
because we're lifting I'm sorry I'm not

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.879 
because we're lifting I'm sorry I'm not
gonna<00:04:03.209> call<00:04:03.389> myself<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.840> beginner<00:04:04.169> but<00:04:04.410> because

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
gonna call myself a beginner but because

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:10.970 
gonna call myself a beginner but because
you're<00:04:05.370> lifting<00:04:05.669> in<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:08.299> in<00:04:09.299> an<00:04:09.959> area<00:04:10.349> so<00:04:10.410> far

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
you're lifting in a in an area so far

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.369 
you're lifting in a in an area so far
away<00:04:11.310> from<00:04:11.370> your<00:04:11.760> genetic<00:04:12.180> potential<00:04:12.599> your

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
away from your genetic potential your

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.540 
away from your genetic potential your
body<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.980> going<00:04:14.190> to

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
body is going to

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.520 
body is going to
able<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:15.030> recover<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.870> adapt<00:04:16.170> to<00:04:16.380> that

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
able to recover and adapt to that

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.000 
able to recover and adapt to that
stimulus<00:04:16.799> very<00:04:17.519> quickly<00:04:18.350> alright<00:04:19.350> let's<00:04:19.890> talk

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
stimulus very quickly alright let's talk

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.730 
stimulus very quickly alright let's talk
about<00:04:20.190> another<00:04:20.430> thing<00:04:21.320> elevated<00:04:22.320> protein

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
about another thing elevated protein

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.430 
about another thing elevated protein
synthesis<00:04:23.340> okay<00:04:23.670> we<00:04:24.090> know<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.660> when<00:04:25.260> we

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
synthesis okay we know that when we

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.370 
synthesis okay we know that when we
train<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:26.130> certain<00:04:26.790> muscle<00:04:27.180> group<00:04:27.390> we<00:04:27.900> elevate

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
train a certain muscle group we elevate

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.040 
train a certain muscle group we elevate
protein<00:04:28.890> synthesis<00:04:29.430> for<00:04:29.610> about<00:04:29.850> 40<00:04:30.270> hours<00:04:30.600> and

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
protein synthesis for about 40 hours and

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.470 
protein synthesis for about 40 hours and
then<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.290> goes<00:04:31.440> back<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.890> baseline<00:04:32.270> alright<00:04:33.270> so

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
then it goes back to baseline alright so

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.820 
then it goes back to baseline alright so
if<00:04:33.720> you<00:04:33.810> train<00:04:34.110> your<00:04:34.140> chest

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
if you train your chest

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.400 
if you train your chest
on<00:04:34.890> Monday<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:35.880> elevate<00:04:36.390> protein<00:04:36.840> synthesis

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
on Monday you elevate protein synthesis

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.910 
on Monday you elevate protein synthesis
by<00:04:38.280> Wednesday<00:04:38.880> it's<00:04:39.720> back<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.170> baseline<00:04:40.530> and

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
by Wednesday it's back to baseline and

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.650 
by Wednesday it's back to baseline and
then<00:04:41.040> you're<00:04:41.430> not<00:04:41.610> elevating<00:04:42.240> protein

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
then you're not elevating protein

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.530 
then you're not elevating protein
synthesis<00:04:43.170> in<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.410> chest<00:04:43.740> area<00:04:44.120> until<00:04:45.120> Monday

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
synthesis in the chest area until Monday

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.990 
synthesis in the chest area until Monday
again<00:04:45.870> right<00:04:46.260> but<00:04:47.250> let's<00:04:47.430> look<00:04:47.550> at<00:04:47.670> somebody

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
again right but let's look at somebody

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.290 
again right but let's look at somebody
who<00:04:48.090> splits<00:04:49.160> their<00:04:50.160> training<00:04:50.610> into<00:04:50.850> full-body

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
who splits their training into full-body

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.930 
who splits their training into full-body
three<00:04:52.020> times<00:04:52.260> a<00:04:52.440> week<00:04:52.470> right<00:04:52.980> they<00:04:53.520> elevate

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
three times a week right they elevate

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.270 
three times a week right they elevate
protein<00:04:54.360> synthesis<00:04:54.900> as<00:04:55.080> it's<00:04:55.770> coming<00:04:56.070> down<00:04:56.250> to

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
protein synthesis as it's coming down to

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.280 
protein synthesis as it's coming down to
baseline<00:04:56.790> it's<00:04:57.390> time<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:57.720> train<00:04:57.930> again<00:04:58.170> they

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
baseline it's time to train again they

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.920 
baseline it's time to train again they
elevate<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.800> again<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.400> you<00:05:00.240> can<00:05:00.390> see<00:05:00.540> how<00:05:00.750> it

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
elevate it again and you can see how it

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.050 
elevate it again and you can see how it
goes<00:05:01.080> from<00:05:01.290> there<00:05:01.380> they<00:05:02.040> are<00:05:02.070> experiencing

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
goes from there they are experiencing

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.800 
goes from there they are experiencing
more<00:05:03.300> overall<00:05:03.960> protein<00:05:04.670> synthesis<00:05:05.810> alright

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
more overall protein synthesis alright

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.600 
more overall protein synthesis alright
so<00:05:07.140> if<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:07.710> don't<00:05:07.980> know<00:05:08.070> what<00:05:08.220> protein

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
so if you don't know what protein

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.510 
so if you don't know what protein
synthesis<00:05:09.150> is<00:05:09.450> I<00:05:09.800> would<00:05:10.800> recommend<00:05:11.250> that<00:05:11.310> you

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
synthesis is I would recommend that you

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.010 
synthesis is I would recommend that you
google<00:05:11.790> it<00:05:12.120> is<00:05:12.570> basically<00:05:13.200> when<00:05:13.650> our<00:05:13.950> body<00:05:14.460> is

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
google it is basically when our body is

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.200 
google it is basically when our body is
repairing<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:16.290> building<00:05:16.340> new<00:05:17.340> muscle<00:05:17.520> in<00:05:17.970> a

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
repairing and building new muscle in a

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.360 
repairing and building new muscle in a
sense<00:05:18.420> okay<00:05:18.800> so<00:05:20.330> that<00:05:21.330> is<00:05:21.360> why<00:05:21.840> in<00:05:22.590> my<00:05:22.860> opinion

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
sense okay so that is why in my opinion

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.330 
sense okay so that is why in my opinion
a<00:05:23.610> full<00:05:24.180> body<00:05:24.419> training<00:05:25.380> routine<00:05:25.680> is<00:05:25.950> going<00:05:26.190> to

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
a full body training routine is going to

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.430 
a full body training routine is going to
be<00:05:26.460> superior<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.419> a<00:05:28.260> body<00:05:28.919> part<00:05:29.310> split<00:05:29.700> for

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
be superior to a body part split for

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.950 
be superior to a body part split for
beginners<00:05:31.610> alright<00:05:32.610> and<00:05:32.850> I<00:05:33.540> want<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.810> mention

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
beginners alright and I want to mention

another thing if you are in beginner who

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.550 
another thing if you are in beginner who
is<00:05:37.350> currently<00:05:38.150> doing<00:05:39.150> by<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:39.780> part<00:05:40.200> splits

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
is currently doing by the part splits

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.490 
is currently doing by the part splits
your<00:05:41.430> your<00:05:41.790> strength<00:05:42.150> is<00:05:42.360> probably<00:05:42.600> going<00:05:43.290> up

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
your your strength is probably going up

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.520 
your your strength is probably going up
pretty<00:05:44.430> frequently<00:05:44.970> however<00:05:45.570> somebody<00:05:46.230> who

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
pretty frequently however somebody who

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.659 
pretty frequently however somebody who
is<00:05:46.590> doing<00:05:46.860> a<00:05:47.300> full<00:05:48.300> body<00:05:48.360> split<00:05:49.640> with<00:05:50.640> a

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
is doing a full body split with a

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.670 
is doing a full body split with a
practical<00:05:51.150> program<00:05:51.510> for<00:05:52.020> a<00:05:52.050> beginner<00:05:52.410> is

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
practical program for a beginner is

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.000 
practical program for a beginner is
going<00:05:53.610> to<00:05:53.790> be<00:05:53.940> able<00:05:54.150> to<00:05:54.870> for<00:05:55.380> a<00:05:55.410> certain<00:05:55.890> amount

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
going to be able to for a certain amount

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.720 
going to be able to for a certain amount
of<00:05:56.160> time<00:05:56.480> increase<00:05:57.480> any<00:05:57.870> given<00:05:58.710> lifts<00:05:58.980> by

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
of time increase any given lifts by

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.380 
of time increase any given lifts by
about<00:06:00.000> five<00:06:00.330> to<00:06:00.540> ten<00:06:00.780> pounds<00:06:00.990> per<00:06:01.620> session

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
about five to ten pounds per session

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.480 
about five to ten pounds per session
that's<00:06:03.390> right<00:06:03.750> so<00:06:04.050> as<00:06:04.290> a<00:06:04.350> beginner<00:06:04.860> this<00:06:05.280> is<00:06:05.340> a

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
that's right so as a beginner this is a

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.440 
that's right so as a beginner this is a
very<00:06:05.850> special<00:06:06.570> opportunity<00:06:06.980> that<00:06:07.980> you<00:06:08.190> have

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
very special opportunity that you have

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:14.000 
very special opportunity that you have
that<00:06:09.450> I<00:06:10.790> really<00:06:11.790> recommend<00:06:12.210> you<00:06:12.720> you<00:06:13.650> know<00:06:13.740> aim

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
that I really recommend you you know aim

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.580 
that I really recommend you you know aim
for<00:06:14.700> the<00:06:14.970> optimal<00:06:15.510> approach<00:06:15.600> and<00:06:16.020> taking<00:06:16.320> full

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
for the optimal approach and taking full

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.700 
for the optimal approach and taking full
advantage<00:06:16.919> of<00:06:17.550> being<00:06:18.210> a

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
advantage of being a

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.580 
advantage of being a
yeah<00:06:18.970> all<00:06:19.970> right<00:06:20.150> so<00:06:20.360> that's<00:06:20.960> pretty<00:06:21.170> much<00:06:21.410> it

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
yeah all right so that's pretty much it

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.250 
yeah all right so that's pretty much it
I<00:06:22.010> just<00:06:22.250> want<00:06:22.460> to<00:06:22.520> say<00:06:22.670> also<00:06:22.940> of<00:06:23.240> your<00:06:23.450> art<00:06:23.750> if

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
I just want to say also of your art if

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.380 
I just want to say also of your art if
you<00:06:24.440> pair<00:06:25.250> beginning<00:06:25.730> you've<00:06:25.880> already<00:06:26.150> been

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
you pair beginning you've already been

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.960 
you pair beginning you've already been
training<00:06:26.810> body<00:06:27.230> parts<00:06:27.650> splits<00:06:27.970> you're

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
training body parts splits you're

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.450 
training body parts splits you're
probably<00:06:29.300> not<00:06:29.840> going<00:06:30.080> to<00:06:30.170> want<00:06:30.380> to<00:06:30.470> switch<00:06:30.830> to

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
probably not going to want to switch to

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.180 
probably not going to want to switch to
a<00:06:31.850> full<00:06:32.330> body<00:06:32.570> split<00:06:33.020> you're<00:06:33.500> probably<00:06:33.830> not

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
a full body split you're probably not

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.870 
a full body split you're probably not
gonna<00:06:34.430> like<00:06:34.640> it<00:06:34.700> I<00:06:35.060> you<00:06:35.750> enjoy<00:06:36.170> the<00:06:36.860> volume<00:06:37.580> and

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
gonna like it I you enjoy the volume and

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.780 
gonna like it I you enjoy the volume and
the<00:06:38.450> nice<00:06:38.630> pump<00:06:39.370> etc<00:06:40.750> so<00:06:41.800> the<00:06:42.800> full<00:06:43.070> body<00:06:43.280> split

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 
the nice pump etc so the full body split

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.700 
the nice pump etc so the full body split
is<00:06:44.000> not<00:06:44.390> going<00:06:44.600> to<00:06:44.660> provide<00:06:44.990> that<00:06:45.050> so<00:06:45.650> you

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
is not going to provide that so you

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.380 
is not going to provide that so you
probably<00:06:46.400> need<00:06:46.580> to<00:06:46.610> take<00:06:46.820> a<00:06:46.850> little<00:06:47.030> bit<00:06:47.240> of

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
probably need to take a little bit of

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.230 
probably need to take a little bit of
the<00:06:47.480> ego<00:06:47.870> hit<00:06:48.580> unless<00:06:49.580> you<00:06:50.000> want<00:06:50.180> to

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
the ego hit unless you want to

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.330 
the ego hit unless you want to
counteract<00:06:50.780> that<00:06:50.870> with<00:06:51.020> the<00:06:51.710> strength<00:06:52.040> gains

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
counteract that with the strength gains

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.890 
counteract that with the strength gains
that<00:06:52.580> you<00:06:52.730> will<00:06:52.910> get<00:06:53.090> from<00:06:53.330> a<00:06:53.420> full<00:06:53.660> body
