00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
to a ghost-type for the immunity I'm

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.340 
to a ghost-type for the immunity I'm
going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.970> start<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> my<00:01:36.450> special<00:01:36.869> wall<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
going to start out to my special wall a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.410 
going to start out to my special wall a
registeel<00:01:37.860> exchange<00:01:38.340> statuses<00:01:38.880> with<00:01:39.030> him<00:01:39.210> and

registeel exchange statuses with him and
now<00:01:39.840> I'm<00:01:39.960> thinking<00:01:40.290> he's<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> supportive<00:01:41.009> set

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
now I'm thinking he's a supportive set

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.469 
now I'm thinking he's a supportive set
can<00:01:41.460> certain<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.790> he<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.060> showed<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.270> little

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
can certain that he just showed a little

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.480 
can certain that he just showed a little
wisp<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.710> believe<00:01:43.979> i'm<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> set<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.430> my

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
wisp so I believe i'm going to set up my

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.819 
wisp so I believe i'm going to set up my
stealth<00:01:44.790> rocks<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.470> thinking<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.680> take

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
stealth rocks here thinking I can take

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:47.960 
stealth rocks here thinking I can take
anything<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.250> supportive<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.850> would

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
anything as supportive so that would

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850 
anything as supportive so that would
handle<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.479> probably<00:01:49.079> even<00:01:49.170> an<00:01:49.409> offensive

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
handle and probably even an offensive

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.069 
handle and probably even an offensive
set<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.220> honest<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.119> yeah<00:01:51.630> now<00:01:51.840> I'm<00:01:51.930> going

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
set to be honest so yeah now I'm going

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.630 
set to be honest so yeah now I'm going
to<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> switch<00:01:52.530> out<00:01:52.710> here<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.040> test<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
to have a switch out here to test the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.160 
to have a switch out here to test the
waters<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.600> guy<00:01:54.780> carries

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
waters and see if this guy carries

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.289 
waters and see if this guy carries
earthquake<00:01:55.649> he<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:56.759> goes<00:01:56.969> for<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> lead

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
earthquake he actually goes for the lead

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.910 
earthquake he actually goes for the lead
seat<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.869> turn<00:01:58.110> making<00:01:58.469> me<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
seat on this turn making me think that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
seat on this turn making me think that
this<00:01:58.979> guy<00:01:59.430> might<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.850> supportive<00:02:00.299> Seth<00:02:00.509> as

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this guy might be a supportive Seth as

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.319 
this guy might be a supportive Seth as
well<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.799> really<00:02:02.189> bulky<00:02:02.610> supportive<00:02:03.119> team

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
well so I really bulky supportive team

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.179 
well so I really bulky supportive team
by<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.509> opponent<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.590> I'm<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:04.799> going<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.040> set

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
by the opponent so I'm just going to set

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.160 
by the opponent so I'm just going to set
up<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.460> reflect<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.149> my<00:02:06.329> opponents<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.869> pay<00:02:07.110> me

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
up a reflect and my opponents can pay me

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.740 
up a reflect and my opponents can pay me
back<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.649> get<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> crit<00:02:08.069> which<00:02:09.060> super

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
back and get a crit which super

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.390 
back and get a crit which super
effective<00:02:09.959> crit<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.319> actually<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.920> going<00:02:11.160> to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
effective crit is actually not going to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.460 
effective crit is actually not going to
kill<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.330> I'm<00:02:12.660> actually<00:02:12.930> really

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
kill so I'm actually really

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.200 
kill so I'm actually really
surprised<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.160> he<00:02:14.280> had<00:02:14.370> leech<00:02:14.610> seed<00:02:14.880> and

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
surprised that he had leech seed and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.940 
surprised that he had leech seed and
crunch<00:02:15.600> crunch<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.620> kind<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.860> an

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
crunch crunch is kind of an

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.530 
crunch crunch is kind of an
unconventional<00:02:17.640> move<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.970> see<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.330> tour

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
2 for the resistance to the crunch which

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.199 
2 for the resistance to the crunch which
worked<00:02:47.130> out<00:02:47.250> pretty<00:02:47.430> well<00:02:47.610> although<00:02:48.090> the

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
worked out pretty well although the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.090 
worked out pretty well although the

luckily<00:02:52.440> for<00:02:52.620> me<00:02:52.770> he<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:52.950> going<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.490> switch<00:02:53.700> out

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
luckily for me he is going to switch out

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.850 
luckily for me he is going to switch out
and<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.390> went<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.780> rapid<00:02:54.959> spin<00:02:55.350> hoping<00:02:55.740> he

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
and I went for the rapid spin hoping he

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.010 
and I went for the rapid spin hoping he
would<00:02:55.980> either<00:02:56.070> switch<00:02:56.520> out<00:02:56.760> or<00:02:57.090> go<00:02:57.720> for<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
would either switch out or go for the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.190 
would either switch out or go for the
leaf<00:02:58.170> seat<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.300> got<00:03:00.630> rid<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.810> myself

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
leaf seat so that got rid of myself

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.199 
leaf seat so that got rid of myself
rocks<00:03:01.500> would<00:03:01.680> freeze<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.340> field<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:03.030> me<00:03:03.120> to

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
rocks would freeze the field for me to

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.060 
rocks would freeze the field for me to
switch<00:03:03.360> into<00:03:03.480> my<00:03:03.660> air<00:03:03.840> freshener<00:03:04.380> my

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
so that was a miss plan on my part but

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.259

I'm<00:04:14.340> just<00:04:14.489> going<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.640> go<00:04:14.760> ahead<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:14.940> go<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.120> my

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
I'm just going to go ahead and go to my

I'm just going to go ahead and go to my

I'm<00:04:48.870> just<00:04:48.990> going<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.169> go<00:04:49.289> for<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.500> rest

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
I'm just going to go for the rest

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.379 
I'm just going to go for the rest
knowing<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.340> can<00:04:50.490> outspeed<00:04:50.880> on<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.120> choke<00:04:51.360> and

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
knowing I can outspeed on the choke and

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.510 
knowing I can outspeed on the choke and
I<00:04:51.599> resist<00:04:51.900> his<00:04:52.050> stab<00:04:52.349> heels<00:04:53.099> for<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.310> dynamic

I resist his stab heels for the dynamic

punch just to get confusion hacks on me
so<00:04:56.280> now<00:04:56.370> I'm<00:04:56.430> going<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.639> search<00:04:56.699> up<00:04:56.849> to<00:04:56.910> my

go for the not very effective payback I

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.360 
go for the not very effective payback I
wasn't<00:05:01.169> necessarily<00:05:01.710> predicting<00:05:02.220> that

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.580 
he's going to protect to block my fake
out<00:05:06.240> because<00:05:06.449> he's<00:05:06.539> probably<00:05:06.780> seen<00:05:07.050> my<00:05:07.199> videos

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
I'm just going to go for the drain punch

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.770 
I'm just going to go for the drain punch
and<00:05:11.400> unfortunately<00:05:12.150> he's<00:05:12.210> going<00:05:12.419> to<00:05:12.479> kill<00:05:12.659> me

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
and unfortunately he's going to kill me

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.420 
and unfortunately he's going to kill me
with<00:05:12.900> a<00:05:12.960> critical<00:05:13.169> hit<00:05:13.470> dynamic<00:05:13.949> punch<00:05:14.130> which

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
with a critical hit dynamic punch which

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.029 
with a critical hit dynamic punch which
unfortunately<00:05:15.060> did<00:05:15.509> matter<00:05:15.740> although<00:05:16.740> it

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
unfortunately did matter although it

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.710 
unfortunately did matter although it
probably<00:05:17.310> wouldn't<00:05:17.550> have<00:05:17.669> mattered<00:05:17.940> if<00:05:18.090> he

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
probably wouldn't have mattered if he

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.980 
probably wouldn't have mattered if he
had<00:05:18.810> got<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:18.990> confusion<00:05:19.590> hacks<00:05:19.830> I<00:05:20.990> guess

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
had got the confusion hacks I guess

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.629 
had got the confusion hacks I guess
that's<00:05:22.169> something<00:05:22.259> we<00:05:22.470> won't<00:05:22.620> really<00:05:22.770> know<00:05:22.889> so

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
that's something we won't really know so

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.100 
that's something we won't really know so
I'm<00:05:23.699> just<00:05:23.819> going<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.000> go<00:05:24.090> ahead<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.569> go<00:05:24.720> for<00:05:24.990> an

I'm just going to go ahead and go for an

I'm just going to go ahead and go for an
ice<00:05:25.289> beam<00:05:26.210> which<00:05:27.210> worked<00:05:27.449> out<00:05:27.539> pretty<00:05:27.690> well

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
ice beam which worked out pretty well

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.540 
ice beam which worked out pretty well
for<00:05:27.990> me<00:05:28.319> and<00:05:28.560> my<00:05:28.889> opponents<00:05:29.220> going<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.400> bring

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
for me and my opponents going to bring

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.339 
for me and my opponents going to bring
in<00:05:29.639> a<00:05:29.699> radical<00:05:30.180> he's<00:05:30.690> going<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:30.960> go<00:05:31.080> for<00:05:31.320> a

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
in a radical he's going to go for a

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.770 
in a radical he's going to go for a
facade<00:05:31.800> while<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.400> went<00:05:32.699> for<00:05:32.909> a<00:05:33.180> heal<00:05:33.539> bell<00:05:33.750> now

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
facade while I went for a heal bell now

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.839 
facade while I went for a heal bell now
I<00:05:34.409> would<00:05:34.680> have<00:05:34.710> just<00:05:34.830> gone<00:05:35.039> for<00:05:35.280> an<00:05:35.370> ice<00:05:35.550> beam

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
I would have just gone for an ice beam

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.129 
I would have just gone for an ice beam
there<00:05:36.060> but<00:05:36.270> I<00:05:36.300> thought<00:05:36.449> he<00:05:36.659> might<00:05:36.840> carry

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
there but I thought he might carry

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.020 
there but I thought he might carry
protect<00:05:37.650> because<00:05:38.009> a<00:05:38.039> lot<00:05:38.219> of<00:05:38.250> Radek<00:05:38.580> eights<00:05:38.729> do

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
protect because a lot of Radek eights do

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.420 
protect because a lot of Radek eights do
well<00:05:39.840> at<00:05:40.169> least<00:05:40.289> that<00:05:40.469> I've<00:05:40.590> encountered<00:05:40.740> just

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
well at least that I've encountered just

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.800 
well at least that I've encountered just
so<00:05:41.580> they<00:05:41.669> can<00:05:41.729> get<00:05:41.909> their<00:05:42.120> flame<00:05:42.539> orb

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
so they can get their flame orb

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.899 
so they can get their flame orb
activated<00:05:43.469> I<00:05:43.650> went<00:05:44.099> to<00:05:44.130> look<00:05:44.340> see<00:05:44.550> thinking<00:05:44.880> I

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
activated I went to look see thinking I

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.070 
activated I went to look see thinking I
could<00:05:45.060> take<00:05:45.210> two<00:05:45.449> hits<00:05:45.659> and<00:05:45.810> set<00:05:45.930> up<00:05:46.020> a

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
could take two hits and set up a

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.920 
could take two hits and set up a
reflects<00:05:46.500> but<00:05:46.800> that<00:05:46.979> was<00:05:47.300> incorrect<00:05:48.300> as<00:05:48.750> it

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
reflects but that was incorrect as it

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.659 
reflects but that was incorrect as it
does<00:05:49.080> just<00:05:49.440> a<00:05:49.530> little<00:05:49.770> over<00:05:49.979> half<00:05:50.190> i<00:05:50.370> believe

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
does just a little over half i believe

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.430 
does just a little over half i believe
so<00:05:50.969> I<00:05:51.000> went<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.240> my<00:05:51.330> resistant<00:05:52.110> simmer<00:05:52.349> down

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
so I went to my resistant simmer down

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.980 
so I went to my resistant simmer down
version<00:05:52.919> 3<00:05:53.190> go<00:05:53.729> for<00:05:53.759> the<00:05:53.969> seismic<00:05:54.270> toss<00:05:54.690> while

version 3 go for the seismic toss while

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.860 
version 3 go for the seismic toss while
he<00:05:55.080> switches<00:05:55.320> out<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.979> his<00:05:56.419> claydol<00:05:57.419> perhaps

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
he switches out to his claydol perhaps

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.529 
he switches out to his claydol perhaps
his<00:05:58.110> death<00:05:58.289> water<00:05:58.729> it<00:05:59.729> does<00:05:59.880> carry<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.240> super

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
his death water it does carry the super

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.390 
his death water it does carry the super
effective<00:06:00.840> earth<00:06:01.110> power<00:06:01.349> though<00:06:01.680> and<00:06:02.280> i'm

effective earth power though and i'm
just<00:06:02.460> going<00:06:02.669> to<00:06:02.699> switch<00:06:02.880> out<00:06:03.000> to<00:06:03.120> my<00:06:03.210> air

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
just going to switch out to my air

freshener<00:06:03.870> knowing<00:06:04.110> it<00:06:04.229> blocks<00:06:04.469> this<00:06:04.740> thing

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
freshener knowing it blocks this thing

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.920 
freshener knowing it blocks this thing
and<00:06:05.280> he<00:06:05.580> might<00:06:05.729> set<00:06:05.909> up<00:06:06.000> the<00:06:06.120> rocks<00:06:06.330> and<00:06:06.630> i<00:06:06.719> need

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
and he might set up the rocks and i need

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.540 
and he might set up the rocks and i need
to<00:06:07.020> get<00:06:07.110> this<00:06:07.259> thing<00:06:07.469> in<00:06:07.590> before<00:06:08.009> rocks<00:06:08.280> get

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
to get this thing in before rocks get

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.209 
to get this thing in before rocks get
set<00:06:08.729> up<00:06:08.759> can<00:06:09.060> i<00:06:09.090> take<00:06:09.270> fifty<00:06:09.690> percent<00:06:09.960> damage

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:10.219 
set up can i take fifty percent damage

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:12.890 
set up can i take fifty percent damage
so<00:06:11.219> that<00:06:11.370> was<00:06:11.460> a<00:06:11.520> good<00:06:11.639> series<00:06:11.880> of<00:06:12.090> place<00:06:12.270> for

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
so that was a good series of place for

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.839 
so that was a good series of place for
me<00:06:13.110> i'm<00:06:13.740> going<00:06:13.979> to<00:06:14.039> switch<00:06:14.190> out<00:06:14.460> here<00:06:14.699> which

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
me i'm going to switch out here which

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.510 
me i'm going to switch out here which
was<00:06:15.000> probably<00:06:15.150> a<00:06:15.330> bad<00:06:15.479> play<00:06:15.840> i<00:06:16.740> probably<00:06:17.250> could

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
was probably a bad play i probably could

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.010 
was probably a bad play i probably could
have<00:06:17.550> just<00:06:17.789> stayed<00:06:17.880> in<00:06:18.210> and<00:06:18.389> gone<00:06:18.539> for<00:06:18.810> an<00:06:18.900> ice

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
have just stayed in and gone for an ice

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.459 
have just stayed in and gone for an ice
beam<00:06:19.349> and<00:06:19.759> then<00:06:20.759> finish<00:06:21.719> this<00:06:21.900> guy<00:06:22.080> off<00:06:22.110> with

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:22.469 
beam and then finish this guy off with

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.800 
beam and then finish this guy off with
an<00:06:22.590> aqua<00:06:22.949> jet<00:06:22.979> I<00:06:23.370> was<00:06:23.969> hoping<00:06:24.090> his<00:06:24.419> Radek<00:06:24.690> 8

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
an aqua jet I was hoping his Radek 8

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.510 
an aqua jet I was hoping his Radek 8
would<00:06:24.930> carry<00:06:25.139> Sucker<00:06:25.440> Punch<00:06:25.770> he'd<00:06:26.099> predict<00:06:26.400> my

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
would carry Sucker Punch he'd predict my

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.939 
would carry Sucker Punch he'd predict my
Aqua<00:06:26.880> Jet<00:06:26.909> and<00:06:27.120> I'd<00:06:27.330> be<00:06:27.449> able<00:06:27.569> to<00:06:27.659> rest<00:06:27.930> up<00:06:28.169> but

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
Aqua Jet and I'd be able to rest up but

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.129 
Aqua Jet and I'd be able to rest up but
that's<00:06:29.099> not<00:06:29.400> the<00:06:29.610> case<00:06:29.639> and<00:06:30.240> I'm<00:06:30.960> just<00:06:31.050> going

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
that's not the case and I'm just going

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:32.779 
that's not the case and I'm just going
to<00:06:31.259> go<00:06:31.319> for<00:06:31.500> a<00:06:31.530> roost<00:06:31.830> here<00:06:31.979> knowing<00:06:32.490> that<00:06:32.520> I

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
to go for a roost here knowing that I

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.959 
to go for a roost here knowing that I
know<00:06:32.880> this<00:06:33.300> tour<00:06:33.599> Tara's<00:06:33.930> move<00:06:34.169> pool<00:06:34.969> and

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969 
know this tour Tara's move pool and

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:37.310 
know this tour Tara's move pool and
doesn't<00:06:36.449> carry<00:06:36.630> anything<00:06:36.870> that<00:06:37.080> can<00:06:37.199> really

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
doesn't carry anything that can really

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.529 
doesn't carry anything that can really
do<00:06:37.529> much<00:06:37.680> to<00:06:37.860> me<00:06:38.010> unfortunately<00:06:39.000> he<00:06:39.120> is<00:06:39.150> going

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 
do much to me unfortunately he is going

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:40.970 
do much to me unfortunately he is going
to<00:06:39.690> get<00:06:39.750> a<00:06:39.810> defense<00:06:40.169> drop

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
to get a defense drop

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.160 
to get a defense drop
which<00:06:41.130> after<00:06:42.060> the<00:06:42.150> defense<00:06:42.450> drop<00:06:42.750> I<00:06:42.960> don't

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.170 
which after the defense drop I don't

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.570 
which after the defense drop I don't
believe<00:06:43.290> my<00:06:43.500> art<00:06:43.770> hakuna<00:06:44.070> will<00:06:44.220> be<00:06:44.310> able<00:06:44.400> to

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
believe my art hakuna will be able to

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.860 
believe my art hakuna will be able to
survive<00:06:44.910> a<00:06:44.970> facade<00:06:45.560> so<00:06:47.270> those<00:06:48.270> defense<00:06:48.600> drops

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
survive a facade so those defense drops

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.440 
survive a facade so those defense drops
we're<00:06:49.650> a<00:06:49.680> bit<00:06:49.830> unfortunate<00:06:50.400> but<00:06:50.550> I<00:06:50.820> guess<00:06:51.300> it

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
we're a bit unfortunate but I guess it

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.140 
we're a bit unfortunate but I guess it
happens<00:06:51.600> so<00:06:52.530> now<00:06:52.710> it's<00:06:53.040> very<00:06:53.340> very<00:06:53.670> close<00:06:53.970> at

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
happens so now it's very very close at

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.210 
happens so now it's very very close at
this<00:06:54.300> stage<00:06:54.570> I'm<00:06:55.140> just<00:06:55.350> going<00:06:55.470> to<00:06:55.500> bring<00:06:55.740> in<00:06:55.980> my

game<00:07:05.670> Sykes<00:07:06.000> I<00:07:06.270> realize<00:07:06.600> that<00:07:06.630> narration<00:07:07.080> was

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
game Sykes I realize that narration was

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.990 
game Sykes I realize that narration was
perhaps<00:07:07.590> a<00:07:07.860> little<00:07:08.040> speedy<00:07:08.490> a<00:07:08.610> little<00:07:08.880> bit

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
perhaps a little speedy a little bit

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.300 
perhaps a little speedy a little bit
speedier<00:07:09.420> than<00:07:09.510> normal<00:07:09.960> but<00:07:10.500> it<00:07:10.920> was<00:07:11.010> a<00:07:11.070> fairly

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
speedier than normal but it was a fairly

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.370 
speedier than normal but it was a fairly
long<00:07:11.520> battle<00:07:12.030> and<00:07:12.180> very<00:07:12.510> fond<00:07:12.750> on<00:07:12.900> at<00:07:12.990> that<00:07:13.140> a

long battle and very fond on at that a

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.680 
long battle and very fond on at that a
10<00:07:13.680> very<00:07:14.220> close<00:07:14.490> I<00:07:14.790> hope<00:07:15.180> everyone<00:07:15.540> had<00:07:15.660> a
