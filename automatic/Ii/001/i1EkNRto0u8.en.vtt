00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.519

 I'll get it loose 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.750
 in 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.610
 what about you doing that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.950
 moves in 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.960
 yes, but do not worry, I'll stand up 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.530
 terminally ill 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.160
 in your opinion one 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.160
 right up to 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.270
 tomorrow at noon I will die 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.110
 and that is the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.970
 but he did not get up then 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.250
 fair-news - longer than usual 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.640
 have children smartass and inaccurate 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.640
 official 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.590
 we make it possible 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.590
 see mette 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:39.020
 is just like before the vita 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.220
 never climb back to the house 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.970
 hide fear again 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.970
 Enjoy your meal 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.700
 Do not you want to tell me what I am going to do 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.840
 Alone, certain people die of lightning 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.840
 slain continuing so on and so 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.750
 You can not go home yet 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.750
 is also clear 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.520
 I must honestly say that 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.930
 I am a very interesting trailer 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.850
 probably a story now 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.020
 would not attack the mainstream 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.550
 not seen in the cinema by so many 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.470
 I will, but right right 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.090
 find exciting tomorrow &amp; tomorrow noon 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.520

 in german cinemas and liv lisa 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.710
 here fries the main character of the lea 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.150
 it plays recently with the 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.580
 Bavarian Film Award for this role 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.320
 you have been awarded a prize 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.240
 girl named lea she is young but she 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.290
 is sick she has cystic fibrosis and has 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.660
 especially the problem that you 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.650
 actually a lung transplant 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.390
 but you would need your own brother 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.190
 even this disease was ill 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.200
 and as a result of such an operation 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.790
 deceased she decides no you 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.920
 would not like to do that to her 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.360
 to put an endpoint and live yourself 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.980
 also decides not to love anymore 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.200
 but want to go to switzerland 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.970
 to claim euthanasia there 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.320
 Take up your family and friends 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.730
 her grandmother is not privy 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.260
 But she still wants one from this plan 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.700
 last time to celebrate your birthday 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.950
 that's the drama of course 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.240
 hardly imaginable and the dramatic 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.650
 ask if it really is ultimately too 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.540
 But I think that is the point 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.970
 the film can do a lot of things 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.830
 the quoted theme plays the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.630
 really worth discussing is the 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.160
 one can talk that I believe that to the 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.810
 Change times with German dram often 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.310
 very very serious maybe one too 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.080
 from time to time he can also be a movie 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.790
 small bright spot granted on some 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.769
 and I think that can do a lot 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.360
 come up with 102 minutes was therefore also 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.260
 not to overlap and I think so 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.930
 trailer gets you already a feeling 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.910
 for that the strip certainly points 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.320
 attacks over which one discusses for a long time 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.330
 May and should that you can with me 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.989
 very excited and tomorrow at noon 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.670

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.700

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.500
 to the short little trailer jack and 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.360
 Tomorrow I'll be dead with Lars Gerdau 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.890
 this one made it stay if not 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.780
