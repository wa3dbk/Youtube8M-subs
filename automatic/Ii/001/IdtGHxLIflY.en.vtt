you<00:01:19.320> know<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:19.860> don't<00:01:19.890> know<00:01:20.130> what<00:01:20.220> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you know I really don't know what that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.830 
you know I really don't know what that
means<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.759> sounds<00:01:21.240> pretty<00:01:21.420> cool<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:23.840> well

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
means it sounds pretty cool and well

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.749 
means it sounds pretty cool and well
then<00:01:25.170> what's<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:25.950> neat<00:01:26.130> about<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.549> that

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
then what's really neat about is that

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.840 
then what's really neat about is that
it's<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.750> Bluetooth<00:01:28.110> obviously<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.579> um

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
it's a it's Bluetooth obviously so um

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
it's a it's Bluetooth obviously so um
like<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.689> connected<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.530> computer

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
like you you connected to your computer

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.080 
like you you connected to your computer
and<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.970> has<00:01:33.210> said<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:34.229> programmable

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
and this has said it's it's programmable

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.999 
and this has said it's it's programmable
so<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.570> go<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> top<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.170> each<00:01:37.320> website<00:01:37.590> no

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
so you go to the top of each website no

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:38.960 
so you go to the top of each website no
I<00:01:38.040> guess<00:01:38.340> they're<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.759> installing

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
I guess they're going to be installing

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.179 
I guess they're going to be installing
like<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:40.049> new<00:01:40.229> tab<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.680> their<00:01:40.799> website
