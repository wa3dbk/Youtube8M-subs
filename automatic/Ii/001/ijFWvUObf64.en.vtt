00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.400
 I see this as climate change 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.020
 we feel everything that I go and maybe what 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.170
 that is not all that sounds high 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.000
 altoandino high that only piura 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.100
 Sometimes some people do not know is , 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.970
 we do not detect the causes that because 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.970
 those changes come 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.129
 ah 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.180
 good in the climatic changes then 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.190
 Clear that here it feels new that is 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.270
 suddenly the drought 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.520
 diseases the unique beaches reach the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.550
 temperature also that in crystal mono 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.640
 but you have to give it as it is said that 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.050
 give life to the change then for how? 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.360
 let's do because suddenly to the 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.869
 same nature is not running over 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.869
 A) Yes 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.549
 this part has been deforested 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.189
 completely through the years have 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.159
 come harvesting the firewood and they have 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:04.270
 predated everything then they are left 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.909
 small is this forest space 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.550
 it is important because the populated center 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:14.260
 of choco is in the upper part no and 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.550
 meters below we can find the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.300
 Cip and coffee coffee producers 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.120
 if there are no trees in the upper part 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.780
 and when the soil is washed there is loss of 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.780
 nutrients 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.990
 the main problem of the coffee growers 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.260
 it is for example that in the dry season 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.110
 They have enough water to produce 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.850
 then production goes down and less 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.010
 economic income for them 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.170
 so if we reforest the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.360
 upper part we help improve the 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.600
 water availability in the basin 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.260
 average not where are the producers of 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.260
 coffee 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.090
 carbons generally 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.520
 the trees more than all of us 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.640
 we have to go some future greetings 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.750
 they capture carbon then comes the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:22.910
 rectifier verifies means how many 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:26.150
 tons captured and sold to companies 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.720
 from abroad as direct coffee from 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.720
 England 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.549
 I am optimistic I know that for the future and 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.250
 here within 10 years you are one dreams 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.670
 with that reality or within ten 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.319
 years 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:55.230
 I'm going to see a beautiful spectacular forest 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.150
 robust and I will see 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.840
 maybe this is going to be an example too 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.840
 for other places 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.690
 for these programs for us better 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.990
 because we know that every program that 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.000
 comes in favor of our agriculture and 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.310
 love is not ours is the best 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.300
 for our night for our way and 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.300
 for our children
