00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.400
 I began to run in the Auris 12 rt 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:28.180
 It still's the engine first thing to become the first to I Whoa tow 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:34.040
 This directly got up and smoked the torque from the bottom 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:38.750
 In the feeling that the maximum torque that can maintain the flat registration is also supplied smoothly 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.710
 Now it is actually uphill, but from the moment it starts running 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.780
 I do not say that I kick my back 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:51.100
 I do not ride to the accelerator most foot really it as it is out jerk and powerful torque 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:56.680
 At all this a little bit Kedomo really it's such about living a little bit Kedomo is 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:01.700
 There is no feeling that the car is moving forward or climbs up the hill 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:06.740
 It is quite easy to say that it is an engine with a relatively small exhaust compared to the conventional sound natural intake 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:09.979
 It's cvt you ca n't go, that engine's rotation is really up 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.380
 There was a kind of image that made me climb up painfully 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:18.570
 Well that was normal, though 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:22.890
 Auris who got this new 10-liter turbo engine this time 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:28.200
 Because I really run in such a place 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.920
 That looks impression of that than if also I easy-to-use say whether the powerful treatment is very 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.690
 I have a strong impression of ease 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.710
 Even when I think I want to hate acceleration , I want to step into the accelerator 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:44.659
 The engine speed has risen so much 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:49.340
 Really this is not a barely suffering Geni hard acceleration and feel go 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.900
 Just put the right foot cat on the accelerator pedal and you have a good chop 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.830
 The power you want is coming 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:02.140
 Go up all the time I without increased so much even the rotation of the engine 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:06.610
 This is a big thing that is often said that the company's sound natural intake engine 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:12.370
 To say to you might be but sensory ne or a little different that like 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.890
 It feels like it's more powerful or fatter than it really is 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.700
 I will 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.330
 For example softening this 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.810
 The point is that you can not play the whole thing 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.910
 What I think I'm the room is also a well raw all the time or collection 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:34.410
 Even if also, or highway south to the hills have up an uplink of the hill 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:40.740
 Since two states where such a situation is maintained are maintained, the car itself gold something Takahashi is good quality 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.550
 I do not even say Zidane I feel that I have become about two levels of fine quality 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.930
 like this 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:51.909
 It 's a freakishly weird thing this car cvt manual 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.569
 There is also a mode of steering and there is also a shift paddle in steering, but this is also what 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.989
 Follow 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:02.019
 Really when you say when and serves as likely to get off the way of principle 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.409
 I even without such a thing I Well, something is in the acceleration or rather climb Kedomo you that helpful 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.010
 Yato 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:13.470
 Anyway, leave it in that d range 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:18.920
 If you leave it to clever clever and leave it to this thick effort and climb, it is most efficient 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:22.790
 It is a kind of feeling and Ikeru to comfortably accelerate or rather early 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.330
 The engine powertrain is also quite an impression summary squirrel 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.150
 a 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.630
 The chassis is not bad either 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.010
 To obtain the engine 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:35.260
 It feels like a good photo has really come to live like this 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.680
 That, for example, this 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:43.800
 Behind the steering can be dressed properly 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:49.950
 The response is good and the suspension works well 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:53.010
 No matter how much the money is pretty rough, it looks like a person who usually works properly 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:58.980
 Also I'd feel 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:02.579
 In fact , I feel that there is a secret potential hidden in the middle and bottom. 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.470
 Actually this car and rear suspension are also hey 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:09.450
 w of the book 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:13.510
 Possibility of using poison's feet, etc. The potential is high. 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:18.729
 It seems that this is quite straightforward 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.720
 I have not done any processing, but I'm not doing anything extra 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.560
 Is that right? 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.120
 So the run is 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.139
 It's not really about sharp cornering performance or something like that. 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.910
 Even though I 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.870
 Anyway moving obediently with high sense of security 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:38.540
 Say Well softening this 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:41.150
 What a small car or something in the sound of a compact hatchback ? A car like a textbook? 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:48.460
 Hey , let's really go in a good sense 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:48.460
 I think that you can realize a very well-balanced high performance
