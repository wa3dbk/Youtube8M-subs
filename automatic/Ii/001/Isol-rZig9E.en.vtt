00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.710 
just how I prefer to keep my kale around
you<00:02:46.590> know<00:02:46.680> it's<00:02:46.799> all<00:02:46.920> over<00:02:47.040> my<00:02:47.190> fingers<00:02:47.720> but

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
you know it's all over my fingers but

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.449 
you know it's all over my fingers but
I'm<00:02:48.870> gonna<00:02:49.019> add<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.380> protein<00:02:49.890> powder<00:02:50.130> into

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
I'm gonna add the protein powder into

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.590 
I'm gonna add the protein powder into
the<00:02:50.640> smoothie<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.330> what<00:02:51.480> actually

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
the smoothie and this is what actually

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.020 
the smoothie and this is what actually
makes<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.290> meal<00:02:52.530> replacement<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
makes it the meal replacement it's the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.699 
makes it the meal replacement it's the
amount<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.420> protein<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.530> is

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
amount of protein in this and this is

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.100 
amount of protein in this and this is
organic<00:02:56.190> it's<00:02:56.610> non-gmo<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.569> good<00:02:57.870> for

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
organic it's non-gmo this is good for

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.140 
organic it's non-gmo this is good for
you<00:02:58.319> it's<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.560> great<00:02:58.739> source<00:02:59.069> of<00:02:59.250> energy<00:02:59.880> for

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
you it's a great source of energy for

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.520 
you it's a great source of energy for
the<00:03:00.480> day<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:00.690> especially<00:03:01.080> if<00:03:01.260> you're<00:03:01.380> someone

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
the day so especially if you're someone

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.620 
the day so especially if you're someone
who<00:03:01.830> doesn't<00:03:02.099> eat<00:03:02.489> breakfast<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.299> morning

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
who doesn't eat breakfast in the morning

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.420 
who doesn't eat breakfast in the morning
this<00:03:04.080> could<00:03:04.380> be<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.560> great<00:03:04.769> alternative<00:03:05.400> for

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
this could be a great alternative for

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.920 
this could be a great alternative for
you<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.820> make<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.150> do<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.329> because<00:03:06.630> it's<00:03:06.810> super

you to make you do it because it's super

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.810 
you to make you do it because it's super
easy<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.380> can<00:03:07.560> even<00:03:07.680> drink<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.220> while

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
easy you can even drink this while

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.610 
easy you can even drink this while
you're<00:03:08.970> driving<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.660> work<00:03:09.930> or<00:03:10.170> running<00:03:10.530> out

the door but then you're still getting

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.580 
the door but then you're still getting
the<00:03:11.850> protein<00:03:12.120> necessary<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.930> get<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.320> moving

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
the protein necessary to get you moving

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.130 
the protein necessary to get you moving
for<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:13.890> day<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.700> I'm<00:03:14.880> just<00:03:15.090> pouring<00:03:15.359> this<00:03:15.630> on

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
for the day so I'm just pouring this on

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.650
