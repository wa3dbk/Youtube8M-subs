see<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.260> famas<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.310> first<00:01:14.520> one

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
see like the famas so the first one

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.010 
see like the famas so the first one
wasn't<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.240> famas<00:01:15.479> i<00:01:15.630> believe<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
wasn't with the famas i believe the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.560 
wasn't with the famas i believe the
second<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.439> was<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.619> UMP<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:18.119> think<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
second one was a UMP and I think the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.770 
second one was a UMP and I think the
third<00:01:18.869> might<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.380> been<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:21.150> UMP<00:01:21.540> i'm<00:01:21.659> not

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
third might have been a the UMP i'm not

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.070 
third might have been a the UMP i'm not
quite<00:01:21.960> sure<00:01:22.670> fourth<00:01:23.670> was<00:01:24.119> i<00:01:24.479> believe<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> scar

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
quite sure fourth was i believe the scar

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.870 
quite sure fourth was i believe the scar
and<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.530> zatar<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.700> I'm<00:01:26.790> gonna

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
this this class setup so it was easier

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
in modern warfare 3 um it's a great gun

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.690 
in modern warfare 3 um it's a great gun
the<00:03:05.810> accuracy<00:03:06.380> for<00:03:06.560> me<00:03:06.650> isn't<00:03:06.830> like<00:03:07.580> I

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
the accuracy for me isn't like I

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.400 
the accuracy for me isn't like I
recapped<00:03:08.060> all<00:03:08.239> I'm<00:03:08.450> kind<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:08.780> recapping<00:03:09.140> this

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
recapped all I'm kind of recapping this

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.290 
recapped all I'm kind of recapping this
because<00:03:09.800> I've<00:03:09.920> already<00:03:10.070> kind<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.790> discuss<00:03:11.150> all

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
because I've already kind of discuss all

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.090 
because I've already kind of discuss all
this<00:03:11.360> it's<00:03:11.780> not<00:03:11.840> as<00:03:12.080> accurate<00:03:12.320> of<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.680> gun<00:03:12.830> as<00:03:13.070> i

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
this it's not as accurate of a gun as i

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.600 
this it's not as accurate of a gun as i
would<00:03:13.850> like<00:03:14.480> but<00:03:14.750> i<00:03:15.140> like<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.010> scars<00:03:16.280> really

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
would like but i like the scars really

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.699 
would like but i like the scars really
accurate<00:03:17.000> comparison<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:17.600> my<00:03:17.750> opinion<00:03:18.049> but

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
accurate comparison in my opinion but

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.380 
accurate comparison in my opinion but
it's<00:03:18.980> just<00:03:19.160> a<00:03:19.250> powerful<00:03:19.700> gun<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.060> don't<00:03:20.209> need

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
it's just a powerful gun you don't need

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.940 
it's just a powerful gun you don't need
stopping<00:03:21.019> power<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.320> you<00:03:21.380> can<00:03:21.500> still<00:03:21.680> do<00:03:21.769> work

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
stopping power and you can still do work

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.070 
stopping power and you can still do work
with<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.190> with<00:03:22.370> stopping<00:03:22.640> parts<00:03:23.120> it's<00:03:23.810> pretty

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
with it with stopping parts it's pretty

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.560 
with it with stopping parts it's pretty
impressive<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:25.220> don't<00:03:25.640> know<00:03:25.820> again<00:03:26.120> if<00:03:26.299> I<00:03:26.420> have

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
impressive I don't know again if I have

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.050 
impressive I don't know again if I have
a<00:03:26.600> four<00:03:26.959> bar<00:03:27.110> right<00:03:28.100> now<00:03:28.280> or<00:03:28.400> not<00:03:28.549> but<00:03:28.790> when<00:03:28.940> you

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
a four bar right now or not but when you

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.880 
a four bar right now or not but when you
use<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.360> ac-130<00:03:29.900> sometimes<00:03:30.350> it<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.620> pain

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
use the ac-130 sometimes it is a pain

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.940 
use the ac-130 sometimes it is a pain
and<00:03:31.100> right<00:03:31.489> there<00:03:31.700> I<00:03:31.730> thought<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.239> um<00:03:32.540> I

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
and right there I thought that um I

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
and right there I thought that um I
thought<00:03:33.950> that<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.160> would<00:03:34.400> have<00:03:34.489> had<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.820> but<00:03:34.940> I

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
thought that I would have had it but I

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.120 
thought that I would have had it but I
didn't<00:03:35.239> get<00:03:35.299> enough<00:03:35.570> together<00:03:36.080> kill<00:03:36.380> oh<00:03:36.590> yeah

guys are gonna like this ending because
I<00:03:43.220> end<00:03:43.489> up<00:03:43.549> just<00:03:43.760> barely<00:03:44.120> getting<00:03:44.420> this<00:03:44.540> nuke

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
I end up just barely getting this nuke

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.979 
I end up just barely getting this nuke
and<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:45.980> was<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.549> think<00:03:46.910> Alaska<00:03:47.239> wasn't<00:03:47.510> on<00:03:47.630> me

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
and it was I think Alaska wasn't on me

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.050 
and it was I think Alaska wasn't on me
and<00:03:48.110> I<00:03:48.140> turret<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:49.280> was<00:03:49.400> super<00:03:49.760> super

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
and I turret and it was super super

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.449 
and I turret and it was super super
clutch<00:03:50.420> as<00:03:51.110> soon<00:03:51.350> as<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:51.560> got<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.830> nuclei<00:03:52.190> just

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
clutch as soon as I got the nuclei just

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.330 
clutch as soon as I got the nuclei just
instantly<00:03:52.790> died<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.360> I<00:03:54.260> was<00:03:54.739> happy<00:03:54.890> because<00:03:55.190> I

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
instantly died so I was happy because I

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.800 
instantly died so I was happy because I
didn't<00:03:55.519> know<00:03:55.580> how<00:03:55.640> many<00:03:56.150> kills<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:56.540> had<00:03:56.630> left

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
which is another thing hopefully they'll

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.910 
which is another thing hopefully they'll
work<00:03:59.570> on<00:03:59.750> that<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.019> i'm<00:04:00.110> not<00:04:00.200> sure<00:04:00.260> black<00:04:00.680> ops

myself but look at this score i was like

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.890 
myself but look at this score i was like
182<00:04:46.700> and<00:04:46.910> I<00:04:46.940> didn't<00:04:47.180> know<00:04:47.240> how<00:04:47.270> many<00:04:47.510> kills<00:04:47.690> I

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
182 and I didn't know how many kills I

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.390 
182 and I didn't know how many kills I
thought<00:04:48.320> I<00:04:48.350> needed<00:04:48.560> at<00:04:48.740> least<00:04:48.890> like<00:04:49.100> three<00:04:49.340> or

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
thought I needed at least like three or

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.310 
thought I needed at least like three or
four<00:04:49.460> kills<00:04:49.760> so<00:04:50.480> i<00:04:50.510> did<00:04:50.750> not<00:04:50.870> know<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.260> i'm

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
four kills so i did not know and i'm

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.020 
four kills so i did not know and i'm
using<00:04:51.590> my<00:04:51.620> wrath<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:52.010> his<00:04:52.130> secondary<00:04:52.520> here<00:04:52.760> so

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.870 
using my wrath of his secondary here so
great<00:04:53.720> choice<00:04:54.410> for<00:04:54.440> myself<00:04:54.950> as<00:04:55.130> a<00:04:55.370> secondary

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
great choice for myself as a secondary

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.390 
great choice for myself as a secondary
because<00:04:56.180> it<00:04:56.300> shoots<00:04:57.080> three<00:04:57.560> round<00:04:57.770> burst<00:04:57.980> and
