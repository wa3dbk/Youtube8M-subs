quick health and safety information i

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.149 
quick health and safety information i
was<00:01:44.810> wearing<00:01:44.990> latex<00:01:45.409> gloves<00:01:45.590> when<00:01:45.980> I<00:01:46.010> was

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
was wearing latex gloves when I was

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.100 
was wearing latex gloves when I was
handling<00:01:46.490> these<00:01:46.880> jelly<00:01:47.180> beans<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.690> count<00:01:47.900> them
