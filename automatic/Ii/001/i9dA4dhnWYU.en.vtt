00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.270
 Thank you 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.270
 so that girls like this 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.119
 this time I bring you my collection 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.840
 of lipsticks smell only me 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.820
 I have 2 467 lipsticks I do not have many 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.770
 but I wanted to show them because I already 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.789
 had talked about this new challenge that 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.010
 I have in mind to show you my 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.660
 mini collection is this casual that in 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.570
 this brand of smell guayo because they are 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.570
 the ones that I use the least even though 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.460
 As you know, they are very famous 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.199
 They have a nice range of colors without 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.239
 However, I do not like the 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.700
 texture since it is made as its common 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.309
 the product in the lines of my lips 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.730
 that's why I do not give them much use but 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:56.329
 well this was one of the challenges of 2014 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.940
 to use it saved so let's 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.040
 start is project less something than 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.079
 I've had a long time 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.390
 watch 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.080
 even though I do not already have like from 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.299
 a year and a half ago it is still quite 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.890
 product then that's where you see that 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:19.399
 If the use that I give this is little, it is the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.159
 color 99 is a pale pink so I was 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:26.479
 I would see this color I will zoom though 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.939
 be wisin in advance I warn you not 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.000
 they are very well disposed my lips are 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:35.619
 a little broken by the cold and that but 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.619
 I hope that the color is appreciated 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.030
 The next one that I'm going to show you is 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.119
 this is the 9 67 2 house field and I 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.950
 love is a pink as well as very chewing gum 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.950
 father very turned on 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.400
 and well, this is the color 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.380
 as you can see it highlights very very well and 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.710
 Well it's one of my favorite excuses 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.050
 I painted my nails last night but as 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.580
 that the enamel did not do me any good 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.810
 it's one of water I have 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.810
 color came as you can see but I already know 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.920
 they send ruined very fast and well if 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.990
 is this is between lilac and pink chewing gum 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.640
 very very countries with another one also in the 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:33.790
 range of the rositas is the 968 pink tree 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.220
 and it's also classic and set from the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.560
 color as you can see if it looks pink but 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.770
 for my point of view it has a touch 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.360
 as well as half coral and I am 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.250
 Brunette then I love in these 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.480
 colors because I feel that it stands out a lot 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.120
 our skin color 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.790
 then it is one of my favorites but 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.350
 I also tell them that this does not bother me 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.700
 that like the color separates 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.620
 as patches as well as painted you do not see 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.110
 parejito then 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.030
 I always combined them with others like that 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.730
 slightly more creamy from another brand like 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.790
 revlon so that they worked for me 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.750
 next is 966 dong jin pyng and 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.040
 he is also super father 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.930
 it's a little bit more fucking fuchsia 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.930
 well I said it well russia 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.610
 and well this looks like this I love many 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.100
 Sometimes they say that lipstick tones 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.720
 in pink tones like that make it look 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.970
 new yellow teeth but in my 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.730
 case does not happen like this I even feel that it 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.420
 they see whites the next one is 905 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.159
 of smoking happy and this is to say as a 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.159
 pink a little more off 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.159
 i 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.470
 the next one is an orange tree this 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:04.980
 it came as well as defective because it was 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.170
 it came out like that I do not know I do not know what 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.879
 it happened but I bought it because it was the only 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:15.319
 that was and this is the 969 that red call 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.150
 it's a very father orange 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.910
 I also have to have a lot 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.340
 beware of this why 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.210
 as I say this, yes, it did come 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.210
 broken 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.260
 and this looks like this is also a very color 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.260
 cute to use it like in the 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
 spring Summer 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:40.299
 and last but not least 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:44.439
 I'm going to show you what I also 

00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:45.939
 I just bought this is between love and 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:48.279
 I hate because as well as that is very 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:50.709
 intense is like a style 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:55.089
 vampirescos I say it's like a 

00:04:50.709 --> 00:05:01.439
 dark purple or grape color is the 

00:04:55.089 --> 00:05:01.439
 sugar plan ferry and this one the number 908 c 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.350
 and it's the only color that I do not 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.750
 I feel comfortable because as I say it is 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.860
 as well as a very good pisco tone and I feel 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.620
 that does not favor much because the color 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.180
 of my skin and my face you what 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.180
 how many favorite
