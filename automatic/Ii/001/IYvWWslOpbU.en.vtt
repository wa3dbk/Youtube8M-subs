00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:08.760
 the manager technology salve da mou by 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.240
 the framers welcome to this new one 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:19.199
 video comparison between htc and nokia 3310 e 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.430
 very resistant famous are nokia in 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.830
 this video comparison we will go to 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.460
 evaluate which of the two top of the range is 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:31.380
 really better then the price is 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:35.130
 very very much like htc juan s 299 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.790
 euro while after that he rests 110 10 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.379
 cents for 12 months we can ax there 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.230
 they give dimensions then we have 76 mm 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.020
 thick for htc juan s per 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.960
 be like iPhone 5 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.260
 and we say that for nokia they were inspired 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.870
 in fact, these curves make a brick 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.629
 you can see of brick recessing 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.470
 in Victorian homes really together 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.020
 to a very resistant brick of course 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.450
 but also htc one I go out of its design and 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.549
 aluminum body is very beautiful and 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.210
 resistant really well to keep ho 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:20.790
 could 4.3 inch amoled display 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.060
 the display is not fantastic let's face it 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.930
 with the display of the nokia madotto 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.000
 we start immediately with basic color that 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.390
 stay there 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.970
 then we immediately see something that htc 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.100
 watch is incredibly brighter not 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.440
 we expected it absolutely dh 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:48.310
 definition we expected was superior 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:56.119
 in one sms to around 250 pp while nokia 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:02:01.880
 leave the 950 x 540 resolution alone 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:03.950
 about three soft touch keys and camera 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.940
 from 8 megapixels and when you center i 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.709
 touch keys but quiet and nothing 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:16.010
 camera we go to view now 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:21.670
 the system the settings menu 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.670
 which should be very rich 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.200
 the work ended 110 in fact well 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.750
 four stations from which setting 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.740
 calling in my past 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.480
 initials and others are not needed 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:42.900
 ok let's go ahead let's move on to manes 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:48.150
 fluidissimo one is a surprise because it is 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.990
 a dual core 1.5gb instead nokia is of 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.200
 siena something like zero point one 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.180
 peak gigahertz no that they have said it 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.180
 because he was probably ashamed 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:10.459
 humility htc mounts android jelly bean 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.410
 4.1.1 with sense 4 class 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.570
 we see the keyboard of false proposals but 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.440
 then here we have a classic keyboard 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:23.670
 qwerty while we have a keyboard here 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:26.790
 in short shit 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.739
 look at how this survey he calls 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.049
 a minimalism of the strong law 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.269
 dimension 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:41.690
 look at this channeling 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:45.810
 the speaker or behind a microphone 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:51.800
 anti vocio thing that was not absurd 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:54.599
 therefore increased point enough omnes 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.599
 features audio beats 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:01.380
 and this can be seen in the music that 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:06.830
 indeed it is nice to listen instead to a 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:10.410
 perimeter 110 we go into the settings 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.860
 very customizable htc juan s 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.360
 we have skins we can 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.239
 to choose 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.690
 for example we have matt aluminum 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.729
 in short, many coastal steel 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.000
 customizations then anyway being 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:31.919
 android can be implemented by 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.320
 systems like pards or apex or apex that 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.660
 they are a kind of launcher 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:44.280
 here they are ready to blacks this launcher 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:46.320
 simply them normal normal android 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.110
 customize the beautiful the nokia 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.900
 meets some restriction of the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.539
 system t is not very open though 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.710
 however we call it wind but nokia has 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.539
 especially focused on the part 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.479
 phone and in fact this phone can 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:03.270
 just call in practically yes 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.810
 really good reception what htc 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.620
 man s 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:11.280
 there isn't actually we don't know if 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.800
 our katy our food is 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.729
 faulty or not but we met 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.830
 reception defects or that 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:24.720
 come out of places with little reception 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.400
 leaked mark nokia has introduced a 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.780
 Announcements 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:35.430
 incredible neghi en smartphone ie the 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:38.639
 resistant zzÃ  look how it always goes 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.930
 really really crazy how and 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.729
 resistant 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.729
 in short, no other 110 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.900
 according to us common stent exactly 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.270
 higher than htc wanted where not 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.800
 Also do my testing 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.840
 conclusions well htc definitely wanted 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.100
 a step forward with my times but 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:05.730
 nokia list behind with short there 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:08.070
 they are neither winners nor losers next time 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:11.960
 video transfer from mobile tech 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.960
