00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.790 

the<00:00:27.449> reality<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.199> spiritually

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the reality of the spiritually

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.569 
the reality of the spiritually
disconnected<00:00:30.439> this<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> reality<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
disconnected this is the reality that

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.560 
disconnected this is the reality that
seems<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.180> prevalent<00:00:33.420> because<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.920> like

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
seems to be prevalent because it's like

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.880 
seems to be prevalent because it's like
you<00:00:36.570> look<00:00:36.690> at<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> leadership<00:00:37.440> or<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.770> look

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you look at the leadership or you look

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.590 
you look at the leadership or you look
at<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> institutions<00:00:38.940> or<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.090> things<00:00:39.390> that

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
at the institutions or the things that

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.130 
at the institutions or the things that
that<00:00:39.809> are<00:00:40.230> held<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:41.149> in<00:00:42.149> these<00:00:42.480> esteems<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:45.140> as

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
that are held up in these esteems and as

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.569 
that are held up in these esteems and as
none<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.469> these<00:00:46.590> things<00:00:46.829> seem<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.309> any

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
none of these things seem to have any

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.410 
none of these things seem to have any
spiritual<00:00:48.059> relationship<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.870> life<00:00:50.329> you<00:00:51.329> know

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
spiritual relationship to life you know

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.260 
spiritual relationship to life you know
so<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:55.309> no<00:00:56.309> spiritual<00:00:56.730> relationship

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
so it's like no spiritual relationship

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.729 
so it's like no spiritual relationship
to<00:00:57.390> life<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.690> almost<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.050> no<00:00:58.199> spiritual

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
to life it's almost like no spiritual

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
to life it's almost like no spiritual
recognition<00:00:59.460> we're<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.300> where<00:01:00.600> anytime<00:01:00.809> in

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
recognition we're in where anytime in

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.650 
recognition we're in where anytime in
reality<00:01:01.739> where<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.670> human<00:01:02.940> beings<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.390> now

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
reality where the human beings are now

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.330 
reality where the human beings are now

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
on that the human beings in the at least

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.630 
on that the human beings in the at least
in<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.700> technologic<00:01:09.420> world<00:01:11.750> no<00:01:12.750> longer

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
in the technologic world no longer

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.580 
in the technologic world no longer
remember<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.909> original<00:01:15.780> dream<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.470> no

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
remember the original dream they no

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.530

teachings or the knowledge they no

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.039 
teachings or the knowledge they no
longer<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:21.240> these<00:01:21.479> things<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.960> their

ancestry<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.009> their<00:01:23.729> ancestry<00:01:25.820> so<00:01:26.820> it's

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
ancestry of their ancestry so it's

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.370 
ancestry of their ancestry so it's
almost<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.509> they're<00:01:27.869> spiritually

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
almost like they're spiritually

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.920 
almost like they're spiritually
disconnected<00:01:29.540> from<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.720> past<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:32.840> when<00:01:33.840> you

action to deal with these this this

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.270 
action to deal with these this this
disease<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.300> aggression<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.830> taking

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
disease of aggression that is taking

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.980 
disease of aggression that is taking
place<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:13.470> almost

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
place so it's almost

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.400 
place so it's almost
like<00:02:14.110> because<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.370> it's<00:02:15.940> oh<00:02:16.240> it's<00:02:16.630> almost

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
like because of that it's oh it's almost

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.560 
like because of that it's oh it's almost
like<00:02:17.590> they<00:02:18.010> have<00:02:18.220> no<00:02:18.400> spiritual<00:02:18.940> relationship

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
like they have no spiritual relationship

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.760 
like they have no spiritual relationship
to<00:02:19.750> their<00:02:19.900> own<00:02:20.020> descendants<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.560> like

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
to their own descendants so it's like

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.280 
to their own descendants so it's like
you<00:02:23.980> know<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.520> no<00:02:25.000> spiritual<00:02:25.480> relationship<00:02:26.110> to

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
you know so no spiritual relationship to

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.130 
you know so no spiritual relationship to
the<00:02:26.380> past<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.980> ancestry<00:02:28.020> no<00:02:29.020> spiritual

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
the past the ancestry no spiritual
