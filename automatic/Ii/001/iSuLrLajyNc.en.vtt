00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:10.350
 hello very good to my channel I'm 0.98 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.550
 and well let's start 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:18.730
 my good video 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:21.160
 and today I plan to make a one then 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.850
 brick house and since I bimbo the idea 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.510
 It's pretty bad 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.260
 right now of harem 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.800
 at sea 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:36.920
 well to do a little how they are done 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.420
 the bricks that I got right we're going to 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.199
 look for a little bit like that 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.199
 let's see the difference 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.370
 the sand is sand but inside there is 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:57.199
 clay and with the shovel is going to take it out 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:01.210
 then with that wall and then he got 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.210
 at the point 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.730
 monkey titi conservation 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.410
 I recommend you 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.350
 that you fuck enough not to be all 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.250
 the time I already made it clear I have 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.930
 most 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.930
 all this is a bit of describing 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.040
 It's a little bit of description 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:35.110
 let's get to the end of that blue 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.340
 that blue now we put it inside no os 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.870
 I also recommend that you chop these 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.810
 ovens to end with and thomas lÃ¼thi 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.360
 there if you want 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.360
 It does not have to, but it does 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.360
 do not 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:02:00.010
 this is my wall 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.010
 and here the bricks are being created 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.319
 so I'll try 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.610
 you have to try to catch as much as possible 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.250
 and for your life it consists of 464 to the best 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.650
 not enough 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.629
 and well now it's 22 and such 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:31.890
 let's see what we can do with 22 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.150
 and good now I will help using go 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.760
 putting up 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:44.360
 of brick when this is coming out 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:47.210
 from the oven to look at what is this blue and 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.360
 that state and in the coal here and the 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:54.190
 brick 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.190
 because it 's the brick where you want 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:06.580
 and you can like another 4 like that and 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:10.960
 a single block of brick will come out 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.750
 You do not do this like this with everyone as I go 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:20.310
 to go doing now and well I'll go 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.310
 leaving already prepared to do it 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.660
 with this opens the short exam now 16 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.450
 let's see what comes out here 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.450
 it will not be left over 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.760
 we already have here also I do not think that 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.090
 give us 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.370
 for a lot of truth but we are not going to 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.370
 keep finding us let's go more 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:00.099
 with this with so little a coal I do not think 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.099
 that we have a contract 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:11.639
 amounts of those crazy explained and you have to 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:13.769
 catch the blue things and send the in 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:21.410
 the oven the best has two parties and 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:23.930
 a little pathos this is not going to come out 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.550
 with the 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.070
 4 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.550
 things in manufacturing 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:37.000
 and a mini will come out 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.000
 putting the more better 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.460
 and this description of how to make a 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.800
 brick house that is pretty much the 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.070
 description then in the second part already 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.340
 my house and we'll see how many thanks 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.340
 I am
