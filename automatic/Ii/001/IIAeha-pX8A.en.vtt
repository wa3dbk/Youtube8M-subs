accommodate you with a quick look at the
changes<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.570> building<00:00:03.870> and<00:00:03.990> rust

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
changes to the building and rust

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.019 
changes to the building and rust
specifically<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.279> terms<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.580> how<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.759> walls

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
specifically in terms of how the walls

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.940 
specifically in terms of how the walls
take<00:00:06.330> damage<00:00:06.600> so<00:00:07.200> which<00:00:07.379> shot<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.770> wall

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
take damage so which shot of the wall

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.890 
take damage so which shot of the wall
you're<00:00:08.099> hitting<00:00:08.160> so<00:00:08.970> if<00:00:09.120> it's<00:00:09.240> an<00:00:09.360> interior

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
you're hitting so if it's an interior

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.990 
you're hitting so if it's an interior
part<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> wall<00:00:10.620> it's<00:00:11.130> going<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.519> do<00:00:11.670> more

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
part of the wall it's going to do more

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.120 
part of the wall it's going to do more
damage<00:00:12.240> versus<00:00:13.049> if<00:00:13.200> it's<00:00:13.410> an<00:00:13.500> exterior<00:00:13.830> part

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
damage versus if it's an exterior part

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.499 
damage versus if it's an exterior part
let's<00:00:14.309> go<00:00:14.400> ahead<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.580> test<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:15.000> out<00:00:15.059> just<00:00:15.360> on

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
let's go ahead and test it out just on

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.019 
let's go ahead and test it out just on
the<00:00:15.630> twig<00:00:15.960> material<00:00:16.770> here<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.160> guys<00:00:17.279> already

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the twig material here you guys already

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.370 
the twig material here you guys already
know<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> twit<00:00:18.840> goes<00:00:18.869> down<00:00:19.080> pretty

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
know that the twit goes down pretty

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.349 
know that the twit goes down pretty
quick<00:00:19.710> but<00:00:20.220> notice<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.640> taking<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.090> lot<00:00:21.300> more

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
quick but notice is taking a lot more

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.210 
quick but notice is taking a lot more
hits<00:00:21.840> when<00:00:22.380> we're<00:00:22.529> hitting<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.800> exterior

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
hits when we're hitting that exterior

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.519 
hits when we're hitting that exterior
wall<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.699> hatchet<00:00:24.119> if<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:25.019> go<00:00:25.140> ahead<00:00:25.380> and

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
wall of the hatchet if we go ahead and

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.109 
wall of the hatchet if we go ahead and
hit<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.740> from<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.010> inside<00:00:26.310> where<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
hit it from the inside where the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.210 
hit it from the inside where the
interior<00:00:27.510> would<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.019> gone<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.920> hit

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
interior would be it's gone in one hit

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.580 
interior would be it's gone in one hit
this<00:00:29.880> holds<00:00:30.300> true<00:00:30.449> for<00:00:30.660> all<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> different

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
this holds true for all of the different

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.200 
this holds true for all of the different
types<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> walls<00:00:32.279> here<00:00:32.579> let's<00:00:32.940> go<00:00:33.120> ahead

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
types of the walls here let's go ahead

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.970 
types of the walls here let's go ahead
and<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> quick<00:00:33.750> test<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> wood<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:34.739> well

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
and do a quick test on the wood as well

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.889 
and do a quick test on the wood as well
and<00:00:35.250> you'll<00:00:35.820> notice<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.540> interior

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and you'll notice this is the interior

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.840 
and you'll notice this is the interior
part<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> wall<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.610> start

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
part of the wall here if we start

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.580 
part of the wall here if we start
hitting<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> hatchet<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.200> going

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
hitting it with the hatchet it's going

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.740 
hitting it with the hatchet it's going
down<00:00:40.739> rather<00:00:41.010> quickly<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:42.000> if<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.120> move<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
down rather quickly but if we move to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.690 
down rather quickly but if we move to
the<00:00:42.780> outer<00:00:43.050> part<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> wall<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.980> start

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
the outer part of the wall and start

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.580 
the outer part of the wall and start
hitting<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> hatchet<00:00:45.390> will<00:00:46.110> notice<00:00:46.440> it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
hitting it with a hatchet will notice it

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.569 
hitting it with a hatchet will notice it
it's<00:00:46.739> not<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.250> down<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:47.850> quickly<00:00:49.039> so<00:00:50.039> this

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
it's not going down as quickly so this

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.860 
it's not going down as quickly so this
is<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> big<00:00:50.879> change<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.420> rating<00:00:51.719> guys

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
is a big change for rating guys

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.270 
is a big change for rating guys
especially<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.590> your<00:00:52.680> rating<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.070> tools

same on stone as well this is an
interior<00:00:58.199> wall<00:00:58.410> even<00:00:58.770> though<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.100> facing

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
interior wall even though it's facing

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.720 
interior wall even though it's facing
out<00:01:00.920> but<00:01:01.920> you'll<00:01:02.070> notice<00:01:02.219> we're<00:01:02.520> chipping

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
out but you'll notice we're chipping

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.179 
out but you'll notice we're chipping
away<00:01:03.030> nicely<00:01:03.300> at<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> pickaxe<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.769> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
away nicely at it with the pickaxe and a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.130 
away nicely at it with the pickaxe and a
very<00:01:05.369> good<00:01:05.580> rate<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:06.210> go<00:01:06.420> over<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
very good rate if we go over to the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.890 
very good rate if we go over to the
outer<00:01:07.740> part<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.220> wall<00:01:08.659> you'll<00:01:09.659> notice

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
outer part of the wall you'll notice

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.590 
outer part of the wall you'll notice
it's<00:01:10.110> taking<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.560> much<00:01:10.830> longer<00:01:11.220> time<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:12.450> it's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
it's taking a much longer time for it's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.480 
it's taking a much longer time for it's
even<00:01:12.869> go<00:01:12.990> down<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.619> point<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.070> know<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.340> hard

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
even go down one point I know it's hard

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
even go down one point I know it's hard
to<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> hasn't<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.229> dropped<00:01:16.500> one

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
to see but it hasn't it just dropped one

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.380 
to see but it hasn't it just dropped one
point<00:01:16.979> after<00:01:17.130> several<00:01:17.700> hits<00:01:17.909> whereas<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.360> the

point after several hits whereas on the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
point after several hits whereas on the
other<00:01:18.479> side<00:01:18.840> i<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:19.049> taking<00:01:19.409> more<00:01:19.650> consistent

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
other side i was taking more consistent

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.310 
other side i was taking more consistent
damage<00:01:20.610> when<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.540> make<00:01:21.720> our<00:01:21.840> way<00:01:21.869> over<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.170> an

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
armored tier guys it's going to be

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.140 
armored tier guys it's going to be
pretty<00:01:25.110> much<00:01:25.409> impenetrable<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.460> weapons<00:01:26.939> at

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
pretty much impenetrable with weapons at

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.520 
pretty much impenetrable with weapons at
this<00:01:27.509> point<00:01:27.720> you're<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.049> want<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> use

done some overhauls to the graphics and
you<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.079> tell<00:01:46.259> you're<00:01:46.770> easily<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.340> what's

inside versus was outside moving over to
what<00:01:50.670> would<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> interior<00:01:51.630> side<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
what would be the interior side of the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.069 
what would be the interior side of the
wall<00:01:52.280> notice<00:01:53.280> guys<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.729> hit<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.000> once<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.540> it

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
wall notice guys we hit it once and it

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.130 
wall notice guys we hit it once and it
starts<00:01:55.439> dropping<00:01:55.740> points<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.750> it's<00:01:57.750> much

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
starts dropping points and it's much

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.020 
starts dropping points and it's much
more<00:01:58.560> prone<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.920> taking<00:01:59.159> damage<00:01:59.549> when<00:01:59.880> you're

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
more prone to taking damage when you're

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.819 
more prone to taking damage when you're
on<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.149> inside<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.049> means<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.530> if

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
on the inside so what this means is if

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.530 
on the inside so what this means is if
you're<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> inside<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.670> base<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.420> know

there<00:03:01.560> guys<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.100> certainly<00:03:02.340> something

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
there guys and it's certainly something

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.580 
there guys and it's certainly something
you<00:03:02.760> want<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.000> be<00:03:03.120> aware<00:03:03.600> of<00:03:03.660> both<00:03:04.080> for<00:03:04.350> rating

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
you want to be aware of both for rating

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.340 
you want to be aware of both for rating
purposes<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.280> defending<00:03:05.820> purposes<00:03:06.350> but

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
purposes and for defending purposes but

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.660 
purposes and for defending purposes but
it's<00:03:07.500> not<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:07.860> melee<00:03:08.130> weapons<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:08.610> have

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
it's not just melee weapons that have

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.880 
it's not just melee weapons that have
changed<00:03:09.180> c4<00:03:09.840> damage<00:03:10.230> has<00:03:10.410> changed<00:03:10.770> as<00:03:10.860> well

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
changed c4 damage has changed as well

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.340 
changed c4 damage has changed as well
and<00:03:11.310> ce4<00:03:11.730> damage<00:03:12.030> now<00:03:12.180> does<00:03:12.390> one<00:03:12.690> half<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.170> what

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
and ce4 damage now does one half of what

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.590 
and ce4 damage now does one half of what
it<00:03:13.470> used<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.370> walls<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.209> let's<00:03:15.450> go<00:03:15.570> ahead

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
it used to to walls so let's go ahead

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.690 
it used to to walls so let's go ahead
and<00:03:15.780> test<00:03:15.990> it<00:03:16.140> out<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.260> an<00:03:16.560> exterior<00:03:16.950> wall<00:03:17.160> for

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
and test it out on an exterior wall for

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.860 
and test it out on an exterior wall for
the<00:03:17.730> armor<00:03:18.120> tier<00:03:18.360> which<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.720> highest

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the armor tier which is the highest

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.150 
the armor tier which is the highest
building<00:03:19.350> fear<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.680> have<00:03:19.800> on<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.010> game

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
building fear that we have on the game

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.800 
building fear that we have on the game
at<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.370> point<00:03:20.459> in<00:03:20.730> time<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.510> guys<00:03:21.600> will

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
at this point in time you guys will

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.420 
at this point in time you guys will
notice<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.410> previous<00:03:22.620> iterations<00:03:23.340> of

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
notice that in previous iterations of

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.370 
notice that in previous iterations of
rust<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.820> took<00:03:23.970> three<00:03:24.269> charges<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.810> c-4<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.260> get

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
rust it took three charges of c-4 to get

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.080 
rust it took three charges of c-4 to get
through<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.620> wall<00:03:25.800> let's<00:03:26.459> go<00:03:26.610> ahead<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:26.790> place

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
through a wall let's go ahead and place

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.330 
through a wall let's go ahead and place
them<00:03:27.300> down<00:03:27.450> here<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:27.989> see<00:03:28.739> exactly<00:03:28.830> how<00:03:29.280> many

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
them down here and see exactly how many

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.030 
them down here and see exactly how many
it's<00:03:29.580> going<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.850> take<00:03:30.680> so<00:03:31.680> we've<00:03:31.800> gone<00:03:31.920> ahead

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
it's going to take so we've gone ahead

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.250 
it's going to take so we've gone ahead
we've<00:03:32.280> placed<00:03:32.519> one<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.090> we'll<00:03:33.930> go<00:03:34.050> ahead<00:03:34.170> and

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
we've placed one and we'll go ahead and

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.800 
we've placed one and we'll go ahead and
take<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.470> look<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.950> brought<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.280> down<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.810> 790

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
take a look it brought it down to 790

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.630 
take a look it brought it down to 790
health<00:03:37.019> from<00:03:37.200> 1,000<00:03:37.860> we'll<00:03:38.280> go<00:03:38.370> ahead<00:03:38.459> and

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
health from 1,000 we'll go ahead and

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.940 
health from 1,000 we'll go ahead and
place<00:03:38.820> one<00:03:39.180> more<00:03:39.390> charge<00:03:39.720> what<00:03:40.709> if<00:03:40.769> there's

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
place one more charge what if there's

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.470 
place one more charge what if there's
two<00:03:41.070> more<00:03:41.220> charges<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:41.820> that'll<00:03:42.060> be<00:03:42.120> three

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
two more charges so that'll be three

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.539 
two more charges so that'll be three
total<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:46.620> would<00:03:46.830> have<00:03:46.950> got<00:03:47.130> us<00:03:47.280> through

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
total and that would have got us through

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.000 
total and that would have got us through
the<00:03:48.090> wall<00:03:48.330> previously<00:03:49.140> in<00:03:49.350> previous

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
the wall previously in previous

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.310 
the wall previously in previous
iteration<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.459> rust<00:03:50.700> now<00:03:51.239> we're<00:03:51.420> at<00:03:51.510> 370

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
iteration of rust now we're at 370

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.500 
iteration of rust now we're at 370
damages<00:03:52.799> go<00:03:52.890> ahead<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.100> place<00:03:53.220> one<00:03:53.459> more<00:03:53.640> c4

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.170 

you'll<00:04:00.510> notice<00:04:00.780> guys<00:04:00.959> is<00:04:01.110> now<00:04:01.230> down<00:04:01.439> to<00:04:02.180> 160

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
you'll notice guys is now down to 160

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.479 
you'll notice guys is now down to 160
damage<00:04:03.930> so<00:04:04.470> we<00:04:04.620> go<00:04:04.709> ahead<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:04.920> put<00:04:05.159> one<00:04:05.340> more

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
damage so we go ahead and put one more

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.339 
damage so we go ahead and put one more
c4<00:04:05.939> on<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.390> that<00:04:06.659> will<00:04:06.810> get<00:04:06.989> us<00:04:07.019> through<00:04:07.110> the

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
c4 on that that will get us through the

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.170 
c4 on that that will get us through the
wall<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:08.159> may<00:04:08.310> want<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.610> switch<00:04:08.730> over<00:04:09.150> to

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
wall you may want to switch over to

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.880 
wall you may want to switch over to
perhaps<00:04:09.629> using<00:04:09.930> melee<00:04:10.260> weapons<00:04:10.650> at<00:04:10.769> that

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
perhaps using melee weapons at that

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.000 
perhaps using melee weapons at that
point<00:04:11.159> in<00:04:11.250> time<00:04:12.110> soften<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.200> up<00:04:13.290> with<00:04:13.470> c4<00:04:13.650> but

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
point in time soften it up with c4 but

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.949 
point in time soften it up with c4 but
that's<00:04:14.159> a<00:04:14.220> substantial<00:04:14.430> difference<00:04:15.000> in<00:04:15.450> terms

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
that's a substantial difference in terms

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.469 
that's a substantial difference in terms
of<00:04:16.169> c-4<00:04:16.709> so<00:04:17.280> what<00:04:17.489> this<00:04:17.609> means<00:04:17.850> guys<00:04:18.120> is<00:04:18.329> it's

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
of c-4 so what this means guys is it's

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.210 
of c-4 so what this means guys is it's
going<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.630> take<00:04:18.900> more<00:04:19.139> c4<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.799> get<00:04:19.949> through

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
going to take more c4 to get through

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.370 
going to take more c4 to get through
that<00:04:20.609> armored<00:04:21.090> building<00:04:21.479> tier<00:04:21.750> let's<00:04:22.229> go

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
that armored building tier let's go

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.870 
that armored building tier let's go
ahead<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.650> take<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.800> look<00:04:23.039> at<00:04:23.160> stone<00:04:23.430> because

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
ahead and take a look at stone because

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.640 
ahead and take a look at stone because
stone<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.419> another<00:04:24.750> common<00:04:25.050> one<00:04:25.259> that<00:04:25.530> you're

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
stone is another common one that you're

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.499 
stone is another common one that you're
going<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.860> be<00:04:25.949> using<00:04:26.070> c4<00:04:26.430> on<00:04:26.669> in<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.000> game<00:04:27.180> and

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
going to be using c4 on in the game and

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.500 
going to be using c4 on in the game and
in<00:04:28.199> previous<00:04:28.770> iterations<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.669> took<00:04:29.880> us<00:04:30.090> two

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
in previous iterations it took us two

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.689 
in previous iterations it took us two
charges<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.050> c-4<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:32.039> get<00:04:32.190> through<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.430> stone

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
charges of c-4 to get through a stone

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.700 
charges of c-4 to get through a stone
wall<00:04:32.940> let's<00:04:33.449> see<00:04:33.630> if<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:33.930> has<00:04:34.110> changed<00:04:34.410> if

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
wall let's see if that has changed if

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.810 
wall let's see if that has changed if
that's<00:04:34.860> any<00:04:35.010> different<00:04:37.400> so<00:04:38.400> go<00:04:38.550> ahead<00:04:38.610> we'll

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
that's any different so go ahead we'll

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.370 
that's any different so go ahead we'll
throw<00:04:39.000> two<00:04:39.210> charges<00:04:39.660> on<00:04:39.780> there<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.139> just<00:04:40.199> go

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
throw two charges on there and just go

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
it still was able to get through the

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.550 
it still was able to get through the
stone<00:04:50.580> wall<00:04:50.849> we<00:04:51.240> were<00:04:51.270> hitting<00:04:51.690> it<00:04:51.900> from<00:04:52.139> the

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
stone wall we were hitting it from the

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.200 
stone wall we were hitting it from the
outside<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:53.490> at<00:04:53.970> that<00:04:54.090> point<00:04:54.860> in<00:04:55.860> terms<00:04:56.820> of<00:04:57.060> how

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
outside to at that point in terms of how

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.200 
outside to at that point in terms of how
much<00:04:57.389> damage<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:58.020> did<00:04:58.199> it<00:04:58.639> still<00:04:59.639> did<00:04:59.849> less

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
much damage it did it still did less

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.240 
much damage it did it still did less
damage<00:05:00.750> because<00:05:01.139> it<00:05:01.289> would<00:05:01.560> have<00:05:01.680> had<00:05:01.860> sort<00:05:02.220> of

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
damage because it would have had sort of

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.640 
damage because it would have had sort of
a<00:05:02.370> splash<00:05:02.699> damage<00:05:03.000> effect<00:05:03.479> but<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.900> c4<00:05:04.320> charges

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
a splash damage effect but to c4 charges

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.010 
a splash damage effect but to c4 charges
is<00:05:04.919> still<00:05:05.250> enough<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.669> get<00:05:05.849> through<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.690> stone

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
is still enough to get through the stone

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.400 
is still enough to get through the stone
wall<00:05:07.320> but<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.490> arbor<00:05:09.150> tier<00:05:09.510> is<00:05:09.690> going<00:05:10.139> to<00:05:10.229> see

wall but the arbor tier is going to see

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.010 
wall but the arbor tier is going to see
a<00:05:10.440> substantial<00:05:10.740> increase<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.720> amount<00:05:12.930> of

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
a substantial increase to the amount of

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.070 
a substantial increase to the amount of
c-4<00:05:13.199> that<00:05:13.560> is<00:05:13.650> going<00:05:13.770> to<00:05:13.830> be<00:05:13.919> required<00:05:14.039> to<00:05:14.580> raid

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
c-4 that is going to be required to raid
