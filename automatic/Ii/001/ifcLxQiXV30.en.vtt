00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.490 
in these is an absolute pleasure what I
will<00:02:43.030> say<00:02:43.240> though<00:02:43.270> is<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:44.050> if<00:02:44.319> you<00:02:44.440> are

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
will say though is that if you are

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.740 
will say though is that if you are
wearing<00:02:44.770> these<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.370> very<00:02:45.760> hot<00:02:46.090> weather<00:02:46.420> or

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
wearing these and very hot weather or

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.510 
wearing these and very hot weather or
maybe<00:02:47.350> wearing<00:02:47.860> them<00:02:48.040> when<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.400> are

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
maybe wearing them when you are

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.240 
maybe wearing them when you are
exercising<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:50.080> leather<00:02:50.350> tends<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:51.040> meet

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
exercising the leather tends to meet

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.790 
exercising the leather tends to meet
your<00:02:51.459> ears<00:02:51.790> get<00:02:52.030> very<00:02:52.420> warm<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.290> maybe<00:02:53.709> a

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
your ears get very warm and maybe a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.809 
your ears get very warm and maybe a
little<00:02:53.980> bit<00:02:54.220> sweaty

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
little bit sweaty

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.940 
little bit sweaty
so<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.150> some<00:02:55.480> things<00:02:55.720> fade<00:02:56.050> myself<00:02:56.500> having<00:02:56.920> to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
so I some things fade myself having to

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.970 
so I some things fade myself having to
remove<00:02:57.400> them

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
remove them

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.010 
remove them
and<00:02:58.129> let<00:02:58.340> my<00:02:58.459> ears<00:02:58.700> breathe<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.090> little<00:02:59.330> it's

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
and let my ears breathe a little it's

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.960 
and let my ears breathe a little it's
not<00:03:00.140> really<00:03:00.379> a<00:03:00.410> huge<00:03:00.800> deal<00:03:00.860> but<00:03:01.640> if<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.819> live

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
not really a huge deal but if you live

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.940 
not really a huge deal but if you live
in<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.150> warm<00:03:02.360> climate<00:03:02.629> then<00:03:03.140> it's<00:03:03.319> definitely

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
in a warm climate then it's definitely

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.979 
in a warm climate then it's definitely
something<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.370> consider<00:03:04.940> but<00:03:05.660> this<00:03:05.810> is

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
something to consider but this is

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.290 
something to consider but this is
definitely<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.830> problem<00:03:07.099> with<00:03:07.400> all<00:03:07.670> headphones

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
definitely a problem with all headphones

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.050 
definitely a problem with all headphones
that<00:03:08.510> feature<00:03:08.750> leather<00:03:09.620> cops<00:03:10.010> another<00:03:10.790> thing

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
that feature leather cops another thing

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.759 
that feature leather cops another thing
worth<00:03:11.269> mentioning<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:12.050> that<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.319> cop<00:03:12.530> size

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
worth mentioning is that the cop size

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.640 
worth mentioning is that the cop size
has<00:03:13.040> also<00:03:13.310> been<00:03:13.610> improved<00:03:13.879> on<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.420> 2.0<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.260> is

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
has also been improved on the 2.0 and is

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.920 
has also been improved on the 2.0 and is
slightly<00:03:15.980> larger<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.760> as<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.330> can<00:03:17.450> see<00:03:17.630> my

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
slightly larger and as you can see my

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.660 
slightly larger and as you can see my
ears<00:03:18.200> seem<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.650> fit<00:03:18.800> in<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.010> holes<00:03:19.220> with<00:03:19.430> no

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
ears seem to fit in the holes with no

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.000 
ears seem to fit in the holes with no
trouble<00:03:20.060> at<00:03:20.180> all<00:03:20.420> but<00:03:21.170> if<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.380> have<00:03:21.530> slightly

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
trouble at all but if you have slightly

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.070 
trouble at all but if you have slightly
larger<00:03:22.400> ears<00:03:22.670> then<00:03:23.300> you<00:03:23.420> may<00:03:23.569> run<00:03:23.750> into<00:03:23.930> a

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
larger ears then you may run into a

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.229 
larger ears then you may run into a
problem<00:03:24.319> on<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.220> bottom<00:03:25.549> of<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.790> headphones

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
problem on the bottom of the headphones

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.850 
problem on the bottom of the headphones
this<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:26.900> where<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:27.260> will<00:03:27.379> find<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.709> audio

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
this is where you will find the audio

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.039 
this is where you will find the audio
amp<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:28.940> when<00:03:29.090> we<00:03:29.209> are<00:03:29.299> talking<00:03:29.480> about<00:03:29.750> the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
momentum featured an audio cable that

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.759 
momentum featured an audio cable that
was<00:03:35.269> three-and-a-half<00:03:35.630> millimeters<00:03:36.410> at<00:03:36.560> one

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769

making it a proprietary cable and that
is<00:03:44.299> one<00:03:44.510> thing<00:03:44.750> that<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.989> really<00:03:45.590> dislike<00:03:45.890> I

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519

to pack these headphones up one thing

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.870 
to pack these headphones up one thing
that<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.109> really<00:04:15.410> love<00:04:15.650> about<00:04:15.680> this<00:04:16.070> capable<00:04:16.639> as

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
that I really love about this capable as

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.569 
that I really love about this capable as
the<00:04:16.940> twister<00:04:17.780> lock<00:04:17.959> feature<00:04:18.310> ensures<00:04:19.310> that

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
the twister lock feature ensures that

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.460 
the twister lock feature ensures that
there<00:04:20.090> is<00:04:20.239> no<00:04:20.510> way<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:21.049> cable<00:04:21.380> is

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
there is no way that the cable is

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.080 
there is no way that the cable is
getting<00:04:21.799> pulled<00:04:22.070> out<00:04:22.220> from<00:04:22.370> your<00:04:22.520> headphones

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
getting pulled out from your headphones

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.750 
getting pulled out from your headphones
if<00:04:23.660> you<00:04:23.840> accidentally<00:04:24.410> get<00:04:24.530> it<00:04:24.740> caught<00:04:24.979> but<00:04:25.639> on
