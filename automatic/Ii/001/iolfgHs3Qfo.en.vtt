00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
my experience has been the reverse of is

I used to believe now I'm running the
other<00:00:21.770> way<00:00:21.860> it's<00:00:22.760> a<00:00:23.020> it's<00:00:24.020> kind<00:00:24.200> of<00:00:24.230> one<00:00:24.350> of

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
other way it's a it's kind of one of

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.770 
other way it's a it's kind of one of
those<00:00:24.470> crazy<00:00:24.830> things<00:00:25.040> it's<00:00:26.030> so<00:00:26.270> hard<00:00:26.510> to<00:00:26.570> say

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:26.780 
those crazy things it's so hard to say

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.160 
those crazy things it's so hard to say
what<00:00:27.020> he<00:00:27.170> saw<00:00:27.410> what<00:00:27.710> he<00:00:27.740> didn't<00:00:28.720> but<00:00:29.720> I<00:00:29.750> can<00:00:29.960> say

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
what he saw what he didn't but I can say

that would come to this earth would be

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.960 
that would come to this earth would be
capable<00:00:38.390> of<00:00:38.840> why<00:00:39.830> would<00:00:40.100> they<00:00:40.250> be<00:00:40.430> caught<00:00:40.730> me

in a peeping tom no Jeff isn't that a
good<00:00:44.240> point<00:00:44.710> well<00:00:45.710> I<00:00:45.800> think<00:00:46.070> if<00:00:46.160> it's<00:00:46.340> pure

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
good point well I think if it's pure

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.720 
good point well I think if it's pure

what<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> make<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.690> all<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.040> are<00:01:08.040> you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
what do you make of all this are you

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.060 
what do you make of all this are you
open<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:08.940> not<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.390> open<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.680> think

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
open to it or not I'm open to it I think

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.530 
open to it or not I'm open to it I think
it's<00:01:11.190> an<00:01:11.310> awfully<00:01:11.580> large<00:01:11.759> universe<00:01:12.270> out<00:01:12.509> there

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
it's an awfully large universe out there

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.749 
it's an awfully large universe out there
and<00:01:13.049> if<00:01:13.290> there's<00:01:13.560> six<00:01:13.950> billion<00:01:14.159> dollar<00:01:14.430> stars

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
and if there's six billion dollar stars

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.370 
and if there's six billion dollar stars
in<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.030> Milky<00:01:15.270> Way<00:01:15.390> galaxy<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.140> there's

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
in the Milky Way galaxy and there's

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.830 
in the Milky Way galaxy and there's
billions<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.250> galaxies<00:01:17.790> yeah<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
billions of galaxies yeah I think it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.570 
billions of galaxies yeah I think it
were<00:01:18.960> rather<00:01:19.229> arrogant<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.860> think<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
were rather arrogant to think for the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.969 
were rather arrogant to think for the
only<00:01:20.790> life<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.270> universe<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:22.680> remember

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
only life of the universe to remember

only life of the universe to remember

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.200 
probing for the possibility of life I
mean<00:01:28.710> there's<00:01:28.890> some<00:01:29.310> pretty<00:01:29.460> serious<00:01:29.640> people

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
mean there's some pretty serious people

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.969 
mean there's some pretty serious people
that<00:01:30.330> have<00:01:30.420> also<00:01:30.600> come<00:01:30.899> forward<00:01:31.409> governor

Stan's<00:01:38.729> case<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.780> full<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.440> this<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:42.000> shot

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
Stan's case is is full of this one shot

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.320 
Stan's case is is full of this one shot
is<00:01:42.660> hardly<00:01:43.369> it's<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.700> tip<00:01:45.179> of<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
iceberg give this man's okay so you know

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.560 
iceberg give this man's okay so you know
I<00:01:48.330> couldn't<00:01:49.289> say<00:01:49.470> we<00:01:49.740> should<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.450> until<00:01:51.450> all

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
I couldn't say we should be until all

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.749 
I couldn't say we should be until all
the<00:01:51.840> story<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.229> told<00:01:52.440> about<00:01:52.560> Sam<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.250> you
