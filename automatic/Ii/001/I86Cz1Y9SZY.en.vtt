good<00:01:03.570> hand<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> trooper<00:01:04.320> i'm<00:01:04.880> not<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
good hand the trooper i'm not going to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.460 
good hand the trooper i'm not going to
do<00:01:06.210> too<00:01:06.360> much<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.810> dealings<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
do too much but the dealings with the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.730 
do too much but the dealings with the
graph<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.700> really<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.030> nice

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
graph is going to be really really nice

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.219 
graph is going to be really really nice
so<00:01:10.740> I'm<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> good<00:01:11.130> position<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:12.299> I'm<00:01:13.080> not

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
so I'm in a good position and I'm not

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.780 
so I'm in a good position and I'm not
too<00:01:13.380> worried<00:01:13.619> about<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.860> he<00:01:14.100> decides<00:01:14.369> not<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
too worried about it he decides not to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.399 
too worried about it he decides not to
overlay<00:01:15.509> because<00:01:15.840> he<00:01:15.930> didn't<00:01:16.170> want<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> give

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
overlay because he didn't want to give

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.249 
overlay because he didn't want to give
me<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> plus<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.729> think<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:19.020> he<00:01:19.110> did

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
me a plus one but I think that if he did

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.480 
me a plus one but I think that if he did
overlay<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> would<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:19.979> put<00:01:20.159> him<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
overlay it would have put him in a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
overlay it would have put him in a
little<00:01:20.580> bit<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> better<00:01:21.119> situation<00:01:21.619> instead

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
little bit of a better situation instead

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.050 
little bit of a better situation instead
of<00:01:22.710> me<00:01:22.950> kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.369> getting<00:01:23.670> over<00:01:23.880> his

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
of me kind of just getting over his

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.359 
of me kind of just getting over his
entire<00:01:24.180> field<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.990> leaving<00:01:25.799> him<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.189> a

but I do have a decrease face up so then

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.099 
but I do have a decrease face up so then
I<00:04:18.739> activated<00:04:19.310> dealings<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:20.750> drawn<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.079> a

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
I activated dealings and I drawn to a

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.520 
I activated dealings and I drawn to a
snow<00:04:21.380> I'm<00:04:21.560> like<00:04:21.709> wow<00:04:21.859> that's<00:04:22.669> perfect<00:04:23.530> and

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
snow I'm like wow that's perfect and

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.620 
snow I'm like wow that's perfect and
then<00:04:25.099> so<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.310> search<00:04:25.610> for<00:04:25.640> graph<00:04:26.060> obviously

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
then so I search for graph obviously

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.280 
then so I search for graph obviously
because<00:04:26.870> I<00:04:26.900> have<00:04:27.110> to

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
because I have to

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.520 
because I have to
pop<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:28.820> was<00:04:29.330> really<00:04:29.600> really<00:04:29.720> really<00:04:30.020> hoping<00:04:30.410> to

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
pop I was really really really hoping to

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.010 
pop I was really really really hoping to
drawn<00:04:30.740> to<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:30.890> darker<00:04:31.280> old<00:04:31.400> monster<00:04:31.760> after<00:04:32.720> I

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
drawn to a darker old monster after I

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.020 
drawn to a darker old monster after I
pop<00:04:34.010> on<00:04:34.160> his<00:04:34.190> monsters<00:04:34.580> I'd<00:04:34.700> run<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.910> another

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
pop on his monsters I'd run to another

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.860 
pop on his monsters I'd run to another
graph<00:04:35.420> is<00:04:35.540> only<00:04:35.720> art<00:04:35.960> this<00:04:36.140> gives<00:04:36.290> me<00:04:36.350> another

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
graph is only art this gives me another

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.020 
graph is only art this gives me another
chance<00:04:38.870> of<00:04:39.140> hope<00:04:39.320> he<00:04:40.190> activates<00:04:40.520> safe<00:04:40.760> zones

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
chance of hope he activates safe zones

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.310 
chance of hope he activates safe zones
for<00:04:41.180> getting<00:04:41.420> that<00:04:41.480> decreased<00:04:41.870> face<00:04:42.050> up<00:04:42.230> on

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320
