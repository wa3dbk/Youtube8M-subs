00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
we need something like that that will

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.760 
we need something like that that will
fit<00:01:13.939> right<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:15.439> when<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.590> clasp<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.130> opened

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
fit right here when the clasp is opened

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.410

needs to fit right right here you know
in<00:01:24.780> order<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> make<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.650> clasp<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:26.640> round<00:01:27.229> so

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
in order to make the clasp more round so

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.539 
in order to make the clasp more round so
it<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:28.530> be<00:01:28.680> tighter<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.829> we<00:01:31.829> put<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.189> right<00:01:32.369> on

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
it will be tighter so we put it right on

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.960 
it will be tighter so we put it right on
the<00:01:32.700> cut<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.090> board<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.890> put<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.250> metal<00:01:35.640> we

the cut on board you put the metal we

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.880 
the cut on board you put the metal we

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
use the hammer to hit the round tool we

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
use the hammer to hit the round tool we
don't<00:01:44.130> need<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.369> hit<00:01:44.579> too<00:01:44.759> strong<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.299> depend

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
don't need to hit too strong it depend

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.730 
don't need to hit too strong it depend
how<00:01:45.810> wide<00:01:46.110> how<00:01:46.920> wide<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:49.170> clasp<00:01:49.409> which

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
how wide how wide is the the clasp which

how wide how wide is the the clasp which
the<00:01:49.920> clasp<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.369> wider<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.509> need<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.780> hit

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
the clasp is wider then you need to hit

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.660 
the clasp is wider then you need to hit
stronger<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.619> class<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.360> looser<00:01:54.360> then

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
stronger if the class is a looser then

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.350 
stronger if the class is a looser then
Amina's<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.899> class<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.170> smaller<00:01:59.360> in

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
Amina's and if the class is smaller in

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.600 
Amina's and if the class is smaller in
shape<00:02:00.689> you'd<00:02:01.290> need<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.680> hit<00:02:02.810> with<00:02:03.810> less<00:02:04.020> power

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
shape you'd need to hit with less power

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.969 
shape you'd need to hit with less power
if<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.670> by<00:02:06.149> mistake<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.110> hit<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.469> too<00:02:07.799> much

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
if you by mistake if you hit it too much

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.880 
if you by mistake if you hit it too much
and<00:02:08.340> then<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.679> hard<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.920> close

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
and then it's hard to close

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.800 
and then it's hard to close
what<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.010> need<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.220> do<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.790> turn<00:02:15.240> around<00:02:15.300> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
what you need to do is turn around the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.320 
what you need to do is turn around the
bracelet<00:02:16.320> like<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:19.400> take<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.610> hammer<00:02:20.850> that

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
bracelet like that take the hammer that

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.830 
bracelet like that take the hammer that
you<00:02:21.510> use<00:02:21.780> but<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:23.400> better<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.790> put<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.180> tape<00:02:24.510> on

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
you use but it's better to put a tape on

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.690 
you use but it's better to put a tape on
it<00:02:27.050> in<00:02:28.050> order<00:02:28.230> not<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.500> scratch<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.010> bracelet

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
it in order not to scratch the bracelet

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.150 
it in order not to scratch the bracelet
so<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.120> put<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> tape<00:02:30.750> on<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.709> head<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:32.040> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
so you put a tape on the head of the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.340 
so you put a tape on the head of the
hammer<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:33.450> hit<00:02:33.690> from<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.200> other<00:02:34.380> side

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
hammer and you hit from the other side

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:45.520 
hammer and you hit from the other side
and<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.560> make<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:38.840> looser<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.410> will<00:02:40.590> close

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.790
