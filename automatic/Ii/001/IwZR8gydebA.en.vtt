 example that the knife and the end 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.210
 So they are still very active 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.280
 place very 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.550
 and that's just a few things 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.880
 requires 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.390
 that has on the 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.080
 has been tested with 33 c and so on 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.670
 continue 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.530
 just click on the download button 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.820
 I need that loaded and 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.710
 if you download that then down 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.160
 you know you just have a browser 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.110
 again 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.200
 we have this here on the desktop 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:32.720
 pulled you go then yes easy 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.680
 windows then give her a symbol there 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.310
 percent a 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.730
 then you come here also 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.950
 roaming 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.950
 there asks minecraft minecraft 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.390
 you seek your own order I make you 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.130
 once briefly purely 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.220
 and you just pull captain off 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.260
 minecraft three in there 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.700
 Now you make a right click and 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.290
 press on 4 unpack 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.970
 But now you have to do something else 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.470
 because if now just closes and 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.900
 then the world starts shopping there 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.390
 not shown you have to on this 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.930
 folder go to captain minecraft 3 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:14.120
 install he clicks on it and 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.220
 you have to copy this folder 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.989
 and paste it into your saves folder 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.180
 otherwise it will not work 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.370
 if you did that then you know 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.370
 Just start it and start your minecraft 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.020
 if the lounge style has been designed 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.250
 down here your profile then you go 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:48.009
 on noble profile and presses her 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.300
 experiment with the pro-version snapshots 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.860
 if you click it then you come 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.529
 this message with five yes 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.520
 Yes 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:05:01.060
 We have to bid on exchanges down here 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.990
 then the snapshot version will be 14 w 33 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.900
 c off 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.800
 Here you will find 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.930
 directly above that it is still very new 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.110
 you just did that then 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.479
 save profile then I would say say 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.900
 we'll skeptical minecraft three right away 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.900
 again 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.950
 so if your minecraft started then 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.320
 he just has to single player then 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.390
 on skeptical minecraft 3 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.390
 the world then loads briefly 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.230
 loads briefly 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.550
 so 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:07.710
 now you see you are in as always 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.710
 a multiplication block bond 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:15.720
 it's just something very fierce though 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.720
 that is not very tragic 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.650
 In any case, I hope that I will you 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.229
 could help 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.030
 and you liked the video and there 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.150
 I would just say that until the next one 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.150
 times
