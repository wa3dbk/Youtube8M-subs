hey youtube today I'm going to show you

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.610 
hey youtube today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.470> get<00:00:07.470> your<00:00:07.529> system<00:00:08.959> information<00:00:09.959> on

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
how to get your system information on

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.530 
how to get your system information on
your<00:00:11.570> g15<00:00:12.570> screen<00:00:13.759> so<00:00:14.759> things<00:00:14.969> such<00:00:15.150> as<00:00:15.210> like

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
your g15 screen so things such as like

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.700 
your g15 screen so things such as like
CPU<00:00:15.990> temperature<00:00:17.450> CPU<00:00:18.450> usage<00:00:18.869> GPU

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
CPU temperature CPU usage GPU

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.040 
CPU temperature CPU usage GPU
temperature<00:00:19.920> high<00:00:20.640> drive<00:00:20.910> temperatures<00:00:21.180> all

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
temperature high drive temperatures all

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.130 
temperature high drive temperatures all
sorts<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.529> things<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.240> on<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.510> g15

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
sorts of things on that on the g15

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.570 
sorts of things on that on the g15
LCD<00:00:26.000> so<00:00:27.260> this<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.380> all<00:00:28.500> using<00:00:28.679> a<00:00:28.949> program

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
LCD so this is all using a program

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.420 
LCD so this is all using a program
called<00:00:29.609> Everest

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
called Everest

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.820 
called Everest
which<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.580> just<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.000> as<00:00:33.150> you<00:00:33.269> can<00:00:33.360> see<00:00:33.830> so

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
which is just you as you can see so

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.079 
which is just you as you can see so
basically<00:00:35.040> once<00:00:35.400> you've<00:00:35.489> got<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.729> installed

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:36.089 
basically once you've got that installed

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:41.960 
basically once you've got that installed
you<00:00:36.930> want<00:00:37.080> to<00:00:37.140> navigate<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:38.070> file<00:00:40.640> file<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
you want to navigate to file file and

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.170 
you want to navigate to file file and
then<00:00:42.120> down<00:00:42.269> to<00:00:42.420> preferences<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.879> ppens<00:00:45.089> up

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.060 

stay<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.460> page<00:01:23.670> one<00:01:23.940> I've<00:01:24.090> put<00:01:24.300> in<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.070> CPU

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
stay on page one I've put in the CPU

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.040 
stay on page one I've put in the CPU
temperatures<00:01:26.550> and<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.780> usage<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.820> an<00:01:30.420> example

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
temperatures and the usage so an example

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.480 
temperatures and the usage so an example
you<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.650> here<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.040> also<00:01:32.159> align

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you can see up here you can also align

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.440 
you can see up here you can also align
where<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:32.880> go<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.950> change<00:01:34.950> them<00:01:35.070> around

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
where they go you can change them around

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.810 
where they go you can change them around
and<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> size<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.990> them<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:38.640> see

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and the size of them and you can see

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.020 
and the size of them and you can see
it's<00:01:38.940> on<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.150> screen<00:01:39.330> there<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:41.370> cool

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it's on the screen there and a cool

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.160 
it's on the screen there and a cool
thing<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.690> actually<00:01:42.810> put<00:01:43.080> in

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
thing you can do is actually put in

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.899 
thing you can do is actually put in
imaging<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:45.920> don't<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.010> an<00:01:47.100> example<00:01:47.370> here<00:01:47.700> but

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
imaging I don't have an example here but

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.960 
imaging I don't have an example here but
so<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:49.140> sound<00:01:49.440> page<00:01:49.650> four<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.190> can<00:01:50.580> press<00:01:50.940> that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
so like sound page four I can press that

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.730 
so like sound page four I can press that
and<00:01:51.300> you'll<00:01:51.479> get<00:01:51.630> an<00:01:51.750> image<00:01:51.960> across<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and you'll get an image across the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.180 
and you'll get an image across the
screen<00:01:53.030> which<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.150> pretty<00:01:54.360> cool<00:01:54.510> you<00:01:55.130> know<00:01:56.130> I

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
screen which is pretty cool you know I

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.010 
screen which is pretty cool you know I
I'll<00:01:56.940> probably<00:01:57.150> make<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> few<00:01:57.570> more<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.870> these

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
I'll probably make a few more of these

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.710 
I'll probably make a few more of these
there's<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.590> there's<00:01:59.010> some<00:01:59.159> cool<00:01:59.520> tools<00:02:00.510> you

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
there's a there's some cool tools you

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.810 
there's a there's some cool tools you
can<00:02:00.870> use<00:02:00.900> in<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.260> and<00:02:02.159> get<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> lot<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.610> cool

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
can use in it and get a lot of cool

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.480 
can use in it and get a lot of cool
stuff<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.299> come<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:03.930> screen<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:05.190> I'll

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
stuff to come up on that screen so I'll

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.059 
stuff to come up on that screen so I'll
probably<00:02:05.729> make<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.030> few<00:02:06.299> more<00:02:06.390> videos<00:02:07.069> stay

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
probably make a few more videos stay

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.209 
probably make a few more videos stay
tuned<00:02:09.860> yeah<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.250> thanks<00:02:11.819> for<00:02:11.910> watching
