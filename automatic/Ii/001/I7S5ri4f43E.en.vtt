welcome to another ssj review this time
we're<00:00:21.650> looking<00:00:21.980> at<00:00:22.070> the<00:00:22.220> Transformers

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
we're looking at the Transformers

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.470 
we're looking at the Transformers
generation<00:00:23.660> to<00:00:24.009> Megatron<00:00:25.009> now<00:00:25.759> I<00:00:25.789> usually<00:00:26.359> try

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
generation to Megatron now I usually try

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.109 
generation to Megatron now I usually try
to<00:00:26.539> keep<00:00:27.019> a<00:00:27.199> rule<00:00:27.439> that<00:00:27.470> I've<00:00:28.460> been<00:00:28.670> pretty

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
to keep a rule that I've been pretty

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.929 
to keep a rule that I've been pretty
good<00:00:29.150> at<00:00:29.480> falling<00:00:30.169> stuff<00:00:30.800> for<00:00:31.429> the<00:00:31.490> most<00:00:31.699> part

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
good at falling stuff for the most part

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.560 
good at falling stuff for the most part
but<00:00:32.660> I<00:00:32.720> usually<00:00:33.530> don't<00:00:33.770> do<00:00:34.310> video<00:00:34.850> reviews<00:00:35.330> of

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
but I usually don't do video reviews of

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.050 
but I usually don't do video reviews of
older<00:00:36.020> toys<00:00:36.230> if<00:00:36.560> I'm<00:00:36.860> missing<00:00:37.310> parts<00:00:37.850> or

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
older toys if I'm missing parts or

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.850 
older toys if I'm missing parts or
certain<00:00:38.720> features<00:00:39.140> aren't<00:00:39.320> usually<00:00:39.530> broken

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
certain features aren't usually broken

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.940 
certain features aren't usually broken
because<00:00:40.220> I<00:00:40.340> like<00:00:40.490> to<00:00:40.520> show<00:00:41.020> every<00:00:42.020> part<00:00:42.710> of<00:00:42.800> the

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
because I like to show every part of the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.950 
because I like to show every part of the
toy<00:00:43.130> but<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:43.850> was<00:00:44.000> going<00:00:44.240> through<00:00:44.300> my<00:00:44.450> old<00:00:44.570> toys

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
toy but I was going through my old toys

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.080 
toy but I was going through my old toys
I<00:00:45.020> not<00:00:45.560> too<00:00:45.680> long<00:00:45.830> ago<00:00:45.890> when<00:00:46.340> I<00:00:46.460> found<00:00:46.730> this<00:00:46.850> guy

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
I not too long ago when I found this guy

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.840 
I not too long ago when I found this guy
and<00:00:47.480> like<00:00:47.690> man<00:00:48.320> I<00:00:48.620> remember<00:00:49.160> getting<00:00:49.310> this<00:00:49.580> and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
and like man I remember getting this and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.600 
and like man I remember getting this and
think<00:00:50.060> it<00:00:50.150> was<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:51.070> just<00:00:52.070> back<00:00:52.310> in<00:00:52.490> that

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
think it was the just back in that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.000 
think it was the just back in that
I<00:00:52.670> never<00:00:53.000> had<00:00:53.390> a<00:00:53.660> generation<00:00:54.350> one<00:00:54.470> Megatron

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
I never had a generation one Megatron

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.320 
I never had a generation one Megatron
toy<00:00:55.250> I<00:00:56.050> was<00:00:57.050> until<00:00:57.440> my<00:00:57.740> well<00:00:58.670> I<00:00:58.970> was<00:00:59.120> well<00:00:59.270> into

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
toy I was until my well I was well into

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.040 
toy I was until my well I was well into
my<00:00:59.630> adulthood<00:01:00.560> I<00:01:00.860> got<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.480> reissued<00:01:02.480> Megatron

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
my adulthood I got a reissued Megatron

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.670 
my adulthood I got a reissued Megatron
so<00:01:03.800> this<00:01:04.010> was<00:01:04.189> my<00:01:04.369> first<00:01:04.790> ever<00:01:05.229> Megatron<00:01:06.229> toy

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
so this was my first ever Megatron toy

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.810 
so this was my first ever Megatron toy
and<00:01:07.240> definitely<00:01:08.240> by<00:01:08.450> particles<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.290> this<00:01:09.439> is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
and definitely by particles and this is

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.210 
and definitely by particles and this is
has<00:01:10.820> been<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.150> trend<00:01:11.360> setter<00:01:11.660> of<00:01:11.990> of<00:01:12.500> having

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
has been the trend setter of of having

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.610 
has been the trend setter of of having
Megatron<00:01:13.820> being<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.510> tank<00:01:14.780> for<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.260> longest

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
Megatron being a tank for the longest

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.360 
Megatron being a tank for the longest
time<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.330> it's<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.660> really<00:01:18.020> kind<00:01:18.290> of<00:01:18.500> funky

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
time and it's a really kind of funky

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.320 
time and it's a really kind of funky
generation<00:01:20.060> to<00:01:20.680> purple<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:21.860> green<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.400> the

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
generation to purple and green and the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.390 
generation to purple and green and the
way<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.570> worked<00:01:23.780> is<00:01:23.960> you<00:01:24.140> put<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.409> open<00:01:25.159> this<00:01:25.250> up

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
way it worked is you put a open this up

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.670 
way it worked is you put a open this up
you<00:01:25.550> put<00:01:25.730> a<00:01:25.760> missile<00:01:26.150> in<00:01:26.240> here<00:01:27.670> you<00:01:28.670> would<00:01:28.909> a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
you put a missile in here you would a

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.170 
you put a missile in here you would a
pull<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.830> trigger<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.340> shoot<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.000> it

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
pull the trigger and shoot it and it

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.420 
pull the trigger and shoot it and it
would<00:01:32.300> make<00:01:32.600> firing<00:01:33.050> noises<00:01:33.170> has<00:01:34.070> school

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
would make firing noises has school

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.760 
would make firing noises has school

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.660 
the turnout this side and off comes up
as<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:44.230> mean<00:02:45.230> purple<00:02:45.650> phase<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.070> I<00:02:46.130> do<00:02:46.190> believe

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
as a mean purple phase and I do believe

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.590 
as a mean purple phase and I do believe
that<00:02:47.540> this<00:02:47.750> is<00:02:47.960> the<00:02:48.080> first<00:02:48.350> time<00:02:48.560> that

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
that this is the first time that

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.030 
that this is the first time that
Megatron<00:02:50.600> had<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.840> purple<00:02:51.260> face<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.860> that's

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
Megatron had a purple face and that's

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.910 
Megatron had a purple face and that's
what<00:02:52.820> kind<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.060> caused<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.770> trend<00:02:54.770> of

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
what kind of caused the trend of

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.220 
what kind of caused the trend of
Metatron's<00:02:55.550> for<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.180> longest<00:02:56.780> time<00:02:56.900> always

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
Metatron's for the longest time always

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.090 
Metatron's for the longest time always
having<00:02:57.620> purple<00:02:57.950> faces<00:02:58.310> especially<00:02:58.580> through

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.900 
into a triptych on repaint which I
thought<00:03:36.170> was<00:03:36.350> really<00:03:36.560> funny<00:03:36.920> but<00:03:37.550> I've<00:03:37.670> always

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
thought was really funny but I've always

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.760 
thought was really funny but I've always
wanted<00:03:38.240> to<00:03:38.510> get<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.900> mega<00:03:39.170> storm<00:03:39.470> just<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:39.740> I

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
wanted to get the mega storm just so I

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.240 
wanted to get the mega storm just so I
could<00:03:39.890> have<00:03:40.070> a<00:03:40.160> brand<00:03:41.090> new<00:03:41.270> clean<00:03:41.720> g2<00:03:42.650> Megatron

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
and articulation one can do that if you

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.400 
and articulation one can do that if you
want<00:03:54.230> he<00:03:54.500> has<00:03:54.890> no<00:03:55.040> head<00:03:55.280> articulation<00:03:56.290> he<00:03:57.290> is

here<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:03.380> he<00:04:03.740> can<00:04:03.920> only<00:04:04.040> lift<00:04:04.670> his<00:04:04.850> arm<00:04:05.030> up

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
here and he can only lift his arm up

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.450 
here and he can only lift his arm up
like<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:05.780> if<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.470> have<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.710> arm<00:04:06.920> Bend<00:04:07.250> back

which is kind of interesting see how

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.760 
which is kind of interesting see how
that<00:04:10.610> works<00:04:10.820> actually<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:12.200> we<00:04:12.290> will<00:04:12.560> really

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
that works actually and we will really

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.730 
that works actually and we will really
look<00:04:12.920> at<00:04:13.100> it's<00:04:13.310> not<00:04:13.490> really<00:04:13.730> that<00:04:13.880> interesting

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
look at it's not really that interesting
