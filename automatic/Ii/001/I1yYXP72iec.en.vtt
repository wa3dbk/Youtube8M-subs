 this recording to teach you how to do 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.300

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.860
 directly from youtube installer 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.630

 I already have one more program you can 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.590

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.630
 you know it's very easy just pressing 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.850
 to install and it will download 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.920
 then you execute it, that's right 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.290
 after the program has 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.960
 installed on your computer is that the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.210
 Actube qat are you going to join him 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.390
 okay that focuses on the ethical framework already 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.250
 I left here to get easier, it's not a 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.150
 very easy program to tinker staff 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.670
 too even there there has to downloads 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.220
 stream caption screen record and here the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.510
 convert video and go nu 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.780
 You come here, oh what's coming, screen record. 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.880
 here'm not very good English is 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.170
 but that's it, is that it is in record 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.790
 here you can trace the area is that 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.890
 means to this 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.870
 if you press here I'll give you an example 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.920
 there I can trace the area that will be 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.900
 recorded 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.440
 so I squeeze my mouse 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.570
 Here , the example I shake here 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.910
 it will record only this area that I 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.140
 I selected you, did not I 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.400
 I do not particularly enjoy doing this. 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.970
 because I already do when after the 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.580
 Egypt video right but let's make one 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.160
 test here i go i will select whole 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.110
 here is my right computer 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.070
 selected back across entire area 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.310
 beautiful 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.170
 here you choose a microphone is with the 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.930
 microphone you are going to choose 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.540
 here the main volume does not touch anything 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.060
 and here below are recording options is 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.100
 the next you will press this button 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.470
 here is the record cursor because 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.230
 because if you do not press this button 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.660
 your mouse will not appear on the recording 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.580
 Ok, so it's very important for your 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.590
 way people see where they are at 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.109
 demonstrate by clicking if you do not press 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.200
 the recording mouse will not appear and e 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.600
 if you use hot case here is pressed him to 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.940
 that you can start your 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.670
 recording by pressing a technician button 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.560
 side, then you tighten these two 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.140
 button only the rest do not need 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.730
 To squeeze is this joy for the love of God in the 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.590
 squeeze that it will follow its way to be 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.410
 a scramble where the brothers and 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.690
 she goes together do not press the button 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.930
 superstar these two is this beginning 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.850
 slows delayed here serves to 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.530
 following if you are an example because it 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.880
 you start here 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.880
 You will start here what goes 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.030
 it will start recording the 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.540
 screen already this little youtube qat e 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.330
 You're never this, so what? 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.000
 I advise you if you want, of course. 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.270
 two ways only have f7 also in r7 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.270
 that you can then minimize the program 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.920
 and press the f7 while doing a 6v recording 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.710
 what a lot of luck 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.290
 here he is already recording he is already 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.260
 recording the screen all right I can 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.590
 enter here on my beautiful screen right 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.230
 So what happens to stop recording me? 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.210
 I'm going to squeeze the f8 I'm not mistaken, I'm going there. 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.150
 see people because I do not remember right 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.490
 but it's trimming the f8 will tighten the f8 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.860
 I've already done a recording here. 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.980
 screen that I show you play 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.780

 So what happens to stop recording me? 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.010
 I'm going to shake the f8, I'm not mistaken. 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.800
 in force because I do not remember right 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.050
 But to stop her, you see. 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.230

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.570
