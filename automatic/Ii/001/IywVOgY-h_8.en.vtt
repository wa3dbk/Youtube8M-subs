have<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.299> USB<00:01:46.539> port<00:01:46.749> on<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.409> side<00:01:47.679> of<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.039> gps

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
have the USB port on the side of the gps

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:49.980 
have the USB port on the side of the gps
so<00:01:49.060> generally<00:01:49.419> you<00:01:49.479> can<00:01:49.569> do<00:01:49.810> all<00:01:49.840> you're

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
so generally you can do all you're

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.319 
so generally you can do all you're
powering<00:01:50.439> a<00:01:50.679> cigarette<00:01:51.369> lighter<00:01:51.429> power<00:01:51.880> for

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
powering a cigarette lighter power for

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.989 
powering a cigarette lighter power for
this<00:01:52.450> GPS<00:01:52.899> through<00:01:53.259> this<00:01:53.409> port<00:01:54.249> but<00:01:54.819> if<00:01:54.909> you

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
this GPS through this port but if you

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:56.730 
this GPS through this port but if you
need<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.299> extra<00:01:55.659> port<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.229> will<00:01:56.409> need<00:01:56.560> to

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
need the extra port you will need to

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.859 
need the extra port you will need to
have<00:01:56.889> this<00:01:57.069> cradle<00:01:57.609> connected<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.630> I'm<00:01:58.689> just

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
have this cradle connected so I'm just

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.569 
have this cradle connected so I'm just
going<00:01:58.989> to<00:01:59.049> connect<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.469> back<00:01:59.709> onto<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.159> GPS

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
going to connect the back onto the GPS

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.899 
going to connect the back onto the GPS
for<00:02:01.509> this<00:02:01.959> example<00:02:02.409> using<00:02:02.859> the<00:02:02.950> cradle<00:02:03.340> now

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
for this example using the cradle now

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.969 
for this example using the cradle now
obviously<00:02:04.689> with<00:02:04.869> this<00:02:04.959> cradle<00:02:05.349> in<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:05.829> have

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
obviously with this cradle in you have

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.889 
obviously with this cradle in you have
to<00:02:06.099> have<00:02:06.219> this<00:02:06.340> antenna<00:02:06.729> up<00:02:06.999> if<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.509> don't<00:02:07.749> use

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
to have this antenna up if you don't use

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.749 
to have this antenna up if you don't use
this<00:02:08.020> cradle<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.800> still<00:02:09.130> need<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.429> antenna

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
this cradle you still need the antenna

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.550 
this cradle you still need the antenna
up<00:02:09.940> otherwise<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.509> GPS<00:02:10.930> actually<00:02:11.260> doesn't

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
up otherwise the GPS actually doesn't

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.620 
up otherwise the GPS actually doesn't
even<00:02:11.650> get<00:02:11.860> GPS<00:02:12.310> signal<00:02:13.060> because<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.330> doesn't

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
even get GPS signal because it doesn't

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.230 
even get GPS signal because it doesn't
turn<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.960> G

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
turn the G

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.230 
turn the G
as<00:02:14.390> part<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.750> unit<00:02:15.020> on<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.850> cradle

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
as part of the unit on so the cradle

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.720 
as part of the unit on so the cradle
goes<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:17.600> way<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.170> firstly<00:02:19.130> place<00:02:19.550> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
goes this way and firstly place the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.390 
goes this way and firstly place the
bottom<00:02:20.060> into<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.840> cradle<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.380> then<00:02:21.740> this<00:02:22.190> is

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
bottom into the cradle and then this is

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.550 
bottom into the cradle and then this is
the<00:02:22.550> top<00:02:22.790> catch<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.960> just<00:02:24.170> clips<00:02:24.410> around

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
the top catch and that just clips around

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.390 
the top catch and that just clips around
the<00:02:24.800> corner<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:26.090> GPS<00:02:26.860> again<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.070> can<00:02:28.220> move

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
the corner of the GPS again you can move

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.060 
the corner of the GPS again you can move
the<00:02:28.580> antenna<00:02:28.700> still<00:02:29.240> as<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.410> mentioned<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.920> can

that when you buy this unit it came with

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.430 
that when you buy this unit it came with
and<00:03:06.860> what<00:03:07.520> this<00:03:07.790> little<00:03:08.180> cook<00:03:08.690> here<00:03:09.020> does<00:03:09.290> is

allows you to hook in that USB cable
prior<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:14.360> sliding<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.050> back<00:03:15.230> into<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.300> cradle

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
prior to sliding it back into the cradle

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.600 
prior to sliding it back into the cradle
and<00:03:17.510> what<00:03:18.140> that<00:03:18.170> does<00:03:18.470> is<00:03:18.530> on<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:18.860> motorbike<00:03:19.220> or

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
and what that does is on a motorbike or

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.310 
and what that does is on a motorbike or
some<00:03:20.000> other<00:03:20.150> area<00:03:20.810> where<00:03:20.960> there's<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.170> high

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
some other area where there's a high

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.130 
some other area where there's a high
vibration<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.160> stops<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.090> USB<00:03:23.510> falling<00:03:23.990> out

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
vibration it stops the USB falling out

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.510 
vibration it stops the USB falling out
because<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.500> was<00:03:24.710> an<00:03:24.890> issue<00:03:25.130> at<00:03:25.430> the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
because that was an issue at the

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.120 
because that was an issue at the
beginning<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.630> this<00:03:26.810> hook<00:03:26.990> here<00:03:27.290> allows<00:03:27.950> you

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
beginning so this hook here allows you

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.770 
beginning so this hook here allows you
to<00:03:28.220> hold<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.520> in<00:03:28.700> but<00:03:29.180> if<00:03:29.270> you<00:03:29.360> have<00:03:29.510> one<00:03:29.690> of

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
to hold that in but if you have one of

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.380 
to hold that in but if you have one of
these<00:03:29.870> newer<00:03:30.230> USBs<00:03:31.190> all<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:31.850> need<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.090> do<00:03:32.240> is

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
these newer USBs all you need to do is

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.380 
these newer USBs all you need to do is
get<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.750> at<00:03:32.960> some<00:03:33.830> sort<00:03:34.070> of<00:03:34.130> tool<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:34.940> just

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
get it at some sort of tool and just

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.300 
get it at some sort of tool and just
break<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:36.080> off<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.470> just<00:03:36.680> snaps<00:03:36.950> straight

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
break that off it just snaps straight

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.270 
break that off it just snaps straight
off<00:03:37.460> cleanly<00:03:38.240> along<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.930> edge<00:03:39.110> so<00:03:39.920> that's<00:03:40.100> how

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
off cleanly along the edge so that's how

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.000 
off cleanly along the edge so that's how
you<00:03:40.340> use<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:41.000> get<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.240> USB<00:03:41.480> same<00:03:42.440> with<00:03:42.860> the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
you use it to get the USB same with the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.970 
you use it to get the USB same with the
USB<00:03:43.280> inside<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:43.940> here<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.660> have<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.200> it<00:03:45.800> will

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
USB inside of here you have to it will

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.670 
USB inside of here you have to it will
only<00:03:46.010> take<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.670> USB<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.300> came<00:03:47.570> with<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.260> GPS

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
only take the USB that came with the GPS

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.370 
only take the USB that came with the GPS
the<00:03:48.890> smaller<00:03:49.310> head<00:03:49.640> USB<00:03:50.150> but<00:03:50.810> now<00:03:50.990> a<00:03:51.020> lot<00:03:51.260> of

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
the smaller head USB but now a lot of

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.320 
the smaller head USB but now a lot of
these<00:03:51.470> newer<00:03:51.740> garmin<00:03:52.310> cables<00:03:52.760> have<00:03:53.150> the

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
these newer garmin cables have the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.090 
these newer garmin cables have the
bigger<00:03:53.570> head<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.050> this<00:03:54.260> actually<00:03:54.500> won't<00:03:54.830> work

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
bigger head and this actually won't work

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.970 
bigger head and this actually won't work
inside<00:03:55.640> there<00:03:55.940> so<00:03:56.540> that's<00:03:56.750> just<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:57.050> point<00:03:57.320> to

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
inside there so that's just a point to

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.640 
inside there so that's just a point to
note<00:03:58.160> but<00:03:59.030> there<00:03:59.240> you<00:03:59.330> go<00:03:59.510> putting<00:03:59.960> the<00:04:00.260> take

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
note but there you go putting the take

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.440 
note but there you go putting the take
the<00:04:00.770> gps<00:04:01.130> out<00:04:01.400> it's<00:04:01.670> just<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.090> matter<00:04:02.300> of

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
the gps out it's just a matter of

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.650 
the gps out it's just a matter of
pulling<00:04:03.230> that<00:04:03.500> knob<00:04:03.800> up<00:04:04.040> all<00:04:04.340> that<00:04:04.610> edging<00:04:05.540> up

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
pulling that knob up all that edging up

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.050 
pulling that knob up all that edging up
and<00:04:05.900> pulling<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.650> gps<00:04:07.070> out<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.610> again

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
and pulling the gps out and again

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.520 
and pulling the gps out and again
putting<00:04:08.300> it<00:04:08.420> back<00:04:08.540> in<00:04:08.780> its<00:04:08.960> just<00:04:09.110> a<00:04:09.290> clip<00:04:09.500> to

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
putting it back in its just a clip to

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.680 
putting it back in its just a clip to
get<00:04:09.800> it<00:04:09.920> in<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:10.520> it<00:04:10.580> goes<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:10.940> very<00:04:11.180> easy<00:04:11.390> but

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
get it in so it goes in very easy but

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.260 
get it in so it goes in very easy but
holds<00:04:12.200> very<00:04:12.410> secure<00:04:12.830> so<00:04:13.730> there<00:04:13.940> you<00:04:13.970> have<00:04:14.090> it

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
holds very secure so there you have it

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.820 
holds very secure so there you have it
