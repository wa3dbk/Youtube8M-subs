00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.650
 so we did not resist the invitation of the 501st 503rd Regiment of 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.920
 battle tanks nothing based on one of the largest fields of maneuvers of 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.320
 France this is where we took possession of our test vehicle 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.249
 presentations are required 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:20.049
 a big baby of 56 tons for a march order and that equips the army 

00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:23.989
 of land for almost ten years even though eighty-eight meter of london 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.609
 in three meters 71 dollars and compromise 53 2 euros its silhouette 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.780
 picked up I had the most possible to shoot as half and to be able to 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.050
 hide more easily 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.949
 it's crawler 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.040
 the cleric charles and the ultimate off-road 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.670
 I will not be 4 4 ​​owner since there are many obstacles 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.670
 natural that resists him 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.710
 the basics at its impressive mass 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.780
 but the gases it metamorphoses 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.380
 a real gazelle its top speed of 80 km hour they ensure a 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.820
 good pace especially boudou funny terrain vehicle will follow him to this 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.170
 cadence did not move us with so much agility in was the mastodon the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.140
 motor is all to say bashung 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.000
 it's a monstrous v8 diesel direct injection with a trick of 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.460
 size the regulars of turbo leave their place and the turbines 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.920
 helicopter 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.240
 the diet 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.600
 of a total moon power make his show 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 that's what gives the flair of such acceleration 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.850
 after this little 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.710
 the owners it's time to take the orders but for that it 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 must already wear the appropriate uniform 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.660
 ok ok be military this can not be improvised thanks to blood donations 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.130
 at the second stage 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.710
 I have certainly allowed driving but no license to charge so had to 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.610
 submit to simulator sessions for a small new flying lesson 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.370
 alas surprise against all odds I found myself in front of a steering wheel and 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.170
 an auto box more 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.720
 Aj auxerre 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.820
 what I felt 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.080
 mika cac 40 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.430
 sporty past after about ten minutes of this treatment 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.719
 and we do not come out exhausted 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.949
 the cgt has just opened its author 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.159
 the Prophet 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.030
 sokol hawk pressure cooker so after practice theory with a first 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.029
 draw succeed to take place on the driver's seat 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.560
 then see a terrible show livability in the nuclear 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:32.269
 once installed we find ourselves alone with his teammate are separated from 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.920
 you and the radio is not contacted the contact is undermined 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.549
 the forum has been removed 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.829
 Let's go 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.969
 more puzzling is that you only have a little white towards 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.409
 the front is another forward right and left for the walkers yesterday there 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.249
 Relatives must be trusted by radio 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:53.249
 to make a niche in these conditions is not won 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.939
 tossed around in all directions as in a big eight but mostly impressed 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.549
 by the power and the 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.260
 the idea of ​​a machine that I remind you the plague the equivalent of 60 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.009
 hugo feet 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.529
 but above all it's the ease of driving that fascinates 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.329
 in the end I did not get too bad out 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.149
 I do not even scratch the bodywork 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.449
 before the force of the accelerations and under the pressure of our soldier friends 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.449
 we evolve 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:25.689
 face the clear alain of the four most powerful caps of the moment the porsche 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.499
 cayenne s 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:32.579
 the e3 140 horsepower and two tons of on one side the 1500 horsepower and 56 tons of 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.120
 the other the ratio weight power nor basis in favor of the clear 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.120
 but this turbine could start again but the numbers 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:43.129
 3 2% off 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.389
 the power of the tank leclerc is available from the first second 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.579
 it allows to start early 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.319
 the idea that the cayenne car box is in jail and has no photo 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.749
 the cat and the article 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:56.879
 32 kilometers in five sets 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.000
 the French tank does not have to blush these are supernatural performances for 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:05.250
 such a machine is also one of the tests that will have left us the 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.469
 best memory 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.449
 some are somewhat likely people they took advantage of 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.529
 the firing exercise that follow 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:17.009
 fancher of our notebook 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.009
 we are not going to be in France 20 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.990
 so for those who would have taken a ride to the market reminds you that we 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.090
 are today 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.090
 for an aura of health recommended New Caledonia 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:34.429
 we produced
