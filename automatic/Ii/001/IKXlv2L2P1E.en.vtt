00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:47.350 

I<00:01:16.799> think<00:01:17.340> you'd<00:01:17.520> rather<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.940> another

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.970 

she<00:01:48.360> doesn't<00:01:48.840> know<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.350> think<00:01:49.440> she's

she doesn't know what to think she's

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:58.170 
she doesn't know what to think she's
like

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.240

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:37.930 

unscrew<00:02:29.240> it<00:02:29.270> maybe<00:02:30.050> it's

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:52.330

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:16.280 

it<00:03:14.000> at<00:03:15.000> least<00:03:15.210> just<00:03:15.420> shows<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.660> these<00:03:16.080> aren't

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290
