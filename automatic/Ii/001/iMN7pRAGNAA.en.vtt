00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.920
 how about my name is x and soler and god 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.700
 let's show how to make a texas with 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.699
 tie but today instead of doing 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.910
 braid the base to which the director is 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.259
 of our salon and the specialist in 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.320
 braid and have picked her up healthy and she 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.320
 is the one that is going to make this tense so 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.590
 I leave you with nothing and until the week that 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.770
 comes 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.650
 Hello, good afternoon, let's show you 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.480
 how a row braid is made today 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.450
 first we brush what is the 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.400
 hair we already have it brushed 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.900
 and now let's start 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.550
 doing 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.850
 pulling a lock in the part 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:01.150
 front of the hair we pulled a lock of 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:05.030
 hair from one side to the other 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:09.510
 a lock that is not very wide 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:13.400
 from one side of the head to the other side 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.030
 this would be the lock we left out 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.590
 As you can see, we started from one side 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.490
 the other side of the head and we leave this 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.830
 tuft outside and we started taking out a 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.180
 lock of hair 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.610
 of this side of the hair 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.410
 in three parts we started doing what 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.410
 it is the braid the braid of life 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.040
 when we reach the height of 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.110
 crown what we are going to try is to go 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.900
 lowering what is the braid for when 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.620
 we round braid to the head of 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.620
 very bottom 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.700
 now with the lock that we had removed 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:21.240
 at the beginning of the top we're going 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.200
 taking out small sections that are not 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:28.569
 very big in a few tiny sessions 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.569
 and we will go moistening the hair 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.599
 once we have the lock 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.209
 moistened hair we have it in the 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.180
 hand and now with the fork 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.349
 we introduce the fork in one of the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.310
 in one of the holes in the braids 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.849
 where we want to put the loop first 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.340
 in this case we're going to start here 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:59.740
 we would put the fork with the tip of 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.720
 the fork up 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.720
 and we would take the lock 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.420
 we would not go 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.769
 through the hollow of the fork 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.540
 with the finger inserted inside and with the 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.459
 other 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.760
 and with the other hand we push the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.319
 hairpin down with the lock with 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.090
 the lock that is left over from the part of 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.490
 Above of Arabic Chola in the loop 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.720
 we throw 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.720
 we throw slowly 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.410
 and at the same time that we throw down 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.410
 and we are also pulling 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.180
 of the upper strand 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.379
 once we got the fork out 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.220
 we will take another one 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.220
 threw out 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:44.520
 and we turn to get 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.520
 almost next to each other we've done 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:30.020
 would be better second loop and so 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.960
 successively and practically our 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.500
 braid that is this type of 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.330
 braid as you see 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:43.860
 we can leave it to one side loose or 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:47.930
 if we want we can also pick it up 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.930
 in this case we are going to pick it up today 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.060
 let's put what braid is done let's 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.060
 placing 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.529
 a little more 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.450
 step 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.450
 to be able to close 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.339
 and this would be 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.580
 this would be our braid today I hope 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.419
 who have fought 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.419
 many thanks
