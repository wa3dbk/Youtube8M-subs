 powertrain 4 plow subsoiler is 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:04.530
 the st matic 450 of the gang who zhan for 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.570
 unpack the earth 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.010
 in the same operation right behind 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.409
 eight other tractors of 320 and 330 and 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.320
 five horsepower trains 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.440
 large curtains of reversible 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.350
 also of tatoo marquesan each with 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.990
 seven aces of 45 centimeters 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.969
 depth to prepare 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.479
 primary soil and prepare only is not 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:36.009
 doing to correct the profile and is 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.969
 cotton paranÃ¡ and not feeling in the kingdom 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.609
 only right 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:42.159
 so it's not easy to prepare arraes goes there 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.200
 to deepen but not meet 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.340
 To have loss, let's go, but not how you're losing. 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.340
 there much 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.500
 the cultivation of cotton requires 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.659
 criteria at all stages including 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.829
 with the application of limestone plaster and 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.009
 fertilizers in large quantities 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.140
 what we see a lot on these machines 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.899
 in these implements is uniformity 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.910
 of this soil preparation we tried with 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.310
 other maciel implements was that 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.280
 He's right here for us in the group. 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.500
 in planning the horita group in 2013 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.849
 only here at the waist farm will be 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.849
 prepared with all these equipment 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.130
 about 7000 hectares of new areas 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.680
 for cotton planting what will 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.200
 provide the group by 2016 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.280
 the planting of about 110 thousand hectares 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.319
 of soybean cotton and also corn 17 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.470
 very proud of the work we were in 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.930
 set with the factory our seller 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.530
 all is a set only working pro 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.530
 man of the field 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.579
 in western Bahia on large farms 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.769
 which produce grain and cotton 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.989
 crop planning in all 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.530
 requires agricultural equipment 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.079
 rugged construction products with 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.720
 to provide maximum efficiency with 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.390
 productivity 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.280
 I wanted a bigger implement because the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.250
 tractors are growing 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.350
 today we have 550 horsepower there 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.840
 we do not have implements to work and 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.850
 brand has already developed this 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.100
 equipment for this type of 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.200
 then an enterprise 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.780
 very large but only carries the 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.830
 tractor that also optimizes the service 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.830
 in yield
