King<00:02:45.090> Homer<00:02:45.450> tower<00:02:45.660> again<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.650> think<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.280> just

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
King Homer tower again I think it's just

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.550 
King Homer tower again I think it's just
gonna<00:02:47.610> be<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:47.849> tower<00:02:48.180> with<00:02:48.510> King<00:02:48.840> Homer<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.380> I

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
gonna be a tower with King Homer on I

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.870 
gonna be a tower with King Homer on I
don't<00:02:49.709> think<00:02:49.769> hang<00:02:50.099> Homer<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.519> gonna<00:02:50.700> be<00:02:50.849> a

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
don't think hang Homer is gonna be a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.539 
don't think hang Homer is gonna be a
costume<00:02:51.450> or<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.810> character<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.739> any<00:02:52.890> sorts<00:02:53.370> it's

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
costume or a character of any sorts it's

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:54.800 
costume or a character of any sorts it's
definitely<00:02:53.910> not<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.030> character<00:02:54.510> because<00:02:54.690> it

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
definitely not a character because it

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.699 
definitely not a character because it
would<00:02:55.049> be<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.440> our<00:02:55.530> character<00:02:57.709> characters

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
would be in our character characters

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.449 
would be in our character characters
guide<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:01.260> probably<00:03:01.739> just<00:03:01.890> gonna<00:03:02.040> sit<00:03:02.430> up

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
guide so it's probably just gonna sit up

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.339 
guide so it's probably just gonna sit up
on<00:03:02.700> top<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.030> maybe<00:03:03.420> shoot<00:03:03.720> at<00:03:03.870> some<00:03:04.019> airplanes

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349
