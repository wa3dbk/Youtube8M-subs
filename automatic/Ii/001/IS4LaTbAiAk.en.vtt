00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.570

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.639
 There you are welcome to another jetpack. 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.580
 happened a lot this week until 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.780
 because I worked a lot has pictures 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.780
 there I work 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.330
 working hard as you can 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:29.170
 see some news came out and the most 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.119
 we have an important yes, sir and I 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.360
 Even though I did, I hope you like it. 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.290
 there is a simple thing but take the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.449
 sticker beginning with a 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.239
 Nokia that just released a tablet 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.260
 and look at this no more looks like a 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.410
 ipad 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.150
 do not come with churumelas looks like a 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.800
 ipad yes sir 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.680
 including the design is very similar to 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.670
 the new iphones these little thing 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.550
 round 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.890
 My goodness is that nokia does not have the 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.320
 same creativity than the motorola 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.229
 motorola being more creative than nokia 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.450
 the square things of nokia have never been 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.300
 there are these things more 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.390
 We did not expect this and nokia. 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.789
 ended up throwing a design is extremely 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.280
 I even did a post about it. 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:22.270
 because it's very hard on the face though 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.090
 long ago that no one copies the iPhone right 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.310
 It's interesting, let's go there nokia 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.860
 be more creative out of there motorola 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.319
 to approve in motogp moto and with a 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.209
 sensational design and looked very good is 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.920
 a beautiful gives a cell to be 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:40.569
 creative does not need to invent the wheel 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.509
 again and continue to compete 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:47.259
 samsung decided to abandon android 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.869
 calm calm is not for definitive but already 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.950
 there are rumors from a couple of years 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.099
 behind 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.929
 called a name say a name nothing 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:58.450
 commercial is very bad 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.459
 Anyway, Samsung is thinking of putting 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.039
 your system since most of the 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:05.380
 phones with android is samsung has 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.679
 thousands of models there like we already 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.959
 know samsung is not so good at this and 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.489
 this system as far as I know it is 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.260
 based on linux 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.390
 so I do not know what's happening 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.569
 with samsung and she's getting mean 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.360
 crazy and installing tejo gum glasses 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.000
 which looks like an immense helmet 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.680
 a weird thing right Please samsung 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.140
 in today's statement I would indicate 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.540
 gta5 for new generation but I think 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.980
 this is a totally 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.710
 unnecessary to be so tired of knowing 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.870
 that will have 5 ends with life with 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.240
 the control battery or end the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.160
 control battery and a very good set 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.170
 only play for hours that the program 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.790
 just launched the so-called tomahawk 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.280
 great being the alan brother who works 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.030
 with me there that indicated this program 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.380
 tomahawk flame it is the streaming of 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.500
 streaming services then you can 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.410
 register your say if the sport was yours 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.750
 last.fm your google music is really modern 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.340
 play is a beta version but is well 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.070
 interesting answer take a look there 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.500
 I recommend you take a 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.650
 program to see how it is and that's it 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.720
