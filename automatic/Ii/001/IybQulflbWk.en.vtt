and well we found a quite interesting
thing<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:14.610> figured<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:15.210> stray<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.660> really<00:00:16.080> know

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
thing we figured a stray I really know

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.740 
thing we figured a stray I really know
what<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.220> or<00:00:17.550> what<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.880> call<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.119> through

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
what it is so or what to call it through

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.880 
what it is so or what to call it through
it's<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.380> teeny<00:00:19.980> tiny<00:00:20.220> road<00:00:21.140> by<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.710> B

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
it's just teeny tiny road by the B

it's just teeny tiny road by the B
flight<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.789> check<00:00:24.000> was<00:00:24.269> kind<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.660> hidden<00:00:24.869> so

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
flight the check was kind of hidden so

yeah<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.789> has<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.449> potential<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.170> be<00:00:28.410> an

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
yeah so has the potential to be an
