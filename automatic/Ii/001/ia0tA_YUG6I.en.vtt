marshall<00:00:15.299> was<00:00:15.540> there<00:00:15.930> was<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.290> lot<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:17.210> die-hard

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
marshall was there was a lot of die-hard

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.929 
marshall was there was a lot of die-hard
fans<00:00:18.599> who<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.920> guess<00:00:20.279> were<00:00:20.490> closeted

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
fans who I guess were closeted

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.640 
fans who I guess were closeted
technicians<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:21.869> been<00:00:22.020> trying<00:00:22.380> to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
technicians that have been trying to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.670 
technicians that have been trying to
rebuild<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:24.090> amplifier<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> used<00:00:25.259> on<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
rebuild the amplifier that I used on the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.359 
rebuild the amplifier that I used on the
appetizer<00:00:26.160> destruction<00:00:26.730> back<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.060> 1986<00:00:27.810> so

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
appetizer destruction back in 1986 so

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.100 
appetizer destruction back in 1986 so
basically<00:00:29.369> they<00:00:29.820> were<00:00:29.880> trying<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.239> reinvent

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
basically they were trying to reinvent

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.590 
basically they were trying to reinvent
that<00:00:31.349> sound<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.980> their<00:00:32.130> garage<00:00:32.430> or<00:00:32.910> whatever

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
that sound in their garage or whatever

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.450 
that sound in their garage or whatever
so<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.440> thought<00:00:34.590> it'd<00:00:34.739> be<00:00:34.770> cool<00:00:34.860> as<00:00:35.310> if

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
so I just thought it'd be cool as if

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.970 
so I just thought it'd be cool as if
Marshall<00:00:35.970> actually<00:00:36.390> reproduced<00:00:37.079> an<00:00:37.320> AM<00:00:37.500> that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
Marshall actually reproduced an AM that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.150 
Marshall actually reproduced an AM that
was<00:00:38.309> basically<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.360> derivative<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.410> whatever

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
was basically a derivative of whatever

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.460 
was basically a derivative of whatever
it<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.700> was<00:00:41.820> using<00:00:41.970> 86<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:42.990> I<00:00:43.020> did<00:00:43.140> was

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
it was I was using 86 so what I did was

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.470 
it was I was using 86 so what I did was
I<00:00:43.620> got<00:00:43.740> together<00:00:43.920> Santiago<00:00:44.790> over<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.060> Marshall

who's their chief designer and I said

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.130 
who's their chief designer and I said
you<00:00:48.330> know<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.570> gonna<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.960> I'm<00:00:49.080> gonna

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
produce the actual tracks off of the

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.050 
produce the actual tracks off of the
appetite<00:00:52.680> record<00:00:53.040> the<00:00:53.130> guitar<00:00:53.400> tracks<00:00:53.700> so<00:00:53.970> you

can<00:00:54.150> get<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.780> good<00:00:54.900> idea<00:00:55.200> of<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:55.470> that

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
can get a really good idea of what that

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.590 
can get a really good idea of what that
amp<00:00:55.800> sounds<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.580> even<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.210> me<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.480> was

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
amp sounds like and even for me it was

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.480 
amp sounds like and even for me it was
an<00:00:57.720> interesting<00:00:57.960> process<00:00:58.380> cuz<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.040> got<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
an interesting process cuz we got the

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.690 
an interesting process cuz we got the
the<00:00:59.940> naked<00:01:00.360> tracks<00:01:00.630> from<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.200> Masters<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.100> I

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
the naked tracks from the Masters and I

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.240 
the naked tracks from the Masters and I
got<00:01:03.150> a<00:01:03.180> night<00:01:03.930> train<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.739> welcome<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
got a night train and welcome to the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.870 
got a night train and welcome to the
jungle<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.979> think<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> other<00:01:08.189> song<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
jungle and I think the other song was a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.819 
jungle and I think the other song was a
rock<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> queen<00:01:09.869> or<00:01:09.900> sweet<00:01:10.500> child<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.770> mine

rock a queen or sweet child of mine
something<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.090> does<00:01:12.359> have<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
something like that and it does have a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.700 
something like that and it does have a
certain<00:01:13.649> particular<00:01:14.189> kind<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.210> mid-range

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
certain particular kind of mid-range

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.919 
certain particular kind of mid-range
gain<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.340> that's<00:01:17.609> that's<00:01:18.179> sort<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.569> unique

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:18.929 
gain to it that's that's sort of unique

you know Santiago and I got together and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.669 
you know Santiago and I got together and
started<00:01:21.569> to<00:01:21.659> really<00:01:21.869> focus<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.530> these

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
started to really focus on these

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.489 
started to really focus on these
characteristics<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.179> then<00:01:24.869> he<00:01:25.049> went<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.350> work

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:25.499 
characteristics and then he went to work

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:27.770 
characteristics and then he went to work
you<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.219> in<00:01:26.520> Hong<00:01:26.759> Kong<00:01:26.789> try<00:01:27.389> to<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
you know in Hong Kong try to get this

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.840 
you know in Hong Kong try to get this
thing<00:01:27.990> together<00:01:28.139> and<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.829> fortunately<00:01:29.429> I<00:01:29.579> had<00:01:29.819> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
thing together and I fortunately I had a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.239 
thing together and I fortunately I had a
tour<00:01:30.149> through<00:01:30.420> Asia<00:01:30.749> at<00:01:31.139> one<00:01:31.350> point<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.859> then

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.249 
tour through Asia at one point and then

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:33.950 
tour through Asia at one point and then
he<00:01:32.280> would<00:01:32.549> bring<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> app<00:01:33.060> over<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.749> would

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
he would bring the app over and I would

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
he would bring the app over and I would
tweak<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.499> it<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.859> know<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.670> use<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.030> for

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
tweak on it you know and we use it for

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.609 
tweak on it you know and we use it for
some<00:01:36.329> shows<00:01:36.569> and<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.899> figure<00:01:37.139> out<00:01:37.259> what<00:01:37.439> was

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
some shows and I figure out what was

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.440 
some shows and I figure out what was
right<00:01:37.889> about<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.459> that<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.579> would<00:01:38.819> send<00:01:39.299> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
right about it and that I would send it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
right about it and that I would send it
back<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.959> went<00:01:40.229> through<00:01:40.319> this<00:01:40.799> all

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
back and we went through this all

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.800 
back and we went through this all
through<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.549> tour<00:01:41.969> all<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.359> way<00:01:42.539> until<00:01:42.749> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
through that tour all the way until the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.449 
through that tour all the way until the
tour<00:01:43.079> was<00:01:43.229> over<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.619> finally<00:01:44.009> got<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.429> a

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
tour was over we finally got it to a

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.849 
tour was over we finally got it to a
place<00:01:44.759> where<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.179> sounded<00:01:45.539> identical<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.409> to

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
place where it sounded identical to to

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.609 
place where it sounded identical to to
the<00:01:47.009> actual<00:01:47.310> FD<00:01:48.179> sound<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.749> so<00:01:48.990> at<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.380> point

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the actual FD sound and so at this point

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.590 
the actual FD sound and so at this point
I'm<00:01:49.920> using<00:01:50.249> that<00:01:50.579> amp<00:01:50.789> on<00:01:50.999> the<00:01:51.119> road<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.539> I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600

a little bit an octave pedal which is
something<00:04:52.659> that<00:04:52.930> I<00:04:52.990> use<00:04:53.370> on<00:04:54.370> this<00:04:54.610> newest

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
which is something that is I actually

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.719 
which is something that is I actually
have<00:05:05.409> a<00:05:05.560> wallet<00:05:05.860> pedal<00:05:06.190> with<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.310> distortion

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
have a wallet pedal with a distortion

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.570 
have a wallet pedal with a distortion
switch<00:05:07.720> on<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:08.380> we<00:05:08.919> tried<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.159> sort<00:05:09.490> of

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
switch on it so we tried to sort of

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.909 
switch on it so we tried to sort of
recreate<00:05:09.909> all<00:05:10.240> those<00:05:10.449> possibilities<00:05:11.020> just

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
recreate all those possibilities just

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.589 
recreate all those possibilities just
and<00:05:12.130> then<00:05:12.219> you<00:05:12.340> can<00:05:12.460> augment<00:05:12.789> that<00:05:12.909> with<00:05:13.060> you
