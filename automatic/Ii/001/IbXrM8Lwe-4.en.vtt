00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 hi i am mireia i hope you are very 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.589
 well the tutorial today is a 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.540
 collaboration with alejandra ezquerro 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.040
 we will make some bracelets that we 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.040
 will show what to combine 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.670
 for the first bracelet we will make 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.500
 we're going to need a strip like this one 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.779
 I have the exact name on one side has 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.770
 fabric and other plastic sells for 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.140
 metro in jewelry stores 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.140
 we will also need some brooches or 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.640
 staples like these we will put one in each 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.100
 extreme and we will crush it with some 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.230
 clamps to fix it 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.190
 then we will place a ring and a 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.629
 hook at one end 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.629
 and in the other only one ring 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.719
 we can decorate it with some details and 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.719
 Sew them with transparent thread 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.829
 for the second idea we will make a bracelet 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.600
 of balls with elastic we are going to 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.910
 need rings and some small pickets 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.199
 long we will place the small 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.040
 the rings and we'll put them 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.040
 interleaved 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.159
 we will stay like this for the next 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.020
 bracelet we will use several elastic 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.930
 colors and a thick chain point or 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.430
 we can recycle some pieces 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.560
 we will cut two elastic strips of 20 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.270
 centimeters and the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.830
 we will go through one of the extremes of 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.830
 this way to make a knot 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.100
 we will do the same on the other side 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.380
 we will make a knot that next to the two 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.630
 ends and we'll pass a lighter through 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.490
 the tips so that they do not fall apart and 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.920
 you will be ready you can follow the same 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.380
 steps with other pieces for the next 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.600
 idea we will use wire we will cut about 7 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.549
 centimeters approximately and we will double 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.760
 one of the tips with a pair of tweezers 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.890
 kind 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.120
 then we will place in some pebbles or 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.120
 the accessories that you want 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.280
 and we will fold it again in the other 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.800
 end with tweezers now we will 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.750
 to a chain then we will place in one of 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.850
 the ends a ring and a hook and 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.560
 in the other only one ring and ready there 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.270
