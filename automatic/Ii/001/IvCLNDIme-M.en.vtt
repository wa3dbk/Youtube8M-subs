00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.649
 very good to all friends we are here 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.990
 with a new party of bobby fischer 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:09.990
 let's start this section with 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.269
 Thumbnails of wingstop precisely to 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.860
 game against rivera frees me 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.960
 game in white and wifis the game in 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.660
 blacks of four by the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.900
 white and the good of fisher meeting 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.210
 horse face on this occasion of 4 many 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 Sometimes I played g6 to practice 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.880
 Indian defense of King his favorite defense 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.510
 but this time he played 6 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.790
 and fast we get to nimzoindia defense 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:39.329
 defense of the strongest against pawn 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.309
 of lady and decided to make the play 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.360
 from 5 to 3 at this time the black is 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.699
 forced to make a decision that is or 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.129
 well take or rewind golf at the end and 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.579
 bobby fischer decides to take but the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.800
 typical reaction of playing 5 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.809
 pressing the center on everything 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.940
 blocking the folded goods of the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.630
 white well the white decided 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.549
 develop and very difficult takes the pawn 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.060
 24 forcing the bishop to move once 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.979
 more I want continued in its development 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.710
 well obviously we are launching in 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.329
 some time play sports 4 and in the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.860
 case of that challenge pand me bishop 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:20.869
 it would be loose 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.500
 so he decides to remove ribera to the field 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.090
 bird 3rd first player 6 played very 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.250
 interesting and that fisher had a few 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.799
 hidden interests and already an approach 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.719
 very well executed later 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.640
 during the game we go because 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.300
 White develops to castle 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.880
 blacks and bishop b2 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.740
 if it is the film tried to develop by 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.540
 this diagonal but the truth is that neither 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.480
 is no future that develops its 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.390
 horse castling looks at a play well 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.920
 It seems that it is not very interesting 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.500
 part of Bobby Fischer since they put a 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.780
 horse in that 5 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.190
 on the edge of the board is the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.700
 best moves there are but it's 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.380
 touching the bishop of b3 and not only that 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.060
 but it has a hidden combination 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.880
 that we will see later recorded 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.160
 in the game obviously a play in 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.540
 would have been to remove the bishop however 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.740
 ribera decided to continue developing and 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.550
 bobby fischer there is a play 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.530
 with a master plan to the film 7 do not see 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.990
 absolutely nothing to shore any 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.120
 danger 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.800
 that you could take it out and therefore 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.260
 decides to place the tower in it 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.480
 column that the lady which can never 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.280
 be bad since it deserves any kind of 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.680
 combination when changing the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.540
 pawns whose minimal extraordinary move 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.680
 by two difficult that gives you give 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:49.280
 the game simply gives more than six 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.920
 checkmate threat and now I do not know if you see 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.540
 try to see why back 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.180
 efe 3 bobby fischer mana the game 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.060
 you have seen it we are going to the resolution 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.280
 of exercise but to stop and think a 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.340
 little bit and it's 5.95 just be 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.769
 doubly playing the bishop of b3 and 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.349
 bishop of b2 is loose therefore 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.540
 even if I remove the bishop I'm just going 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.370
 fisher captures the other bishop who is 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.340
 loose and the lady is going to be able to escape 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.409
 so ribera decided to leave in the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.090
 miniature would catch bobby raise 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.580
 fischer later we will do more 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.290
 thumbnail videos about the libor e 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.780
 I will try to upload more videos a rise 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.360
 lately I'm quite asleep but 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.069
 the interesting thing is after this play a 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.900
 straight up officer horse of me 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.030
 absolutely thought that if you are going to 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.700
 castle his rival and will seek the attack 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.010
 double over the bishop in the event that 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.890
 not the bishop withdrew and retired 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.720
 So here comes 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.660
 the movement polls great of what 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.360
 difficult that is pin 7 the threat of 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.030
 attack and the truth of two pieces you have to 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.410
 be very careful with having pieces 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.270
 unprotected and this is a part of 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.069
 that explained a lot in my classes 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.840
 since the bishop of v2 we are 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.420
 unprotected that you have to be protected 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.290
 this combination would have given us this way 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.730
 that nothing friends I hope that I have 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.370
 liked this miniature please
