unfortunately<00:01:10.950> though<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> catalog<00:01:11.760> this

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
unfortunately though in the catalog this

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.340 
unfortunately though in the catalog this
year<00:01:12.150> there<00:01:12.330> weren't<00:01:12.540> any<00:01:12.659> school<00:01:13.020> or<00:01:13.140> kid

year there weren't any school or kid

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.800

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
think it's so I decided to design my own

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.410

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
example of one so I've designed two sets

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.420

each one each covering again a variety

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160 
each one each covering again a variety
of<00:01:35.310> different<00:01:35.490> themes<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.630> use<00:01:36.869> these
