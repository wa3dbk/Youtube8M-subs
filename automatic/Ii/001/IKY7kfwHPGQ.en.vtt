40k<00:00:30.420> now<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.289> he<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.710> definitely<00:00:32.250> worth

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
40k now so he is definitely worth

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.130 
40k now so he is definitely worth

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
haven't tried a Valbuena you wouldn't

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.289 
haven't tried a Valbuena you wouldn't
you<00:01:13.979> would<00:01:14.100> think<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:15.030> what

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you would think this is what

you would think this is what
trust<00:01:15.960> me<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.530> you'll<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.130> so

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
trust me on this one you'll see in so

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.070 
trust me on this one you'll see in so
many<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.610> these<00:01:17.729> clips<00:01:18.090> how<00:01:18.450> defenders<00:01:18.960> are

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
many of these clips how defenders are

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.690 
many of these clips how defenders are
having<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.500> very<00:01:19.740> difficult<00:01:19.979> time<00:01:20.220> trying<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
having a very difficult time trying to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.969 
having a very difficult time trying to
defend<00:01:21.060> against<00:01:21.330> him<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.659> I'm<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.650> sure<00:01:22.770> if<00:01:22.890> I

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
defend against him and I'm not sure if I

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.499 
defend against him and I'm not sure if I
should<00:01:23.009> call<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.549> dribbling<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.330> comes

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
should call it dribbling when it comes

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.330 
should call it dribbling when it comes
down<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> second<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.439> Valbuena<00:01:25.770> I'm

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
down to second in for Valbuena I'm

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.130 
down to second in for Valbuena I'm
thinking<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.759> calling<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.240> magic<00:01:27.840> because

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
thinking of calling it magic because

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.719 
thinking of calling it magic because
this<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.770> guy<00:01:28.979> creates<00:01:29.430> when<00:01:29.610> he's

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
this is what this guy creates when he's

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.109 
this is what this guy creates when he's
on<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> ball<00:01:30.259> he<00:01:31.340> defenders<00:01:32.340> try<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.640> tackle

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
on the ball he defenders try to tackle

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.960 
on the ball he defenders try to tackle
him<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.630> he<00:01:33.810> instantly<00:01:34.310> recovers<00:01:35.310> because<00:01:35.850> he

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
him and he instantly recovers because he

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.440 
him and he instantly recovers because he
has<00:01:36.090> 99<00:01:36.509> reactions<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.380> 97<00:01:38.310> balance<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:38.970> you

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
has 99 reactions and 97 balance so you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.090 
has 99 reactions and 97 balance so you
