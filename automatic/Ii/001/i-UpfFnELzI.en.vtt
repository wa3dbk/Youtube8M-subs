 sense what 's up to win and indeed 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.140
 a while not out, but still 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.420
 already here in advance there are two dvds and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.790
 two blu-rays to place beyond the pines 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.350
 with Ryan Gosling with Bradley Cooper 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.580
 many other known faces but 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.869
 especially the story of one 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.659
 Policeman trying a man 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.159
 chase after the criminal 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.360
 is going to provide for his family without 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.770
 the topic is always the same 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.860
 in the film, however, it is mainly taken up 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.210
 here in a drama thriller flows into the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.950
 I found the trailer a bit crazy 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.540
 lead because the film is lengthy but 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.710
 good and then raffle 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.780
 to participate in the comments 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.210
 robert i think bradley cooper or 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.009
 robert i will gosling for a ryan 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.810
 to have the better career of both 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.399
 because and then you write something believed 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.049
 which of both has the nose in front 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.630
 or in the long run the bigger one 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.070
 actor will be both 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.390
 certainly not quite so fast away 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.310
 Both of them would be from the window 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.539
 already like to both have great 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.039
 career probably before him he will 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.270

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.450

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.980
 I here are three blu-rays and three dvd 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.190

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.680
 bonus material on the blu ray and dvd 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:48.350

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.129

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.310
 hard here it is heavy booklet in it 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.010

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.840
 which follow the procedure of adolf 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.250

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.690
 with their view of the total 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.519
 totalitarian regime in the second world war 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.200
 but above all as they too 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.569
 part sympathizes or the truth 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.010
 tries to explore very many 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.570
 hostile people 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.889
 had to face and for that 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.880
 had to hold the one and 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.320
 German movie award cleared 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.840
