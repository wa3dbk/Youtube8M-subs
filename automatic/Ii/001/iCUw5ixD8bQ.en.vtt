00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.309 

okay<00:00:02.149> this<00:00:03.149> video<00:00:03.510> I'm<00:00:03.570> going<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.840> show<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.290> I

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
okay this video I'm going to show how I

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.570 
okay this video I'm going to show how I
make<00:00:04.910> a<00:00:06.859> pee-pee<00:00:07.859> hinges<00:00:08.429> or<00:00:08.849> hinging<00:00:10.580> until

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
make a pee-pee hinges or hinging until

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.080 
make a pee-pee hinges or hinging until
so<00:00:11.849> surface<00:00:12.570> s<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.200> upp<00:00:15.710> here<00:00:16.710> we<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.160> my

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
so surface s on upp here we have my

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.470 
so surface s on upp here we have my
soldering<00:00:18.779> station<00:00:22.430> with<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> triangular<00:00:24.240> tip

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
soldering station with a triangular tip

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.660 
soldering station with a triangular tip
I<00:00:26.630> don't<00:00:27.630> know<00:00:27.720> if<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.900> can<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.670> here's

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
I don't know if you can see it here's

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:38.209 
I don't know if you can see it here's
the<00:00:29.789> light<00:00:33.079> it<00:00:34.079> has<00:00:34.579> two<00:00:35.579> notches<00:00:37.219> for

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the light it has two notches for

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.119 
the light it has two notches for
different<00:00:38.640> form<00:00:38.969> thicknesses<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:42.829> come<00:00:43.829> down

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
different form thicknesses and come down

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:53.229 
different form thicknesses and come down
here<00:00:48.469> basically<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:51.180> idea<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.600> superb<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
here basically the idea is superb the

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.410 
here basically the idea is superb the
nudge<00:00:54.239> against<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.289> edge<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> ruler

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
nudge against the edge of the ruler

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.139 
nudge against the edge of the ruler
metal<00:00:57.420> ruler<00:00:57.660> or<00:00:58.020> something<00:00:58.410> similar<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> it

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
metal ruler or something similar so it

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.990 
metal ruler or something similar so it
can<00:01:00.300> slide<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.100> use<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> guide<00:01:04.850> as<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
can slide and we use it as a guide as I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.289 
can slide and we use it as a guide as I
said<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.450> make<00:01:07.080> too<00:01:07.320> much<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:08.490> this

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
said I make too much this on this

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.090 
said I make too much this on this
particular<00:01:09.960> cell<00:01:10.140> using<00:01:11.180> files<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.720> this

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
particular cell using files like this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.410 
particular cell using files like this
small<00:01:14.100> file<00:01:16.189> Saints<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.280> say<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:18.000> guess

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
small file Saints that say this I guess

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.550 
small file Saints that say this I guess
it's<00:01:18.570> made<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.930> copper<00:01:20.630> it's<00:01:21.630> fairly<00:01:21.930> easy<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
it's made of copper it's fairly easy to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.170 
it's made of copper it's fairly easy to
do

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
do

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.070 
do
now<00:01:24.180> I've<00:01:24.270> already<00:01:24.390> tested<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.680> tape<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:27.080> six

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
now I've already tested this tape on six

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.270 
now I've already tested this tape on six
millimeter<00:01:29.240> epp<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:31.560> idea<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.250> don't

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
millimeter epp the idea is that we don't

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.399 
millimeter epp the idea is that we don't
go<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.790> way<00:01:32.939> through<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:35.369> EPP<00:01:35.820> otherwise

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
go all the way through the EPP otherwise

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.399 
go all the way through the EPP otherwise
we<00:01:37.409> don't<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.710> any<00:01:38.659> hinging<00:01:39.659> at<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:39.960> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
we don't have any hinging at all and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.190 
we don't have any hinging at all and
we'll<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.710> go<00:01:40.890> through<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> let's<00:01:43.049> get

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
we'll just go through it so let's get

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.130 
we'll just go through it so let's get
please<00:01:43.409> wanna<00:01:43.590> go<00:01:44.270> put<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> tip<00:01:45.600> against<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
please wanna go put the tip against the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.649 
please wanna go put the tip against the
ruler<00:01:47.090> 200<00:01:48.090> degrees<00:01:48.420> we'll<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.350> go<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.740> it

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
ruler 200 degrees we'll just go for it

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:00.359 
ruler 200 degrees we'll just go for it
snarling<00:01:56.939> that's<00:01:58.500> wipe<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.680> tip<00:01:59.830> off<00:02:00.040> so<00:02:00.280> I

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
snarling that's wipe the tip off so I

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:07.139 
snarling that's wipe the tip off so I
don't<00:02:00.549> bring<00:02:00.820> these<00:02:01.090> fumes<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:05.790> here<00:02:06.790> we<00:02:06.970> have

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
don't bring these fumes and here we have

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:16.229 
don't bring these fumes and here we have
it<00:02:09.330> we<00:02:10.330> still<00:02:10.539> have<00:02:10.840> very<00:02:12.270> little<00:02:14.370> maybe<00:02:15.370> half

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
it we still have very little maybe half

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:23.729 
it we still have very little maybe half
a<00:02:16.420> millimeter<00:02:17.100> EPP<00:02:21.510> abscissa<00:02:22.680> there's<00:02:23.680> a

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
a millimeter EPP abscissa there's a

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.960 
a millimeter EPP abscissa there's a
hinge<00:02:23.980> there<00:02:24.840> feel<00:02:25.840> strong<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:29.130> would<00:02:30.130> maybe

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
hinge there feel strong I would maybe

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.100 
hinge there feel strong I would maybe
make<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.620> bit<00:02:33.480> less<00:02:34.480> gift<00:02:34.810> actually<00:02:36.989> so<00:02:37.989> we

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
make it a bit less gift actually so we

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.530 
make it a bit less gift actually so we
have<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:39.250> I'm<00:02:39.730> gonna<00:02:39.910> make<00:02:40.090> another<00:02:40.120> one<00:02:40.420> and

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
have so I'm gonna make another one and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.090 
have so I'm gonna make another one and
this<00:02:40.720> time<00:02:40.780> I'm<00:02:41.080> going<00:02:41.319> to<00:02:42.299> incline<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.870> tip

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.430 

at<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.160> greater<00:02:48.459> angle<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.450> don't<00:02:51.930> go<00:02:52.930> as<00:02:53.140> far

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
at a greater angle so I don't go as far

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.949 
at a greater angle so I don't go as far
down<00:02:54.840> maybe<00:02:55.840> like<00:02:56.079> this<00:02:57.180> yeah<00:02:58.180> that's<00:02:58.420> better

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
down maybe like this yeah that's better

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.130 
down maybe like this yeah that's better
I<00:03:00.959> find<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.140> system<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:04.299> gives<00:03:04.570> me<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.780> greater

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
I find this system it gives me a greater

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.640 
I find this system it gives me a greater
control<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:05.950> accuracy<00:03:06.630> than<00:03:07.630> using<00:03:08.640> ordinary

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
control on accuracy than using ordinary

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.000 
control on accuracy than using ordinary
knives<00:03:11.650> like<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.840> special<00:03:13.840> on<00:03:14.530> EPP

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
knives like this special on EPP

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.430 
knives like this special on EPP
synthesis<00:03:15.760> it's<00:03:16.540> not<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:16.870> easy<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.230> cut

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
synthesis it's not so easy to cut

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.180 
synthesis it's not so easy to cut
through<00:03:18.750> material<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:20.350> one<00:03:20.560> has<00:03:20.859> come<00:03:21.040> out

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
through material this one has come out

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.259 
through material this one has come out
quite<00:03:21.430> good<00:03:21.989> we<00:03:22.989> have<00:03:23.140> more<00:03:23.380> material<00:03:23.530> now<00:03:24.269> I'm

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
quite good we have more material now I'm

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.670 
quite good we have more material now I'm
still<00:03:25.690> pretty<00:03:26.560> easy<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:27.190> bend<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:29.290> this

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
still pretty easy to bend and this

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.509 
still pretty easy to bend and this
technique<00:03:30.040> could<00:03:30.190> be<00:03:30.250> used<00:03:30.370> obviously<00:03:30.730> to

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
technique could be used obviously to

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.400 
technique could be used obviously to
bend<00:03:33.519> that<00:03:33.760> front<00:03:34.060> in<00:03:34.510> different<00:03:34.930> shapes<00:03:35.170> like

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
bend that front in different shapes like

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.400 
bend that front in different shapes like
this<00:03:35.560> perhaps<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:37.570> just

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
this perhaps and just

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:49.470 
this perhaps and just
glue<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:40.030> on<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.780> channels<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:43.750> once<00:03:44.750> more

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:04:01.230 

that'll<00:03:50.480> do<00:03:50.780> for<00:03:51.110> today<00:03:53.080> start<00:03:54.080> from<00:03:54.320> outside

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.050 

okay<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:03.550> really<00:04:03.850> is<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.480> existing<00:04:04.930> obviously

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
okay it really is the existing obviously

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.370 
okay it really is the existing obviously
if<00:04:07.060> you've<00:04:07.300> never<00:04:07.480> done<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:07.750> before

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
if you've never done it before

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.930 
if you've never done it before
obviously<00:04:09.540> practice<00:04:10.540> on<00:04:10.720> some<00:04:10.960> scrap<00:04:11.940> and

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
obviously practice on some scrap and

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:22.920 
obviously practice on some scrap and
there<00:04:13.120> you<00:04:13.210> go<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:15.780> said<00:04:21.240> this<00:04:22.240> this<00:04:22.600> is<00:04:22.750> how<00:04:22.900> I

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
there you go I said this this is how I

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.790 
there you go I said this this is how I
prefer<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.590> do<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.830> hinges<00:04:24.190> now<00:04:24.370> really

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
prefer to do the hinges now really

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.500 
prefer to do the hinges now really
particularly<00:04:26.800> non<00:04:27.100> EPP<00:04:27.640> Zeppelin<00:04:28.210> as<00:04:28.330> well

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
particularly non EPP Zeppelin as well

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.530 
particularly non EPP Zeppelin as well
although<00:04:28.810> their<00:04:29.110> form<00:04:29.290> is<00:04:29.380> not<00:04:29.560> so<00:04:29.800> flexible

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
although their form is not so flexible

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.900 
although their form is not so flexible
and<00:04:31.540> eventually<00:04:32.470> may<00:04:32.650> crack<00:04:32.980> so<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.490> tend<00:04:33.850> to

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
and eventually may crack so I tend to

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.380 
and eventually may crack so I tend to
use<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.150> strong<00:04:34.510> type<00:04:34.780> on<00:04:34.960> them<00:04:35.290> as<00:04:35.440> well<00:04:36.210> but<00:04:37.210> I

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
use a strong type on them as well but I

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.340 
use a strong type on them as well but I
I<00:04:38.200> do<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.740> channels<00:04:39.100> like<00:04:39.310> this<00:04:40.110> as<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.290> said

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
I do the channels like this as I said

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.630 
I do the channels like this as I said
because<00:04:44.790> they<00:04:45.790> just<00:04:45.940> come<00:04:46.210> out<00:04:46.240> really<00:04:46.660> nice

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
because they just come out really nice

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.580 
because they just come out really nice
I'm<00:04:48.640> not<00:04:48.850> sure<00:04:49.120> how<00:04:49.300> many<00:04:49.360> degrees<00:04:49.690> that<00:04:50.110> would

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
I'm not sure how many degrees that would

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.940 
I'm not sure how many degrees that would
be<00:04:50.650> but<00:04:51.480> that<00:04:52.480> seems<00:04:52.780> plenty<00:04:53.260> for<00:04:53.410> most<00:04:53.560> claims

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
be but that seems plenty for most claims

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.070 
be but that seems plenty for most claims
for<00:04:54.280> example<00:04:54.370> ooh<00:04:55.650> that's<00:04:56.650> their<00:04:56.980> maximum

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
for example ooh that's their maximum

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.390 
for example ooh that's their maximum
obviously<00:04:59.080> that<00:04:59.440> way<00:04:59.620> we<00:04:59.770> can<00:04:59.950> go<00:05:00.100> further

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
obviously that way we can go further

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.060 
obviously that way we can go further
that<00:05:01.320> would<00:05:02.320> be<00:05:02.470> probably<00:05:02.740> 45<00:05:03.400> degrees<00:05:03.730> maybe

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
that would be probably 45 degrees maybe

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.720 
that would be probably 45 degrees maybe
okay<00:05:06.070> guys<00:05:06.280> thank<00:05:06.850> you<00:05:06.910> for<00:05:07.060> watching<00:05:08.550> bye<00:05:09.550> for

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
okay guys thank you for watching bye for

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.760 
okay guys thank you for watching bye for
