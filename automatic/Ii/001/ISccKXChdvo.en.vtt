look good so all you have to really do

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980 
look good so all you have to really do
is<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.670> make<00:01:08.850> sure<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.390> color<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.869> very

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
is just make sure that the color is very

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.170 
is just make sure that the color is very
pigmented<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:11.130> feel<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.580> kind<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.939> need<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
pigmented I feel like you kind of need a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.050 
pigmented I feel like you kind of need a
thick<00:01:12.720> eyeshadow<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.490> thin<00:01:14.640> eyeshadow

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
thick eyeshadow a really thin eyeshadow

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.880 
thick eyeshadow a really thin eyeshadow
might<00:01:15.360> work<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:15.810> it'll<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.140> take<00:01:16.590> more

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
might work but it'll just take more

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.219 
might work but it'll just take more
layers<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.790> apply<00:01:18.150> main<00:01:18.450> reason<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:18.900> using

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
layers to apply main reason I like using

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.109 
layers to apply main reason I like using
this<00:01:19.439> technique<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:20.970> get

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
this technique is because you can get

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.880 
this technique is because you can get
the<00:01:21.270> effect<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.840> dyeing<00:01:22.259> your<00:01:22.439> hair<00:01:22.500> without
