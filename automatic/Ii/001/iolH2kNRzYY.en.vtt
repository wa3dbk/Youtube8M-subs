 very good two kids here of matron 

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:08.099
 and we're in a new minecraft video 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.019
 with a tutorial that a subscriber has 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.019
 asked and that I know that many of you 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.329
 you may like it because it really is useful 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.310
 and apart is a decorative element that 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.920
 I love it and well what it is about 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.990
 It's about a port, a port 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.270
 simple and that good 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.599
 they just need the resources that I have in 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:33.210
 the hand that are they are pistons in 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:37.510
 repetitive woods a redstone lever 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.239
 water and berries pretty simple and to 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.050
 love it worth here we have an example of 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.050
 one that I have done 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.480
 it works like this so it can come out and so 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:54.590
 follow raval I'll do an equal here 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:57.200
 worth nothing let's start is pretty 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:04.990
 simple we have to 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:08.320
 open three wide and three long 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.320
 and good 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.640
 to later not be changing and if 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.690
 maybe I touch the structure because I 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.450
 I know 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.390
 and well let's cover here is so that 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.770
 do not enter the water 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.100
 perfect 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.820
 work here all the boxes of is of 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.820
 3 x 3 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.700
 I'm going to open here because the circles 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.039
 times the dies 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.799
 I do not know how I do it but they give me very 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.259
 wrong and who says that I'm good at that 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.429
 lie is fatal to me let's start 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.929
 hanging pistons like that and so here they 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.990
 it's because they wanted to live in the 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:00.360
 bays are going to put right 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:05.659
 and we are going to place the repeaters by 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.289
 each gun the rest like this 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.800
 here would be where we would put the lever 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:15.350
 I'm going to drive it like this for when I'm not 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.780
 do the function 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.440
 it works 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.840
 you see now we will begin the process of 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.840
 covered without such 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.980
 but it works correctly it has worked 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.370
 the pier made the port and if I stay 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.670
 smaller than the other that says good 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.580
 It is also that 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.370
 another one that I did I made it stronger that 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.370
 has easy solution to the shit 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.260
 in order there must be a failure always 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.020
 nothing and now I return I have solved 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:16.050
 we see that it works and that we lack more 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.050
 strong put our boat has been 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.370
 the wide 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.230
 boat has finally commented to 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.709
 principle that had to have decorated 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.500
 before because I know how it usually happens 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.080
 well then to finish we put the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.430
 boat we ride we open the 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:43.239
 gates and we're going to sunbathe 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.360
 I hope you liked the tutorial and 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.820
 well you see that it is quite simple 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.690
 and nothing but leave me a layman a 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:56.850
 comment that you follow me on twitter nothing 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.850
 guys until the next video bye bye
