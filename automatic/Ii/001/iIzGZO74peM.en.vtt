 famous brand nike 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.120
 now let's remember how it appeared 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.520
 adidas 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.330

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.910
 Becca to the dump and filled the old 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.180

 and we will run around the field so will play 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.870
 . 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.380
 great idea then let's have one more 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:47.590
 our slipper will draw two strips 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.780
 see the first strip of this you 2 diarrhea and 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.210
 melted away 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.350
 not going to make my own 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:00.130
 film and call it puma puma 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:04.480
 then how not to call your company adolf 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.840
 Dassler from and to 100 I will name my firms 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.700
 adidas whatever you want calls only promise 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.840
 I never take ours 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.180
 branded in strips well i won't 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.310
 use our courses 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.319
 [music] 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.380
 listen here i'm german and 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:30.140
 you are there then why you 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.420
 Asian Thai can be despite the fact 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.860
 what appeared on iq later like this 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.110
 it is pulled forward 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.850
 outsider i'm leaving champions away 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.890
 behind all financial indicators 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.800
 nike is leading now 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.780
 but does that mean it's better in 2012 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.319
 year net profit amounted to 2 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.480
 a half a billion dollars and here 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.340
 succeed a little less than a half billion 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.620
 while nike manages to invest 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.690
 about 2 billion dollars annually in 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.730
 its technical developments while 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.209
 adidas only spend a billion 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.209
 dollars. 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.080
 Well, the numbers they can certainly not 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.269
 accurate but everything suggests that 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.850
 technology nayk is still better than u 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.590
 adidas take for example the same nike + if 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.569
 do you have sneakers with this technology a 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.200
 also iphone or ipod then you can 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.340
 install the nike + ipod application and 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.010
 see for example how much you ran 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.590
 and at what speed did you have 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.419
 pulse and many many other parameters a 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.520
 also upload it all to the website 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.440
 on their plus dot com how to do it 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.850
 other 5 million users 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.820
 adidas also have this technology 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.960
 called my coach and 100 she along with 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.479
 by samsung 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.700
 but still easier than before thought of 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.650
 nike and apple advertising campaign and 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.479
 good finance allocation too 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.520
 plays a significant role in the success of the company 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.680
 so for example adidas make an angle on that 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.810
 that sponsors the whole team de 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.729
 major championships she tries them 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.710
 sponsor individual athletes 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.720
 and it was this move that made the team 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.550
 world famous after she 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.650
 began to sponsor michael jordan 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.900
 absolutely everyone wanted air sneakers 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.590
 jordan just like him and who sponsors 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.289
 adidas 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.110
 I honestly only know david beckham 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.789
 for a lifetime contract with adidas adidas 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.229
 in general it is somehow very strange to select 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.350
 myself athletes here I have 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:18.570
 some 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:22.130
 badges everyone knew but that's who all 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.790
 who are all these people who are you 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.460
 single sponsorship 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.110
 athletes brings an unprecedented income but 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.150
 and sponsoring such large 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.580
 events like olympic 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.530
 games also bring a high income hundred 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.740
 only difference is that sponsor such 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.990
 activities more costly with a little 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.850
 profit you are not at all reasonable statistics 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.170
 profit shows that nike is better 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.450
 manage with your finances 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.510
 but what about advertising company slogan 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.160
 adidas says it all with us again hint 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.810
 the fact that for our sake is more focused on 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.490
 teams rather than individual 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.620
 athlete any adidas advertisement 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.180
 extremely correct there is no 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.330
 ambiguity in it is looked through 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.520
 story plot and they are interested to watch 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.190
 she catches the attention of absolutely everyone 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.230
 nike ads look more viral 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.910
 advertising is not present dynamic and 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.370
 bright frames that are superimposed on 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.750
 epically motivated music success 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.880
 similar advertising lies in 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.070
 multiple screenings in addition to that 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.670
 Advertising is simply easy and looks 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:24.650
 the slogan hour blowing allows you to do advertising 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:28.790
 absolutely any directional small 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:31.550
 Vietnamese village sit last 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:35.760
 American prisoners of war in front of them 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.880
 nike sneakers 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:43.250
 the importance of getting ready will not start 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.250
 quietly then start knocking shoes 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:54.580
 remains 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:57.310
 queue and on the threshold appears high

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:07.930

 jazz you child naki good or here you 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.120

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.610
 military action in belgorod nike 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.490
 performed a bitch zone a poster of 100 ms and 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.650
 MSK part of blowing after this exit 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.220
 the company's profit has grown by a couple more 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:27.659
 million dollars
