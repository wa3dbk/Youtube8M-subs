00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
going to get out of the front end so

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.579 
going to get out of the front end so
remember<00:05:10.759> if<00:05:11.089> your<00:05:11.599> helmet<00:05:12.049> if<00:05:12.319> you're

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:12.589

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:14.029 
looking at the edge of your fairing you

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:15.219 
looking at the edge of your fairing you
probably<00:05:14.329> need<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:14.569> start<00:05:14.659> leaning<00:05:15.079> off<00:05:15.199> a

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
probably need to start leaning off a

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.989 
probably need to start leaning off a
little<00:05:15.439> bit<00:05:15.619> more<00:05:15.829> on<00:05:15.979> both<00:05:16.159> sides<00:05:16.429> if<00:05:16.669> you<00:05:16.699> can

00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:16.999 
little bit more on both sides if you can

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.879 
little bit more on both sides if you can
see<00:05:17.209> this<00:05:17.389> you<00:05:17.719> need<00:05:17.899> to<00:05:17.989> be<00:05:18.049> out<00:05:18.289> in<00:05:18.559> a<00:05:18.709> way

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
see this you need to be out in a way

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.709 
see this you need to be out in a way
from<00:05:19.549> the<00:05:19.669> fairing<00:05:20.029> so<00:05:20.119> you<00:05:20.239> can<00:05:20.359> see<00:05:20.539> what's

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:20.719 
from the fairing so you can see what's

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:21.749 
from the fairing so you can see what's
going<00:05:21.019> on

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
going on

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.159

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
of their controls is all off we do a

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.200 
of their controls is all off we do a
little<00:07:06.860> bit<00:07:07.039> of<00:07:07.129> adjustment<00:07:07.550> just<00:07:07.909> on<00:07:08.060> the

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 
little bit of adjustment just on the

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.029 
little bit of adjustment just on the
foot<00:07:08.389> pegs<00:07:08.659> and<00:07:08.900> on<00:07:09.050> that<00:07:09.259> handlebars<00:07:09.800> and

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
foot pegs and on that handlebars and

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:11.649 
foot pegs and on that handlebars and
before<00:07:10.310> you<00:07:10.400> know<00:07:10.550> it<00:07:10.580> there<00:07:10.849> you're<00:07:11.300> hanging

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:11.659 
before you know it there you're hanging

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:13.059 
before you know it there you're hanging
off<00:07:11.750> the<00:07:11.870> bike<00:07:12.050> and<00:07:12.289> they're<00:07:12.379> doing<00:07:12.620> 10<00:07:12.830> times

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:13.069 
off the bike and they're doing 10 times

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:14.100 
off the bike and they're doing 10 times
better

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.110 
better

you other than that it's all about just

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.719 
you other than that it's all about just
trying<00:07:23.839> to<00:07:24.110> get<00:07:24.770> off<00:07:24.889> the<00:07:25.069> bike<00:07:25.219> a<00:07:25.279> little<00:07:25.490> bit

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:25.729 
trying to get off the bike a little bit

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:27.760 
trying to get off the bike a little bit
the<00:07:26.089> farther<00:07:26.419> you<00:07:26.509> get<00:07:26.779> off<00:07:26.930> the<00:07:27.080> bike<00:07:27.289> the

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.770 
the farther you get off the bike the

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.559 
the farther you get off the bike the
more<00:07:27.979> contact<00:07:28.520> patch<00:07:28.729> is<00:07:28.969> going<00:07:29.120> to<00:07:29.180> be<00:07:29.300> in<00:07:29.449> the

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:29.569 
more contact patch is going to be in the

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:31.480 
more contact patch is going to be in the
middle<00:07:29.839> even<00:07:30.469> when<00:07:30.620> you're<00:07:30.770> leaned<00:07:30.979> over<00:07:31.129> if

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:31.490 
middle even when you're leaned over if

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.189 
middle even when you're leaned over if
you're<00:07:31.639> off<00:07:31.819> the<00:07:31.969> bike<00:07:32.150> you're<00:07:32.389> able<00:07:32.719> to<00:07:32.870> stand

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 
you're off the bike you're able to stand

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.079 
you're off the bike you're able to stand
the<00:07:33.319> bike<00:07:33.469> up<00:07:33.710> easier<00:07:34.099> so<00:07:34.460> you<00:07:34.490> have<00:07:34.699> more<00:07:34.909> of<00:07:34.939> a

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:35.089 
the bike up easier so you have more of a

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:37.929 
the bike up easier so you have more of a
contact<00:07:35.509> patch<00:07:35.719> touching<00:07:36.259> the<00:07:36.379> pavement<00:07:36.939> and

00:07:37.929 --> 00:07:37.939 
contact patch touching the pavement and

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:39.339 
contact patch touching the pavement and
that's<00:07:38.150> the<00:07:38.330> main<00:07:38.539> reason<00:07:38.719> that<00:07:38.930> you<00:07:39.139> see<00:07:39.319> a

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:39.349 
that's the main reason that you see a

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:40.839 
that's the main reason that you see a
lot<00:07:39.529> of<00:07:39.620> these<00:07:39.680> a<00:07:39.740> lot<00:07:40.069> of<00:07:40.129> these<00:07:40.339> guys<00:07:40.550> getting

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:40.849 
lot of these a lot of these guys getting

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:42.969 
lot of these a lot of these guys getting
off<00:07:41.029> the<00:07:41.180> bike<00:07:41.360> so<00:07:41.599> far<00:07:41.930> is<00:07:42.500> because<00:07:42.680> it<00:07:42.889> allows

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:42.979 
off the bike so far is because it allows

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:44.980 
off the bike so far is because it allows
them<00:07:43.370> to<00:07:43.460> have<00:07:43.580> more<00:07:43.789> contact<00:07:44.240> match<00:07:44.479> touching

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:44.990 
them to have more contact match touching

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.710 
them to have more contact match touching
the<00:07:45.080> pavement

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:47.720
