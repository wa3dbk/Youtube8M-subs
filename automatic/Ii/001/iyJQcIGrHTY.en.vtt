some<00:00:42.190> unusual<00:00:43.210> tuning<00:00:44.210> mechanisms<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:45.379> the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
some unusual tuning mechanisms and the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.369 
some unusual tuning mechanisms and the
reason<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:46.580> do<00:00:46.640> brought<00:00:47.210> this<00:00:47.390> dro<00:00:47.900> minister

reason I do brought this dro minister
it's<00:00:48.650> a<00:00:48.769> perfect<00:00:49.159> example<00:00:49.280> of<00:00:49.760> that<00:00:49.820> it's<00:00:50.089> a

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
it's a perfect example of that it's a

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.500 
it's a perfect example of that it's a
leading<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:50.870> Ludwig<00:00:51.860> knob<00:00:52.250> tension<00:00:53.120> snare

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
drum and it has a very unusual tuning

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.740 
drum and it has a very unusual tuning
system<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:58.280> we're<00:00:58.970> going<00:00:59.120> to<00:00:59.180> take<00:00:59.300> a<00:00:59.360> look<00:00:59.629> at

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
system and we're going to take a look at

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.270 
system and we're going to take a look at
that<00:00:59.960> just<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.440> minute<00:01:00.650> I<00:01:00.800> want<00:01:00.979> to<00:01:01.070> show<00:01:01.220> you

that just a minute I want to show you
that<00:01:01.370> it<00:01:01.670> has<00:01:02.379> basically<00:01:03.909> six<00:01:04.909> lugs<00:01:05.269> even

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
that it has basically six lugs even

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.830 
that it has basically six lugs even
though<00:01:05.780> get<00:01:06.140> on<00:01:06.290> scene<00:01:06.560> he<00:01:06.770> lives<00:01:06.979> here<00:01:07.400> but

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
though get on scene he lives here but

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.500 
though get on scene he lives here but
these<00:01:08.840> knobs<00:01:09.229> each<00:01:10.010> one<00:01:10.490> set<00:01:10.909> of<00:01:11.030> these<00:01:11.180> knobs

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
these knobs each one set of these knobs

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.170 
these knobs each one set of these knobs
would<00:01:11.870> represent<00:01:12.260> one<00:01:13.250> look<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:13.820> there<00:01:14.030> are

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
would represent one look so there are

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.800 
would represent one look so there are
six<00:01:14.990> of<00:01:15.170> six<00:01:16.070> sets<00:01:16.340> of<00:01:16.520> knobs<00:01:16.790> here<00:01:17.180> okay<00:01:17.600> and

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
six of six sets of knobs here okay and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.020 
six of six sets of knobs here okay and
I'll<00:01:18.289> show<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:18.619> what<00:01:18.890> those<00:01:19.159> knobs<00:01:19.520> do<00:01:19.850> in

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
I'll show you what those knobs do in

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.060 
I'll show you what those knobs do in
just<00:01:20.180> a<00:01:20.360> second<00:01:20.840> but<00:01:20.960> let's<00:01:21.320> take<00:01:21.680> a<00:01:21.710> look<00:01:21.950> at

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.880 
just a second but let's take a look at
the<00:01:22.159> strainer<00:01:22.719> this<00:01:23.719> is<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.869> very<00:01:24.110> collectible

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
the strainer this is a very collectible

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.200 
the strainer this is a very collectible
drum<00:01:25.159> that's<00:01:25.340> why<00:01:25.579> I<00:01:25.610> brought<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:26.060> in<00:01:26.180> here

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
drum that's why I brought it in here

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.929 
drum that's why I brought it in here
today<00:01:26.719> I<00:01:26.750> wanted<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.170> show<00:01:27.439> you<00:01:27.490> all<00:01:28.490> about<00:01:28.789> it

today I wanted to show you all about it
but<00:01:29.149> the<00:01:30.140> real<00:01:30.320> reason<00:01:30.350> is<00:01:30.859> because<00:01:31.039> of<00:01:31.189> the

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
but the real reason is because of the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.870 
but the real reason is because of the
unusual<00:01:31.869> tuning<00:01:33.009> in<00:01:34.009> fact<00:01:34.369> we're<00:01:34.670> going<00:01:34.820> to

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
unusual tuning in fact we're going to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.599 
unusual tuning in fact we're going to
take<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.060> look<00:01:35.299> inside<00:01:35.719> right<00:01:36.320> now<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:37.039> I'll

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
take a look inside right now and I'll

take a look inside right now and I'll
show<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:37.909> what's<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:38.420> unusual<00:01:38.659> about<00:01:39.289> this

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
show you what's so unusual about this

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.929 
show you what's so unusual about this
tuning<00:01:41.500> now<00:01:42.500> here's<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.100> side<00:01:43.369> of<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.670> drum

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
tuning now here's the side of the drum

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.580 
tuning now here's the side of the drum
and<00:01:44.000> basically<00:01:44.600> you've<00:01:44.840> got<00:01:44.990> all<00:01:45.170> the

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
and basically you've got all the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.529 
and basically you've got all the
components<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.399> are<00:01:46.549> needed<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:47.000> tune<00:01:47.329> this

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
components that are needed to tune this

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.330 
components that are needed to tune this
drum<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:49.820> knurled<00:01:50.270> knobs<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:51.079> more<00:01:51.950> knurled

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
drum to knurled knobs to more knurled

knobs<00:01:52.630> these<00:01:53.630> two<00:01:53.990> knobs<00:01:54.259> are<00:01:54.710> simply<00:01:55.429> there

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
knobs these two knobs are simply there

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.330 
knobs these two knobs are simply there
to<00:01:56.030> hold<00:01:56.539> on<00:01:56.869> these<00:01:57.259> metal<00:01:57.770> hoops<00:01:58.009> these

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
to hold on these metal hoops these

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.169 
to hold on these metal hoops these
chrome<00:01:58.700> hoops<00:01:59.530> these<00:02:00.530> knobs<00:02:01.070> actually<00:02:01.880> do<00:02:02.030> the

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
chrome hoops these knobs actually do the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.569 
chrome hoops these knobs actually do the
tuning<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.780> when<00:02:03.530> they're<00:02:03.710> turned<00:02:04.009> they

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
tuning and when they're turned they

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.239 
tuning and when they're turned they
affect<00:02:04.999> a<00:02:05.210> threaded<00:02:05.869> rod<00:02:06.109> that<00:02:06.409> goes<00:02:06.439> into<00:02:07.009> the

affect a threaded rod that goes into the
inside<00:02:07.579> of<00:02:07.609> the<00:02:07.820> drum<00:02:07.939> let's<00:02:08.810> have<00:02:08.990> a<00:02:09.020> look<00:02:09.229> at

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
inside of the drum let's have a look at

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.440 
inside of the drum let's have a look at
that<00:02:09.380> right<00:02:09.770> now<00:02:10.039> I'm<00:02:10.340> going<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:10.970> switch<00:02:11.210> to

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
that right now I'm going to switch to

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.680 
that right now I'm going to switch to
the<00:02:12.220> underside<00:02:13.220> inside<00:02:14.000> view<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.569> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
drummond there are the two mechanisms

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.480 
drummond there are the two mechanisms
now<00:02:17.450> those<00:02:17.690> two<00:02:18.050> knurled<00:02:18.470> knobs<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:19.069> we<00:02:19.340> were

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
now those two knurled knobs that we were

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.200 
now those two knurled knobs that we were
looking<00:02:19.819> at<00:02:19.940> are<00:02:20.120> connected<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:22.490> threads

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
looking at are connected to the threads

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.990 
looking at are connected to the threads
and<00:02:23.540> here<00:02:23.870> are<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.050> threaded<00:02:24.740> rods<00:02:25.040> one<00:02:25.730> there

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
and here are the threaded rods one there
