make<00:02:58.540> sure<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.350> now<00:02:59.890> that<00:03:00.250> we<00:03:00.400> have<00:03:00.670> our<00:03:00.940> two

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
make sure it is now that we have our two

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
make sure it is now that we have our two
strands<00:03:01.870> we<00:03:02.110> need<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.620> create<00:03:02.950> more<00:03:03.280> tension

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
strands we need to create more tension

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.660 
strands we need to create more tension
sturdy<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:06.580> once<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:06.910> have<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.360> tension<00:03:07.750> I

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
sturdy so once you have that tension I

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.000 
sturdy so once you have that tension I
use<00:03:09.670> my<00:03:09.910> finger<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.750> kind<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.410> wrap<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.710> around

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
use my finger to kind of wrap it around

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.410 
use my finger to kind of wrap it around
like<00:03:12.340> so<00:03:12.550> and<00:03:13.240> then<00:03:14.170> we're<00:03:14.440> going<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:15.240> start<00:03:16.240> to

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
like so and then we're going to start to

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.040 
like so and then we're going to start to
twist<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:17.050> at<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.500> root<00:03:18.150> still<00:03:19.150> create<00:03:19.510> making

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
twist it at the root still create making

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.190 
twist it at the root still create making
sure<00:03:20.350> there's<00:03:20.800> tension<00:03:21.360> still<00:03:22.360> in<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.810> twist

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
sure there's tension still in the twist

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.070 
sure there's tension still in the twist
because<00:03:24.040> that<00:03:24.520> is<00:03:24.700> important<00:03:25.390> in<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.630> bantu

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
because that is important in the bantu

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.130 
because that is important in the bantu
knot<00:03:26.460> process<00:03:27.460> and<00:03:28.060> as<00:03:28.480> I'm<00:03:28.780> bantu<00:03:29.560> knot<00:03:29.860> e<00:03:29.890> I'm

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
knot process and as I'm bantu knot e I'm

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.300 
knot process and as I'm bantu knot e I'm
going<00:03:32.370> under<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:34.330> twist<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.930> not<00:03:35.170> on<00:03:35.560> top<00:03:36.040> I'm

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
going under to twist it not on top I'm

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.550 
going under to twist it not on top I'm
going<00:03:36.640> under<00:03:39.390> so<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.720> think<00:03:40.840> we<00:03:41.110> need<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.380> do<00:03:41.530> a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
going under so I think we need to do a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.680 
going under so I think we need to do a
bigger<00:03:41.950> one<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:42.610> you<00:03:42.670> can<00:03:42.880> actually<00:03:43.120> see

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
bigger one so you can actually see

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
going to start creating tension at the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.670 
going to start creating tension at the
top<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.509> bottom<00:04:37.660> by<00:04:38.110> doing<00:04:38.530> this

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
top and the bottom by doing this

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.719

twisting<00:04:39.250> motion<00:04:39.820> got<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.810> be<00:04:40.900> coordinated

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
twisting motion got to be coordinated

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.310 
twisting motion got to be coordinated
then<00:04:42.729> I'm<00:04:42.849> going<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.090> roll<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.389> up<00:04:43.630> my<00:04:43.810> finger

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
then I'm going to roll it up my finger

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.550 
then I'm going to roll it up my finger
just<00:04:44.620> so<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.949> tension<00:04:45.430> will<00:04:45.550> remain<00:04:45.940> there

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
just so the tension will remain there

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.400 
just so the tension will remain there
and<00:04:47.560> we're<00:04:47.800> going<00:04:47.949> to<00:04:48.009> twist<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.639> around<00:04:49.410> and

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
and we're going to twist it around and

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.710 
and we're going to twist it around and
as<00:04:51.220> you're<00:04:51.490> going<00:04:51.849> around<00:04:52.000> you're<00:04:52.509> going

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
as you're going around you're going

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.460 
as you're going around you're going
underneath<00:04:53.349> of<00:04:53.949> the<00:04:54.190> twist<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:56.080> make<00:04:56.259> sure

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
underneath of the twist to make sure

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.680 
underneath of the twist to make sure
that<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.889> is<00:04:57.039> secure<00:04:59.849> so<00:05:00.849> there<00:05:01.060> is<00:05:01.300> another

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
that it is secure so there is another

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.719 
that it is secure so there is another
bantu<00:05:02.560> knot<00:05:02.740> I<00:05:02.770> hope<00:05:03.070> you<00:05:03.250> can<00:05:03.430> see<00:05:03.699> it<00:05:05.729> so

our<00:05:24.940> finger<00:05:25.360> to<00:05:25.509> create<00:05:25.690> keep<00:05:26.169> that<00:05:26.380> tension

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
our finger to create keep that tension

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.180

closer<00:05:35.590> to<00:05:35.889> our<00:05:35.919> scalp<00:05:36.520> because<00:05:37.479> that<00:05:37.930> is

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
closer to our scalp because that is

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.920 
closer to our scalp because that is
making<00:05:38.560> sure<00:05:38.860> that<00:05:38.940> bantu<00:05:39.940> knot<00:05:40.150> is<00:05:40.360> not<00:05:40.630> it's

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
making sure that bantu knot is not it's

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.149

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:51.790 

so<00:05:45.159> that<00:05:45.460> is<00:05:45.759> a<00:05:46.000> Bantu<00:05:46.479> mine

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.409 

so<00:05:52.800> let's<00:05:53.250> see<00:05:53.400> if<00:05:53.490> we<00:05:53.639> can<00:05:53.849> do<00:05:54.000> it<00:05:54.150> at<00:05:54.270> this

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
so let's see if we can do it at this

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.290 
so let's see if we can do it at this
angle<00:05:55.250> since<00:05:56.250> it<00:05:56.400> looks<00:05:56.550> better<00:05:56.849> from<00:05:57.120> the

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
angle since it looks better from the

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:04.339 
angle since it looks better from the
thing<00:05:57.509> well<00:05:57.750> I'm<00:05:57.900> gonna<00:05:58.080> turn<00:05:58.349> this<00:05:58.560> way<00:06:03.080> so<00:06:04.080> as

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349
