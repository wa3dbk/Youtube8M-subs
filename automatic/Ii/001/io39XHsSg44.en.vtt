00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.040 
going to be an unboxing video I don't
know<00:00:20.970> how<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.240> these<00:00:21.420> because<00:00:21.689> I've<00:00:21.930> never

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
know how to do these because I've never

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.560 
know how to do these because I've never
done<00:00:22.230> these<00:00:22.710> before<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.220> yeah<00:00:23.970> well<00:00:24.180> I'm<00:00:24.300> at<00:00:24.420> it

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
done these before so yeah well I'm at it

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.880 
done these before so yeah well I'm at it
I<00:00:24.720> might<00:00:24.920> as<00:00:25.920> well<00:00:26.750> run<00:00:27.750> box<00:00:28.050> Majora's<00:00:28.560> Mask<00:00:28.740> 2

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
I might as well run box Majora's Mask 2

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.200 
I might as well run box Majora's Mask 2
because<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.279> sealed<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.090> it

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
because this is sealed and I have it

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.189 
because this is sealed and I have it
open<00:00:30.269> until<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.720> got<00:00:30.869> this

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
open until I got this

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.270 
open until I got this
so<00:00:32.660> it's<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.719> double<00:00:33.930> unboxing<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:35.040> sure<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280
