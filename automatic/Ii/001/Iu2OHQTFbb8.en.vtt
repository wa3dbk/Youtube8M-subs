where<00:00:31.740> every<00:00:32.070> once<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.460> while<00:00:32.640> when<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.910> was

started cold you get a bad fuel smell in

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.799 
started cold you get a bad fuel smell in
the<00:00:36.570> car<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.520> I<00:00:38.520> wouldn't<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.420> known<00:00:39.600> what

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the car and I wouldn't have known what

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.500 
the car and I wouldn't have known what
to<00:00:39.870> look<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.379> right<00:00:40.739> off<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.129> hand<00:00:41.510> except

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
to look for right off the hand except

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.060 
to look for right off the hand except
for<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.780> time<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.230> under<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.469> hood<00:00:43.590> doing

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
for one time I was under the hood doing

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.920 
for one time I was under the hood doing
a<00:00:44.160> service<00:00:44.370> check<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.059> thing<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.480> as

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
a service check on this thing and as

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.650 
a service check on this thing and as
soon<00:00:46.079> as<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:46.320> turn<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> key<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.250> saw<00:00:47.820> right

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
soon as we turn the key on I saw right

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.240 
soon as we turn the key on I saw right
around<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.230> rim<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.770> feel<00:00:49.950> pressure

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
around the rim of the feel pressure

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.660 
around the rim of the feel pressure
dampener<00:00:50.989> there<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.110> gasoline<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:53.219> sitting

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
dampener there was gasoline just sitting

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.819 
dampener there was gasoline just sitting
there<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.989> leads<00:00:55.260> me<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> believe<00:00:55.530> that

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
there so that leads me to believe that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.220 
there so that leads me to believe that
we're<00:00:56.280> getting<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.579> small<00:00:56.879> leak<00:00:57.149> either<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
we're getting a small leak either the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.610 
we're getting a small leak either the
seal<00:00:58.500> went<00:00:58.770> bad<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.780> unit<00:01:01.050> just<00:01:01.230> failed<00:01:01.410> or

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
seal went bad or the unit just failed or

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.200 
seal went bad or the unit just failed or
something<00:01:01.969> so<00:01:02.969> basically<00:01:04.339> it's<00:01:05.339> located

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
something so basically it's located

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.630 
something so basically it's located
right<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.590> fuel<00:01:07.830> rail<00:01:08.040> goes<00:01:08.280> here

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
right here and the fuel rail goes here

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.070 
right here and the fuel rail goes here
and<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.880> other<00:01:09.000> half<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> fuel<00:01:09.630> rail<00:01:09.810> goes

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and the other half of the fuel rail goes

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.679 
and the other half of the fuel rail goes
under<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.420> intake<00:01:13.729> it's<00:01:14.729> real<00:01:15.000> easy<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.360> ten

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
under the intake it's real easy to ten

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.560 
under the intake it's real easy to ten
millimeter<00:01:16.110> bolts<00:01:16.530> right<00:01:17.520> down<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.090> you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
millimeter bolts right down here you

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.160 
millimeter bolts right down here you
take<00:01:18.780> those<00:01:19.049> two<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.520> I<00:01:20.520> used<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.450> long

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
take those two out I used a long

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.280 
take those two out I used a long
extension<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.159> got<00:01:23.759> me<00:01:23.939> back<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.689> was

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
extension it got me back there I was

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.560 
extension it got me back there I was
able<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.220> without<00:01:26.490> being<00:01:27.479> able

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
able to do it kind of without being able

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.890 
able to do it kind of without being able
to<00:01:27.750> reach<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.170> perfectly<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:30.360> new<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.720> has

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
to reach it perfectly the new one has

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.760 
to reach it perfectly the new one has
two<00:01:31.710> seals<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.490> put<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> two<00:01:32.970> seals<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
two seals you put the two seals on it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.980 
two seals you put the two seals on it
you<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.979> slide<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.369> back<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.810> there

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
you just slide it back up up in there

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.810 
you just slide it back up up in there
you<00:01:37.020> put<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> ten<00:01:37.829> millimeters<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.579> torque

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
you put the ten millimeters you torque

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.140 
you put the ten millimeters you torque
them<00:01:38.939> down<00:01:40.040> snug<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.460> got<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> rubber<00:01:41.850> seal

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
them down snug it's got a rubber seal

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850 
them down snug it's got a rubber seal
it'll<00:01:42.570> hold<00:01:42.720> pressure<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.290> don't<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
it'll hold pressure you don't have to

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.480 
it'll hold pressure you don't have to
over<00:01:44.100> tighten<00:01:44.369> them<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.360> do<00:01:46.490> you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
over tighten them and if you do you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.770 
over tighten them and if you do you
could<00:01:47.640> always<00:01:47.820> strip<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> threads<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.659> be

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
could always strip the threads so be

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.960 
could always strip the threads so be
careful<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:50.040> that's<00:01:50.189> basically<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.790> it's

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
careful but that's basically it it's

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.340 
careful but that's basically it it's
just<00:01:51.180> two<00:01:51.329> bolts<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.750> took<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
just two bolts I took all of the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.710 
just two bolts I took all of the
assembly<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> took<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.520> intake<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.630> all

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
assembly here I took the intake and all

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.499 
assembly here I took the intake and all
that<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.619> air<00:01:55.770> intake<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.240> move<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.450> around

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that the air intake and move that around

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.380 
that the air intake and move that around
so<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.170> gave<00:01:58.320> me<00:01:58.439> some<00:01:58.590> extra<00:01:58.799> room<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.390> free

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
so just gave me some extra room to free

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.230 
so just gave me some extra room to free
up<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.619> not<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.829> big<00:02:02.130> deal<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.000> see

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
up but it's not a big deal if you see
