edging<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.870> along<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> sides<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.579> one

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
edging all along the sides and this one

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.770 
edging all along the sides and this one
does<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> bottom<00:00:51.480> two<00:00:51.629> because

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
does have on the bottom two because

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.010 
does have on the bottom two because
they're<00:00:52.050> small<00:00:52.350> right<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.809> way<00:00:54.899> it's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
they're small right so that way it's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.680 
they're small right so that way it's
going<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.230> last<00:00:55.760> quite<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.120> keeps<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.539> from

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
going to last quite that keeps it from

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.720 
going to last quite that keeps it from
getting<00:00:57.870> dinged<00:00:58.170> up<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.280> really<00:00:59.430> nice

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
getting dinged up it's a really nice

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.760 
getting dinged up it's a really nice
feature<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.390> then<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.930> also<00:01:01.079> use<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> our

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
feature and then we also use one of our

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.319 
feature and then we also use one of our
custom<00:01:02.129> bases<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.789> part<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> trench

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
custom bases this is part of the trench

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.560 
custom bases this is part of the trench
works<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.979> base<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> flag<00:01:05.640> too<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.330> r<00:01:06.360> is

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
works as a base for the flag too so r is

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.990 
works as a base for the flag too so r is
legend<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.080> base<00:01:07.260> yes<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.250> our<00:01:08.430> risk<00:01:08.610> case<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
legend that base yes of our risk case is

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.440 
legend that base yes of our risk case is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.710 
here so you can stick some prominent
units<00:01:32.640> over<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.210> there's<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> little

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
units over here there's a little

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.200 
units over here there's a little
marbleized<00:01:34.340> yeah<00:01:35.340> that's<00:01:35.520> dumpster<00:01:36.000> lower

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
marbleized yeah that's dumpster lower

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.960 
marbleized yeah that's dumpster lower
and<00:01:36.450> then<00:01:37.189> there's<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.250> little<00:01:38.340> cave<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.820> there

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970

and then there's a little cave in there
I<00:01:39.000> kind<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.570> envision<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.049> that's<00:01:40.259> where<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
I kind of envision it that's where the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.060 
I kind of envision it that's where the
doors<00:01:41.540> grandmasters<00:01:42.540> sure<00:01:43.110> get<00:01:43.380> buried<00:01:43.799> make

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
doors grandmasters sure get buried make

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.539 
doors grandmasters sure get buried make
a<00:01:44.189> sanctum<00:01:44.670> asli<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.479> yeah<00:01:45.869> exactly<00:01:46.380> ok<00:01:46.979> so

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
a sanctum asli and yeah exactly ok so

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.880 
a sanctum asli and yeah exactly ok so
well<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> really<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.020> I'd<00:01:49.170> also<00:01:49.320> point<00:01:49.710> out
