one<00:01:22.979> striker<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.909> he<00:01:24.390> was<00:01:24.570> never<00:01:24.869> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.320> be

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
one striker and he was never going to be

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710 
one striker and he was never going to be
a<00:01:25.860> number<00:01:26.159> one<00:01:26.490> striker<00:01:26.820> under<00:01:27.210> Mourinho

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
a number one striker under Mourinho

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.660 
a number one striker under Mourinho
because<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.200> some<00:01:28.439> reason<00:01:28.470> Mourinho<00:01:29.220> doesn't

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
because for some reason Mourinho doesn't

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.569 
because for some reason Mourinho doesn't
fancy<00:01:29.909> him<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.479> don't<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.290> why<00:01:31.530> maybe<00:01:32.340> he

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
fancy him I don't know why maybe he

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.380 
fancy him I don't know why maybe he
feels<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.299> not<00:01:33.630> ready<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.290> fire<00:01:34.590> 20<00:01:35.490> 25<00:01:35.970> goals

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
feels is not ready to fire 20 25 goals

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.230 
feels is not ready to fire 20 25 goals
in<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.780> season<00:01:37.130> but<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.640> he<00:01:38.850> will<00:01:39.030> become

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
in a season but I think he will become

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.050 
in a season but I think he will become
an<00:01:39.630> even<00:01:39.780> better<00:01:40.439> striker<00:01:40.920> than<00:01:41.220> Diego<00:01:41.610> Costa

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
an even better striker than Diego Costa

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.450 
an even better striker than Diego Costa
so<00:01:42.360> I'm<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:43.200> Chelsea<00:01:43.619> might<00:01:43.799> regret<00:01:44.159> this

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
so I'm I think Chelsea might regret this

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.210 
so I'm I think Chelsea might regret this

another<00:02:46.140> really<00:02:46.769> strong<00:02:47.159> season<00:02:47.609> they<00:02:47.730> just

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
another really strong season they just

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.960 
another really strong season they just
need<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.150> little<00:02:48.510> bit<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:49.760> midfield<00:02:50.760> and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
need a little bit of a midfield and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.509 
need a little bit of a midfield and
defensive<00:02:51.599> reinforcements<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:53.099> this<00:02:53.220> shows

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
defensive reinforcements but this shows

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.670 
defensive reinforcements but this shows
a<00:02:53.549> statement<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.389> intent<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.049> if<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.650> think

little bit of money now in recent

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.599 
little bit of money now in recent
seasons<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:10.079> wasn't<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.620> case<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.190> Everton

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
seasons that wasn't the case and Everton

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.670 
seasons that wasn't the case and Everton
has<00:03:11.760> been<00:03:12.060> have<00:03:12.389> been<00:03:12.750> really<00:03:12.959> struggling<00:03:13.409> to

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
has been have been really struggling to

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.400 
has been have been really struggling to
break<00:03:13.859> into<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.459> top<00:03:14.760> four<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:15.840> think<00:03:16.230> this

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
break into the top four but I think this

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.909 
break into the top four but I think this
is<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:17.639> is<00:03:17.699> the<00:03:17.910> first<00:03:18.209> big<00:03:19.199> step<00:03:19.500> for<00:03:19.799> ever

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
is a this is the first big step for ever

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:24.289 
is a this is the first big step for ever
turn<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.549> it<00:03:21.329> will<00:03:21.930> be<00:03:22.139> a<00:03:22.319> really<00:03:23.190> really<00:03:23.879> the

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
turn and it will be a really really the

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.569 
turn and it will be a really really the
most<00:03:24.629> competitive<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.919> most<00:03:26.160> competitive

become a
world-class<00:04:15.940> striker<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.389> I<00:04:17.480> think<00:04:17.750> for<00:04:17.959> for

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
world-class striker and I think for for

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.260 
world-class striker and I think for for
28<00:04:19.010> million<00:04:19.959> if<00:04:20.959> he<00:04:21.440> if<00:04:21.680> he<00:04:21.950> fires<00:04:22.220> Everton<00:04:22.910> to

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
28 million if he if he fires Everton to

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.870 
28 million if he if he fires Everton to
maybe<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:24.020> cup<00:04:24.260> final<00:04:24.500> or<00:04:24.980> to<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.400> top<00:04:25.610> four

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
maybe a cup final or to the top four

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.040 
maybe a cup final or to the top four
then<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:26.690> was<00:04:26.930> money<00:04:27.650> well<00:04:28.130> spent<00:04:28.540> but<00:04:29.540> never

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
then it was money well spent but never

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.990 
then it was money well spent but never
to<00:04:30.290> meet<00:04:30.410> more<00:04:30.650> signings<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.340> can<00:04:31.520> understand

thought that for 28 million that's a
great<00:04:44.600> deal<00:04:44.810> for<00:04:45.080> them<00:04:45.230> because<00:04:45.530> now<00:04:45.830> they<00:04:46.070> can

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
great deal for them because now they can

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.420 
great deal for them because now they can
reinforce<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.120> squad<00:04:47.390> even<00:04:47.660> more<00:04:48.430> coast

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
across da Costa cost 30 million and

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.260 
across da Costa cost 30 million and
Lukaku<00:04:52.940> cus<00:04:53.660> 20-some<00:04:54.470> some<00:04:55.010> papers<00:04:55.400> say<00:04:55.610> 25

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
Lukaku cus 20-some some papers say 25

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.200 
Lukaku cus 20-some some papers say 25
million<00:04:56.600> some<00:04:56.870> people<00:04:57.169> say<00:04:57.410> 28<00:04:57.919> million<00:04:58.280> so

million some people say 28 million so

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.860 
million some people say 28 million so
I'm<00:04:59.300> not<00:04:59.480> sure<00:04:59.540> what<00:05:00.020> is<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.530> actual<00:05:00.830> amount

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
I'm not sure what is the actual amount

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.470 
I'm not sure what is the actual amount
yeah<00:05:02.870> but<00:05:03.140> I<00:05:03.320> think<00:05:03.790> Lukaku<00:05:04.790> cause<00:05:05.000> this<00:05:05.240> much

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
yeah but I think Lukaku cause this much

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.719 
yeah but I think Lukaku cause this much
because<00:05:06.080> his<00:05:06.410> four-year<00:05:06.979> on<00:05:07.130> for<00:05:07.610> years

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
because his four-year on for years

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.930 
because his four-year on for years
younger<00:05:08.390> than<00:05:09.140> than<00:05:09.650> Costa<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.250> also<00:05:10.700> he<00:05:10.820> has

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
younger than than Costa and also he has

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.200 
younger than than Costa and also he has
the<00:05:11.240> great<00:05:11.840> potential<00:05:12.560> so<00:05:13.280> let<00:05:13.760> me<00:05:13.910> know<00:05:14.030> guys

had those will be the top five and that

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.260 
had those will be the top five and that
Everton<00:05:33.470> and<00:05:33.590> Dalton<00:05:33.950> and<00:05:34.039> we<00:05:34.160> have<00:05:34.250> five<00:05:34.490> for

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270
