into<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> letting<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> few<00:01:36.840> seconds

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
into it and letting for a few seconds

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.499 
into it and letting for a few seconds
blowing<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> water<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:39.299> I'll

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
blowing on the water and then I'll

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.600 
blowing on the water and then I'll
remove<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.960> excess<00:01:40.290> polish<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:41.159> whatever<00:01:41.460> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
remove the excess polish with whatever I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.170 
remove the excess polish with whatever I
find<00:01:41.759> lying<00:01:42.030> around<00:01:42.119> normally<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> cotton<00:01:43.290> tip

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
find lying around normally a cotton tip

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.149 
find lying around normally a cotton tip
yeah<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.380 

then<00:01:49.159> just<00:01:49.369> keep<00:01:49.520> your<00:01:49.700> lips<00:01:49.850> nail<00:01:50.119> out<00:01:50.270> of

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
then just keep your lips nail out of

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.380 
then just keep your lips nail out of
water<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.900> voila<00:01:51.729> okay<00:01:52.729> I've<00:01:52.909> cleaned<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:53.299> all

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
water and voila okay I've cleaned it all

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.609 
water and voila okay I've cleaned it all
up<00:01:53.420> now<00:01:53.690> but<00:01:53.900> another<00:01:54.080> way<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.260> getting<00:01:54.530> around

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
up now but another way of getting around

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.740 
up now but another way of getting around
long<00:01:55.280> cleanup<00:01:55.729> is<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.030> put<00:01:56.150> tape<00:01:56.390> around<00:01:56.510> your

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
long cleanup is to put tape around your

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.620 
long cleanup is to put tape around your
nails<00:01:56.960> or<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.860> use<00:01:58.040> vaseline<00:01:58.670> or<00:01:59.030> cuticle<00:01:59.479> oil

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630

as<00:01:59.930> sort<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.320> deterrent<00:02:00.590> from<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.979> nail

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
as sort of a deterrent from the nail

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
polish sticking I team to not do that

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.020 
polish sticking I team to not do that
for<00:02:03.500> some<00:02:03.619> reason<00:02:03.650> but<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.250> is<00:02:04.369> an<00:02:04.520> option<00:02:04.880> oh

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
for some reason but it is an option oh

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.639 
for some reason but it is an option oh
and<00:02:05.690> there's<00:02:05.810> also<00:02:05.900> some<00:02:06.080> stuff<00:02:06.290> could<00:02:06.500> like

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
and there's also some stuff could like

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.350 
and there's also some stuff could like
liquid<00:02:06.979> latex<00:02:07.310> or<00:02:07.610> something<00:02:07.850> like<00:02:07.940> that<00:02:08.000> or

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
liquid latex or something like that or

liquid latex or something like that or
liquid<00:02:08.899> pallasite<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.590> can't<00:02:09.770> quite<00:02:09.860> remember

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
liquid pallasite I can't quite remember

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.940 
liquid pallasite I can't quite remember
right<00:02:10.340> now<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.750> just<00:02:12.080> appears<00:02:12.530> off<00:02:12.739> but<00:02:12.920> I

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
right now and it just appears off but I

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.199 
right now and it just appears off but I
haven't<00:02:13.250> got<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.459> so<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.610> can't<00:02:13.850> really<00:02:13.940> show

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
haven't got it so I can't really show

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.210 
haven't got it so I can't really show
you<00:02:14.380> anyway<00:02:15.380> as<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.620> can<00:02:15.709> see<00:02:15.950> we're<00:02:16.100> just

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
starting again and I will do the same

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.979 
starting again and I will do the same
thing<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.290> four<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.519> my<00:02:19.790> nails<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.390> personally

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
thing to four of my nails I personally

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.540 
thing to four of my nails I personally
like<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.380> patterns<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:21.800> my<00:02:21.890> nails<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.250> vary

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
like the patterns on my nails to vary

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.009 
like the patterns on my nails to vary
but<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.850> can<00:02:23.030> choose<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.540> same<00:02:23.720> design

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
but you can choose to the same design

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.440 
but you can choose to the same design
every<00:02:24.350> time<00:02:24.560> if<00:02:24.800> you're<00:02:24.920> more<00:02:25.100> into<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.670> that

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
every time if you're more into and that

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.440 
every time if you're more into and that
kind<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.690> continuity<00:02:27.050> look<00:02:34.060> now<00:02:35.060> what<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.239> like

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
kind of continuity look now what I like

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.150 
kind of continuity look now what I like
to<00:02:35.570> do<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.690> just<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.200> fix<00:02:36.380> up<00:02:36.590> any<00:02:36.739> problems<00:02:37.070> of

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
to do is just to fix up any problems of

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.770 
to do is just to fix up any problems of
the<00:02:37.220> design<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.670> add<00:02:37.820> some<00:02:38.180> special<00:02:38.630> touches

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
the design and add some special touches

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.380 
the design and add some special touches
oh<00:02:39.019> I<00:02:39.260> think<00:02:39.950> dots<00:02:40.310> complement<00:02:40.970> with<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.090> marble

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
oh I think dots complement with a marble

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.699 
oh I think dots complement with a marble
really<00:02:41.630> really<00:02:41.840> well<00:02:42.019> so<00:02:42.260> I'm<00:02:42.320> adding<00:02:42.470> in<00:02:42.680> some

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
really really well so I'm adding in some

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.680 
really really well so I'm adding in some
silver<00:02:43.280> dots<00:02:43.430> as<00:02:43.670> well<00:02:43.820> as<00:02:43.940> some<00:02:44.120> black<00:02:44.390> dots

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
silver dots as well as some black dots

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.140 
silver dots as well as some black dots
and<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.860> think<00:02:46.100> we<00:02:46.160> just<00:02:46.280> really<00:02:46.730> set<00:02:46.970> up<00:02:47.060> a

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
and I think we just really set up a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.630 
and I think we just really set up a
design<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.680> we'll<00:02:48.830> see<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.069> really<00:02:49.400> small

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
design and we'll see is a really small

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.520 
design and we'll see is a really small
brush<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.030> some<00:02:50.150> black<00:02:50.390> polish<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.050> fix<00:02:51.350> up

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
brush and some black polish to fix up

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.140 
brush and some black polish to fix up
any<00:02:51.709> areas<00:02:52.100> where<00:02:52.130> that's<00:02:52.519> what<00:02:52.640> smudgy

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
any areas where that's what smudgy

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.660 
any areas where that's what smudgy
doesn't<00:02:53.450> look<00:02:53.570> quite<00:02:53.720> right<00:02:54.370> as<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.519> can

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
doesn't look quite right as you can

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.810 
doesn't look quite right as you can
probably<00:02:55.820> see<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.329> front<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.600> you<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:58.100> that's

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
probably see in front of you and that's

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.580 
probably see in front of you and that's
just<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.180> really<00:02:59.420> sneaky<00:02:59.780> trick<00:03:00.019> for<00:03:00.290> if<00:03:00.440> your

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
just a really sneaky trick for if your

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.319 
just a really sneaky trick for if your
polishes<00:03:01.010> aren't<00:03:01.220> behaving<00:03:01.459> properly<00:03:01.820> or

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
polishes aren't behaving properly or

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.420 
polishes aren't behaving properly or
whatever<00:03:02.660> or<00:03:03.650> even<00:03:03.860> if<00:03:03.920> you're<00:03:04.040> still<00:03:04.190> get

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
whatever or even if you're still get

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.190 
whatever or even if you're still get
enough<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:05.000> marbling<00:03:05.480> effect<00:03:05.600> on<00:03:05.989> it<00:03:06.110> you

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
enough of the marbling effect on it you

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.630 
enough of the marbling effect on it you
can<00:03:06.290> actually<00:03:06.440> paint<00:03:06.799> on<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.310> marbling

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
can actually paint on the marbling

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.670 
can actually paint on the marbling
effect<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:08.090> some<00:03:08.299> degree<00:03:08.480> using<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.500> base

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
effect to some degree using the base

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.759 
effect to some degree using the base
marbling<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.459> like<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.640> guide<00:03:11.410> this<00:03:12.410> just<00:03:12.680> works

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
marbling is like a guide this just works

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.050 
marbling is like a guide this just works
really<00:03:12.980> well<00:03:13.070> for<00:03:13.190> me<00:03:13.459> because<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:13.730> know<00:03:13.790> how

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
really well for me because I know how
