00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.849
 Okay, and we'll have the background already. 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:15.630
 What we want is a nerd. 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:18.180
 whoa background with an overall right crowd 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:23.280
 I record only noise is'll stay 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:25.080
 quietly without hearing, oh and how 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.599
 this noise here guys 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.639
 here we have a background noise 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.229
 and here we have the background music 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.610
 but the music I do not use because I have 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.190
 fear of copyright but only for you to see 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:40.380
 the CA 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:41.880
 oh, it's enough, it's enough soon 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.680
 so I think that's basically it 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.200
 people have several options 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.300

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.550
 options that have one that let 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.620
 This is where the old tram is. 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.600

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.920
 This is just to show you how 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.390

 anyway many people were asking 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.740
 It's how I do it to play such is 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.290
 this extension is so that it opposes the plane 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.790
