anyway yeah y'all haven't seen I got me
a<00:00:17.449> Ford<00:00:18.449> nine<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.050> think<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.500> 1941<00:00:20.189> I'm

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
a Ford nine in I think it's a 1941 I'm

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.670 
a Ford nine in I think it's a 1941 I'm
not<00:00:21.210> sure<00:00:21.390> because<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.930> can't<00:00:22.109> really<00:00:22.289> read<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
not sure because I can't really read the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.849 
not sure because I can't really read the
serial<00:00:22.920> number<00:00:23.189> all<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.400> way<00:00:24.230> but<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.590> course

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
serial number all the way but of course

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.800 
serial number all the way but of course
somebody's<00:00:26.279> painted<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> TN<00:00:27.269> which<00:00:27.660> i

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
somebody's painted it like a TN which i

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.330 
somebody's painted it like a TN which i
think<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.140> fine<00:00:28.289> because<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> way<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
think is fine because I like the way to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.919 
think is fine because I like the way to
a<00:00:29.490> TENS<00:00:29.789> look<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.000> lot<00:00:30.150> better<00:00:30.359> than<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.599> solid

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
a TENS look a lot better than the solid

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.030 
a TENS look a lot better than the solid
gray<00:00:31.080> nines<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:33.170> it's<00:00:34.170> been<00:00:34.350> converted<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.770> 12

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
gray nines but it's been converted to 12

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.880 
gray nines but it's been converted to 12
volts<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:36.290> actually<00:00:37.290> converted<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.739> right

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
volts and actually converted it right

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860 
volts and actually converted it right
because<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.280> put<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> voltmeter<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
because I put a voltmeter on and it

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.869 
because I put a voltmeter on and it
actually<00:00:40.020> charges<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> battery<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
actually charges the battery one of the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.250 
actually charges the battery one of the
few<00:00:42.059> tractors<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.540> got<00:00:42.719> around<00:00:42.960> here<00:00:43.110> that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
few tractors we got around here that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.139 
few tractors we got around here that
charges<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.620> battery<00:00:44.719> yes<00:00:45.719> sir<00:00:46.140> buddy<00:00:47.149> but

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
charges the battery yes sir buddy but

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.630 
charges the battery yes sir buddy but
let's<00:00:48.809> see<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.379> put<00:00:49.800> my<00:00:49.920> new<00:00:50.039> carburetor<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
it doesn't require run exactly right put

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.619 
it doesn't require run exactly right put

dr. Greider oh yeah
it<00:02:13.680> gets<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.160> little<00:02:14.280> as<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.910> hear<00:02:15.560> when<00:02:16.560> I

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
it gets a little as you can hear when I

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.740 
it gets a little as you can hear when I
look<00:02:16.770> at<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:18.030> reflections<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
look at like that the reflections in the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.790 
look at like that the reflections in the
headlights<00:02:19.110> look<00:02:19.260> like<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.740> got<00:02:19.860> eyeball

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.330 

to<00:02:24.040> deal

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
have a noisy transmission in that kind

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.920 
have a noisy transmission in that kind
of<00:02:35.379> books<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:36.120> don't<00:02:37.120> know<00:02:37.239> how<00:02:37.390> noisy<00:02:37.780> they're

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
of books I don't know how noisy they're

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.670 
of books I don't know how noisy they're
supposed<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.260> be
