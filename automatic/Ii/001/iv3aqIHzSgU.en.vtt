00:00:08.338 --> 00:00:10.238
 I have a heart, 

00:00:10.238 --> 00:00:14.378
 that feeds on your soft and sweet voice, 

00:00:14.378 --> 00:00:18.268
 that clings to your breath to your love, 

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:22.068
 that stops if you lack your heat. 

00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:25.821
 I have a heart, 

00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:29.571
 that beats to the rhythm that your song intones to me, 

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:33.501
 that accelerates when I know that I am here, 

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:37.481
 face to face with the eternal creator. 

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:41.311
 I do not understand so much love, 

00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:45.311
 You loved me while I was a sinner. 

00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:49.007
 Now I surrender what I am, 

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:50.177
 I give my life 

00:00:50.177 --> 00:00:53.697
 I am a slave for love. 

00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:56.954
 You love Me, 

00:00:56.954 --> 00:01:01.314
 You gave your life, you gave yourself for me. 

00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:04.501
 I fall in love, 

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:08.891
 when I contemplate that work on the cross. 

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:12.289
 A waste of love, 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.289
 the one you gave for me. 

00:01:28.675 --> 00:01:31.285
 Today my life, 

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:34.815
 yields its breath, renders the soul and heart, 

00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:38.815
 Renders his dream, renders all his song. 

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:42.815
 My whole world today I surrender to you I am. 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.799
 You my life, 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.409
 you the way, you are my salvation, 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.409
 your faithful lover, you my friend, you my God, 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.409
 your the refuge, your my moon, your my sun. 

00:01:59.323 --> 00:02:01.813
 I do not understand so much love, 

00:02:01.813 --> 00:02:05.813
 You loved me while I was a sinner. 

00:02:06.847 --> 00:02:09.457
 Now I surrender what I am, 

00:02:09.457 --> 00:02:13.467
 I surrender my life I am a slave for love. 

00:02:14.427 --> 00:02:17.367
 You love Me, 

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:21.367
 You gave your life, you gave yourself for me. 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.169
 I fall in love, 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:29.169
 when I contemplate that work on the cross. 

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:32.638
 You love Me, 

00:02:32.638 --> 00:02:36.718
 Your eternal blood has made me live today. 

00:02:37.787 --> 00:02:40.277
 Your look, 

00:02:40.277 --> 00:02:44.277
 Fill my soul, fill all my existence. 

00:02:45.202 --> 00:02:47.872
 A waste of love, 

00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:53.702
 the one you gave for me. 

00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:11.131
 You love me heart. 

00:03:11.131 --> 00:03:15.021
 You gave yourself and I was the reason. 

00:03:15.021 --> 00:03:18.671
 I am poetry, I am your eternal song. 

00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:22.621
 I am the sheep that one day rescued. 

00:03:22.621 --> 00:03:26.021
 You are life, you are all that I am. 

00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:30.021
 You make me yours, you attract me with your voice. 

00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:34.021
 I declare myself to be your lover, you my God. 

00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:37.951
 Today I declare that you are my savior. 

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:41.951
 That you are my inspiration. 

00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:46.381
 You are fire, you are light, you are my sun, you are a song. 

00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:49.531
 Today I give myself completely, 

00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:53.531
 to the love that everything for me gave.
