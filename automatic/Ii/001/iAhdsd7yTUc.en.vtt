00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:12.679
 you're looking for love discovers the 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.139
 since daniel here again on the ifa from 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.849
 sony stood and while here a young one 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.130
 young musician his beautiful 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.140
 we are still watching songs 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.970
 some are not yet one 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.649
 but they were able to deliver 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.360
 buy now I just 

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:31.669
 sony xperia miro a real low 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.250
 end beginner gets that at the moment 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.620
 is available for 209 euro moment 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.289
 street price and we show you once 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:45.019
 very briefly is a 3 5 inch display with 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:48.210
 a resolution of 480 x 320 pixels 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.760
 I think if I am wrong 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.010
 with its single core snapdragon 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.010
 Qualcomm chip with at 800 megahertz 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.190
 OS is android 4.0 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.140
 with the well-known sony 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.410
 user interface and how we are here 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.410
 see 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.770
 then shows off here in the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.140
 low speed of the processor 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.229
 then, little quite like valens 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.140
 but balls for beginners is 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.170
 probably absolutely bearable as 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.940
 a very like you would expect from sony 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.899
 very well finished device feels 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.320
 very valuable 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.299
 as you can see from the design study of 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.830
 design a bit like the xperia 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.180
 solar what already fed 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.400
 had 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.850
 it has a 5 megapixel camera with led 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.240
 lightning 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.790
 and otherwise the usual thing 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.860
 actually expects a day as 1500 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.000
 Milliah should therefore be at the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190
 Equipment actually normal 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.729
 suffice 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.259
 the sony xperia miro from the ifa daniel 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.140
 frameworks if I like the video 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.030
 then has thumbs up licon and such 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.299
 continue on a channel until the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.299
 next 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.910
