00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:11.700
 bombay away from work 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:15.179
 then a little shock and then what 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.210
 I did listen well I took the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.560
 fairy town I put in a rest then 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.220
 inside the pot I added some 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.980
 lego a lego in abs ac plastic 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.520
 but she marks them so desiring then 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.340
 well all night that's sub 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.700
 I took it not that one and I come the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:45.440
 glue and I had to put it on the 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:45.440
 directly on it 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.489
 hop 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.190
 so 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.140
 particularity of this paste is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.360
 that she is quite consistent by 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.640
 compared to the fairing 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.050
 the sailboats that have dried up need 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.790
 wait two days and then she will be 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.500
 she will listen will be an integral part 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.110
 of fairing 1 will be very very solid 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.570
 this is a good bowl 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.610
 well - well I passed had had good 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.200
 but they have it going to break when 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.820
 even then if one reviews the side there well 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.710
 sure I put some scotch tape to make 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.320
 hold the system and then it's fine 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.369
 when I finish managing this hook then 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.369
 hit 4 austria 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.270
 which is good also with safety pat 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.780
 look here at the shock an impact 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:53.190
 broke then I simply 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.509
 pick up and makes and many of 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.150
 get a new dough 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.720
 but no I dried 48 hours at least 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.240
 I sand I enlarge and then well 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.840
 I will have a paste as if they were 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.640
 dander a different color 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:16.799
 here is back for a strong effect 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.959
 of lego of the brand calves 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.450
 on a leash marinating for one night 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:26.070
 and then we hear a dough she's 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.019
 beats out well we all do here is we 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.760
 recounting cracks and all countries 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.829
 who took the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.180
 the fairing in its fall here you go 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:41.239
 so hopefully it will be able to help you 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.390
 in your skin for future work 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.920
 Youtube 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:53.440
 so there you noticed that here the same I 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.810
 surround me who knew that enough 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.880
 also done in the process of 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.050
 it's a train to react right there you 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.160
 actually it's not the color 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.970
 but hey we do not care the main thing 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.560
 that I am perfectly solid have 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.540
 left at his grandmother's - great outdoors 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.160
 breed the shelter for at least 48 hours 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.150
 then just think 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:29.910
 everything to repaint and where she works 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.910
 all right well my courage super good
