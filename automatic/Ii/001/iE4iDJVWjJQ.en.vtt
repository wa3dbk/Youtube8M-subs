very human let's see number 4 this is
another<00:01:17.810> Boston<00:01:18.290> Dynamics<00:01:18.410> robot<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:19.340> was

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
another Boston Dynamics robot this was

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.030 
another Boston Dynamics robot this was
called<00:01:19.730> Big<00:01:20.210> Dawg<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.830> it's<00:01:21.830> like<00:01:21.950> a

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
called Big Dawg and it's like a

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.010 
called Big Dawg and it's like a
gas-powered<00:01:22.360> robot<00:01:23.360> that's<00:01:23.600> made<00:01:23.750> for

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
gas-powered robot that's made for

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.810 
gas-powered robot that's made for
transferring<00:01:24.680> stuff<00:01:24.890> for<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.220> military<00:01:25.610> from

my<00:01:25.910> point<00:01:26.210> A<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.330> point<00:01:26.450> B<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:27.080> it's<00:01:27.380> got

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
my point A to point B and so it's got

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.980 
my point A to point B and so it's got
this<00:01:27.590> crazy<00:01:27.740> engine<00:01:28.190> it's<00:01:28.310> like<00:01:28.430> me<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:28.990> I

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
this crazy engine it's like me and I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.920 
this crazy engine it's like me and I
like<00:01:30.020> walks<00:01:30.500> it's<00:01:30.800> legs<00:01:31.160> come<00:01:31.370> up<00:01:31.400> real<00:01:31.700> quick

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
like walks it's legs come up real quick

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.570 
like walks it's legs come up real quick
and<00:01:32.930> it<00:01:33.020> can<00:01:33.440> like<00:01:33.560> balance<00:01:33.860> itself<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.430> stuff

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
and it can like balance itself and stuff

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.230 
and it can like balance itself and stuff
like<00:01:34.730> that<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.120> then<00:01:35.450> number<00:01:35.960> 5<00:01:36.290> is<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:37.670> robot

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
like that and then number 5 is a robot

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.780 
like that and then number 5 is a robot
it's<00:01:38.840> not<00:01:39.110> like<00:01:39.530> what<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:39.830> would<00:01:39.920> think<00:01:40.160> of<00:01:40.460> as

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
it's not like what you would think of as

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.040 
it's not like what you would think of as
something<00:01:41.330> that<00:01:41.360> I<00:01:41.570> would<00:01:41.780> get<00:01:41.900> like

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
something that I would get like

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.200 
something that I would get like
influenced<00:01:42.590> by<00:01:42.710> as<00:01:42.980> far<00:01:43.190> as<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.640> way<00:01:43.760> it<00:01:43.910> moves

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
influenced by as far as the way it moves

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.000 
influenced by as far as the way it moves
necessarily<00:01:45.050> but<00:01:45.380> it's<00:01:45.500> called<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:45.740> keep<00:01:45.890> on

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
necessarily but it's called the keep on

own<00:06:50.029> image<00:06:50.330> and<00:06:50.809> this<00:06:51.289> idea<00:06:51.529> that<00:06:51.739> we<00:06:51.949> can

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:52.069 
own image and this idea that we can

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:54.309 
own image and this idea that we can
create<00:06:52.129> life<00:06:52.699> like<00:06:53.389> just<00:06:53.629> out<00:06:53.719> of<00:06:53.749> nothing<00:06:54.139> and

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 
create life like just out of nothing and

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.139 
create life like just out of nothing and
in<00:06:54.830> create<00:06:55.099> something<00:06:55.429> that's<00:06:55.519> self-aware

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:56.149 
in create something that's self-aware

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.089 
in create something that's self-aware
and<00:06:56.509> self-sufficient<00:06:57.349> I<00:06:57.619> think<00:06:57.919> it's<00:06:58.009> a

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:58.099 
and self-sufficient I think it's a

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:00.070 
and self-sufficient I think it's a
little<00:06:58.249> bit<00:06:58.519> of<00:06:58.639> like<00:06:58.849> a<00:06:59.149> power<00:06:59.449> trip<00:06:59.749> but<00:06:59.959> then

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
little bit of like a power trip but then

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.199 
little bit of like a power trip but then
I<00:07:00.169> think<00:07:00.349> it's<00:07:00.469> also<00:07:00.619> feel<00:07:01.219> that<00:07:01.399> maybe<00:07:01.580> we

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:02.209 
I think it's also feel that maybe we

00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:04.629 
I think it's also feel that maybe we
think<00:07:02.449> by<00:07:02.779> creating<00:07:03.169> life<00:07:03.649> it<00:07:04.129> will<00:07:04.339> teach<00:07:04.490> us

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 
think by creating life it will teach us

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.399 
think by creating life it will teach us
more<00:07:04.789> about<00:07:04.969> ourselves<00:07:05.089> and<00:07:05.899> our<00:07:06.080> own<00:07:06.169> life

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:06.409 
more about ourselves and our own life

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:09.279 
more about ourselves and our own life
and<00:07:06.679> how<00:07:06.979> we<00:07:07.039> came<00:07:07.429> to<00:07:07.610> be<00:07:07.759> and<00:07:08.059> it's<00:07:08.839> it's

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:09.289 
and how we came to be and it's it's

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:11.739 
and how we came to be and it's it's
almost<00:07:10.159> like<00:07:10.429> playing<00:07:10.939> God<00:07:11.209> will<00:07:11.509> help<00:07:11.599> us

00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:11.749 
almost like playing God will help us

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:13.929 
almost like playing God will help us
find<00:07:11.990> God<00:07:12.289> somehow<00:07:12.649> and<00:07:12.979> I<00:07:13.069> don't<00:07:13.249> see<00:07:13.369> I<00:07:13.639> don't

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:13.939 
find God somehow and I don't see I don't

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:15.579 
find God somehow and I don't see I don't
know<00:07:14.029> fully<00:07:14.300> how<00:07:14.479> to<00:07:14.539> articulate<00:07:14.929> that<00:07:15.259> but<00:07:15.499> in

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:15.589 
know fully how to articulate that but in

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:17.649 
know fully how to articulate that but in
my<00:07:15.740> mind<00:07:15.979> it's<00:07:16.189> there's<00:07:16.789> something<00:07:17.149> spiritual

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:17.659 
my mind it's there's something spiritual

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:18.070 
my mind it's there's something spiritual
about<00:07:17.719> it

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
about it
