00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
bosses before they activate the turrets

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.840

example the Manhunter in this alert in

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.119 
example the Manhunter in this alert in
this<00:00:57.870> room<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:59.149> has<00:01:00.149> two<00:01:00.920> if<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.010> guys

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
this room right here has two if you guys

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.889 
this room right here has two if you guys
can<00:01:02.399> see<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> turrets<00:01:03.000> over<00:01:03.210> there<00:01:03.390> they're

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
can see the turrets over there they're

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.690 
can see the turrets over there they're
green<00:01:04.260> at<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> moment<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.129> once<00:01:05.339> they<00:01:05.489> turn

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
green at the moment but once they turn

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.590 
green at the moment but once they turn
yellow<00:01:06.860> that's<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:09.119> know<00:01:09.330> it's

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
yellow that's when you know it's

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.910 
yellow that's when you know it's
activated<00:01:11.510> so<00:01:12.510> there's<00:01:12.990> four<00:01:13.260> turrets<00:01:13.740> in

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
activated so there's four turrets in

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.070 
activated so there's four turrets in
total<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.210> got<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.540> make<00:01:15.689> sure<00:01:15.810> all<00:01:16.049> four

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
total so you got to make sure all four

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.910 
total so you got to make sure all four
turrets<00:01:16.799> are<00:01:17.180> activated<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.740> can

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
turrets are activated and then you can

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800 
turrets are activated and then you can
attack<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> bosses<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.090> kill<00:01:21.479> them<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
attack the bosses and kill them and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.030 
attack the bosses and kill them and
you'll<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.259> 25<00:01:22.740> point<00:01:23.009> feat<00:01:23.990> but<00:01:25.040> what

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you'll get that 25 point feat but what

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.749 
you'll get that 25 point feat but what
we<00:01:26.220> did<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.729> one<00:01:27.000> was<00:01:27.740> we<00:01:28.740> got<00:01:28.979> all<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
we did and this one was we got all the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.749 
we did and this one was we got all the
bosses<00:01:29.970> held<00:01:30.390> down<00:01:30.659> low<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.650> know

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
bosses held down low you know

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.350 
bosses held down low you know
and<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.659> once<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:34.350> were<00:01:34.439> at<00:01:34.590> 20%<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:36.119> just

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and then once they were at 20% we just

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.060 
and then once they were at 20% we just
stopped

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
stopped

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.480 
stopped
started<00:01:38.970> tithing<00:01:39.480> you<00:01:39.720> know<00:01:39.840> moving<00:01:40.110> around

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
started tithing you know moving around

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.490 
started tithing you know moving around
fueling<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.630> pretty<00:01:42.810> difficult<00:01:43.080> at<00:01:43.470> first

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
fueling it was pretty difficult at first

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.130 
fueling it was pretty difficult at first
because<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:45.060> tourists<00:01:45.479> will<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.600> hitting<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
because the tourists will be hitting you

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.390 
because the tourists will be hitting you
hard<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.860> matter<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.010> staying

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
hard and it was just a matter of staying

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.520 
hard and it was just a matter of staying
alive<00:01:50.580> during<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.600> whole<00:01:51.780> process<00:01:51.960> till

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
alive during this whole process till

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.840 
alive during this whole process till
they<00:01:52.619> activated<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.280> turrets

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
they activated the turrets

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.080 
they activated the turrets
I<00:01:54.470> recommend<00:01:55.470> y'all<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.920> first<00:01:56.550> work<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
I recommend y'all to first work on the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.090 
I recommend y'all to first work on the
bosses<00:01:57.509> get<00:01:57.690> them<00:01:57.810> get<00:01:58.530> them<00:01:58.590> down<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.070> about

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
bosses get them get them down to about

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.770 
bosses get them get them down to about
10%<00:01:59.610> 20%<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.640> take<00:02:02.640> your<00:02:02.820> pets<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.240> for

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
10% 20% and take your pets out for

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.800 
10% 20% and take your pets out for
example<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.530> watcher<00:02:05.009> or<00:02:05.780> not<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
example if you have a watcher or not a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.320 
example if you have a watcher or not a
watch<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.229> mean<00:02:07.410> like<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> security<00:02:07.950> drone<00:02:08.340> that

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
watch I mean like a security drone that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.199 
watch I mean like a security drone that
does<00:02:09.810> damage<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.590> would<00:02:11.280> take<00:02:11.910> them<00:02:12.060> out

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
does damage I would take them out

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.020 
does damage I would take them out
because<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.720> don't<00:02:12.810> want<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:14.489> security<00:02:15.000> zone

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
because you don't want the security zone

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.440 
because you don't want the security zone
to<00:02:15.540> kill<00:02:15.989> one<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.800> bosses<00:02:16.980> for<00:02:17.970> example

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
to kill one of the bosses for example

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.810 
to kill one of the bosses for example
Hank<00:02:18.959> was<00:02:19.440> ever<00:02:20.090> 5%<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:23.160> security<00:02:23.640> drones

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
Hank was ever 5% and the security drones

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.260 
Hank was ever 5% and the security drones
just<00:02:24.180> targeting<00:02:24.959> him<00:02:25.910> eventually<00:02:26.910> Hank's

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
just targeting him eventually Hank's

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.320 
just targeting him eventually Hank's
when<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.540> dot<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.980> that's<00:02:29.160> one<00:02:29.370> that's<00:02:30.120> why<00:02:30.269> I

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
when the dot so that's one that's why I
