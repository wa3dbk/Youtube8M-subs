00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
then you fry it in a pan with some bacon

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.330

all<00:00:40.520> together<00:00:40.700> it's<00:00:41.120> supposed<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.450> do<00:00:41.630> that

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
all together it's supposed to do that

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.780 
all together it's supposed to do that
because<00:00:41.989> supposedly<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:43.130> stuff<00:00:43.370> is<00:00:43.520> toxic

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
because supposedly this stuff is toxic

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.930 
because supposedly this stuff is toxic
and<00:00:44.239> you<00:00:44.329> have<00:00:44.480> to<00:00:44.600> rinse<00:00:44.780> out<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.050> toxins

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
and you have to rinse out the toxins

00:00:45.940 --> 00:01:02.460 
and you have to rinse out the toxins
I've<00:00:46.940> never<00:00:47.240> done<00:00:47.540> that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
tasteless mass that had all of the

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.780 
tasteless mass that had all of the
nutrients<00:01:10.900> washed<00:01:11.620> out<00:01:11.920> of<00:01:12.160> it<00:01:12.280> cooked<00:01:12.580> out<00:01:12.760> of

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
do just gonna wash off most of the bugs

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.910 
do just gonna wash off most of the bugs
when<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.830> plant<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.430> young<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:16.590> vein

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
when the plant is this young that vein

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.830 
when the plant is this young that vein
in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.220> center<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:18.000> stem<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.890> light<00:02:19.890> green

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
in the center the stem is light green

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.170 
in the center the stem is light green
when<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.960> gets<00:02:22.110> older<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.920> turns<00:02:23.220> red<00:02:23.550> my

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
when it gets older it turns red my

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.850 
when it gets older it turns red my
understanding<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.900> that's<00:02:25.140> when<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.590> plant

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
understanding is that's when the plant

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.270 
understanding is that's when the plant
is<00:02:26.040> toxic<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.850> don't<00:02:27.750> pick<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:27.990> then<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.560> pick<00:02:29.130> it

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
is toxic I don't pick it then I pick it
