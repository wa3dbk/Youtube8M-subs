00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
then we're gonna move the left analog

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.169 
then we're gonna move the left analog
stick<00:02:06.630> which<00:02:06.990> would<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
stick which would be the it's going to

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.110 
stick which would be the it's going to
serve<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.660> cursor<00:02:10.019> and<00:02:10.379> then<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.519> X<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
serve as the cursor and then the X and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.720 
serve as the cursor and then the X and
y-axis<00:02:12.269> are<00:02:12.840> labeled<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.489> going<00:02:17.670> to

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
y-axis are labeled so this is going to

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:31.910 
y-axis are labeled so this is going to
be<00:02:18.920> left<00:02:20.569> analog<00:02:24.860> X<00:02:26.690> then<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.930> Y<00:02:30.680> will<00:02:31.680> left

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
be left analog X then the Y will left

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.490 
be left analog X then the Y will left
analog<00:02:32.879> stick<00:02:36.470> Y<00:02:38.900> now<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.290> basic

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
analog stick Y now we have the basic

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
to do the same thing for the second axis

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:52.920 
to do the same thing for the second axis
collaboration<00:03:48.859> there's<00:03:49.859> gonna<00:03:49.980> be<00:03:50.130> 240

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
negative to Maxis - they're gonna go

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.000

back<00:03:59.860> into<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.340> polite<00:04:01.030> one<00:04:01.239> though<00:04:01.829> go<00:04:02.829> back

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
back into the polite one though go back

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.229 
back into the polite one though go back
to<00:04:03.159> controllers<00:04:04.439> and<00:04:05.439> then<00:04:05.670> here's<00:04:06.670> a<00:04:06.760> virtual

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
to controllers and then here's a virtual

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.670 
to controllers and then here's a virtual
mess<00:04:07.420> we<00:04:07.569> created<00:04:07.959> mine<00:04:08.140> was<00:04:08.319> named<00:04:08.500> new

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
mess we created mine was named new

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.050 
mess we created mine was named new
virtual<00:04:08.920> mouse<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:10.650> X<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:11.799> y-axis<00:04:11.980> so<00:04:12.700> X<00:04:12.909> would

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
virtual mouse to X and y-axis so X would

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.920 
virtual mouse to X and y-axis so X would
go<00:04:13.239> with<00:04:13.450> x<00:04:15.239> and<00:04:16.239> y<00:04:16.600> would<00:04:16.780> go<00:04:16.959> with<00:04:17.109> y<00:04:18.930> now

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
go with x and y would go with y now

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.680 
go with x and y would go with y now
right<00:04:20.289> now<00:04:20.470> if<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:21.100> move<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.489> left<00:04:22.449> analog

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
right now if I move the left analog

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.980 
right now if I move the left analog
stick<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.620> cursor<00:04:24.310> is<00:04:24.490> moving<00:04:27.810> so<00:04:28.810> I'm

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
stick the cursor is moving so I'm

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.270 
stick the cursor is moving so I'm
actually<00:04:29.229> moving<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:29.830> now<00:04:29.860> with<00:04:30.130> the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
actually moving it now with the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.800 
actually moving it now with the
PlayStation<00:04:31.210> 3<00:04:31.690> controller<00:04:33.570> now<00:04:34.570> we're<00:04:34.690> going

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
PlayStation 3 controller now we're going

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.460 
PlayStation 3 controller now we're going
to<00:04:34.870> set<00:04:35.080> up<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:36.479> right<00:04:37.479> click<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.020> left-click

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.180 

so<00:04:41.470> we're<00:04:41.560> gonna<00:04:41.650> go<00:04:41.830> into<00:04:42.039> control<00:04:42.760> list

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
so we're gonna go into control list

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:56.460 
so we're gonna go into control list
PlayStation<00:04:45.190> 3<00:04:45.990> good<00:04:46.990> X<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.990> square<00:04:55.289> go<00:04:56.289> back

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
PlayStation 3 good X and square go back

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:05.610 
PlayStation 3 good X and square go back
to<00:04:56.590> controller<00:04:56.949> list<00:04:59.280> virtual<00:05:00.280> mouse<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:04.620> but

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
to controller list virtual mouse and but

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.240 
to controller list virtual mouse and but
and<00:05:05.800> one<00:05:05.949> would<00:05:06.130> be<00:05:06.160> right<00:05:07.060> click<00:05:07.360> are<00:05:08.250> left

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
and one would be right click are left

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.700 
and one would be right click are left
click<00:05:10.620> bent<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.830> would<00:05:11.919> be<00:05:12.070> right

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.129 

so<00:05:16.310> now<00:05:16.400> you<00:05:16.490> can<00:05:16.669> move<00:05:16.960> PlayStation<00:05:17.960> 3

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
so now you can move PlayStation 3

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.560 
so now you can move PlayStation 3
controller<00:05:18.500> around<00:05:19.780> price<00:05:20.780> x4<00:05:22.330> left<00:05:23.330> click

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
controller around price x4 left click

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.300 
controller around price x4 left click
and<00:05:23.780> then<00:05:24.610> right<00:05:27.910> square<00:05:28.910> 4<00:05:29.120> right<00:05:29.300> click

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
and then right square 4 right click

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.140 
and then right square 4 right click
that's<00:05:31.310> how<00:05:31.490> you<00:05:31.550> connect<00:05:31.850> your<00:05:31.970> PlayStation

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
that's how you connect your PlayStation

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:44.990 
that's how you connect your PlayStation
3<00:05:32.840> controller<00:05:34.990> to<00:05:35.990> your<00:05:36.169> Mac
