 the state preservation has become 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.690
 End of the 50s of mill maintenance 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.420
 others still and the number of private ones 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.670
 people and the mill club the mills 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.670
 Restore increases year after year 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.530
 around 1865 there was on today's Steinfurt 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.310
 Circular area more than 50 oil producing 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.310
 take water 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.640
 only three of these old wood mechanical 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:40.920
 mr after the industrialization 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:43.680
 times of deterioration outlasted in 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.890
 halverde starts to beat the oil 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.869
 actual oil extraction in Canada one 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.229
 consisting of three millstones 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.820
 Network of raw material rapeseed and rÃ¼bsam 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.899
 line and poppy beechnuts and 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.940
 sunflower seeds will be on the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.550
 so-called hearth a lying 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.890
 Millstone he serves 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.840
 mainly as a work surface though 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.110
 also as a warehouse for a standing wave 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.420
 team together with the frame 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.120
 Two runners stones in a circle 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.480
 leads through this process is the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.220
 turned on paints crushed 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.970
 during the braking process serve the 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.769
 painter to loosen the seed 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.750
 You delete the coloring book again and again 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.519
 in the direction of the caller stones 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.920
 back it is sufficiently crushed 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.890
 be drawn to the house painter and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.690
 lowered from the strings 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.360
 at the same time the rapeseed crushes 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.400
 promoted outside and falls open after 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.790
 the ski pass in an underneath 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:53.489
 container the crushed erasmus now 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.739
 are heated so that the oil flows 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.329
 becomes capable and can be squeezed out 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.690
 t raps now comes directly to the 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.690
 hotplate 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.280
 by switching on a clockwork and 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.740
 Constantly stirring like burning 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.440
 prevented and a steady 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:20.270
 warming up when the rape hand 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.260
 the morning work is warm again 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.540
 raised 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.880
 the ring becomes with the acquisition of rapeseed 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:31.220
 pulled over a funnel and falls in 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:38.240
 the underlying tight bag the bag 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:40.340
 is called now soon the squeezing of the 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.370
 Oil happens in this big wooden 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.680
 Block the press with the two press 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:54.500
 words right and left and this one 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:56.810
 leather bags in these leather bags 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.360
 It's called h because you're in the past 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:05.240
 wooden boards bad mats made of pink 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:07.250
 and youtube had used in the star 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.120
 Now comes the bale and goes smoothly 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.370
 beaten 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.370
 so that he goes into the presses too 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.860
 the vintage serve meiÃŸen or karl 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.660
 named under the influence of the ram 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.660
 it drives pillows outwards 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.870
 while the oil from the mentioned 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.870
 mass pressed out 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.640
 the deeper the wedge gets the higher 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.950
 will put pressure on the drivers during 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:58.930
 the seed flows into the oil below 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:05:01.720
 standing wooden damage now 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.520
 the solution is taken by the driver 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.390
 wedge has relaxed and settles 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.390
 pull out easily 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.210
 on a special table with the 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.170
 bag of the solid mass 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.360
 withdrawn 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:30.760
 which one calls highlight and to if 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:33.610
 This is the half of the oil fed 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.280
 that we have just solved this oil 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.290
 was filtered earlier came in one 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.820
 bigger containers so that still 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.330
 could settle something 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.880
 the good oil was taken from the top of the oil 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.580
 was used as a store for lamps and for 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.230
 further smear used as 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.230
 linseed oil for paints and varnishes
