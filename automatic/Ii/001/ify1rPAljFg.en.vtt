00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.540
 server destroy ex those configured ok 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.480
 this with simple intel garden 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.400
 video display and thus downloading 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.570
 the file and we leave this file points 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.200
 they give you right click to be here 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.020
 we hope they leave this folder 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.780
 they double click and gave them these 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.570
 ok files 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.219
 in this poor server suit, first what 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.170
 first thing we have to do is go to 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.290
 this folder that is style that we have 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.760
 sorry that says server here is configured 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:00.860
 all this put the ip that is 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.190
 but they put the ip that is 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.580
 computer with that since they give to 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:15.900
 the windows + r key will come out 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:19.950
 run and here they are going to put cmd cmd 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.740
 although it will come out in the bar 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.040
 windows commands and they're going to put 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:30.700
 ipconfig ip with what you give enter 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.050
 they are going to leave all this they go up 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.080
 here in the part where it says address of 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.350
 uve 4 of this you give right click to 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:44.280
 mark the brand and give it to enter 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.390
 It's the mountain range and so it's worth it, I do not 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.430
 I'm going to paste this and then this one already done 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.590
 nothing to be seeing where it is here 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.409
 mine who study double click and wait for 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.569
 that opens 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.479
 you will open equal now 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:02.049
 Windows commands and wait for careers 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.049
 bookstores 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.660

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:17.810
 server in port 2 55 to 65 sad 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.020
 but the port is needed 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.550
 they go to the server folder and this one 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.720
 said the ip and then they put sipe because 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.840
