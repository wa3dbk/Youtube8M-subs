take the cube root or the fourth root or
the<00:00:40.290> seventeenth<00:00:40.830> route<00:00:41.129> well<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.910> turns<00:00:42.120> out

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the seventeenth route well it turns out

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.600 
the seventeenth route well it turns out
that<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:43.019> you<00:00:43.140> want<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> take<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.070> square<00:00:44.460> root

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
that if you want to take the square root

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.799 
that if you want to take the square root
of<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.180> number<00:00:45.330> that<00:00:46.290> is<00:00:46.680> really<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.430> same

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
of a number that is really the same

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.560 
of a number that is really the same
algebraically<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:50.120> raising<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> number<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
algebraically as raising the number to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.049 
algebraically as raising the number to
the<00:00:51.690> one-half<00:00:52.200> power<00:00:52.489> so<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.640> formula<00:00:53.910> here

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the one-half power so this formula here

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.979 
the one-half power so this formula here
equal<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.930> three<00:00:55.579> carat<00:00:56.579> which<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.270> ship<00:00:57.660> 6

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
equal be three carat which is the ship 6

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.240 
equal be three carat which is the ship 6
we<00:00:58.140> talked<00:00:58.320> about<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.680> yesterday<00:00:58.829> when<00:00:59.129> we

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
we talked about that yesterday when we

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.889 
we talked about that yesterday when we
were<00:00:59.340> doing<00:00:59.399> exponents<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.780> in

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
were doing exponents and then in

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.319 
were doing exponents and then in
parentheses<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:01.739> half<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.850> same<00:01:03.180> as

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
parentheses one half is the same as

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.210 
parentheses one half is the same as
taking<00:01:03.450> a<00:01:03.660> square<00:01:03.899> root<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:05.009> we<00:01:05.100> get

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
taking a square root so you see we get

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.040 
taking a square root so you see we get
the<00:01:05.280> same<00:01:05.430> answer<00:01:05.640> there<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.149> if<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.899> your

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
the same answer there and if in your

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.719 
the same answer there and if in your
head<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.740> know<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.100> half<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.460> same

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
head you know the one half is the same

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.359 
head you know the one half is the same
as<00:01:08.880> 0.5<00:01:09.590> you're<00:01:10.590> more<00:01:10.740> than<00:01:10.800> welcome<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> use<00:01:11.190> B

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
as 0.5 you're more than welcome to use B

as 0.5 you're more than welcome to use B
4<00:01:11.640> raised<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.630> zero<00:01:12.869> point<00:01:13.110> five<00:01:13.350> power<00:01:13.680> so

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
4 raised to the zero point five power so

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.710 
4 raised to the zero point five power so
four<00:01:14.759> square<00:01:14.940> roots<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.390> either<00:01:15.479> use<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
four square roots you can either use the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.359 
four square roots you can either use the
building<00:01:16.140> function<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:16.619> any<00:01:16.800> of<00:01:16.920> those<00:01:17.009> tricks

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
building function or any of those tricks

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.700 
building function or any of those tricks
once<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.180> get<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.330> cube<00:01:18.659> roots<00:01:18.840> though<00:01:19.080> there

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
once you get to cube roots though there

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.500 
once you get to cube roots though there
is<00:01:19.950> no<00:01:20.220> building<00:01:20.549> function<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> cube<00:01:21.360> root

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
is no building function for a cube root

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.510 
is no building function for a cube root
so<00:01:21.659> you're<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.439> use<00:01:22.740> the

so you're going to have to use the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.550 
so you're going to have to use the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
number 17 and you have to put those in

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.100 
number 17 and you have to put those in
parentheses<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.420> reason<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.900> put<00:01:55.020> it

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
parentheses the reason we have to put it

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.859 
parentheses the reason we have to put it
in<00:01:55.140> parentheses<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.070> Excel<00:01:56.520> always<00:01:57.030> does

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
in parentheses is that Excel always does

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.679 
in parentheses is that Excel always does
the<00:01:58.530> exponents<00:01:59.460> before<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> does<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the exponents before it does the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.450 
the exponents before it does the
division<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.200> multiplication<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.369> in

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
division and multiplication and so in

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.160 
division and multiplication and so in
this<00:02:02.549> case<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.909> would<00:02:03.000> actually<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
this case it would actually get the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.069 
this case it would actually get the
wrong<00:02:04.380> answer<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:05.399> would<00:02:05.520> take<00:02:05.640> be<00:02:06.270> 15<00:02:06.810> raised

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
wrong answer it would take be 15 raised

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.669 
wrong answer it would take be 15 raised
to<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> first<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.790> later<00:02:09.000> /<00:02:09.570> 17<00:02:10.200> which

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
to the first and then later / 17 which

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.750 
to the first and then later / 17 which
would<00:02:10.799> be<00:02:10.860> wrong<00:02:11.040> so<00:02:11.370> when<00:02:11.489> you're<00:02:11.579> doing

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
would be wrong so when you're doing

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.449 
would be wrong so when you're doing
roots<00:02:11.970> make<00:02:12.750> sure<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.930> raise<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.680> number<00:02:13.829> to

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
roots make sure to raise the number to

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.810 
roots make sure to raise the number to
the<00:02:14.489> one<00:02:14.910> over<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.900> route<00:02:16.140> power<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.890> include

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
the one over the route power and include

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.270 
the one over the route power and include
that<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.060> parentheses<00:02:18.890> thanks<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.010> stopping

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
that in parentheses thanks for stopping
