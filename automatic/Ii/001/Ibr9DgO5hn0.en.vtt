can't be genetic which basically means

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.470 
can't be genetic which basically means
that<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.610> passed<00:00:53.910> down<00:00:54.059> from

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
that it can be passed down from

usually<00:00:57.300> come<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.930> around<00:00:58.199> teenage<00:00:58.980> twins<00:00:59.160> all

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
usually come up around teenage twins all

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.299 
usually come up around teenage twins all
ears<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.210> research<00:01:00.600> has<00:01:00.870> shown<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.309> Native
