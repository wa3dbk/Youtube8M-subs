well
now<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:16.949> particular<00:00:17.190> motor<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.880> designed

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
now this particular motor is designed

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.660 
now this particular motor is designed
for<00:00:18.390> eighth<00:00:18.630> scale<00:00:18.960> vehicles<00:00:19.670> more

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
for eighth scale vehicles more

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.279 
for eighth scale vehicles more
specifically<00:00:21.330> for<00:00:21.480> eighth<00:00:21.600> scale<00:00:21.869> buggies

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
specifically for eighth scale buggies

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.080 
specifically for eighth scale buggies
and<00:00:22.320> trucks<00:00:22.830> great<00:00:23.160> motor<00:00:23.400> for<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.760> based<00:00:23.970> on

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
and trucks great motor for that based on

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.630 
and trucks great motor for that based on
the<00:00:24.210> kV<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.779> size<00:00:24.960> there<00:00:25.260> now<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.279> 42

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the kV and the size there now it's a 42

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.790 
the kV and the size there now it's a 42
millimeter<00:00:27.240> diameter<00:00:27.449> motor<00:00:27.930> sixty<00:00:28.680> eight

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
millimeter diameter motor sixty eight

millimeter diameter motor sixty eight
millimeter<00:00:29.130> kin<00:00:29.400> length<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.910> very<00:00:30.630> nicely

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
millimeter kin length and very nicely

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.280 
millimeter kin length and very nicely
finished<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.710> aluminum<00:00:32.960> housing<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:34.110> so

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
finished in a aluminum housing here so

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
finished in a aluminum housing here so
the<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.739> actual<00:00:34.950> motor<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.790> all<00:00:36.180> aluminum

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the the actual motor can is all aluminum

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.160 
the the actual motor can is all aluminum
and<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.620> lightweight<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.399> also<00:00:38.910> has<00:00:39.540> cooling

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and so lightweight and also has cooling

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.869 
and so lightweight and also has cooling
fins<00:00:40.379> built<00:00:40.649> into<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.460> very<00:00:41.700> nice

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
fins built into the can so very nice

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.280 
fins built into the can so very nice
helps<00:00:42.239> keep<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> temperatures<00:00:42.870> down<00:00:42.960> while

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
helps keep the temperatures down while

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.440 
helps keep the temperatures down while
running<00:00:43.489> now<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.730> particular<00:00:45.149> motor<00:00:45.270> is

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
running now this particular motor is

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.209 
running now this particular motor is
sensor<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> sensor<00:00:46.890> port<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
sensor to see the sensor port on the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
sensor to see the sensor port on the
back<00:00:47.370> here

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
back here

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
back here
most<00:00:48.809> guys<00:00:48.960> racing<00:00:49.379> prefer<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> use<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
most guys racing prefer to use the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.130 
most guys racing prefer to use the
sensor<00:00:50.190> motors<00:00:50.610> because<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.420> better

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
sensor motors because you do get better

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.139 
sensor motors because you do get better
startup<00:00:52.710> better<00:00:52.890> acceleration<00:00:53.250> much

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
startup better acceleration much

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.840 
startup better acceleration much
smoother<00:00:54.780> response<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
smoother response with the with the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.580 
smoother response with the with the
sensory<00:00:57.210> motor<00:00:57.360> when<00:00:57.930> compared<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
sensory motor when compared to a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.160 
sensory motor when compared to a
standard<00:00:58.829> at<00:00:59.100> sensorless<00:00:59.430> motor<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.390> nice<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
standard at sensorless motor so nice it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.619 
standard at sensorless motor so nice it
has<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.440> feature<00:01:01.670> now<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.449> give<00:01:03.570> an

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
has that feature now just to give an

now<00:01:33.240> when<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.869> purchase<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.290> motor<00:01:34.530> here

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
now when you purchase this motor here

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.620 
now when you purchase this motor here
you<00:01:34.890> do<00:01:35.070> get<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> sensor<00:01:35.729> wire<00:01:35.909> included<00:01:36.420> so

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you do get the sensor wire included so

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.480 
you do get the sensor wire included so
no<00:01:36.780> need<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> buy<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.380> separately<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.369> it's

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
no need to buy that separately so it's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.679 
no need to buy that separately so it's
