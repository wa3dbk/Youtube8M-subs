00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
we're going to start with the feet

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.769 
we're going to start with the feet
elevated<00:00:28.050> toes<00:00:28.440> on<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.860> wall<00:00:29.450> push-ups<00:00:30.450> with

elevated toes on the wall push-ups with

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.450 
elevated toes on the wall push-ups with
a<00:00:30.840> push-up<00:00:31.050> bar<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:32.010> then<00:00:32.160> we're<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.400> to

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
a push-up bar and then we're going to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.950 
a push-up bar and then we're going to
say<00:00:32.700> great<00:00:32.970> great<00:00:33.180> format<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:33.840> going

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
say great great format it's just going

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.400

to<00:00:34.020> hold<00:00:34.230> back<00:00:34.470> they<00:00:34.980> go<00:00:35.160> into<00:00:35.370> some<00:00:35.700> more

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
to hold back they go into some more

to hold back they go into some more
presses<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:38.010> pauses<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.790> bottom<00:00:39.180> each

presses with pauses of the bottom each
time<00:00:42.410> muscles<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> chest

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.450 

beautiful<00:00:51.780> beautiful<00:00:51.930> exercise<00:00:52.500> combination

beautiful beautiful exercise combination

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.430 
beautiful beautiful exercise combination
again<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.140> movement

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
again I like to think of this movement

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.830 
again I like to think of this movement
as<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.950> reverse<00:00:56.399> bench<00:00:56.700> press<00:00:57.000> action<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.600> so

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
as a reverse bench press action of so

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.080 
as a reverse bench press action of so
again<00:00:58.430> bodybuilders<00:00:59.430> think<00:00:59.730> if<00:00:59.820> there's<00:01:00.000> no

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
again bodybuilders think if there's no

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.389 
again bodybuilders think if there's no
weight<00:01:00.450> on<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.719> bar<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.980> not<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.130> bench

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399

weight on the bar that it's not a bench
press<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:02.880> this<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> exact<00:01:03.660> same<00:01:03.870> motion

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
press but this is the exact same motion

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.370 
press but this is the exact same motion
just<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.130> Reverse<00:01:05.660> telemetry<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:06.840> gravity

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
just with Reverse telemetry and gravity

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.200 
just with Reverse telemetry and gravity
a<00:01:07.560> lot<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.040> core<00:01:08.250> emphasis<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.149> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
a lot of core emphasis because of the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.120 
a lot of core emphasis because of the
ball<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.960> look<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.440> range<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.800> motion

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
ball and look at the range of motion

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310 
ball and look at the range of motion
because<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.550> bar<00:01:11.790> he<00:01:12.450> gets<00:01:12.660> down<00:01:12.899> now<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
because of the bar he gets down now that

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.930 
because of the bar he gets down now that
would<00:01:13.410> be<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.710> taking<00:01:14.039> the<00:01:14.130> bench<00:01:14.369> press<00:01:14.670> bar

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
would be like taking the bench press bar

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.690 
would be like taking the bench press bar
to<00:01:15.509> your<00:01:15.690> neck

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
exhaustion getting some shoulder works

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.580 
exhaustion getting some shoulder works
and<00:01:21.240> tricep<00:01:21.630> work<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.020> most<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> emphasis

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and tricep work but most of the emphasis

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.730 
and tricep work but most of the emphasis
on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> chest<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.060> he'd<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.360> 12<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.810> 15<00:01:25.229> 15<00:01:25.410> to
