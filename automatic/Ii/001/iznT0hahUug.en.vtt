00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
alphabet is going to be the best because

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.690 
alphabet is going to be the best because
they're<00:04:07.989> going<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.200> be<00:04:08.290> typing<00:04:08.560> in<00:04:08.709> words<00:04:08.980> so

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
they're going to be typing in words so

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.539 
they're going to be typing in words so

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
space yes now what that does that

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.050 
space yes now what that does that
basically<00:04:26.530> means<00:04:26.860> if<00:04:27.190> they<00:04:27.580> begin<00:04:27.880> editing

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
basically means if they begin editing

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.089 
basically means if they begin editing
dili<00:04:28.840> everything<00:04:29.349> that's<00:04:29.530> in<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.740> text<00:04:30.070> field

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
dili everything that's in the text field

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.719 
dili everything that's in the text field
and<00:04:30.539> so<00:04:31.539> as<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:31.960> saw<00:04:32.140> more<00:04:32.349> exam

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
and so as you saw more exam

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.329 
and so as you saw more exam
when<00:04:33.089> I<00:04:33.120> clicked<00:04:33.719> on<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.020> alert<00:04:34.339> everything

00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:35.339 
when I clicked on the alert everything

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:36.469 
when I clicked on the alert everything
that<00:04:35.460> was<00:04:35.550> in<00:04:35.639> there<00:04:35.789> before<00:04:35.819> hand<00:04:36.210> had<00:04:36.330> been

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
that was in there before hand had been

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.480 
that was in there before hand had been
deleted<00:04:36.779> which<00:04:37.499> is<00:04:37.680> useful<00:04:37.860> because<00:04:38.219> you

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
deleted which is useful because you

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.649 
deleted which is useful because you
don't<00:04:38.699> want<00:04:38.849> them<00:04:38.939> having<00:04:39.089> to<00:04:39.360> delete

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
don't want them having to delete

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:41.329 
don't want them having to delete
everything<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:40.289> then<00:04:40.409> retype<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:41.039> in<00:04:41.249> because

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:41.339 
everything and then retype it in because

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:44.869 
everything and then retype it in because
that's<00:04:41.550> a<00:04:41.669> bit<00:04:41.789> annoying<00:04:42.469> so<00:04:43.469> next<00:04:43.710> one<00:04:43.949> alert

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:44.879 
that's a bit annoying so next one alert

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:51.379 
that's a bit annoying so next one alert
text<00:04:45.749> field<00:04:46.460> dots<00:04:47.460> clear<00:04:49.460> button<00:04:50.460> mode<00:04:50.909> they

text field dots clear button mode they

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.989 
text field dots clear button mode they
have<00:04:51.779> space<00:04:52.259> equals<00:04:52.680> space<00:04:53.009> and<00:04:53.309> that's<00:04:53.849> going

00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:53.999 
have space equals space and that's going

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:58.309 
have space equals space and that's going
to<00:04:54.059> be<00:04:54.210> UI<00:04:54.569> text<00:04:55.080> field<00:04:56.389> view<00:04:57.389> mode<00:04:57.900> while

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
to be UI text field view mode while

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.159 
to be UI text field view mode while
editing<00:04:58.699> press<00:04:59.699> ENTER<00:04:59.999> and<00:05:00.120> what<00:05:00.839> that<00:05:01.020> does

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
editing press ENTER and what that does

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.709 
editing press ENTER and what that does
that<00:05:01.349> basically<00:05:01.770> adds<00:05:02.159> the<00:05:02.580> X<00:05:02.819> button<00:05:03.029> on<00:05:03.509> side

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
that basically adds the X button on side

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:05.899 
that basically adds the X button on side
of<00:05:03.779> the<00:05:03.990> text<00:05:04.289> field<00:05:04.469> so<00:05:05.069> people<00:05:05.249> can<00:05:05.430> tap<00:05:05.729> it

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
of the text field so people can tap it

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:07.790 
of the text field so people can tap it
and<00:05:05.939> delete<00:05:06.360> whatever<00:05:06.569> they<00:05:06.809> put<00:05:07.020> in<00:05:07.169> if<00:05:07.289> they

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
and delete whatever they put in if they

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.149 
and delete whatever they put in if they
entered<00:05:08.189> it<00:05:08.309> wrong<00:05:08.339> or<00:05:08.669> something<00:05:09.889> so<00:05:10.889> that

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
entered it wrong or something so that

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.799 
entered it wrong or something so that
that's<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.610> quite<00:05:11.789> useful<00:05:12.240> one<00:05:12.330> to<00:05:12.360> know<00:05:12.569> and

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:12.809 
that's a quite useful one to know and

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:14.779 
that's a quite useful one to know and
then<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.199> last<00:05:13.319> one<00:05:13.469> is<00:05:13.589> going<00:05:13.860> to<00:05:14.129> be<00:05:14.339> alert

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
then the last one is going to be alert

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.389 
then the last one is going to be alert
oki<00:05:15.779> put<00:05:15.990> an<00:05:16.169> able<00:05:16.559> alert<00:05:17.159> text<00:05:17.520> field<00:05:17.879> dots

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:19.399 
oki put an able alert text field dots

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:22.790 
oki put an able alert text field dots
keyboard<00:05:20.719> appearance<00:05:21.719> space<00:05:22.229> equal<00:05:22.559> space

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
keyboard appearance space equal space

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.929 
keyboard appearance space equal space
you<00:05:23.219> I<00:05:23.689> keyboard<00:05:24.689> oops<00:05:25.319> you<00:05:26.039> I<00:05:26.069> keyboard<00:05:27.589> or

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:28.939 
you I keyboard oops you I keyboard or

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.850 
you I keyboard oops you I keyboard or
appearance<00:05:29.939> alerts<00:05:30.809> and<00:05:31.080> that<00:05:31.649> basically

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
appearance alerts and that basically

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.399 
appearance alerts and that basically
changes<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.669> keyboard<00:05:33.210> from<00:05:33.479> the<00:05:33.809> default

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
changes the keyboard from the default

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:35.899 
changes the keyboard from the default
one<00:05:34.469> which<00:05:34.800> is<00:05:34.979> if<00:05:35.189> I<00:05:35.309> believe<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:35.729> press

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
one which is if I believe that press

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.939 
one which is if I believe that press
escape<00:05:36.240> you<00:05:36.389> can<00:05:36.509> see<00:05:36.659> default<00:05:37.110> to<00:05:37.620> alerts

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
escape you can see default to alerts

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.129 
escape you can see default to alerts
meaning<00:05:38.550> it's<00:05:38.699> slightly<00:05:39.149> see<00:05:39.539> through<00:05:39.569> just

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
meaning it's slightly see through just

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.869 
meaning it's slightly see through just
like<00:05:40.289> the<00:05:40.469> alert<00:05:40.709> so<00:05:40.979> it<00:05:41.069> kind<00:05:41.249> of<00:05:41.310> fits<00:05:41.610> in

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:41.879 
like the alert so it kind of fits in

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.649 
like the alert so it kind of fits in
with<00:05:42.599> the<00:05:42.629> theme<00:05:43.520> now<00:05:44.520> we<00:05:44.580> need<00:05:44.849> to<00:05:44.879> set<00:05:45.360> the

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
with the theme now we need to set the

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.070 
with the theme now we need to set the
labels<00:05:46.490> text<00:05:47.490> to<00:05:47.819> the<00:05:47.939> text<00:05:48.240> field<00:05:48.419> so<00:05:48.959> if<00:05:49.020> we

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
labels text to the text field so if we

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.439 
labels text to the text field so if we
go<00:05:49.259> down<00:05:49.289> here<00:05:49.469> to<00:05:49.680> our<00:05:49.889> void<00:05:50.459> clicks<00:05:51.300> button

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
go down here to our void clicks button

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.230 
go down here to our void clicks button
our<00:05:51.930> index<00:05:52.289> method<00:05:52.499> and<00:05:52.830> delete<00:05:53.669> all<00:05:53.819> the<00:05:54.029> else

our index method and delete all the else

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.719 
our index method and delete all the else
if<00:05:54.539> statements<00:05:55.110> so<00:05:55.830> we<00:05:55.949> just<00:05:56.159> left<00:05:56.310> with<00:05:56.490> one

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
if statements so we just left with one

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.659 
if statements so we just left with one
if<00:05:56.879> statement<00:05:57.499> now<00:05:58.499> we<00:05:58.560> need<00:05:58.680> to<00:05:58.889> change<00:05:59.129> this

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
if statement now we need to change this

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.179 
if statement now we need to change this
from<00:06:00.180> bad<00:06:00.479> to<00:06:00.930> done<00:06:01.199> because<00:06:01.649> we<00:06:01.830> named<00:06:02.039> it

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:02.189 
from bad to done because we named it

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.269 
from bad to done because we named it
done<00:06:02.459> over<00:06:02.789> there<00:06:03.289> and<00:06:04.289> now<00:06:04.620> we<00:06:04.680> need<00:06:05.009> to<00:06:05.039> do

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:05.279 
done over there and now we need to do

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.939 
done over there and now we need to do
some<00:06:05.520> really<00:06:05.879> basic<00:06:06.120> code<00:06:06.599> and<00:06:06.930> that's<00:06:07.589> just

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
some really basic code and that's just

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.029 
some really basic code and that's just
to<00:06:08.219> say<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.939> alert<00:06:09.270> label<00:06:09.689> dot<00:06:09.899> text<00:06:10.379> equals

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
to say the alert label dot text equals

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.189 
to say the alert label dot text equals
the<00:06:11.370> alert<00:06:12.180> text<00:06:12.870> field<00:06:13.339> text<00:06:14.719> and<00:06:15.719> that's

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
the alert text field text and that's

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.659 
the alert text field text and that's
really<00:06:16.620> simple<00:06:16.770> code<00:06:17.129> if<00:06:17.339> you<00:06:17.459> don't

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
really simple code if you don't

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.399 
really simple code if you don't
understand<00:06:18.120> that<00:06:18.330> then<00:06:18.539> I<00:06:18.749> don't<00:06:18.839> even<00:06:19.229> know

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
understand that then I don't even know

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:20.989 
understand that then I don't even know
how<00:06:19.589> supposed<00:06:19.949> to<00:06:20.039> explain<00:06:20.339> it<00:06:20.550> to<00:06:20.669> you<00:06:20.819> so

00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:20.999 
how supposed to explain it to you so

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:23.570 
how supposed to explain it to you so
basically<00:06:21.360> when<00:06:21.629> the<00:06:21.659> user<00:06:22.229> clicks<00:06:22.349> done<00:06:22.889> the

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
basically when the user clicks done the

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.579 
basically when the user clicks done the
labels<00:06:24.059> text<00:06:24.389> is<00:06:24.509> going<00:06:24.689> to<00:06:24.749> equal<00:06:24.899> the<00:06:25.289> text

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:25.589 
labels text is going to equal the text

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:27.589 
labels text is going to equal the text
fields<00:06:25.889> text<00:06:26.279> so<00:06:26.969> that<00:06:26.999> means<00:06:27.360> whatever

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
fields text so that means whatever

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:30.019 
fields text so that means whatever
they've<00:06:27.899> typed<00:06:28.110> in<00:06:28.349> and<00:06:28.559> so<00:06:29.459> there<00:06:29.909> you<00:06:29.969> go

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:30.029 
they've typed in and so there you go

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:31.850 
they've typed in and so there you go
guys<00:06:30.120> that's<00:06:30.749> all<00:06:31.020> the<00:06:31.139> code<00:06:31.319> we<00:06:31.469> need<00:06:31.680> we

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
guys that's all the code we need we

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.199 
guys that's all the code we need we
don't<00:06:31.889> need<00:06:32.099> to<00:06:32.279> go<00:06:32.370> into<00:06:32.490> interface<00:06:32.909> builder

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:33.209 
don't need to go into interface builder

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:35.799 
don't need to go into interface builder
because<00:06:33.479> it's<00:06:33.870> all<00:06:34.080> generated<00:06:34.709> by<00:06:34.919> code<00:06:35.159> here

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:35.809 
because it's all generated by code here

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:38.809 
because it's all generated by code here
so<00:06:36.809> now<00:06:37.439> we<00:06:37.499> can<00:06:37.709> build<00:06:37.860> a<00:06:38.009> run<00:06:38.159> and<00:06:38.370> cyril

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 
so now we can build a run and cyril

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:41.800 
so now we can build a run and cyril
look--<00:06:39.349> so<00:06:40.349> here's<00:06:40.529> the<00:06:40.620> simulator<00:06:41.099> here<00:06:41.370> and

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
look-- so here's the simulator here and

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.790 
look-- so here's the simulator here and
there's<00:06:42.810> our<00:06:43.050> thing<00:06:43.409> and<00:06:43.439> if<00:06:43.649> we<00:06:43.709> click

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
there's our thing and if we click

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.860 
there's our thing and if we click
generate<00:06:44.159> a<00:06:44.279> look

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
generate a look

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.150 
generate a look
outputs<00:06:45.530> are<00:06:46.420> I<00:06:47.420> love<00:06:48.020> you<00:06:48.050> just<00:06:48.620> forgot<00:06:48.860> aware

if I click enter you see that the

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.170 
if I click enter you see that the
keyboard<00:07:02.900> disappears<00:07:03.640> so<00:07:04.640> that's<00:07:04.880> another

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
keyboard disappears so that's another

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.320 
keyboard disappears so that's another
thing<00:07:05.420> that<00:07:05.600> will<00:07:05.750> happen<00:07:05.780> and<00:07:06.400> so<00:07:07.400> they<00:07:08.120> go
