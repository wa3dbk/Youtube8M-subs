it's<00:00:03.810> my<00:00:04.049> Baja<00:00:04.440> buggy<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.420> just<00:00:06.420> over<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
it's my Baja buggy and just over the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.470 
it's my Baja buggy and just over the
past<00:00:07.319> weekend<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.160> had<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> little<00:00:09.150> incident

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
past weekend I had a little incident

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.600 
past weekend I had a little incident
with<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.910> the<00:00:12.049> clutch<00:00:13.049> bail<00:00:13.460> apparently<00:00:14.460> had

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
with it the clutch bail apparently had

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.590 
with it the clutch bail apparently had
come<00:00:14.849> loose<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.890> it<00:00:16.890> has<00:00:17.420> what<00:00:18.420> you're

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
come loose and it has what you're

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.060 
come loose and it has what you're
probably<00:00:18.869> not<00:00:19.199> going<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.410> be<00:00:19.560> able<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.830> see

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
probably not going to be able to see

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.620 
probably not going to be able to see
because<00:00:20.400> they're<00:00:20.580> fine<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:20.939> they're<00:00:21.359> fine

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
because they're fine but they're fine

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.189 
because they're fine but they're fine
cracks<00:00:22.109> along<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.949> sides<00:00:23.250> here<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.199> that

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
cracks along the sides here and that

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.040 
cracks along the sides here and that
caused<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:26.000> gear<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.119> get<00:00:27.300> loose<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.779> there

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
caused the gear to get loose on there

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.010 
caused the gear to get loose on there
and<00:00:28.349> then<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.740> strip<00:00:29.070> out<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:30.240> spur<00:00:30.929> gear<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
and then to strip out the spur gear so I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.130 
and then to strip out the spur gear so I
bought<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> new<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.329> think<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.840> lie

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
bought a new one but I think the lie

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
bought a new one but I think the lie
either<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.590> Loctite<00:00:38.160> had<00:00:38.399> come<00:00:38.640> loose<00:00:38.879> that

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
either the Loctite had come loose that

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.520 
either the Loctite had come loose that
they<00:00:39.329> had<00:00:39.510> put<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.840> there<00:00:40.020> because<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.350> was

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
they had put in there because this was

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.100 
they had put in there because this was
already<00:00:40.739> built<00:00:41.160> when<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.430> got<00:00:41.670> it

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
already built when I got it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.880 
already built when I got it
were<00:00:43.430> it<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.760> cracked<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.480> don't<00:00:45.809> know<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.230> was

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
were it just cracked I don't know I was

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.440 
were it just cracked I don't know I was
getting<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.640> more<00:00:47.820> torque<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.420> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
getting a little bit more torque out of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.510 
getting a little bit more torque out of
this<00:00:48.719> now<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> new<00:00:49.440> Dominator<00:00:50.039> muffler

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
this now with the new Dominator muffler

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.600 
this now with the new Dominator muffler
and<00:00:50.550> those<00:00:50.850> tires<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:52.230> hostile<00:00:52.710> tires<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.370> mean

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and those tires the hostile tires I mean

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.279 
and those tires the hostile tires I mean
this<00:00:53.760> thing<00:00:54.000> started<00:00:54.420> wheeling<00:00:54.629> which<00:00:55.110> it

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
this thing started wheeling which it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.049 
this thing started wheeling which it
never<00:00:55.469> did<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.579> could<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.850> been<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
never did so it could have been the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.639 
never did so it could have been the
added<00:00:57.390> extra<00:00:57.780> torque<00:00:58.109> I'm<00:00:58.379> not<00:00:58.649> sure<00:01:00.649> but

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
added extra torque I'm not sure but

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.539 
added extra torque I'm not sure but
anyways<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.460> decided<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> complete

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
anyways I decided to do a complete

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.870 
anyways I decided to do a complete
overhaul<00:01:06.680> I<00:01:07.680> had<00:01:08.220> bought<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.850> back<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:10.880> 2010

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
overhaul I had bought this back in 2010

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.780 
overhaul I had bought this back in 2010
and<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:13.170> didn't<00:01:13.500> use<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.920> till<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> spring<00:01:14.369> of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
and I didn't use it till the spring of

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.840 
and I didn't use it till the spring of
2011<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.530> haven't<00:01:16.770> overhauled<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.549> since

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
2011 and I haven't overhauled it since

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.980 
2011 and I haven't overhauled it since
then<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.540> never<00:01:19.259> overhauled<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.750> but<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.840> got

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
then I never overhauled this but you got

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.840 
then I never overhauled this but you got
to<00:01:22.110> remember<00:01:22.170> guys<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.680> didn't<00:01:23.220> use<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.670> lot

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
to remember guys I didn't use it a lot

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.810 
to remember guys I didn't use it a lot
one<00:01:24.540> summer<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> rained<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:25.650> summer<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.340> I'm

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
one summer and rained all summer and I'm

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.340 
one summer and rained all summer and I'm
in<00:01:26.970> New<00:01:27.090> England<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.689> don't<00:01:27.900> use<00:01:28.110> these

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
in New England so we don't use these

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.960 
in New England so we don't use these
things<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.979> California<00:01:29.189> or<00:01:29.820> Florida

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
things like in California or Florida

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.010 
things like in California or Florida
year-round

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
year-round

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.469 
year-round
so<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:32.100> didn't<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> lot<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.790> miles<00:01:33.119> on

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
so really didn't have a lot of miles on

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.840 
so really didn't have a lot of miles on
it<00:01:33.680> but<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> clutch<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.970> bearing<00:01:37.520> in<00:01:38.520> there

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
it but the clutch the bearing in there

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.980 
it but the clutch the bearing in there
on<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.270> back<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:41.400> gear<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:45.540> bearing

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
on in back of the gear and the bearing

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.539 
on in back of the gear and the bearing
and<00:01:46.110> back<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> spur<00:01:46.829> here<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
and back of the spur here and the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.810 
and back of the spur here and the
bearing<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.000> back<00:01:48.350> are<00:01:49.350> actually<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.159> front<00:01:50.460> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
bearing in back are actually in front of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.590 
bearing in back are actually in front of
the<00:01:51.090> clutch<00:01:51.329> belt<00:01:51.689> we're<00:01:52.320> both<00:01:52.530> very<00:01:52.860> dry<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:54.540> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the clutch belt we're both very dry so I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.060 
the clutch belt we're both very dry so I
read<00:01:54.960> grease<00:01:55.259> those<00:01:55.470> I'm<00:01:55.710> gonna<00:01:55.860> make<00:01:56.040> another

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
read grease those I'm gonna make another

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.850 
read grease those I'm gonna make another
video<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.759> show<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.000> how<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:58.500> I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
video and show you how to do that but I

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.660 
video and show you how to do that but I
decided<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.119> make<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> little<00:02:00.540> video<00:02:00.810> here

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
decided just to make a little video here

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.959 
decided just to make a little video here
and<00:02:03.259> I'm<00:02:04.259> gonna<00:02:04.560> zoom<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.219> best<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.640> can

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
and I'm gonna zoom in the best I can

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.869 
and I'm gonna zoom in the best I can
here<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.450> try<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> keep<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> camera<00:02:07.819> on<00:02:08.819> that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
here and try to keep the camera on that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.910 
here and try to keep the camera on that
but<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:09.509> I'm<00:02:09.629> gonna<00:02:09.720> do<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.110> take<00:02:10.349> apart<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
but what I'm gonna do is take apart the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.460 
but what I'm gonna do is take apart the
differential<00:02:11.640> now

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
differential now

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.160 
differential now
and<00:02:12.880> show<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:13.940> what's<00:02:14.240> inside<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:15.020> and

and show you what's inside of it and
we're<00:02:15.320> gonna<00:02:15.410> see<00:02:15.710> how<00:02:15.890> bad<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:17.360> silicone

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930
