00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
obviously he's a fast tiller and just

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.320 
obviously he's a fast tiller and just
watching<00:02:09.950> him<00:02:10.160> from<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.369> sidelines<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.090> I<00:02:11.150> me

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
watching him from the sidelines and I me

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.300 
watching him from the sidelines and I me
it<00:02:11.390> was<00:02:11.510> really<00:02:11.600> hard<00:02:11.960> to<00:02:12.050> imagine<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.860> but

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
it was really hard to imagine that but

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.340 
it was really hard to imagine that but
nine<00:02:13.490> days<00:02:13.760> ago<00:02:14.030> he<00:02:14.240> was<00:02:14.390> he<00:02:14.780> was<00:02:14.900> having<00:02:15.170> the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
nine days ago he was he was having the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.920 
nine days ago he was he was having the
invasive<00:02:15.920> surgery<00:02:16.340> but<00:02:16.520> he<00:02:16.850> looked<00:02:17.030> sharp<00:02:17.660> and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
invasive surgery but he looked sharp and

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.840 
invasive surgery but he looked sharp and
through<00:02:18.110> some<00:02:18.320> really<00:02:18.470> crisp<00:02:18.830> passes<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.520> I

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
through some really crisp passes and I

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.000 
through some really crisp passes and I
think<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.630> was<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.780> good<00:02:21.080> return<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.530> camp<00:02:21.770> for

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
think it was a good return to camp for

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.320 
think it was a good return to camp for
him<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.400> wasn't<00:02:22.670> like<00:02:22.760> he<00:02:22.880> wasn't<00:02:23.060> heavily

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
him and it wasn't like he wasn't heavily

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.390 
him and it wasn't like he wasn't heavily
involved<00:02:23.840> with<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:24.470> team<00:02:24.740> for<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.160> last

involved with this team for the last

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.250
