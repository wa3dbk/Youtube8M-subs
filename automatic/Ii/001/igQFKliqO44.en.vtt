00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
do what we did you know it was not

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.230 
do what we did you know it was not
really<00:03:41.750> selective<00:03:42.460> courses<00:03:43.460> and<00:03:43.640> we<00:03:44.030> made

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
really selective courses and we made

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.850 
really selective courses and we made
them<00:03:44.360> selectively<00:03:44.960> you<00:03:45.140> know<00:03:45.260> we<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.740> know

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
them selectively you know we you know

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.620 
them selectively you know we you know
hundred<00:03:46.250> people<00:03:46.400> finish<00:03:46.880> this<00:03:47.000> race<00:03:47.270> and<00:03:47.570> I

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
hundred people finish this race and I

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.080 
hundred people finish this race and I
would<00:03:47.990> I<00:03:48.230> think<00:03:48.620> we<00:03:48.710> can<00:03:48.830> take<00:03:49.010> pride<00:03:49.340> in<00:03:49.370> and

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
would I think we can take pride in and

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.670 
would I think we can take pride in and
being<00:03:50.330> responsible<00:03:50.510> for<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:53.530> we<00:03:54.530> had<00:03:54.650> a

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
being responsible for that so we had a

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.620 
being responsible for that so we had a
great<00:03:54.950> time<00:03:55.190> but<00:03:55.460> the<00:03:55.760> biggest<00:03:55.970> thing<00:03:56.270> is<00:03:56.420> is

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
great time but the biggest thing is is

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.100 
great time but the biggest thing is is
we<00:03:57.320> came<00:03:57.530> together<00:03:57.710> as<00:03:57.950> a<00:03:58.070> team<00:03:58.510> we<00:03:59.510> all<00:03:59.540> came

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
we came together as a team we all came

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.360 
we came together as a team we all came
up<00:04:00.290> with<00:04:00.440> objectives<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.100> we<00:04:01.190> never

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
up with objectives and we never

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.860 
up with objectives and we never
second-guess<00:04:02.000> ourselves<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.720> saw

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
second-guess ourselves and you saw

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.360 
second-guess ourselves and you saw
Christian<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.590> he<00:04:03.740> knew<00:04:03.860> what<00:04:04.010> he<00:04:04.100> had<00:04:04.130> to

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
Christian to that he knew what he had to

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.470 
Christian to that he knew what he had to
do<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:04.760> he<00:04:04.820> did<00:04:05.000> it

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.949 

sure<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.290> race<00:04:11.440> does<00:04:11.709> scare<00:04:12.040> away<00:04:12.159> sprinters

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
sure the race does scare away sprinters

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.869 
sure the race does scare away sprinters
because<00:04:13.959> it's<00:04:14.110> so<00:04:14.319> hard<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:15.400> know<00:04:15.519> this<00:04:15.849> this

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
because it's so hard you know this this

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.849

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
a week you know but I there's always a

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.390 
a week you know but I there's always a
nice<00:04:46.150> balance<00:04:46.479> to<00:04:46.750> strike<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:48.280> know<00:04:48.370> I

nice balance to strike and you know I

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.850 
nice balance to strike and you know I
think<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:49.229> important<00:04:50.229> thing<00:04:50.289> is<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:50.500> make<00:04:50.710> the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
think the important thing is to make the

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.730 
think the important thing is to make the
race<00:04:51.010> exciting<00:04:51.580> every<00:04:51.820> day<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.210> I<00:04:53.050> I<00:04:53.289> think

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
race exciting every day and I I think

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.260 
race exciting every day and I I think
this<00:04:53.830> was<00:04:53.979> a<00:04:54.010> pretty<00:04:54.160> exciting<00:04:54.669> race<00:04:54.850> of

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
this was a pretty exciting race of

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.700 
this was a pretty exciting race of
course<00:04:55.510> personally<00:04:55.900> I<00:04:55.960> wouldn't<00:04:56.169> complain<00:04:56.650> if

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
course personally I wouldn't complain if

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.740 
course personally I wouldn't complain if
there<00:04:57.010> was<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.160> another<00:04:57.669> sprint<00:04:57.970> stage<00:04:58.240> next

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
there was a another sprint stage next

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.920 
there was a another sprint stage next
year<00:04:59.110> but<00:04:59.380> but<00:05:00.130> I<00:05:00.340> guess<00:05:00.520> I<00:05:00.669> I<00:05:00.699> mean<00:05:01.030> I<00:05:01.300> have

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
year but but I guess I I mean I have

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.270 
year but but I guess I I mean I have
nothing<00:05:02.080> but<00:05:02.320> positive<00:05:02.470> things<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:03.039> take<00:05:03.220> away

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
nothing but positive things to take away

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.370 
nothing but positive things to take away
from<00:05:03.550> this<00:05:03.820> week<00:05:04.030> I<00:05:04.240> think<00:05:04.270> every<00:05:05.110> day<00:05:05.229> was

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
from this week I think every day was

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.659 
from this week I think every day was
exciting<00:05:05.860> like<00:05:06.039> you<00:05:06.130> said<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.400> leader's

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
exciting like you said the leader's

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.279 
exciting like you said the leader's
jersey<00:05:06.729> changed<00:05:07.389> back<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:07.780> forth<00:05:07.990> constantly

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
jersey changed back and forth constantly

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.330 
jersey changed back and forth constantly
and<00:05:09.030> it<00:05:10.030> was<00:05:10.270> really<00:05:10.419> good<00:05:10.660> racing<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.340> good

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
and it was really good racing and good

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.279 
and it was really good racing and good
watch<00:05:12.520> on<00:05:12.729> TV<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:13.060> would<00:05:13.270> imagine<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.870> it<00:05:14.169> was

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
watch on TV I would imagine and it was

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.789 
watch on TV I would imagine and it was
fun<00:05:14.500> to<00:05:14.530> do<00:05:14.740> is<00:05:14.889> ask<00:05:15.160> one<00:05:15.430> of<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.610> riders
