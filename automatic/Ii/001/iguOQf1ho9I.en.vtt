she<00:01:32.740> became<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.100> mother<00:01:33.460> she<00:01:33.820> made<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.150> choice

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
she became a mother she made that choice

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.690

to put the bottle away and make sure

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.330 
to put the bottle away and make sure
that<00:01:36.850> it's<00:01:37.030> not<00:01:37.180> in<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.390> house<00:01:37.690> so<00:01:38.290> I
