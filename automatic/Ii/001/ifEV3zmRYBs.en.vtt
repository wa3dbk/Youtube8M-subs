the<00:01:42.240> fractional<00:01:42.659> restore<00:01:43.399> this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.970> really

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the fractional restore this is a really

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.469 
the fractional restore this is a really
good<00:01:45.750> result<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> newer<00:01:48.060> laser

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
good result we this is a newer laser

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.780 
good result we this is a newer laser
than<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> original<00:01:49.409> Fraxel<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.399> was<00:01:50.640> on

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
than the original Fraxel that was on

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
than the original Fraxel that was on
that<00:01:50.820> was<00:01:51.119> briefly<00:01:51.450> introduced<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.140> was<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
that was briefly introduced it was the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.560 
that was briefly introduced it was the
first<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.009> fractional<00:01:53.520> lasers<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.299> used

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
first of the fractional lasers and used

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.819 
first of the fractional lasers and used
a<00:01:54.659> blue<00:01:54.899> dye<00:01:55.490> restores<00:01:56.490> amount<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.329> a

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
a blue dye restores amount of is a

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.780 
a blue dye restores amount of is a
improvement<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.520> less

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
improvement on that it's less

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.630 
improvement on that it's less
uncomfortable<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.689> gives<00:02:01.590> better<00:02:01.979> results

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
uncomfortable and gives better results

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.819 
uncomfortable and gives better results
here's<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.969> stretch<00:02:03.270> mark<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> abdomen<00:02:04.259> you

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
here's a stretch mark on the abdomen you

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.999 
here's a stretch mark on the abdomen you
can<00:02:04.920> see<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.369> after<00:02:05.909> person<00:02:06.479> after<00:02:07.009> abdomen

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
can see the after person after abdomen

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.650 
can see the after person after abdomen
has<00:02:08.190> much<00:02:08.489> fewer<00:02:08.520> stretch<00:02:09.119> marks<00:02:09.450> they're

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
has much fewer stretch marks they're

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.260 
has much fewer stretch marks they're
fainter<00:02:10.170> they're<00:02:10.379> narrower

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
fainter they're narrower

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.080 
fainter they're narrower
and<00:02:11.390> even<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.320> scar<00:02:12.620> above<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.370> belly<00:02:13.700> button

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
and even the scar above the belly button

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.570 
and even the scar above the belly button
is<00:02:14.390> better<00:02:15.080> as<00:02:15.320> well<00:02:15.590> interesting<00:02:16.430> all<00:02:16.550> right

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
is better as well interesting all right

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.890 
is better as well interesting all right
we<00:02:16.760> have<00:02:16.880> one<00:02:16.910> more<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.210> believe<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:17.690> show

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
we have one more I believe this show

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.990 
we have one more I believe this show
okay<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.620> this<00:02:18.770> is<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.950> pigment<00:02:19.220> issue<00:02:19.640> and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
okay and this is a pigment issue and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.780 
okay and this is a pigment issue and
this<00:02:20.120> patient<00:02:20.600> has<00:02:20.750> severe<00:02:21.260> melasma<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
this patient has severe melasma that the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.400 
this patient has severe melasma that the
pigment<00:02:23.420> changes<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.900> can<00:02:24.020> come<00:02:24.260> with

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
pigment changes that can come with

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.160 
pigment changes that can come with
pregnancy<00:02:24.860> exactly<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:26.000> after<00:02:26.930> four

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
pregnancy exactly and after four

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.590 
pregnancy exactly and after four
treatments<00:02:27.500> greatly<00:02:28.220> reduced<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.940> if<00:02:29.330> she

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
treatments greatly reduced and if she

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.420 
treatments greatly reduced and if she
wanted<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.900> continue<00:02:30.230> she<00:02:30.620> still<00:02:30.890> has<00:02:31.070> some<00:02:31.280> on

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
wanted to continue she still has some on

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.250 
wanted to continue she still has some on
the<00:02:31.520> after<00:02:31.940> but<00:02:32.120> we<00:02:32.180> could<00:02:32.360> continue<00:02:32.660> instant

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
the after but we could continue instant

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.140 
the after but we could continue instant
and<00:02:33.410> we<00:02:33.740> continue<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.280> see<00:02:34.430> some<00:02:34.610> improvement

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
and we continue to see some improvement

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.430 
and we continue to see some improvement
all<00:02:35.270> right<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.510> see<00:02:35.660> there's<00:02:35.840> also<00:02:36.020> another

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
all right you see there's also another

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.690 
all right you see there's also another
treatment<00:02:36.770> that<00:02:37.010> can<00:02:37.190> even<00:02:37.310> be<00:02:37.400> more

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
treatment that can even be more

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.280 
treatment that can even be more
aggressive<00:02:38.210> if<00:02:38.360> we<00:02:38.510> want<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.750> be<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.900> little<00:02:39.140> bit

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
aggressive if we want to be a little bit

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.930 
aggressive if we want to be a little bit
more<00:02:39.470> aggressive<00:02:40.010> then<00:02:40.250> we<00:02:40.460> go<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.670> a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
more aggressive then we go to a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.330 
more aggressive then we go to a
fractional<00:02:41.600> co2<00:02:41.840> laser<00:02:42.170> like<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.860> smart<00:02:43.100> side

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
fractional co2 laser like the smart side

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.840 
fractional co2 laser like the smart side
dot<00:02:43.610> okay<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.590> difference<00:02:46.040> with<00:02:46.460> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
dot okay and the difference with the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.350 
dot okay and the difference with the
Fraxel<00:02:47.810> restorer<00:02:48.530> versus<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.640> smart<00:02:50.120> side

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
Fraxel restorer versus the smart side

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.320 
Fraxel restorer versus the smart side
dot<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:51.320> when<00:02:51.950> we<00:02:52.070> do<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.430> little<00:02:52.700> dots<00:02:52.940> with

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
dot is when we do the little dots with

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.750 
dot is when we do the little dots with
the<00:02:53.600> smart<00:02:54.080> side<00:02:54.380> with<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.040> carbon<00:02:55.370> dioxide

the smart side with the carbon dioxide
what<00:02:56.510> is<00:02:56.690> inside<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.350> dot<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:57.680> actually

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
what is inside the dot is actually

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.580 
what is inside the dot is actually
vaporized<00:02:58.640> it's<00:02:58.970> turn<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.330> gas<00:02:59.570> so<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.380> can

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
vaporized it's turn to gas so you can

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.950 
vaporized it's turn to gas so you can
see<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.130> really<00:03:01.550> great<00:03:01.910> improvement<00:03:02.810> in

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
see the really great improvement in

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.320 
see the really great improvement in
wrinkles<00:03:03.650> around<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.040> eyes<00:03:04.400> here<00:03:05.030> in<00:03:05.150> this

a touch-up I got to tell you I can't
really<00:03:33.980> tell<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.250> difference<00:03:34.340> when<00:03:34.820> you<00:03:34.940> use

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
really tell the difference when you use

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150 
really tell the difference when you use
one<00:03:35.390> as<00:03:35.630> opposed<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.410> other<00:03:36.560> tell<00:03:36.950> us<00:03:37.040> the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
difference well the biggest difference

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.380 
difference well the biggest difference
way<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.290> choose<00:03:39.710> is<00:03:40.040> folks<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.180> need<00:03:41.360> a

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
little more tightening should probably

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.240 
little more tightening should probably
go<00:03:44.030> as<00:03:44.150> smart<00:03:44.390> side<00:03:44.630> dot<00:03:44.900> anyone<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.040> really

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
go as smart side dot anyone that really

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.030 
go as smart side dot anyone that really

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
know should come in for a consult and we

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.480 
know should come in for a consult and we
can<00:03:52.760> tell<00:03:52.970> them<00:03:53.120> but<00:03:53.780> some<00:03:54.320> general<00:03:54.800> rules<00:03:54.980> if

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
can tell them but some general rules if

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.540 
can tell them but some general rules if
you<00:03:56.480> are<00:03:56.780> darker<00:03:57.140> skin<00:03:57.470> you'd<00:03:58.070> want<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.400> go

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
you are darker skin you'd want to go

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.640 
you are darker skin you'd want to go
with<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.790> Fraxel<00:03:59.240> because<00:03:59.690> it's<00:03:59.870> just<00:04:00.170> safer

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
with the Fraxel because it's just safer

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.430 
with the Fraxel because it's just safer
and<00:04:00.950> then<00:04:01.550> the<00:04:02.030> dot<00:04:02.270> is<00:04:02.840> then<00:04:03.020> the<00:04:03.110> carbon

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
and then the dot is then the carbon

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.770 
and then the dot is then the carbon
dioxide<00:04:03.500> laser<00:04:03.950> is<00:04:04.280> on<00:04:04.490> darker<00:04:05.180> individuals

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
dioxide laser is on darker individuals

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.630 
dioxide laser is on darker individuals
if<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:06.980> are<00:04:07.840> wanting<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:09.050> real<00:04:09.740> short<00:04:10.070> downtime

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
if you are wanting a real short downtime

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.270 
if you are wanting a real short downtime
the<00:04:10.820> Fraxel<00:04:11.209> has<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.810> shorter<00:04:12.260> downtime<00:04:12.860> and

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
the Fraxel has a shorter downtime and

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.250 
the Fraxel has a shorter downtime and
you're<00:04:13.430> seeing<00:04:13.730> again<00:04:14.150> yeah<00:04:14.480> this<00:04:14.660> is<00:04:14.840> darker

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
you're seeing again yeah this is darker

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.199 
you're seeing again yeah this is darker
skin<00:04:15.470> individuals<00:04:16.070> getting<00:04:16.280> Fraxel<00:04:16.970> that

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
skin individuals getting Fraxel that

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.060 
skin individuals getting Fraxel that
depends<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.750> which<00:04:17.959> one<00:04:18.170> you<00:04:18.200> get<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.530> use<00:04:18.650> and

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
depends to which one you get to use and

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.600 
depends to which one you get to use and
so<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.419> Fraxel<00:04:21.260> has<00:04:21.560> only<00:04:21.830> a<00:04:21.919> day<00:04:22.130> or<00:04:22.310> two<00:04:22.460> of

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
so the Fraxel has only a day or two of

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.290 
so the Fraxel has only a day or two of
downtime

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
downtime

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.240 
downtime
smartside<00:04:23.900> has<00:04:24.169> five<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.590> seven<00:04:24.919> days<00:04:24.949> of

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
smartside has five to seven days of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.920 
smartside has five to seven days of
downtime<00:04:25.699> the<00:04:26.560> so<00:04:28.000> which<00:04:29.000> how<00:04:29.539> many<00:04:29.599> days<00:04:29.900> can

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
downtime the so which how many days can

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.839 
downtime the so which how many days can
you<00:04:30.259> afford<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.620> be<00:04:30.740> out<00:04:30.770> is<00:04:31.160> a<00:04:31.400> good<00:04:31.699> way<00:04:31.819> of

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
you afford to be out is a good way of

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.059 
you afford to be out is a good way of
choosing<00:04:32.180> real<00:04:32.629> quickly<00:04:33.020> tell<00:04:33.229> me<00:04:33.259> about<00:04:33.440> the

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
choosing real quickly tell me about the

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.649 
choosing real quickly tell me about the
number<00:04:34.280> of<00:04:34.370> treatments<00:04:34.759> and<00:04:34.909> costs<00:04:35.360> because

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:35.659 
number of treatments and costs because

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:36.850 
number of treatments and costs because
you've<00:04:35.900> got<00:04:36.020> something<00:04:36.319> special<00:04:36.349> going<00:04:36.650> on

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
you've got something special going on

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.950 
you've got something special going on
especially<00:04:37.190> one<00:04:37.639> with<00:04:37.909> Fraxel<00:04:38.419> we<00:04:38.539> typically

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
especially one with Fraxel we typically

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.740 
especially one with Fraxel we typically
do<00:04:39.319> four<00:04:39.830> treatments<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.759> the<00:04:41.419> fracture

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
do four treatments and the fracture

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.879 
do four treatments and the fracture
restore<00:04:42.080> we're<00:04:42.289> trying<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.590> get<00:04:42.710> more

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
restore we're trying to get more

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.800 
restore we're trying to get more
exposure<00:04:43.250> so<00:04:43.669> we've<00:04:43.819> actually<00:04:43.970> cut<00:04:44.419> the<00:04:44.569> cost

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
exposure so we've actually cut the cost

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.080 
exposure so we've actually cut the cost
of<00:04:45.020> our<00:04:45.169> treatments<00:04:45.650> in<00:04:45.770> half<00:04:46.009> so<00:04:46.759> if<00:04:46.849> we're

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
of our treatments in half so if we're

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.670 
of our treatments in half so if we're
going<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.419> get<00:04:47.599> people<00:04:47.780> interested<00:04:48.139> to<00:04:48.530> give
