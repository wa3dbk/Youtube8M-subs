00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.330
 Well, this is the presentation of the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.670
 first that we have to do I'm in 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.460
 the viewer that the letters stand in 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.770
 four heaps 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.760
 it does not matter how you always separate them and 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.680
 when I complete in the four piles 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.170
 in four cycles I explain myself 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.890
 it does not matter if I do it without meaning 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.740
 so round the diagonal action in 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.950
 the opposite way but I can not put 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.950
 never two followed or anything like that 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.190
 now 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.190
 well redondito 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:53.350
 and once we have the heaps 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.630
 We ask the public to choose two the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.410
 you want, no matter how they see that is a 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.910
 pretty trick for example these two 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.430
 pretty volunteer pretty dependent 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.590
 from the public I take our two and the 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.930
 we cut in half as precisely 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.470
 possible with the two that we have been left 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.470
 we do the same 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.430
 good 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.390
 and we would have two piles with which 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.050
 we do the same we embrace the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.050
 american 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.110
 ok now we have only one heap 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.620
 and we separated them into a group of 16 of 22 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.620
 to 16 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.990
 76 here is 20 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.740
 18 19 and 20 and here they would have to create us 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.740
 16 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.520
 56 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.280
 15 6 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.770
 now you can invent the story that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.149
 you want me what I have invented is that 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.610
 These letters are quite new 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.099
 and then they have not yet been made 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.150
 friends of the letters of another color here 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.810
 there are the red ones that are black 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.510
 sewage have not made us friends without 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.659
 however the center stack that are 20 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.390
 as they are 20 years old if they have been made 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.730
 friends of the others therefore in a 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.799
 the tiny piles are only 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.470
 there's a single color here 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.040
 for example the red ones we can see that no 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.040
 there is no black 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.990
 here are only blacks we can see 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.540
 that there is no red 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.140
 and in a lot of the center that are more 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.940
 older have decided to become friends and 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.250
 there are 10 red and black ex 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.650
 let's count 123456789 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.750
 we place to create blacks in the other 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.010
 'red' okay and now let's tell 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.189
 how many fat 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.800
 one two three four five six seven 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:14.070
 eight nine and ten 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.070
 Well this is the presentation of the trick 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.730
 mothers and cos I will explain how 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.260
 perform this trick that in the end is 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.290
 pretty simple the only thing that requires 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.240
 is a placement of the cards does not have 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.670
 what to carry has to be black at 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.270
 beginning 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.230
 and the red after or the reverse the red ones 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:37.620
 before and after black 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.459
 simply because I think it's the best 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.650
 card of the deck 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.930
 I think the riverbank but that's things 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.650
 watch us do it as you want then 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.940
 the spectator has to do the groups 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.940
 of four starting at the top 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.940
 shuffle so that in the cards two down 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.319
 but in every heap that is the same 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:06.360
 number of each heap at this time does not 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:12.280
 I know if it's 12 648 12 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:16.180
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.060
 there are half reds below and the 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.820
 half black above that's why you 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.720
 they did in all happen the same 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.810
 viewer decision to choose two 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.120
 random lots whoever wants to 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.650
 example already being all around 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.950
 and the deck is American 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.440
 precisely possible 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.080
 trying to get a letter from is a 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.710
 letter from this so they stay below 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.270
 the red one and the black one above are 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.420
 the red ones and here they start 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.639
 intercalate black red black red 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.770
 black because we are not very precise 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.069
 there is always a margin of 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.069
 mistake 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.080
 here we welcome the other two buttons 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.000
 we do exactly the same 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.000
 we shuffle equally 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:13.800
 and the leaves are left here below red 

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:16.259
 and black and here I will leave the black 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.960
 now these two heaps as follows 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.729
 having the order of red below 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.770
 then red and black and then only 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.940
 we black them again to shuffle another 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.360
 time we can be 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.820
 and we will have the red ones below 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:39.150
 the red ones and the black ones and the black ones 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:42.150
 everything we do in 2016 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.150
 yes 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.370
 and 2016 sorry but talkers who do not 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.030
 I can speak against it at the same time 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.030
 man I'm sorry 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.530
 and here the 16 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.120
 16 the story you want if I'm not 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.150
 to think, get mine performance 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.750
 on the fly and as we remember that the 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.200
 he was like that 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.730
 here are the red ones there are the 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.000
 black and red and here are the 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.560
 black light is this pile is more 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.450
 large and because there is more margin can 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.590
 have the margin of error can be very 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.120
 large 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.400
 So here we are sure that 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.380
 They are only red because 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.180
 download the Americans accurately 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:40.750
 something that makes red and we can say what 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.440
 madrid- the black ones we can say that 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.440
 only and black 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.940
 here how could we have been wrong 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.440
 and put some red instead of black 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.540
 we say that 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.910
 are friends of loja to be black so 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:01.670
 there are so many reds and it's black here 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.670
 are the other 16 white red 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.320
 as in 1616 they are 32 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.640
 here there are 20 and they are 42 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:15.310
 for forty-two cards in the deck 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:21.729
 ten and ten ten blacks 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:28.860
 7 8 9 and 10 and here the other 10 red 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:32.310
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:37.409
 and then here the 16 reds without any 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:39.389
 black you can place the letters and then 

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:41.780
 let the trick only flow to the 

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:41.780
 next
