00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 in August as always the good morning 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.290
 how you are I confess that I 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.450
 I am the only one who has 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.490
 I thought that running barefoot was fine 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.139
 I was running on the beach about on the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.670
 sand for example and you saw what 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.619
 difficult to run barefoot in the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.119
 sand why why what happens when the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.359
 sand is soft 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.000
 You have karki weapons in the bow and you use 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.400
 almost all muscles there are 26 bones 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.400
 in the foot that hold all this 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.840
 structure ligaments muscles and when 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 you are on the beach that you have to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.940
 put your foot in the sand you have to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.040
 mobilize many more more ligaments 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.510
 and muscles that when you run in a 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.850
 shoe and this is the new trend 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.530
 of course there is a lack of evidence but what 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.110
 happens when you run with these 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.210
 new sneakers that in the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.000
 last decades have like increased and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.949
 lifted the heel a little separating the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.980
 keep with air chamber is a 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.720
 wonder 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.480
 what happens at that moment when you have 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.059
 the heel more raised than the tip you 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.940
 taken towards the arkia column is the 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.240
 back much more to keep this 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.650
 posture instead the new trend that 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.710
 is 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.290
 Running barefoot puts you in the same 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.450
 level the tip that the heel and you have 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.790
 that put the weight on the heel if not 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.770
 you put the weight in the middle part 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:26.740
 central foot and in that way this voice 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.500
 bow more you do a moment much more 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.600
 natural and they say say what are the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.630
 that follow this position that produces 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.980
 less injuries and that facilitate and by 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.560
 supposed if this happens when the 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.200
 guys are 8 9 10 11 years old that is 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.970
 forming the arch is strengthening 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.460
 the foot this makes the boys not 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.920
 have flat feet and can strengthen more 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.320
 the bow there are many many trends 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.590
 but good also the idea is not 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.500
 only the posture but when you 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.680
 you are in a flat shape change it 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.259
 cadence instead of running at 140 steps 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.980
 by minutes it is done to 180 to say that 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.840
 is not having the heel so high and having 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.920
 more steps 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.379
 short but that produce you let's say that 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.760
 you have a faster cadence but with 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.010
 different mobile as possible 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.540
 intermediates it also occurs to me that 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.790
 maybe those shoes that were not for 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.430
 run because they are so much ink that they are 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.080
 this almost how is that they adapt to the foot 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.940
 could be another good option too 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.590
 now the shoe industry 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.599
 is changing instead of doing these 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.150
 super sneakers with the air chamber 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.819
 they are making more natural sneakers 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.440
 more flexible that allow the foot 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.780
 have a contact with the surface the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.880
 which is running much more intimate 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.370
 but you have to be careful with 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.170
 this of running barefoot on the foot 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.599
 diabetic that there are times that people go 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.480
 to have diabetic neuropathy sometimes 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.430
 has science diminished and when running 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.739
 barefoot can have pity power of 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.150
 Carla calm down the same as the people who 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.190
 he has circulatory tests but hey 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.240
 this what is coming is there is a 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.750
 antecedent in the rome olympics 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:15.110
 the Ethiopian bikic a bikila won the medal 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.440
 of gold and ran 42 kilometers barefoot 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.080
 in south africa 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.550
 and also running barefoot so good 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.800
 no no it is not so crazy what we are 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:30.610
 talking about a case inside your house I 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.610
 It seems perfect
