 You are seeing also take a look here was 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.380
 a reference to the console atari sim 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.740
 of the shortcut you should be seeing 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.320
 images and the colors and such 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.600
 console is also colored so 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.310
 the same format as the symbol and 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.090

 as no one had paid attention 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.380
 because I look on youtube I did not find 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.629
 nobody understood anyone talking about it 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.520
 but clearly it is a reference to the 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.510
 console atari and that's what I wanted 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.239
