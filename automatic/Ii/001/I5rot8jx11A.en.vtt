00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.180
 do in childhood our dogs can 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:28.369
 another injection in time 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.989
 to be vaccinated against rabies 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.599
 just wanted to show you how it is 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.910

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.630
 telenor 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.790
 why do you see it if you 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.680
 bring the dog to the vet in order 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.510
 that he do not have yours in me 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.130
 dogs he will not only do 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.860
 infection, he will once again complete 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.240
 inspection that is the skin 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.690
 how do you feel at home 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.610
 conditions you can't do it 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.070
 I already have some experience 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.739
 education I can do it myself 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.920
 some because of the distances involved 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.829
 no car put too arises 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.570
 such a need to put at home 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:15.350
 let's give you injections today 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.229
 how it is done but best of course 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.799
 I repeat to you once again to do so 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:27.380
 visit to the vet means I recommend 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.979
 purchase vaccine if it is some what 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.060
 in specialized pharmacies or 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.689
 directly veterinary clinics 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.249
 vaccine is a live strain of those viruses 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.869
 therefore, it is necessary to observe 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:47.509
 transportation and storage rules for these 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.319
 strains of this particular vaccine that cannot 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.539
 observe 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.880
 ordinary pet stores then there is no 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:57.789
 conditions they have therefore i recommend everything 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.710
 to purchase these vaccines from 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:06.159
 veterinarians either in the eye 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:09.200
 in umbrellas it means well I already charged here 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.810
 this vaccine for rabies is put 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.300
 she subcutaneously so let's we 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.180
 let's talk this one minute literally 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.880
 take time you learn how to 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.500
 it's done here see the difference in length 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:28.310
 needles this syringe for vaccine 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.709
 intramuscular with a short needle this is for 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.030
 the injection is exactly done which 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:37.070
 subcutaneously that is, we are doing with you 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.140
 right i teach you to do right 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.630
 therefore, we select exactly the injection 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.200
 who exactly need a syringe with needle length 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.019
 the one you need means volume here 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:53.600
 one milliliter here too 1 milliliter 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:56.360
 accordingly, it means that here 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.269
 the jar itself has a special 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.840
 sticker that we will surely stick 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.150
 veterinary passport 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.160
 many clinics 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:12.079
 many pharmacies provide say my 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.390
 stamp and mark the vet about 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.810
 stopping this vaccine for what it is 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.940
 you need it to be able to 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.000
 transport cheap 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.459
 animal could cross borders and so 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.980
 so be sure to continue your same 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:33.470
 dogs have a passport i jis like mine 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.170
 so make sure make 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.239
 nakleechka put a stamp here if 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.700
 wrong until done from the mark 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.209
 why did he make a mark when I do 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.680
 I will give him an injection empty jar and 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.910
 vet me put a mark on something 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.700
 that injection i did a doggy must 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.950
 take root absolutely healthy because 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.320
 that this is still a provocation so for 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.930
 one hundred percent to be sure 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.299
 that nothing oppresses any disease 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.480
 no we still have additional geist fire 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:08.940
 do the same thing in the passport then 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.040
 there are stickers and from the mark 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.480
 so not so well dogs we have semi 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.019
 sterile animals therefore 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.420
 one hundred percent need not in 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.760
 skin treatment but we are 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.950
 will do 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.280
 so here we have a dog ready for 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.680
 injections if you have a puppy small then 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.890
 please prepare feed for 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.440
 that the dog was interested and 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.530
 not distracted by the process itself 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.990
 punctures and it is better to do it of course 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.240
 if you have an assistant that is with me 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.550
 cable already trained to this all that is 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.610
 he doesn't need fertilizing well if you 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.680
 there is a person omitted assistant he will 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.930
 distract to give under the mold so here 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.090
 here is an animal and at this time you made 3 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.580
 pc to have i will just and here you are 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:03.130
 please. you apple and most importantly 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.280
 so I want to say it is necessary again 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.180
 to be very calm 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.040
 there is peace of mind because here 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.680
 this emotional state is transmitted 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.630
 animals and when you are calm dog too 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.169
 will be calm accordingly she is more 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.580
 simply transfer is the floor, and since 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.200
 subcutaneous injection is done 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:32.650
 Well, you can plant can lie to do it 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:35.400
 paint here we go with loki raise 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.620
 here from Lou lodge under the skin lift 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.729
 here here here 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.590
 raise triangle turns out 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.010
 such a triangle and there it is necessary 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.010
 to prick 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.570
 now we process 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.129
 Here I did not even feel the puncture 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:07.460
 This because as if in this place 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:10.520
 nerve endings are very few important 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.310
 the driver is not fast not sharply quietly 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:18.550
 driver so that it is all 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.699
 everything went like this twin syringe 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:25.669
 softens 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:29.000
 I mean well done praise the little dog 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:33.069
 give feed necessarily her 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.069
 Was for motivated akbar lie down 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.930
 I will not make an injection right now I will show 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:44.210
 how it is done intramuscularly here we are 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.150
 took the right syringe needle length 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.550
 corresponds inside the muscle 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.520
 this is done very simply doggy 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:54.800
 put in a position of submission then 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.509
 pulled leg that is what it is for 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.699
 this muscle flexor is done this 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.099
 extensor muscles to itself 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:03.050
 muscular 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:06.710
