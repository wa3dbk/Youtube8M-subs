yet<00:02:31.799> of<00:02:31.920> course<00:02:31.950> then<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:32.940> have<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.150> dwarf

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269

yet of course then you have to dwarf
battle<00:02:33.659> wine<00:02:33.780> which<00:02:33.989> is<00:02:34.110> basically<00:02:34.440> like<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
battle wine which is basically like the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.199 
battle wine which is basically like the
new<00:02:34.890> battalion<00:02:35.400> box<00:02:35.609> that<00:02:35.940> they're<00:02:36.090> doing

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
new battalion box that they're doing

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.210 
new battalion box that they're doing
where<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:36.989> bigger<00:02:37.500> than<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.709> battle<00:02:38.010> horse

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
where it's bigger than a battle horse

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.520 
where it's bigger than a battle horse
was<00:02:38.430> smaller<00:02:38.730> than<00:02:38.939> like<00:02:39.150> an<00:02:39.299> army<00:02:39.599> box<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.500> to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
was smaller than like an army box so to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.770 
was smaller than like an army box so to
speak<00:02:40.829> so<00:02:41.159> who<00:02:41.760> knows<00:02:41.909> what<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.269> what<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
speak so who knows what the what the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.210 
speak so who knows what the what the
reasoning<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.349> there<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:43.859> it<00:02:44.010> still

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
reasoning is there but it still

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.800 
reasoning is there but it still
generally<00:02:44.700> tends<00:02:44.909> to<00:02:45.000> be<00:02:45.120> pretty<00:02:45.150> good<00:02:45.390> value

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
generally tends to be pretty good value

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.780 
generally tends to be pretty good value
so<00:02:46.079> here's<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.650> quick<00:02:46.829> look<00:02:46.980> at<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.280> iron

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
so here's a quick look at the iron

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.280 
so here's a quick look at the iron
Drake's<00:02:48.090> themselves<00:02:48.659> then<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.170> new

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
Drake's themselves then you the new

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.309 
Drake's themselves then you the new

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
models of course they go along with the

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.369 
models of course they go along with the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
next week and then who knows might be a

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.509 
next week and then who knows might be a
big<00:04:06.329> 40k<00:04:06.810> release<00:04:07.319> for<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.680> week<00:04:08.040> after<00:04:08.220> there
