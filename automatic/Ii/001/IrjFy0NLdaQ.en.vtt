Bieber's involved he's not actually in
the<00:01:27.210> movie<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.570> don't<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> worry<00:01:28.290> about

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the movie so don't have to worry about

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.069 
the movie so don't have to worry about
that<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.640> remember<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.299> he<00:01:30.360> put<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.930> his

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that but we remember that he put on his

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.810 
that but we remember that he put on his
Twitter<00:01:31.350> something<00:01:32.040> about<00:01:32.280> how<00:01:32.490> he<00:01:32.520> hates

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
Twitter something about how he hates

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.770 
Twitter something about how he hates
anime<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.810> because<00:01:34.470> he<00:01:34.710> hates<00:01:34.950> anime<00:01:35.570> he<00:01:36.570> is

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
anime and because he hates anime he is

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.660 
anime and because he hates anime he is
doubling<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.470> budget<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.100> movie<00:01:38.490> so

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
doubling the budget of this movie so

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.090 
doubling the budget of this movie so
basically<00:01:39.090> he<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.450> paying<00:01:39.810> half<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
basically he is paying half of the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.249 
basically he is paying half of the
budget<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.820> movie<00:01:42.180> he<00:01:42.329> donated<00:01:42.720> half<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
budget of this movie he donated half of

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.380 
budget of this movie he donated half of
the<00:01:43.320> budget<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.520> movie<00:01:45.000> could<00:01:45.210> be

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the budget here so this movie could be

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.899 
the budget here so this movie could be
made<00:01:45.659> into<00:01:45.990> reality<00:01:46.920> simply<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.670> he

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
made into reality simply because he
