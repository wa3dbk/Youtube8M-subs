I<00:02:13.110> knew<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.130> game<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.610> some<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.000> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
I knew in this game that some of the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.820 
I knew in this game that some of the
enemies<00:02:15.210> were<00:02:15.630> using<00:02:15.930> LMGs<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.620> they<00:02:16.770> were

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
enemies were using LMGs and they were

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.010 
enemies were using LMGs and they were
just<00:02:17.100> locking<00:02:17.340> down<00:02:17.640> lanes<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.690> wasn't

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
just locking down lanes so I wasn't

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.450 
just locking down lanes so I wasn't
about<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.410> try<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.740> challenge<00:02:19.890> them<00:02:20.250> head-on

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
about to try and challenge them head-on

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.040 
about to try and challenge them head-on
when<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:20.850> knew<00:02:21.090> they<00:02:21.240> had<00:02:21.390> cover<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.900> they<00:02:21.960> were

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
when I knew they had cover and they were

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.650 
when I knew they had cover and they were
just<00:02:22.230> aiming<00:02:22.590> down<00:02:22.710> sights<00:02:23.510> once<00:02:24.510> an

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
just aiming down sights once an

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.390 
just aiming down sights once an
opportunity<00:02:25.140> presented<00:02:25.290> itself<00:02:25.620> then<00:02:26.370> I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
opportunity presented itself then I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.610 
opportunity presented itself then I
would<00:02:26.640> make<00:02:26.790> my<00:02:26.940> move<00:02:27.210> but<00:02:27.570> until<00:02:27.930> then<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.260> felt

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
would make my move but until then I felt

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.680 
would make my move but until then I felt
absolutely<00:02:29.220> no<00:02:29.550> shame<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.300> hanging

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
absolutely no shame and just hanging

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.450 
absolutely no shame and just hanging
back<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.110> picking<00:02:31.530> off<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.800> poor<00:02:32.010> guys<00:02:32.220> that

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
back and picking off the poor guys that

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.880 
back and picking off the poor guys that
just<00:02:32.640> kept<00:02:32.910> rushing<00:02:33.150> me<00:02:33.440> now<00:02:34.440> in<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.710> gameplay

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
just kept rushing me now in the gameplay

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.650 
just kept rushing me now in the gameplay
right<00:02:35.160> here<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.550> might<00:02:35.790> wonder<00:02:35.970> why<00:02:36.270> I'm<00:02:36.450> just

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
right here you might wonder why I'm just

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.570 
right here you might wonder why I'm just
laying<00:02:36.840> down<00:02:36.960> that's<00:02:37.950> just<00:02:38.010> because<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.400> was

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
laying down that's just because I was

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.190 
laying down that's just because I was
starting<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.910> get<00:02:39.060> really<00:02:39.360> bad<00:02:39.510> skips<00:02:39.840> because

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
starting to get really bad skips because

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.170 
starting to get really bad skips because
that's<00:02:40.380> what<00:02:40.530> my<00:02:40.620> internet<00:02:40.980> does<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.820> I've

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that's what my internet does so I've

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.520 
that's what my internet does so I've
been<00:02:42.360> trying<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.780> kind<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.110> find<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.350> pattern

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
been trying to kind of find a pattern

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.710 
been trying to kind of find a pattern
with<00:02:43.920> when<00:02:44.430> these<00:02:44.610> skips<00:02:44.850> happen<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.510> what

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
with when these skips happen and what

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.390 
with when these skips happen and what
causes<00:02:45.960> these<00:02:46.320> skips<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.800> was<00:02:47.040> just<00:02:47.220> having

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
causes these skips so I was just having

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.590 
causes these skips so I was just having
a<00:02:47.460> look<00:02:47.550> at<00:02:47.700> my<00:02:47.760> computer<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.300> make<00:02:48.390> sure

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
a look at my computer to make sure

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.630 
a look at my computer to make sure
nothing<00:02:49.440> was<00:02:49.560> using<00:02:49.920> bandwidth<00:02:50.310> or<00:02:50.460> anything

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
nothing was using bandwidth or anything

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.820 
nothing was using bandwidth or anything
like<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.480> that's<00:02:52.140> why<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.380> paused<00:02:52.680> like

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
like that and that's why I paused like

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.470 
like that and that's why I paused like
that<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.220> that's<00:02:53.280> also<00:02:53.550> part<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.180> reason

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
that and that's also part of the reason

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.150 
that and that's also part of the reason
I<00:02:54.600> was<00:02:54.750> or<00:02:54.960> I<00:02:55.020> start<00:02:55.560> playing<00:02:55.800> really

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
I was or I start playing really

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.670 
I was or I start playing really
defensively<00:02:56.640> right<00:02:56.910> up<00:02:57.120> here<00:02:57.480> coming<00:02:58.260> up<00:02:58.470> and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
defensively right up here coming up and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.620 
defensively right up here coming up and
that's<00:02:59.430> just<00:02:59.610> because<00:02:59.730> my<00:02:59.940> internet<00:03:00.180> was<00:03:00.360> kind

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
that's just because my internet was kind

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.180 
that's just because my internet was kind
of<00:03:00.720> acting<00:03:01.020> up<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.470> didn't<00:03:01.800> want<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.040> get

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
of acting up and I didn't want to get

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.650 
of acting up and I didn't want to get
myself<00:03:02.370> into<00:03:02.700> any<00:03:02.880> situations<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.630> I

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
myself into any situations that I

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.120 
myself into any situations that I

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
you should or shouldn't play the game if

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.840 
you should or shouldn't play the game if
you<00:03:13.230> want<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.560> camp<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:13.950> some<00:03:14.130> random<00:03:14.310> corner

you want a camp in some random corner

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.150 
you want a camp in some random corner
I'm<00:03:15.000> not<00:03:15.390> gonna<00:03:15.540> stop<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:16.020> just<00:03:16.680> be<00:03:16.800> honest

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
I'm not gonna stop you just be honest

I'm not gonna stop you just be honest
with<00:03:17.190> yourself<00:03:17.580> about<00:03:17.850> whether<00:03:18.120> or<00:03:18.330> not

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
with yourself about whether or not

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.120 
with yourself about whether or not
that's<00:03:18.660> actually<00:03:18.840> an<00:03:19.290> effective<00:03:19.680> strategy

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
that's actually an effective strategy

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.880 
that's actually an effective strategy
for<00:03:20.160> earning<00:03:20.640> 25<00:03:21.060> kills<00:03:21.330> without<00:03:21.510> dying<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:22.200> my

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
for earning 25 kills without dying in my

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.620 
for earning 25 kills without dying in my
opinion<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.459> isn't<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.330> should<00:03:24.480> probably

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
opinion it isn't and you should probably

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.990 
opinion it isn't and you should probably
find<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:25.230> balance<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.739> treat<00:03:26.160> every<00:03:26.459> situation

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000

differently there are times when

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.590 
differently there are times when

cover really quickly and I'm kind of

cover really quickly and I'm kind of
going<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.780> spoil<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.290> gameplay<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.709> little<00:03:43.980> bit

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
going to spoil the gameplay a little bit

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.340 
going to spoil the gameplay a little bit
here<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.580> don't<00:03:45.239> end<00:03:45.450> up<00:03:45.570> earning<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.959> Kem<00:03:46.230> strike

here I don't end up earning a Kem strike
in<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:46.980> game<00:03:47.220> now<00:03:48.090> you're<00:03:48.239> probably

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
in this game now you're probably

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.270 
in this game now you're probably
thinking<00:03:48.630> why<00:03:49.140> would<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:49.410> even<00:03:49.530> post<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:50.040> video

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280

when you didn't even get a cam in the
gameplay<00:03:53.720> well<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.750> wanted<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.350> use<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:55.680> to

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
gameplay well I wanted to use this to

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.710 
gameplay well I wanted to use this to
illustrate<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.310> it's<00:03:56.580> not<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.850> bad<00:03:57.239> thing<00:03:57.540> to

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
illustrate that it's not a bad thing to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.530 
illustrate that it's not a bad thing to
go<00:03:57.870> on<00:03:58.080> say<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.410> 17<00:03:58.980> or<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.310> 19<00:03:59.790> kill<00:04:00.060> streak<00:04:00.330> and

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
go on say a 17 or a 19 kill streak and

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.810 
go on say a 17 or a 19 kill streak and

sucks I get that but try to look at it
in<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.530> positive<00:04:19.560> way<00:04:20.299> every<00:04:21.299> time<00:04:21.479> you<00:04:21.570> go<00:04:21.690> on<00:04:21.720> a

in a positive way every time you go on a
streak<00:04:22.109> like<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.740> reinforce<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.490> fact

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
streak like that you reinforce the fact

going on high kill
streaks<00:04:26.909> and<00:04:27.120> it's<00:04:27.270> only<00:04:27.419> a<00:04:27.509> matter<00:04:27.689> of<00:04:27.810> time

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
streaks and it's only a matter of time

streaks and it's only a matter of time
before<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.590> start<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:28.949> earn<00:04:29.039> chem<00:04:29.310> stripes<00:04:29.639> in

this<00:04:30.870> gameplay<00:04:31.080> when<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.650> died<00:04:31.949> at<00:04:32.189> 19<00:04:32.639> kills<00:04:32.939> my

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
this gameplay when I died at 19 kills my

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.909 
this gameplay when I died at 19 kills my
first<00:04:33.509> thought<00:04:33.749> was<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:34.199> was<00:04:34.710> an<00:04:34.830> awesome

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919
