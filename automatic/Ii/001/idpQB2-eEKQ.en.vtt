alright so the next step is we are going
to<00:01:43.050> take<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.260> skewer<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.550> are<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
to take a skewer and we are going to

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.870 
to take a skewer and we are going to
poke<00:01:45.150> it<00:01:45.300> all<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.080> way<00:01:46.229> through<00:01:46.770> our<00:01:47.040> orange

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
poke it all the way through our orange

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.460 
poke it all the way through our orange
and<00:01:48.060> bean<00:01:48.450> actually<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.020> came<00:01:49.140> up<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.380> this

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and bean actually just came up with this

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.050 
and bean actually just came up with this
idea<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.830> didn't<00:01:50.190> think<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.580> ahead<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.820> time

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
idea I didn't think of it ahead of time

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.330 
idea I didn't think of it ahead of time
of<00:01:51.090> course<00:01:51.270> not<00:01:51.660> well<00:01:52.140> basically<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:52.979> poke

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
of course not well basically if we poke

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.770 
of course not well basically if we poke
the<00:01:53.490> skewer<00:01:53.729> all<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> way<00:01:54.090> through<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.540> leave

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the skewer all the way through and leave

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810 
the skewer all the way through and leave
it<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.050> its<00:01:55.619> gonna<00:01:55.830> give<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> birdies<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> place

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
it in its gonna give the birdies a place

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.930

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
we're going to tie our string so that we

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.570 
we're going to tie our string so that we
can<00:02:19.170> hang<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.560> tree<00:02:19.650> guys<00:02:20.220> my<00:02:20.370> boat

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580

actually going to cut this to make two
separate<00:02:35.790> strings<00:02:36.150> because<00:02:36.510> obviously<00:02:36.690> you

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
separate strings because obviously you

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.539 
separate strings because obviously you
might<00:02:37.380> be<00:02:37.500> hanging<00:02:37.650> your<00:02:37.860> bird<00:02:38.010> feeder<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.400> a

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
might be hanging your bird feeder on a

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.670 
might be hanging your bird feeder on a
big<00:02:38.790> branch<00:02:39.209> or<00:02:39.570> something<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.560> we

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
big branch or something like that so we

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.750 
big branch or something like that so we
want<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.920> give<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.190> option<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.610> be<00:02:41.730> able

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.620 
to reach over and just tie it on top of
the<00:02:44.370> branch<00:02:44.549> instead<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.060> trying<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.299> like<00:02:45.450> oh

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
the branch instead of trying to like oh

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.900 
the branch instead of trying to like oh
shoot<00:02:46.080> me<00:02:46.200> up<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.380> tree<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.980> slide<00:02:47.519> all<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.730> way
