hypnosis so if you want to use hypnosis
on<00:00:22.920> someone<00:00:23.279> else<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.760> first<00:00:23.939> thing<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.240> have

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
aren't going to go there's a number of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.600

ways<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.329> induce<00:00:37.200> hypnosis<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.520> the

easiest ways is to tire the eyes and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
that can be done by staring up at a spot

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.369 
that can be done by staring up at a spot
on<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.950> ceiling<00:00:43.980> or<00:00:44.670> staring<00:00:45.239> at<00:00:45.450> somebody's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
on the ceiling or staring at somebody's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.810 
on the ceiling or staring at somebody's
hand<00:00:46.850> basically<00:00:48.200> tiring<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> eyes<00:00:49.610> will<00:00:50.610> get

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
hand basically tiring the eyes will get

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.569 
hand basically tiring the eyes will get
somebody<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.590> begin<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.770> get<00:00:52.920> relaxed<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
somebody to begin to get relaxed and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.119 
somebody to begin to get relaxed and
begin<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.199> want<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.289> close<00:00:55.469> their<00:00:55.649> eyes

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
begin to want to close their eyes

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.310 
begin to want to close their eyes
so<00:00:56.789> once<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.180> once<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.750> achieved<00:00:57.870> eye

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so once the once you have achieved eye

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.529 
so once the once you have achieved eye
closure<00:00:58.739> then<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.760> take<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> person<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
closure then you can take a person to a

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.529 
closure then you can take a person to a
favorite<00:01:01.020> place<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.940> in<00:01:02.940> their<00:01:03.090> mind<00:01:03.329> you

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
favorite place and in their mind you

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
favorite place and in their mind you
talk<00:01:03.809> about<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.140> their<00:01:04.260> minds<00:01:04.470> eye<00:01:04.799> why<00:01:05.100> their

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
talk about in their minds eye why their

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.039 
talk about in their minds eye why their
eyes<00:01:05.400> are<00:01:05.580> closed<00:01:05.850> they're<00:01:06.570> using<00:01:06.930> their

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
eyes are closed they're using their

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.660 
eyes are closed they're using their
subconscious<00:01:07.650> mind<00:01:07.860> they're<00:01:08.040> accessing<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
subconscious mind they're accessing the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.850 
subconscious mind they're accessing the
memory<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.689> they'll<00:01:09.840> go<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.229> favorite<00:01:10.619> place

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
memory so they'll go to a favorite place

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.550 
memory so they'll go to a favorite place
perhaps<00:01:11.310> out<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.729> nature<00:01:11.960> seeing<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.290> their

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
perhaps out in nature seeing all their

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
perhaps out in nature seeing all their
favorite<00:01:13.950> things<00:01:14.220> using<00:01:14.790> all<00:01:14.909> their<00:01:15.060> senses

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
favorite things using all their senses

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.690 
favorite things using all their senses
to<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.840> there<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.290> direct<00:01:16.650> them<00:01:16.830> use<00:01:17.430> all

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
to be there so you direct them use all

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.370 
to be there so you direct them use all
your<00:01:17.880> senses<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.840> seeing<00:01:19.140> your

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
your senses to be here seeing your

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.740 
your senses to be here seeing your
favorite<00:01:19.560> things<00:01:19.979> perhaps<00:01:20.220> trees<00:01:20.939> mountains

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
favorite things perhaps trees mountains

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.679 
favorite things perhaps trees mountains
maybe<00:01:22.470> an<00:01:22.650> ocean

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
maybe an ocean

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.959 
maybe an ocean
and<00:01:23.810> then<00:01:24.320> once<00:01:24.500> they've<00:01:24.710> done<00:01:24.920> that<00:01:24.979> then<00:01:25.939> you

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
and then once they've done that then you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.789 
and then once they've done that then you
can<00:01:26.119> deepen<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.719> state<00:01:26.930> of<00:01:27.049> relaxation<00:01:27.590> for

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
can deepen the state of relaxation for

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.600 
can deepen the state of relaxation for
the<00:01:28.039> deeper<00:01:28.369> that<00:01:28.520> they<00:01:28.939> go<00:01:29.149> the<00:01:29.689> more

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
the deeper that they go the more

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
the deeper that they go the more
responsive<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.119> subconscious<00:01:32.450> mind

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
responsive that the subconscious mind

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.200 
responsive that the subconscious mind
will<00:01:32.930> be<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.409> just<00:01:34.130> one<00:01:34.340> way<00:01:34.549> to<00:01:34.610> deepen<00:01:35.119> a

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
will be and just one way to deepen a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.819 
will be and just one way to deepen a
state<00:01:35.450> of<00:01:35.689> relaxation<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.619> count

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
state of relaxation is to count

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.160 
state of relaxation is to count
backwards<00:01:37.280> I'm<00:01:37.820> going<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.270> count<00:01:38.479> from<00:01:38.750> 15

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
backwards I'm going to count from 15

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.859 
backwards I'm going to count from 15
down<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:39.439> 1<00:01:39.829> and<00:01:40.130> when<00:01:40.460> I<00:01:40.520> reach<00:01:40.850> one<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.780> are

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
down to 1 and when I reach one you are

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.569 
down to 1 and when I reach one you are
going<00:01:42.079> to<00:01:42.140> be<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:42.439> deeply<00:01:42.829> relaxed<00:01:43.310> more

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
going to be so deeply relaxed more

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.910 
going to be so deeply relaxed more
relaxed<00:01:43.970> than<00:01:44.240> you've<00:01:44.360> ever<00:01:44.539> been<00:01:44.750> this<00:01:45.619> isn't

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
relaxed than you've ever been this isn't

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.559 
relaxed than you've ever been this isn't
rocket<00:01:46.009> science<00:01:46.579> it's<00:01:46.759> really<00:01:46.819> pretty<00:01:47.119> easy

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
rocket science it's really pretty easy

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:53.289 
rocket science it's really pretty easy
start<00:01:48.200> counting<00:01:48.590> 15<00:01:49.630> 14<00:01:50.630> 13<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:52.520> going<00:01:53.090> all

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
start counting 15 14 13 and going all
