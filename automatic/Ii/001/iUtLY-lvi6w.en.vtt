all-star<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.120> made<00:02:27.540> him<00:02:27.720> kind<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.080> accurate

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
all-star so we made him kind of accurate

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.680 
all-star so we made him kind of accurate
at<00:02:29.099> range<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.700> not<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.120> accurate<00:02:30.299> when<00:02:30.569> you're

personal favorite of the new characters

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.930 
personal favorite of the new characters
it's<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.900> alien<00:02:55.260> flower<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:56.459> is<00:02:56.609> very

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
it's the alien flower this is very

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.789 
it's the alien flower this is very
different<00:02:57.269> for<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:57.450> sunfire<00:02:57.780> class<00:02:58.049> she

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
different for the sunfire class she

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.530 
different for the sunfire class she
actually<00:02:58.890> shoots<00:02:59.310> kind<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.880> spores<00:03:00.390> that

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
actually shoots kind of spores that

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.030 
actually shoots kind of spores that
explode<00:03:01.109> when<00:03:01.290> they<00:03:01.319> hit<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.530> ground<00:03:01.739> they

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
explode when they hit the ground they

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.319 
explode when they hit the ground they
linger<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.579> air<00:03:02.700> for<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> couple<00:03:03.269> of

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
linger in the air for a couple of

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.849 
linger in the air for a couple of
seconds<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.350> kind<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.530> make<00:03:04.620> little

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
seconds so you can kind of make little

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.170 
seconds so you can kind of make little
traps<00:03:05.130> where<00:03:05.400> you're<00:03:05.640> shooting<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.970> ground

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
traps where you're shooting the ground

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.430 
traps where you're shooting the ground
and<00:03:06.390> zombies<00:03:06.660> are<00:03:06.750> walking<00:03:07.049> through<00:03:07.079> it<00:03:07.350> and

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
and zombies are walking through it and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.710 
and zombies are walking through it and
taking<00:03:07.709> damage<00:03:08.180> finally<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.359> plant<00:03:09.540> side

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
taking damage finally on the plant side

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.479 
taking damage finally on the plant side
we<00:03:09.900> had<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.079> Jade<00:03:10.290> cactus<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.920> she's<00:03:11.310> our

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
we had the Jade cactus and she's our

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.670 
we had the Jade cactus and she's our
slower<00:03:11.970> moving<00:03:12.209> higher<00:03:12.660> health<00:03:12.989> cactus

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
slower moving higher health cactus

variant her weapon sticks in the ground
for<00:03:16.319> a<00:03:16.470> second<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:16.829> it<00:03:16.950> explodes<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:18.480> it's

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
for a second and it explodes so it's

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.300 
for a second and it explodes so it's
what<00:03:18.690> kind<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.959> new<00:03:19.170> twist<00:03:19.889> on<00:03:20.040> how<00:03:20.250> the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
what kind of a new twist on how the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.250 
what kind of a new twist on how the
cactus<00:03:20.760> plays<00:03:20.970> if<00:03:21.299> you<00:03:21.389> hit<00:03:21.540> players<00:03:21.750> directly

cactus plays if you hit players directly

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.229 
cactus plays if you hit players directly
the<00:03:22.500> damage<00:03:22.799> happens<00:03:23.100> right<00:03:23.250> away<00:03:23.459> but<00:03:24.090> if<00:03:24.180> you

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
the damage happens right away but if you

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.180 
the damage happens right away but if you
hit<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.450> ground<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:25.440> can<00:03:25.560> kind<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.739> time<00:03:26.010> it

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
hit the ground you can kind of time it

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.300 
hit the ground you can kind of time it
and<00:03:26.280> wait<00:03:26.430> for<00:03:26.549> people<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.790> run<00:03:27.150> towards<00:03:27.569> you
