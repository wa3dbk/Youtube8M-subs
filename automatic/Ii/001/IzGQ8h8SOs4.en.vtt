00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
of some kind and they have quite a lot

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.630 
of some kind and they have quite a lot
of<00:02:06.270> interesting<00:02:06.900> gameplay<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.350> them<00:02:07.610> what<00:02:08.610> I

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
of interesting gameplay in them what I

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.120 
of interesting gameplay in them what I
like<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.209> game<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.600> diversity<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
like in that game is diversity is the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.130 
like in that game is diversity is the
the<00:02:11.580> contrast<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.330> between<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the contrast we have between the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.870 
the contrast we have between the
different<00:02:13.560> time<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.770> days<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.310> between<00:02:14.819> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
different time of days and between the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.130 
different time of days and between the
different<00:02:15.150> locations<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.690> game<00:02:15.840> because

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
different locations of the game because

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.720 
different locations of the game because
each<00:02:16.440> city<00:02:16.860> as<00:02:17.160> its<00:02:18.090> different<00:02:18.510> flavor<00:02:18.720> each

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
each city as its different flavor each

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.460 
each city as its different flavor each
forest<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.940> jungle<00:02:21.030> have<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> different<00:02:22.320> kind

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
forest and jungle have a different kind

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.350 
forest and jungle have a different kind
of<00:02:22.530> landmark<00:02:22.860> Natural<00:02:23.340> Landmark<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:24.150> what<00:02:24.330> I

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
of landmark Natural Landmark so what I

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.810 
of landmark Natural Landmark so what I
like<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.810> really<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.590> diversity<00:02:26.130> we<00:02:26.459> managed

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
like is really the diversity we managed

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:55.250 
like is really the diversity we managed
to<00:02:26.970> create<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.450> game

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.319
