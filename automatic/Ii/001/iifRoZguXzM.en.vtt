00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello girls how are you today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.649
 I'm going to teach a recipe to do 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.620
 Butter cookies is very easy and 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.070
 they are delicious we are going to need with 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.660
 100 kilo of butter 6 eggs and 6 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.000
 egg yolks 1 kilo 800 flour 350 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.300
 grams of sugar and a large bowl where 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.640
 we can mix everything 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.740
 let's put all the butter 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.929
 try to leave her for a little while outside the 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.619
 Refri to make it soft and we can 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.619
 knead it 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.000
 and we are going to add the 350 grams of 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.000
 sugar 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.960
 let's mix everything very well up 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.000
 that there is a homogeneous and smooth mixture 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.829
 This step can also be done with the 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.250
 blender only that I like to do it 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.250
 by hand 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.460
 and then we're going to make even the flour and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.460
 let's add the little by little 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 we mix it with the previous mixture and 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.250
 we also add the egg yolks 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.490
 I prefer to do it little by little 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.530
 added a little flour then a little 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.840
 of egg and then again flour and then 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.670
 a little egg and so on until it's over 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.500
 with everything 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.380
 until the dough is smooth and 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.119
 consistent when it explodes you do not know 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.060
 paste in the hands means that the dough 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.070
 is ready to start 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.040
 with this same mass we can do 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.570
 nuts and chocolate cookies here 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.880
 I'll show you how to make those 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.930
 louis just grab some dough and you 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.930
 you add is not chopped 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.390
 you have to mix everything very well so that 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.390
 the whole mass is full of our 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.140
 with this mass you can make balls or me 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.710
 I make like some croissants or some type 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.710
 little horns 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.850
 you can do the way you want 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.750
 and in a tray with waxed paper we 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.750
 let's go with local 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.550
 When you have ready, all your tray is 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.440
 time to go to the oven at 180 degrees and the 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.900
 let's leave there like 10 to 15 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.620
 minutes while they are gone I'm going to 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.209
 teach how to make chocolate dough 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.739
 again we take some dough from the 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.530
 that we already had made and we added 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.650
 cocoa adds enough so that all 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.019
 the mass that fills you with cocoa and we're going 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.799
 to mix again until it is 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.799
 a uniform color 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.920
 when you have your dough ready with help 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.060
 of a roller let's start to 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.060
 extend our mass 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.420
 it is us taking care uniform 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.420
 same thickness 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.740
 And now with the help of a cutter 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.760
 cookies we're going to start marking the 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.760
 figures in the mass 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.020
 to lift the cookies you can use 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.080
 a spatula or me like I did not have or be 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.060
 a card of those that are no longer used 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.620
 I prefer to go first by removing all 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.300
 the excesses so that I stay 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.220
 only the figurines 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.350
 and now yes with care there is 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.900
 lift them and put them on the tray with 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.040
 the waxed paper until you have all 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.040
 your complete tray 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.720
 the nut cookies have already come out if 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.030
 fixes should look like toast 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.220
 down these nut cookies go with 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.530
 icing sugar so they take the still 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.700
 that are warm and fill them 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.700
 full of icing sugar 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.569
 the truth that these are delicious 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.220
 good by following with our cookies 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.680
 chocolate let's put a little bit of 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.960
 egg white this is so that they remain 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.180
 shines and you can decorate them with 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.580
 chuchitos with sprinkles with sugar 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.230
 with what you want the children as they are 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.600
 kingdoms I decided to put sparks of 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.180
 chocolates on the horns and to make 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.330
 the nose I used red sugar and 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.240
 with the help of a doubt is the little circle and 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.850
 ready we take them to the oven 180 degrees 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.830
 for 10 to 15 minutes and these same ones 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.930
 do with all the other mass you can 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.510
 make the figures that you want and 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.050
 decorate them as you want, I did 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.090
 bells pinitos of all kinds 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.130
 of cookies 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.010
