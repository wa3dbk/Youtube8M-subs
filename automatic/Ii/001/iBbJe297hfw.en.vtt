this<00:04:49.610> way<00:04:49.759> okay<00:04:50.060> top<00:04:50.719> to<00:04:50.900> bottom<00:04:51.050> this<00:04:51.620> is<00:04:51.680> what

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
this way okay top to bottom this is what

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.010 
this way okay top to bottom this is what
the<00:04:52.250> base<00:04:52.400> included<00:04:52.939> you're<00:04:53.270> looking<00:04:53.449> at<00:04:53.539> 17

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
the base included you're looking at 17

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.929 
the base included you're looking at 17
and<00:04:54.199> a<00:04:54.259> half<00:04:54.289> inches<00:04:54.830> of<00:04:55.039> course<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.729> have<00:04:55.849> a

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:55.939 
and a half inches of course you have a

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.240 
and a half inches of course you have a
variable<00:04:56.409> distance<00:04:57.409> over<00:04:57.530> there<00:04:57.710> okay

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
variable distance over there okay

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.670 
variable distance over there okay
now<00:04:58.490> front<00:04:58.849> to<00:04:59.030> back<00:04:59.210> nine<00:05:00.080> point<00:05:00.440> eight

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
now front to back nine point eight

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.129 
now front to back nine point eight
inches<00:05:01.099> this<00:05:01.250> is<00:05:01.520> including<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.690> base<00:05:02.900> and

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
inches this is including the base and

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.320 
inches this is including the base and
don't<00:05:03.289> forget<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:03.919> can<00:05:04.219> get<00:05:04.430> rid<00:05:04.729> of<00:05:04.879> the<00:05:05.180> base

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
don't forget you can get rid of the base

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.180 
don't forget you can get rid of the base
altogether<00:05:05.870> because<00:05:06.199> on<00:05:06.379> the<00:05:06.500> back<00:05:06.680> you're

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
altogether because on the back you're

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.589 
altogether because on the back you're
actually<00:05:07.490> I'm<00:05:07.580> gonna<00:05:07.729> turn<00:05:07.819> it<00:05:07.940> this<00:05:08.030> way<00:05:08.210> look

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
actually I'm gonna turn it this way look

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.010 
actually I'm gonna turn it this way look
at<00:05:08.719> that

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
at that

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.779 
at that
before<00:05:09.500> I<00:05:09.530> forget<00:05:09.650> look<00:05:09.919> at<00:05:10.009> that<00:05:10.159> this<00:05:10.610> thing

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
before I forget look at that this thing

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:11.770 
before I forget look at that this thing
can<00:05:10.940> basically<00:05:11.090> I'm<00:05:11.270> not<00:05:11.300> going<00:05:11.479> to<00:05:11.539> do<00:05:11.599> it<00:05:11.659> now

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
can basically I'm not going to do it now

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.270 
can basically I'm not going to do it now
cuz<00:05:11.930> my<00:05:12.020> court<00:05:12.319> isn't<00:05:12.469> long<00:05:12.650> enough<00:05:12.680> but<00:05:13.190> this

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
cuz my court isn't long enough but this

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.100 
cuz my court isn't long enough but this
might<00:05:13.460> be<00:05:13.490> can<00:05:13.639> pretty<00:05:13.789> much<00:05:13.879> sue<00:05:14.090> over<00:05:14.150> 360

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
might be can pretty much sue over 360

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.619 
might be can pretty much sue over 360
degrees<00:05:15.530> that<00:05:15.889> is<00:05:16.520> very<00:05:16.699> cool<00:05:16.849> while<00:05:17.389> we're<00:05:17.539> at

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:17.629 
degrees that is very cool while we're at

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:19.360 
degrees that is very cool while we're at
it<00:05:17.659> on<00:05:17.840> the<00:05:18.050> back<00:05:18.229> right<00:05:18.919> over<00:05:19.069> here<00:05:19.219> you<00:05:19.279> get

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
it on the back right over here you get

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.379 
it on the back right over here you get
your<00:05:19.430> visa<00:05:19.610> mounting<00:05:20.000> point<00:05:20.150> so<00:05:20.270> if<00:05:20.330> you

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
your visa mounting point so if you

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.059 
your visa mounting point so if you
actually<00:05:20.509> lose<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:21.050> base<00:05:21.199> altogether<00:05:21.830> and

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069 
actually lose the base altogether and

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.219 
actually lose the base altogether and
pop<00:05:22.520> this<00:05:22.759> on<00:05:22.969> an<00:05:23.090> arm<00:05:23.270> if<00:05:23.419> you<00:05:23.509> want<00:05:23.750> to<00:05:23.900> really

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
pop this on an arm if you want to really

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.320 
pop this on an arm if you want to really
clean<00:05:24.500> up<00:05:24.529> your<00:05:24.710> workspace<00:05:25.129> there<00:05:25.969> it<00:05:26.060> is<00:05:26.150> what

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
else do we have on the back all the way

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.230 
else do we have on the back all the way
over<00:05:28.159> on<00:05:28.279> the<00:05:28.310> left<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.789> don't<00:05:28.849> know<00:05:29.000> if<00:05:29.060> you<00:05:29.120> can

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
over on the left I don't know if you can

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.430 
over on the left I don't know if you can

see it I'm gonna tilt it this little bit
so<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:30.560> can<00:05:30.650> see<00:05:30.740> that's<00:05:30.889> of<00:05:31.069> course<00:05:31.219> where

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
so you can see that's of course where

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.339 
so you can see that's of course where
your<00:05:31.490> power<00:05:31.669> goes<00:05:31.969> in<00:05:32.180> okay<00:05:32.870> if<00:05:33.110> you<00:05:33.199> pan

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
your power goes in okay if you pan

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:34.959 
your power goes in okay if you pan
across<00:05:33.650> to<00:05:33.830> your<00:05:33.949> right<00:05:34.190> there's<00:05:34.550> your<00:05:34.729> VGA

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
input which of course we've got

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.510 
input which of course we've got
connected<00:05:36.319> to<00:05:36.440> our<00:05:36.560> notebook<00:05:36.919> right<00:05:37.099> now<00:05:37.279> and

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
connected to our notebook right now and

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.430 
connected to our notebook right now and
then<00:05:37.909> right<00:05:38.090> next<00:05:38.210> door<00:05:38.360> to<00:05:38.479> it<00:05:38.629> you've<00:05:39.020> got<00:05:39.259> a

thing<00:05:41.509> you<00:05:41.539> can<00:05:41.690> literally<00:05:42.080> use<00:05:42.229> this<00:05:42.409> one<00:05:42.740> LCD

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
thing you can literally use this one LCD

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.010 
thing you can literally use this one LCD
and<00:05:43.430> hook<00:05:43.849> it<00:05:43.940> up<00:05:44.029> to<00:05:44.150> two<00:05:44.300> systems<00:05:44.779> you<00:05:44.900> can

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
and hook it up to two systems you can

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.249 
and hook it up to two systems you can
have<00:05:45.199> your<00:05:45.800> your<00:05:46.460> PC<00:05:47.120> connected<00:05:47.569> to<00:05:47.719> the<00:05:47.900> VGA
