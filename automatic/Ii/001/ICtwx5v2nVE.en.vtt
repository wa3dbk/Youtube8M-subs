00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.480
 because the formula luis fernando tena 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.400
 blue cross is not going to work here I'm going 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.709
 to say some reasons and I hope that 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.900
 you provide comments support or 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.820
 are against those that expose we are going 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.500
 with the first the first time I 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.440
 it seems that it is a cycle that has already been fulfilled 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.600
 it would be worth it in colloquial terms 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.790
 as a popular saying that the chancla that 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.620
 they are thrown it does not come back to pick up on 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.600
 everything when it is neither the first nor the 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.360
 second nor the third time it is collected 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.989
 we are talking about a relationship 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.940
 spent and from a relationship marked by a 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.269
 stereotype by a qualifying adjective 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.649
 who is a loser is not seen in the environment 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.809
 you do not breathe even among 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.030
 true crossbullies those like the 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.679
 Sanchez a conviction that Luis 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.920
 fernando tena and blue cross together 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.390
 again be a good idea and why not 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.940
 It seems a good idea because 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.710
 final both had already written their 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.499
 history separately it seemed that by 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.330
 order had broken with this cycle and now 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.210
 they go back to their old ways 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.909
 I insist both under the label points 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.220
 when least of losers something that to the 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.650
 long when 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.780
 and harms more to Luis Fernando had to 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.750
 the celestial machine of blue cross and this 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.150
 the fact of trying to revive a love that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.160
 already concluded or a love that gave everything 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.900
 that he had to give connects with the 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.260
 second reason the second is the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.540
 reinvention that both had suffered for 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.640
 a much more marked side Luis Fernando 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.800
 had an achievement with Olympic gold 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.600
 historic for Mexican soccer for 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.160
 the history of the national sport of what 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.830
 biggest one that has been achieved then 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.840
 you can not detract from any merit and 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.479
 on the other much more limited but 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.670
 important for dedusting purposes 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.740
 the showcase then the mx glass that got 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.100
 blue cross with memo bass is that technician 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.400
 who has been criticized so much 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.070
 so much they punished him until he finished 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.600
 being fired in this case I see a 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.340
 mistake when being together again 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.770
 Luis Fernando Tena was already another as 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.959
 got the gold had relaunched his 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.330
 career had taken all this 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.140
 warm cold label of not having 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.380
 character 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.540
 of not knowing how to deal with responsibilities 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.490
 older was up before the games 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.560
 Olympians or technicians we could say 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.420
 finish that was kept in the carousel 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.670
 of technicians because simply and simply 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.770
 because of this sickly tendency among 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.540
 managers of Mexican football but that 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.160
 he did not seem to have a great future 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.990
 Every time Luis Fernando arrived, he had a 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.790
 team was expected not to do much 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.070
 It was not in the taste of the amateur or 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.660
 of the media and cross 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.700
 blue on the other hand it was seen and 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.760
 it's still because the mx cup does not 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.770
 it was enough like a losing team but that 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.780
 at least with vázquez memo went to 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.640
 seconds closer than ever before 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.390
 get topic gives a title of 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.300
 league 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.790
 and raising the mx glass that meant 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.850
 a lot and a little at a time because I was doing 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.530
 a lot did not win and little because in the end 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.740
 what really matters in the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.540
 Mexican football we know it's the title 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.540
 is the league title or in any case the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.420
 concachampions but the cup mx knew very 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.540
 little but still ended motivating 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.380
 to the cross-blue team then in this 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.570
 reinvention 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.310
 it seems to me that Luis Fernando had 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.720
 I commented on his second mistake in very 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.510
 little time the first was to have 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.950
 accepted to be a substitute for josé manuel 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.590
 chepo of the tower for the party 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.450
 eliminatory and then there is your 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.330
 arrival at blue cross is a reinvention 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.640
 that you cut to go back to the past 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.830
 unexplainable we go with the third reason 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.320
 that seems fundamental to me in the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.180
 paradigm of the current cruzazulino and 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.519
 also from the detractors there is a 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.200
 reading that says this blue cross as the 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.690
 Mexican national team in trouble 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.210
 qualifiers needs a technician with 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.540
 character 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.130
 with eggs as it is popularly said 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.750
 well, Luis Fernando Tena is not a 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.540
 technical that is characterized precisely 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.000
 that's why it's a technician worth the 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.070
 comparison more to the vucetich than to what 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.840
 Miguel Herrera and it is very clear to me that 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.850
 when there is a crisis of results that 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.350
 when a title is not achieved the 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.900
 generalized reading that does not 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.300
 necessarily is the correct one but if the 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.310
 vox populi is that you need a technician 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.170
 with a motivating character that screams for 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.750
 that many crossbows asked tomás 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.020
 Boy, that's why many cross-bred 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.300
 his moment they have asked Felix but not in 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.820
 this case once again the directive does 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.860
 what he considers prudent and that 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.080
 prudence goes against what the 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.210
 amateur feels when they come 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.460
 problems when suddenly the 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.050
 circumstances are adverse , and we see 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.210
 a luis fernando had attitude 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.790
 similar to that of memo vázquez in the 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.920
 final before blue cross after believing in 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.930
 America equalized in the scoreboard 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.820
 global will come the criticisms and 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.620
 questions to Guillermo Vázquez with 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.260
 everything in the cup mx 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.389
 he was not forgiven his reaction in the final 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.580
 before america his reaction is a reaction 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.040
 as they want to see and I think luis 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.560
 fernando tena is clearly more than 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.510
 same in that sense not everything is character 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.270
 it's not all screaming what vucetich has said 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.830
 after having left very fast very 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.960
 soon of the Mexican national team but 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.820
 to do you have to appear and in this 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.950
 Fernando Luis Tena case does not appear 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.870
 solution to raise a dead person to a 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.330
 equipment that is emotionally weakened 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.810
 whenever the finals come and for 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.240
 that's my reading at the end of all this 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.520
 all this list of reasons is that 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.410
 luis fernando tena will lose more than cross 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.290
 blue very probably blue cross 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.450
 will accumulate six months plus one more year without 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.910
 title but the one of luis fernando tena is 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.470
 bury a reinvention that he himself 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.930
 had achieved with a historic achievement 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.870
 the gold medal in the games 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.240
 Olympics that presea should have served to 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.430
 truly catapult and look for new 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.860
 alternatives new roads will not return 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.500
 to the past there will cost you dearly already 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.260
 blue cross a few months or a year 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.660
 more than drought titles that's what 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.350
 I ask and you remember to follow me in 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.210
 twitter 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.890
 mcafee and also of course 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.450
 subscribe to this YouTube channel 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.930
 where every week we will be with the 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.940
 Mark points here the luck ends 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.330
 of blue cross I wish I was wrong he accepted 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.470
 the team I like him 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.629
 and that despite everything despite being 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.490
 americanista I would like that you 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:20.199
 Fernando Tena continued to catapult his 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:24.509
 race and blue cross and ending with a 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.509
 drought that even retractors hurt
