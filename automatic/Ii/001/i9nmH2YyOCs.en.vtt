a<00:01:04.080> charge<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.500> putting<00:01:04.619> together<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
a charge of putting together the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.640 
a charge of putting together the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
concession aha agile and I think that's

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.230 
concession aha agile and I think that's
how<00:01:07.770> Einstein<00:01:07.979> came<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> theory<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
how Einstein came up with a theory of

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.030 
how Einstein came up with a theory of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
relativity he was working on the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.890 
relativity he was working on the
concession<00:01:11.549> schedule<00:01:12.000> yeah<00:01:12.240> stumbled<00:01:12.840> upon
