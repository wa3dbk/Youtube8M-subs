00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
kog'maw even in that ad carry position

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.439 
kog'maw even in that ad carry position
put<00:05:47.099> more<00:05:47.250> weight<00:05:47.400> on<00:05:47.460> wildturtle<00:05:47.969> shoulders

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
put more weight on wildturtle shoulders

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.059 
put more weight on wildturtle shoulders
he<00:05:48.599> showed<00:05:48.870> us<00:05:49.020> before<00:05:49.380> that<00:05:49.529> he<00:05:49.650> can<00:05:49.800> handle

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
he showed us before that he can handle

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.820 
he showed us before that he can handle
it<00:05:50.130> yeah<00:05:50.849> I<00:05:50.880> think<00:05:51.090> that<00:05:51.419> it's<00:05:51.599> a<00:05:51.990> lot<00:05:52.590> better

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
it yeah I think that it's a lot better

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.010 
it yeah I think that it's a lot better
if<00:05:53.099> TSM<00:05:53.550> gets<00:05:53.969> a<00:05:54.180> better<00:05:54.419> light<00:05:54.630> game<00:05:54.810> in<00:05:54.930> this

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
if TSM gets a better light game in this

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.050 
if TSM gets a better light game in this
next<00:05:55.229> draft<00:05:55.500> but<00:05:55.830> it's<00:05:56.490> just<00:05:56.729> so<00:05:56.849> hard<00:05:57.029> for

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
next draft but it's just so hard for

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.430 
next draft but it's just so hard for
them<00:05:57.240> to<00:05:57.270> close<00:05:57.449> out<00:05:57.599> games<00:05:57.629> right<00:05:58.169> now<00:05:58.199> the

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
them to close out games right now the

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.010 
them to close out games right now the
way<00:05:58.800> that<00:05:58.830> they're<00:05:59.099> playing<00:05:59.370> because<00:05:59.900> if<00:06:00.900> you

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
way that they're playing because if you

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.480 
way that they're playing because if you
have<00:06:01.169> them<00:06:01.319> if<00:06:01.469> you're<00:06:01.680> playing<00:06:01.860> SCIP<00:06:02.279> and

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
have them if you're playing SCIP and

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.189 
have them if you're playing SCIP and
impact<00:06:02.759> is<00:06:02.879> running<00:06:03.210> one<00:06:03.360> of<00:06:03.449> these<00:06:03.569> really

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
impact is running one of these really

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.809 
impact is running one of these really
tanky<00:06:04.500> bruises<00:06:04.860> with<00:06:04.979> skirmisher<00:06:05.340> saber<00:06:05.610> it

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
tanky bruises with skirmisher saber it

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.399 
tanky bruises with skirmisher saber it
becomes<00:06:06.150> an<00:06:06.270> impossible<00:06:06.810> split<00:06:07.020> push<00:06:07.169> threat

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:07.409 
becomes an impossible split push threat

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.629 
becomes an impossible split push threat
so<00:06:07.500> it's<00:06:07.620> really<00:06:07.740> hard<00:06:08.009> for<00:06:08.069> you<00:06:08.190> to<00:06:08.279> get<00:06:08.490> up

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
so it's really hard for you to get up

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.580 
so it's really hard for you to get up
and<00:06:08.789> group<00:06:09.300> as<00:06:09.449> you<00:06:09.599> saw<00:06:09.779> like<00:06:09.930> when<00:06:10.080> TSM<00:06:10.409> did

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
and group as you saw like when TSM did

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.659 
and group as you saw like when TSM did
group<00:06:10.770> there<00:06:11.069> were<00:06:11.159> these<00:06:11.250> really<00:06:11.490> sloppy

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
group there were these really sloppy

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:12.830 
group there were these really sloppy
fights<00:06:12.000> because<00:06:12.150> they<00:06:12.360> couldn't<00:06:12.539> ever<00:06:12.719> get

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
fights because they couldn't ever get

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.330 
fights because they couldn't ever get
together<00:06:13.020> to<00:06:13.289> get<00:06:13.349> vision<00:06:13.680> before<00:06:13.889> the<00:06:14.190> fight

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
together to get vision before the fight

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.070 
together to get vision before the fight
started<00:06:14.759> and<00:06:14.909> when<00:06:15.569> you're<00:06:15.690> playing<00:06:15.840> against

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
started and when you're playing against

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.629 
started and when you're playing against
romano<00:06:16.289> with<00:06:16.409> skirmishers<00:06:17.129> saver<00:06:17.340> like<00:06:17.520> i

romano with skirmishers saver like i

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.189

said<00:06:17.849> it's<00:06:18.240> just<00:06:18.330> really<00:06:18.750> hard<00:06:18.990> there's<00:06:19.139> so

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
said it's just really hard there's so

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:19.999 
said it's just really hard there's so
much<00:06:19.259> pressure<00:06:19.440> on<00:06:19.590> the<00:06:19.710> map<00:06:19.800> you<00:06:19.830> have<00:06:19.949> to

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:20.009 
much pressure on the map you have to

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:21.499 
much pressure on the map you have to
send<00:06:20.159> one<00:06:20.250> or<00:06:20.639> two<00:06:20.819> people<00:06:21.000> to<00:06:21.180> go<00:06:21.300> deal<00:06:21.479> with

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
send one or two people to go deal with

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:23.360 
send one or two people to go deal with
them<00:06:21.810> and<00:06:22.020> it's<00:06:22.259> just<00:06:22.469> impossible<00:06:22.860> for<00:06:23.250> you<00:06:23.340> to

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
them and it's just impossible for you to

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.709 
them and it's just impossible for you to
get<00:06:23.520> to<00:06:23.610> group<00:06:23.729> up<00:06:23.879> so<00:06:24.029> having<00:06:24.539> a<00:06:24.599> better
