alright so without further ado you're
doing<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.310> review<00:00:05.640> on<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:06.440> CSX<00:00:07.440> low<00:00:08.900> they<00:00:09.900> have

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
doing a review on the CSX low they have

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.780 
doing a review on the CSX low they have
about<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.349> forty<00:00:10.800> nine<00:00:10.950> millimeter<00:00:11.490> height

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
about a forty nine millimeter height

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.099 
about a forty nine millimeter height
from<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.990> base<00:00:13.440> plate<00:00:14.030> toward<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> mid<00:00:15.990> to

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
from the base plate toward the mid to

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.859 
from the base plate toward the mid to
live<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.410> exome<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.390> they<00:00:18.390> have<00:00:18.570> about<00:00:18.840> a

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
live the exome and they have about a

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.160 
live the exome and they have about a
medium<00:00:20.779> hangar<00:00:21.779> angle<00:00:22.529> second<00:00:23.960> as<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.080> can

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
medium hangar angle second as you can

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.050 
medium hangar angle second as you can
see<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.529> not<00:00:25.680> real<00:00:25.920> vertical<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.580> also<00:00:26.849> not

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
see it's not real vertical and also not

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.939 
see it's not real vertical and also not
real<00:00:27.300> right<00:00:27.930> back<00:00:28.170> because<00:00:28.529> when<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.769> has<00:00:28.920> a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
real right back because when it has a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.020 
real right back because when it has a
high<00:00:30.320> hangar<00:00:31.320> angle<00:00:32.070> it'll<00:00:32.489> fill<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> lot

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
high hangar angle it'll fill a lot

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.850 
high hangar angle it'll fill a lot
higher<00:00:33.270> than<00:00:33.329> what<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> truck<00:00:34.079> really<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.500> and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
higher than what the truck really is and

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.889 
higher than what the truck really is and
it<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:35.670> give<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.880> some<00:00:36.059> tension<00:00:36.570> when<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.780> go

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
it will give it some tension when you go

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.750 
it will give it some tension when you go
to<00:00:36.960> pop<00:00:37.219> if<00:00:38.219> as<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.520> low<00:00:39.260> hang<00:00:40.260> your<00:00:40.440> angle<00:00:40.829> it's

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
to pop if as a low hang your angle it's

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.920 
to pop if as a low hang your angle it's
going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> feel<00:00:42.210> lower<00:00:42.450> than<00:00:42.570> what<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.899> really

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
going to feel lower than what it really

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410 
going to feel lower than what it really
is<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.550> give<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.879> lot<00:00:45.210> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
is and it's going to give you a lot of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.950 
is and it's going to give you a lot of
response<00:00:47.960> but<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.079> one's<00:00:49.260> about<00:00:50.870> it's<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
response but this one's about it's a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.319 
response but this one's about it's a
medium<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> pretty<00:00:53.940> much<00:00:54.030> fill

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
medium so it's going to pretty much fill

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.630 
medium so it's going to pretty much fill
the<00:00:54.510> height<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.960> really<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.520> kind<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the height that it really is kind of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.069 
the height that it really is kind of
going<00:00:56.789> towards<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.420> low<00:00:57.539> because<00:00:57.750> these

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
going towards the low because these

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.810 
going towards the low because these
trucks<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.440> some<00:00:58.649> good<00:00:58.800> pop<00:00:59.340> response

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
trucks have some good pop response

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
trucks have some good pop response
that's<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.300> sure<00:01:00.449> some<00:01:01.109> are<00:01:01.230> really<00:01:01.350> noticed

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
that's for sure some are really noticed

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.640 
that's for sure some are really noticed
about<00:01:01.949> them<00:01:03.049> something<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.500> my

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
about them something I like I like my

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.179 
about them something I like I like my
board<00:01:04.979> low<00:01:05.600> like<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> lot<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.140> responsive<00:01:07.979> pop

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
board low like a lot of responsive pop

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.670 
board low like a lot of responsive pop
because<00:01:08.430> i<00:01:08.520> actually<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.880> issues<00:01:09.680> popping

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
because i actually have issues popping

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.080 
because i actually have issues popping
my<00:01:10.920> tricks<00:01:11.130> all<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> way<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:13.549> helps<00:01:14.549> out

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
my tricks all the way so that helps out

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.249 
my tricks all the way so that helps out
quite<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:19.100> now<00:01:20.100> turn<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.820> i've<00:01:21.390> had<00:01:22.049> better

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
quite a bit now turn was i've had better

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.210 
quite a bit now turn was i've had better
and<00:01:22.380> i've<00:01:22.560> had<00:01:22.770> worse<00:01:23.960> they<00:01:24.960> didn't<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.890> i

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and i've had worse they didn't really i

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.310 
and i've had worse they didn't really i
don't<00:01:26.340> think<00:01:26.759> they<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:27.000> turn<00:01:27.720> really<00:01:28.020> good

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
don't think they really turn really good

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.350 
don't think they really turn really good
i<00:01:28.350> mean<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.619> i<00:01:28.710> skate<00:01:28.979> loose<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.640> i<00:01:29.729> had<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
put soft pushing them because the

knots<00:02:04.710> trying<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.009> figure<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.399> out<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.549> was<00:02:05.759> like

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
knots trying to figure it out I was like

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.119 
knots trying to figure it out I was like
okay<00:02:06.090> maybe<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.450> bushings<00:02:06.899> are<00:02:07.170> getting<00:02:07.950> some

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
okay maybe the bushings are getting some

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.869 
okay maybe the bushings are getting some
drupa<00:02:08.489> JH<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.360> switched<00:02:10.229> them<00:02:10.410> out<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.879> some

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
drupa JH so I switched them out for some

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.400 
drupa JH so I switched them out for some
mediums

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
mediums

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.700

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the case so I'm like okay maybe I'll

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.780 
the case so I'm like okay maybe I'll
just<00:02:18.840> kind<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.950> mess<00:02:20.340> around<00:02:20.460> with<00:02:20.640> him<00:02:20.670> a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
just kind of mess around with him a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.130 
just kind of mess around with him a

little bit more have a soft and a medium

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.220 
little bit more have a soft and a medium
wasn't<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.010> case<00:02:23.130> either<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:24.570> for<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.050> case

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
wasn't the case either and for the case

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.830 
wasn't the case either and for the case
that<00:02:25.560> end<00:02:25.860> for<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.250> fact<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.840> mounting

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
that end for the fact that the mounting

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.570 
that end for the fact that the mounting
holes<00:02:27.960> weren't<00:02:28.410> stretching<00:02:28.770> out<00:02:28.920> at<00:02:29.040> all<00:02:29.190> that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.700 
holes weren't stretching out at all that
really<00:02:29.820> had<00:02:30.030> me<00:02:30.150> puzzled<00:02:30.300> but<00:02:31.170> then<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.350> got<00:02:31.560> to

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
really had me puzzled but then I got to

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.460 
really had me puzzled but then I got to
thinking<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.280> pivot<00:02:32.760> cup<00:02:33.200> that's<00:02:34.200> what<00:02:34.380> it

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
thinking of the pivot cup that's what it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.040 
thinking of the pivot cup that's what it
could<00:02:34.620> be<00:02:35.120> thing<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.510> don't<00:02:36.660> know<00:02:36.810> how<00:02:36.960> to

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
could be thing is I don't know how to

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.840 
could be thing is I don't know how to
prove<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.640> other<00:02:38.640> than<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:40.440> pivot<00:02:40.800> cup<00:02:41.130> they

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
prove that other than the pivot cup they

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.880 
prove that other than the pivot cup they
like<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.180> would<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:43.260> would<00:02:43.350> be<00:02:43.470> like<00:02:43.590> off<00:02:43.800> to

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
like you would it would be like off to

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.310 
like you would it would be like off to
the<00:02:44.010> side<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> bit<00:02:44.520> or<00:02:44.700> something<00:02:45.090> but<00:02:46.020> it

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
the side a bit or something but it

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.690 
the side a bit or something but it
didn't<00:02:46.620> appear<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.980> be<00:02:47.070> off<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.430> side

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
didn't appear to be off to the side

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.250 
didn't appear to be off to the side
