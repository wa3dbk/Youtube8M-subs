00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.059
 I am a trattoria choice and we are at home 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.830
 to encourage them she has a channel 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:15.030
 very nice that is called me told me what 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.039
 they beat the incredible tips this bread you 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.269
 teaches how to comb my hair like that 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.269
 I need to see it 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.119
 and hey baby is waiting for me and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.989
 He asked that if we made his channel 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.860
 I decided that I remembered that you train like 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.739
 example thanks to my name is free I 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:47.199
 I learned a lot of migration in this 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.190
 video is all about 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.440
 teach 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.140
 craftsmanship the first 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.410
 and I will also teach him to do something but 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.719
 talking, I realized that ale 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.519
 teaches us things for the house for 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.430
 decorations so good talks a lot about 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.229
 she and it is that if they will see it live not what 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.590
 they would believe the complexion so perfect that 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.590
 they have 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.020
 but is that if this incredible 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.650
 and the first thing I said is how do you 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:27.119
 you take care of the face of the skin and you had 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.310
 tell us about emelec keep them not us 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.369
 it says how you look too 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.580
 First of all, the recommendation is 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.780
 take two liters of water daily 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.170
 dryness your skin falls 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.170
 and good try to sleep for about 8 hours 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.640
 of addiction by the creams 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.640
 It impresses me because I said 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.899
 I shocked myself because it turns out that 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:05.030
 I have cream in my hair ok of course 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.500
 that swims the feet cream for the cuticle 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.410
 cream on the lips 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:16.460
 vital cream for an emergency always 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.730
 application something and then good 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.730
 we arrived with the body cream 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.730
 fundamental 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.540
 cream every time make up all the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.260
 knows and is very good 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.739
 then I have cream for the day for the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.739
 night 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.330
 the makeup 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.600
 it's good he doubled it went down but that's why 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.640
 all this came out 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.520
 because he wants to learn from someone who 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.440
 follow when the skin very well and then 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.830
 what about the two liters of water and sleep 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:08.819
 all and then we do not do it there 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.870
 do it actively and then fundamental 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.900
 where they are 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:20.250
 Now all your baby every day 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.250

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.510

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.150

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.800
