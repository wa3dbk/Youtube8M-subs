second in our bit making video in this

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.690 
second in our bit making video in this
video<00:00:12.679> I'm<00:00:12.769> going<00:00:12.950> to<00:00:13.040> show<00:00:13.160> you<00:00:13.190> how<00:00:13.429> to<00:00:13.490> make

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
video I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.089 
video I'm going to show you how to make
a<00:00:13.880> heavy<00:00:14.179> work<00:00:14.450> spit<00:00:14.840> also<00:00:15.590> known<00:00:15.799> as<00:00:15.980> they

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
a heavy work spit also known as they

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.999 
a heavy work spit also known as they
folded<00:00:16.610> detail<00:00:17.090> bit<00:00:17.439> there<00:00:18.439> is<00:00:18.529> no<00:00:18.680> point

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
folded detail bit there is no point

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.910 
folded detail bit there is no point
making<00:00:19.160> this<00:00:19.490> out<00:00:19.640> of<00:00:19.820> light<00:00:20.029> wire<00:00:20.330> guys

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
making this out of light wire guys

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.529 
making this out of light wire guys
because<00:00:21.920> if<00:00:22.520> you<00:00:22.699> make<00:00:22.850> it<00:00:22.970> out<00:00:23.060> of<00:00:23.090> light<00:00:23.330> wire

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
because if you make it out of light wire

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:24.759 
because if you make it out of light wire
you're<00:00:23.840> just<00:00:23.990> going<00:00:24.109> to<00:00:24.140> end<00:00:24.289> up<00:00:24.410> with<00:00:24.560> a<00:00:24.590> bit

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
you're just going to end up with a bit

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.250 
you're just going to end up with a bit
that's<00:00:24.949> very<00:00:25.220> similar<00:00:25.640> to<00:00:25.820> a<00:00:25.900> fine<00:00:26.900> detail

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
that's very similar to a fine detail

from there guys exactly the same as the
fine<00:01:37.870> detail<00:01:38.230> point<00:01:38.760> pinched<00:01:39.760> below<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.990> tip

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
fine detail point pinched below the tip

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.990 
fine detail point pinched below the tip
and<00:01:42.390> squeeze<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:45.100> give<00:01:45.250> yourself<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.700> detail

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
and squeeze to give yourself the detail

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.580 
and squeeze to give yourself the detail
point<00:01:46.270> but<00:01:46.810> what<00:01:46.900> you're<00:01:47.020> going<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.260> do<00:01:47.410> now

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
point but what you're going to do now

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.720 
point but what you're going to do now
guys<00:01:47.830> is<00:01:48.130> you're<00:01:48.220> going<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.400> come<00:01:48.550> down<00:01:48.580> a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
guys is you're going to come down a

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.760 
guys is you're going to come down a
little<00:01:48.880> bit<00:01:49.060> lower<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.590> you're<00:01:50.590> going<00:01:50.710> to

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
little bit lower and you're going to

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.410 
little bit lower and you're going to
squeeze<00:01:50.950> again

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.510 

now<00:01:56.420> you<00:01:56.960> could<00:01:57.170> shake<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.500> tines<00:01:57.920> now<00:01:58.220> guys

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
now you could shake the tines now guys

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.760 
now you could shake the tines now guys
you<00:01:58.880> could<00:01:59.030> shake<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.390> connect<00:01:59.659> points<00:02:00.110> but<00:02:00.650> I

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
you could shake the connect points but I

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.170 
you could shake the connect points but I
don't<00:02:00.979> like<00:02:01.130> doing<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.520> because<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:01.940> feel

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
don't like doing that because I feel

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.730 
don't like doing that because I feel
that<00:02:02.360> it's<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.540> bit<00:02:02.659> of<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.810> waste<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.200> time<00:02:03.440> and

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
that it's a bit of a waste of time and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.609 
that it's a bit of a waste of time and
effort<00:02:04.119> because<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.479> tines<00:02:06.140> often<00:02:06.500> get

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
effort because the tines often get

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.469 
effort because the tines often get
ruined<00:02:06.950> by<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.159> next<00:02:07.400> stage<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:07.940> what<00:02:08.240> I<00:02:08.270> like

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
ruined by the next stage so what I like

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.730 
ruined by the next stage so what I like

guys and squeezed in there is a heavy

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.459 
guys and squeezed in there is a heavy
works<00:03:21.459> bit<00:03:21.760> if<00:03:22.569> there's<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.870> bit<00:03:23.079> of<00:03:23.109> a<00:03:23.260> loop

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:23.469 
works bit if there's a bit of a loop

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.080 
works bit if there's a bit of a loop
here<00:03:23.829> and<00:03:23.859> you're<00:03:24.099> not<00:03:24.280> happy<00:03:24.519> with<00:03:24.639> the<00:03:24.819> space

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
here and you're not happy with the space

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
here and you're not happy with the space
you've<00:03:25.299> got<00:03:25.450> there<00:03:26.159> just<00:03:27.599> pinch<00:03:28.599> it<00:03:28.719> down

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.900 

yep<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.530> from<00:03:36.040> there<00:03:36.190> guys<00:03:36.370> we<00:03:36.550> go<00:03:36.670> on<00:03:36.790> to

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
yep and from there guys we go on to

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.020 
yep and from there guys we go on to
shaping<00:03:37.240> our<00:03:37.360> times<00:03:38.310> what<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.340> tend<00:03:39.610> to<00:03:39.700> do<00:03:39.820> guys

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
shaping our times what I tend to do guys

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.250 
shaping our times what I tend to do guys
is<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.300> tend<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.600> hold<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:40.990> vertically<00:03:43.050> like<00:03:44.050> so

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
is I tend to hold it vertically like so

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.320 
is I tend to hold it vertically like so
but<00:03:45.100> other<00:03:45.220> than<00:03:45.400> that<00:03:45.490> other<00:03:45.850> than<00:03:46.000> holding

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
but other than that other than holding

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.990 
but other than that other than holding
it<00:03:46.450> vertically<00:03:46.870> rather<00:03:47.290> than<00:03:47.410> horizontally

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
it vertically rather than horizontally

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.550 
it vertically rather than horizontally
so<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.290> point<00:03:50.290> goes<00:03:50.500> in<00:03:51.210> like<00:03:52.210> that<00:03:52.560> shaping

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
so the point goes in like that shaping

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.170 
so the point goes in like that shaping
the<00:03:53.620> tines<00:03:53.890> works<00:03:54.160> exactly<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.730> same<00:03:54.940> as<00:03:55.060> it

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
the tines works exactly the same as it

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.790 
the tines works exactly the same as it
does<00:03:55.330> every<00:03:55.870> other<00:03:56.530> time<00:03:57.300> we<00:03:58.470> take<00:03:59.470> hold<00:03:59.710> of

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
does every other time we take hold of

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.820 
does every other time we take hold of
the<00:03:59.920> wire<00:04:01.050> which<00:04:02.050> is<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.230> little<00:04:02.530> hard<00:04:02.740> because

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
the wire which is a little hard because

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.050 
the wire which is a little hard because
they're<00:04:03.010> close<00:04:03.190> together<00:04:03.430> but<00:04:03.580> we<00:04:03.670> take<00:04:03.850> hold

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
they're close together but we take hold

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.610 
they're close together but we take hold
the<00:04:04.180> wire<00:04:04.360> a<00:04:04.540> little<00:04:04.810> bit<00:04:04.930> up<00:04:05.050> above<00:04:05.350> from<00:04:05.590> the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
the wire a little bit up above from the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.940 
the wire a little bit up above from the
base<00:04:06.480> squeeze<00:04:07.480> with<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.750> pliers<00:04:07.990> and<00:04:08.290> pull

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
base squeeze with the pliers and pull

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.410 
base squeeze with the pliers and pull
towards<00:04:09.820> yourself<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.820> there<00:04:13.000> you<00:04:13.060> go

you've got one tine take hold of the

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.500 
you've got one tine take hold of the
wire<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.480> little<00:04:17.350> bit<00:04:17.590> above<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.890> base<00:04:18.040> and

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
while burning because you've got this

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.530 
while burning because you've got this
fold<00:04:37.660> here<00:04:38.080> this<00:04:38.890> curve<00:04:39.220> here<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.910> this<00:04:40.300> curve

fold here this curve here and this curve
here<00:04:40.810> does<00:04:41.140> help<00:04:41.650> to<00:04:41.830> reduce<00:04:41.950> the<00:04:42.370> amount<00:04:42.640> of

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
here does help to reduce the amount of

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.450 
here does help to reduce the amount of

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
pitting and the amount of sink you get

the amount of digging you get when you

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.500 
the amount of digging you get when you
push<00:04:47.440> away<00:04:47.590> from<00:04:47.950> yourself<00:04:48.310> with<00:04:49.120> pyrography

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
push away from yourself with pyrography

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.150 
push away from yourself with pyrography
I<00:04:49.750> always<00:04:50.080> think<00:04:50.290> you<00:04:50.410> should<00:04:50.560> draw<00:04:50.770> towards

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
I always think you should draw towards

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.370 
I always think you should draw towards
yourself<00:04:51.280> it's<00:04:51.640> easier<00:04:52.270> it's<00:04:52.690> easier<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:53.110> draw

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
yourself it's easier it's easier to draw

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.350 
yourself it's easier it's easier to draw
the<00:04:53.440> pen<00:04:53.740> across<00:04:54.070> what<00:04:54.610> you're<00:04:54.730> doing<00:04:54.970> toward

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
the pen across what you're doing toward

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.210 
the pen across what you're doing toward
yourself<00:04:55.570> but<00:04:56.380> if<00:04:56.470> you<00:04:56.560> want<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.830> push<00:04:56.980> away

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
yourself but if you want to push away

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.790 
yourself but if you want to push away
for<00:04:57.460> something<00:04:57.720> then<00:04:58.720> this<00:04:59.020> kind<00:04:59.260> of<00:04:59.440> detail

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
for something then this kind of detail

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.980 
for something then this kind of detail
point<00:05:00.070> or<00:05:00.550> this<00:05:00.820> kind<00:05:00.940> of<00:05:01.120> folded<00:05:01.720> detail

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
point or this kind of folded detail

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.260 
point or this kind of folded detail
point<00:05:02.200> or<00:05:02.350> heavy<00:05:02.530> works<00:05:02.740> point<00:05:03.070> is<00:05:03.430> quite<00:05:03.910> good

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
point or heavy works point is quite good

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.480 
point or heavy works point is quite good
for<00:05:04.450> that<00:05:04.540> so<00:05:05.440> that's<00:05:05.530> a<00:05:05.710> heavy<00:05:05.920> works<00:05:06.160> point

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
for that so that's a heavy works point

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.610 
for that so that's a heavy works point
guys<00:05:06.670> as<00:05:06.970> I<00:05:07.390> said<00:05:07.600> make<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:07.960> with<00:05:08.200> thick<00:05:08.410> wire

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
guys as I said make it with thick wire

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.650 
guys as I said make it with thick wire
because<00:05:09.250> that's<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:09.940> point<00:05:10.090> of<00:05:10.240> it<00:05:10.330> is<00:05:10.480> to<00:05:10.570> get

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
because that's the point of it is to get

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.510 
because that's the point of it is to get
nice<00:05:10.870> and<00:05:11.050> hot<00:05:11.200> it<00:05:11.590> will<00:05:11.920> provide<00:05:12.160> you<00:05:12.370> with<00:05:12.400> a

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
nice and hot it will provide you with a

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.390 
nice and hot it will provide you with a
greater<00:05:12.820> store<00:05:13.330> of<00:05:13.480> heat<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:14.800> greater<00:05:15.040> heat

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
greater store of heat and a greater heat

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.880 
greater store of heat and a greater heat
than<00:05:15.850> a<00:05:16.860> thick<00:05:17.860> detail<00:05:18.340> point<00:05:18.640> would<00:05:19.800> but<00:05:20.800> it

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
than a thick detail point would but it

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.290 
than a thick detail point would but it
won't<00:05:21.070> provide<00:05:21.280> as<00:05:21.430> much<00:05:21.580> heat<00:05:21.820> or<00:05:21.970> energy<00:05:22.090> as

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
won't provide as much heat or energy as

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.350 
won't provide as much heat or energy as
a<00:05:22.330> coil<00:05:22.600> point<00:05:22.870> so<00:05:23.800> guys<00:05:24.010> that's<00:05:24.610> that<00:05:24.850> point<00:05:25.030> I

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
a coil point so guys that's that point I

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.470 
a coil point so guys that's that point I

greasy the thing you will notice is when

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.649 
greasy the thing you will notice is when
you<00:05:45.610> first

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
you first

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.619 
you first
with<00:05:47.110> homemade<00:05:47.620> points<00:05:48.180> they<00:05:49.180> will<00:05:49.330> give<00:05:49.509> off

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:49.629 
with homemade points they will give off

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:51.390 
with homemade points they will give off
a<00:05:49.659> little<00:05:49.870> bit<00:05:50.020> of<00:05:50.169> smoke<00:05:50.439> you<00:05:51.129> shouldn't

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
a little bit of smoke you shouldn't

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.399 
a little bit of smoke you shouldn't
breed<00:05:51.550> that<00:05:51.759> because<00:05:52.060> it's<00:05:52.180> oil<00:05:52.360> smoke<00:05:52.659> but

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409
