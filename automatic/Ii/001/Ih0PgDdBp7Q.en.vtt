00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.810
 [Music] 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.879
 we continue with direct witnesses 5 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.950
 families of indigenous Huitotos are 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:13.019
 They became tourism entrepreneurs 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.940
 in the city of Villavicencio after 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.680
 have been displaced from their lands 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.770
 today the aborigines teach the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.560
 visitors to command and hunt and dance for 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.239
 only 10 thousand pesos 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.800
 our correspondent solace 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:33.710
 He visited this new tourist spot 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:36.050
 [Music] 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 and I want 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:45.840
 it's the wool dance with a dance where 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.220
 the myths thank the mother earth 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.220
 for abundance and prosperity 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.870
 paradoxically here far from his land 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.970
 and of his belongings this dance does not 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.540
 represents the bonanza 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.900
 it's the opposite here they dance because they 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.630
 they removed everything they did not want to lose in their 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.060
 life or that of your loved ones 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.430
 [Music] 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.250
 too hard mind either be or this 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.980
 city ​​of these environments near the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.050
 city ​​thus generates in some way in the 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.790
 individual a training or a level of 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.020
 high training to be able to find 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.020
 job opportunities 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.590
 it happened nine years ago at the time of 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.359
 the demilitarized zone the battalions of the 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.700
 army that had in the region were 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.100
 retired the guerrillas seized the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.130
 zone to the point of threatening and violating 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.369
 five indigenous families forcing them to 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.100
 leave your territory the corregimiento of 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.679
 the chorrera in the putumayo then 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.080
 They started a long journey through 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.540
 Colombian jungles 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.640
 well then in the year 2003 when after 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.260
 made the situation difficult by the 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.090
 presence of the insurgency and I 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.520
 we chose to leave the region and 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.830
 we arrived at the plains with it started the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.100
 migration of myths always looking 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.500
 another method of subsistence in the city 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.020
 as villavicencio where they could not hunt 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.810
 nor fish 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.940
 here they would have to survive from another 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:24.180
 way I start to use then some 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.370
 materials of the jungle the santiago leader 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.840
 of that community after receiving a 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.300
 Entrepreneurship training 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.430
 business was given the task of convincing 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.220
 to his relatives and friends to stop 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.530
 think about the chorrera for tourists 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.130
 with his dance and thus earn money for 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.130
 subsist 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.160
 I like dance and words 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.130
 [Music] 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.620
 and everything that is 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.030
 the daily life of these aborigines 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.230
 now it is interesting to remember 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.630
 where you can observe from the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.150
 artisanal products elaboration 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.250
 scratching and baking the yucca base of its 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.410
 feeding up the murals with 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.930
 messages that talk about your lifestyle 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.690
 as it seemed very nice they teach it to one 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.950
 their culture as cooking in everything 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.750
 what you have means is one of the 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.480
 greatest attractions to visit that 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.250
 community is able to observe closely the 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.340
 processing and subsequent cultivation 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.740
 consumption of the coca leaf to only 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.200
 six kilometers from villavicencio 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.510
 Huitotos surround their village with this bush 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.160
 that for them does not kill because it is part 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.080
 of a spiritual ritual they practice 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.200
 the men of the collectivity almost to 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.200
 daily 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.720
 for their part, they claim that it has cost them 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.820
 adapt to their new lifestyle 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.520
 there had been a little more quiet 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.650
 we did not see ourselves so harassed with money 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.260
 because, for example, if we wanted 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.760
 eat and the way if fishing very tired 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.730
 I am changing and everything is turning 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.800
 around the money however having 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.490
 become city dwellers also has 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.980
 its advantages 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.890
 will be the colleges to enter the 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.620
 university and meet new things 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.560
 new customs because like them 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.640
 they say they went from being nomadic hunters to 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.640
 successful businessmen 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.509
 with ten thousand pesos per person and 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.580
 for two hours tourists enjoy 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.830
 of a show that gathers dances 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.020
 typical of their culture the talk that 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.630
 Illustrate about your ancestors and stories 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.099
 and a tour of the law of moore 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.740
 He commented on the years of use 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.240
 borrowed parameters has been so successful 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.490
 the project that on your list of 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.180
 visitors already count more than 60 thousand 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.680
 people 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.680
 [Music] 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.850
 from displaced to good entrepreneurs from 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.009
