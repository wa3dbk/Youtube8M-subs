00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
loosen this function got capisce and I

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.340 
loosen this function got capisce and I
should<00:05:27.250> like<00:05:27.820> this<00:05:28.120> there's<00:05:28.510> also<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:29.110> water

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
look down you want to point in town you

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:40.930 
look down you want to point in town you
should<00:06:31.849> do<00:06:32.849> this<00:06:33.030> way<00:06:35.360> flip<00:06:36.360> this<00:06:36.630> like<00:06:37.020> dad

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940
