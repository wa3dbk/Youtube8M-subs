I'm a furniture builder by trade and I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.120 
I'm a furniture builder by trade and I
began<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.720> realize<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.170> most<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.920> work

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
began to realize that most of this work

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.380 
began to realize that most of this work
is<00:01:23.340> no<00:01:23.460> different<00:01:23.820> than<00:01:23.850> putting<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> beautiful

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
is no different than putting a beautiful

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.109 
is no different than putting a beautiful
piece<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> furniture<00:01:25.190> together<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.460> put<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
piece of furniture together to put a the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.389 
piece of furniture together to put a the
rubbing<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.600> process<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.009> forth<00:01:29.280> is

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
rubbing out process and so forth is

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.889 
rubbing out process and so forth is
really<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> same<00:01:29.940> as<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.450> furniture

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
really the same as it is on furniture

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.370 
really the same as it is on furniture
so<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.070> prep<00:01:32.310> work<00:01:32.660> is<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.899> thing<00:01:34.080> that<00:01:34.110> took

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
so the prep work is the thing that took

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.180 
so the prep work is the thing that took
me<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.649> longest

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
me the longest

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.060 
me the longest

blogging building the climbing up and I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.150 
blogging building the climbing up and I
would<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.780> had<00:01:42.929> it<00:01:42.960> perfect<00:01:43.440> and<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:44.070> would

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.219

take<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.550> Joe<00:01:45.300> he<00:01:45.570> would<00:01:45.720> say<00:01:45.899> well<00:01:46.110> it

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
take it to Joe he would say well it

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.469 
take it to Joe he would say well it
looks<00:01:46.440> pretty<00:01:46.530> good<00:01:47.030> but<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.360> this

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
down to around 1200 grit it looked

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.460 
down to around 1200 grit it looked
beautiful<00:02:53.300> but<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.870> could<00:02:54.110> tell<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.290> wasn't

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
beautiful but I could tell it wasn't

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.900 
beautiful but I could tell it wasn't
going<00:02:54.740> to<00:02:54.830> stay<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.040> way<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.460> had<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.610> clear

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
going to stay that way so I had a clear

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.630 
going to stay that way so I had a clear
powder<00:02:56.120> coated<00:02:56.540> which<00:02:56.720> was<00:02:56.870> kind<00:02:57.050> of<00:02:57.110> my<00:02:57.230> own

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
powder coated which was kind of my own

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.440 
powder coated which was kind of my own
solution<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.820> thing<00:02:58.970> but<00:02:59.150> then<00:02:59.270> it<00:02:59.360> was

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
solution to the thing but then it was

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.050 
solution to the thing but then it was
way<00:02:59.660> too<00:02:59.690> glossy<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:01.100> we<00:03:01.430> just<00:03:01.640> had<00:03:01.790> way<00:03:02.000> too

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
way too glossy and we just had way too

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.890 
way too glossy and we just had way too
much<00:03:02.860> gloss<00:03:03.860> on<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.460> again<00:03:05.360> I<00:03:05.600> was<00:03:05.870> a

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
much gloss on it and again I was a

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.170 
much gloss on it and again I was a
furniture<00:03:06.650> builder<00:03:07.190> by<00:03:07.340> trade<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.850> so<00:03:08.000> what<00:03:08.150> I

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
furniture builder by trade and so what I

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.300 
furniture builder by trade and so what I
did<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:08.540> basically<00:03:08.690> rubbed<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.350> out<00:03:09.440> with<00:03:10.220> a

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
did is I basically rubbed it out with a

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.670 
did is I basically rubbed it out with a
succession<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:10.970> woodworking<00:03:11.630> products<00:03:12.020> and

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
succession of woodworking products and

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.290 
succession of woodworking products and
got<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.070> down<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.460> sheen<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:13.850> wanted<00:03:14.180> I

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
got it down to the sheen that I wanted I

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.240 
got it down to the sheen that I wanted I
think<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.720> turned<00:03:14.900> out<00:03:15.050> looking<00:03:16.010> fairly

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
think it turned out looking fairly

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.210 
think it turned out looking fairly

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
goes in place and exactly how it's

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.550 
goes in place and exactly how it's
supposed<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.670> be<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.540> wanted<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.410> look

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
supposed to be and I wanted it to look

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.590 
supposed to be and I wanted it to look
like<00:03:36.740> that<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.730> know<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.210> there's<00:03:38.480> other

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
like that I know that there's other

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.760 
like that I know that there's other
things<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:38.990> can<00:03:39.200> do<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.440> trunk<00:03:39.650> that

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
things that you can do to the trunk that

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.680 
things that you can do to the trunk that
make<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.070> more<00:03:40.190> user-friendly<00:03:40.520> perhaps<00:03:41.180> but<00:03:41.450> I

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
make it more user-friendly perhaps but I

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.210 
make it more user-friendly perhaps but I
really<00:03:42.080> like<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.350> idea<00:03:42.380> and<00:03:42.740> I've<00:03:42.860> actually

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
really like the idea and I've actually

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.860 
really like the idea and I've actually
argued<00:03:43.730> with<00:03:43.790> quite<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.030> few<00:03:44.180> people<00:03:44.390> about<00:03:44.600> the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
argued with quite a few people about the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.640 
argued with quite a few people about the
straps

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
straps

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.050 
straps
I<00:03:45.680> had<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.220> coat<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.430> quite<00:03:46.640> a<00:03:46.670> bit<00:03:46.820> of<00:03:46.910> trouble

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
I had the coat a quite a bit of trouble

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.150 
I had the coat a quite a bit of trouble
to<00:03:47.300> find<00:03:47.510> those<00:03:47.780> straps<00:03:48.590> which<00:03:48.830> actually

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
to find those straps which actually

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.560 
to find those straps which actually
don't<00:03:49.340> have<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.490> be<00:03:49.640> in<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.760> MAS<00:03:49.910> catalog<00:03:50.420> they

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
don't have to be in the MAS catalog they

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.760 
don't have to be in the MAS catalog they
were<00:03:50.630> there<00:03:50.840> all<00:03:50.930> along<00:03:51.140> but<00:03:51.200> they're<00:03:51.500> kind<00:03:51.680> of

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
were there all along but they're kind of

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.350 
were there all along but they're kind of
an<00:03:51.890> odd<00:03:52.040> place<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.640> straps<00:03:52.910> are<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.180> hold

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
an odd place and the straps are to hold

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.420 
an odd place and the straps are to hold
a<00:03:53.600> lot<00:03:54.050> of<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.200> tools<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.680> accessories<00:03:54.980> and

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
a lot of the tools and accessories and

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.480 
a lot of the tools and accessories and
such<00:03:55.610> in<00:03:56.209> position<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:57.680> two<00:03:57.830> cars<00:03:58.040> that<00:03:58.220> I<00:03:58.280> got

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
such in position the two cars that I got

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.430 
such in position the two cars that I got
one<00:03:59.000> hand

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
one hand

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.840 
one hand
the<00:03:59.620> one<00:03:59.770> that<00:03:59.890> had<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.010> good<00:04:00.250> body<00:04:00.490> this<00:04:00.700> will

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
the one that had the good body this will

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.310 
the one that had the good body this will
call<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.090> good<00:04:01.240> body<00:04:01.450> had<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.870> disk<00:04:02.050> wheels

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
call it good body had the disk wheels

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.990 
call it good body had the disk wheels
and<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.620> parts<00:04:02.890> car<00:04:03.160> ended<00:04:03.550> up<00:04:03.640> having<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
and the parts car ended up having the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.790 
and the parts car ended up having the
wire<00:04:04.180> wheel<00:04:04.390> so<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.780> was<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:04.900> fairly<00:04:05.530> simple

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
wire wheel so it was a fairly simple

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.440 
wire wheel so it was a fairly simple
matter<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.280> switching<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:06.760> drive<00:04:06.970> trains<00:04:07.300> in

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
matter of switching the drive trains in

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.110 
matter of switching the drive trains in
the<00:04:07.510> front<00:04:07.750> ends<00:04:07.960> over<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:09.130> accommodate<00:04:09.640> the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
the front ends over to accommodate the

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.880 
the front ends over to accommodate the
wire<00:04:10.300> wheels<00:04:10.570> on<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.870> car<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.230> have<00:04:11.290> today

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
wire wheels on the car that I have today

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.400 
wire wheels on the car that I have today
you<00:04:12.730> have<00:04:12.850> your<00:04:13.000> choice<00:04:13.240> I<00:04:13.420> guess<00:04:13.480> of<00:04:13.840> chrome

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
you have your choice I guess of chrome

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.930 
you have your choice I guess of chrome
wire<00:04:14.590> wheels<00:04:14.860> or<00:04:15.070> panda<00:04:15.370> wire<00:04:15.490> wheels<00:04:15.700> and

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
wire wheels or panda wire wheels and

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.520 
wire wheels or panda wire wheels and
I've<00:04:16.000> always<00:04:16.239> liked<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.690> fact<00:04:17.230> that<00:04:17.410> they're

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
I've always liked the fact that they're

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.620 
I've always liked the fact that they're
painted<00:04:17.890> I<00:04:18.040> think<00:04:18.520> it's<00:04:18.670> more<00:04:18.820> original<00:04:19.239> and

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
painted I think it's more original and

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.440 
painted I think it's more original and
it's<00:04:19.810> all<00:04:19.959> a<00:04:20.140> lot<00:04:20.380> easier<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.770> maintain<00:04:21.450> the

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
it's all a lot easier to maintain the

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.120 
it's all a lot easier to maintain the
interior<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:22.930> car<00:04:23.140> which<00:04:23.440> is<00:04:23.470> coarse<00:04:23.890> the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
interior of the car which is coarse the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.580 
interior of the car which is coarse the
part<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.520> most<00:04:24.730> of<00:04:24.940> us<00:04:25.030> see<00:04:25.270> most<00:04:25.960> often<00:04:26.140> I

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
part that most of us see most often I

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.680 
part that most of us see most often I
wanted<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.430> try<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.670> keep<00:04:27.790> it<00:04:28.030> as<00:04:28.240> original<00:04:28.270> as

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
wanted to try to keep it as original as

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.390 
wanted to try to keep it as original as
possible<00:04:28.720> I<00:04:29.290> always<00:04:29.500> said<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.830> two<00:04:29.980> cars<00:04:30.220> that

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
possible I always said the two cars that

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.520 
possible I always said the two cars that
had<00:04:30.610> previously<00:04:30.930> were<00:04:31.930> pretty<00:04:32.170> much<00:04:32.320> done

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
had previously were pretty much done

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.750 
had previously were pretty much done
like<00:04:32.710> this<00:04:32.920> they<00:04:33.100> had<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.340> black<00:04:33.550> leather

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
like this they had the black leather

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.480 
like this they had the black leather
with<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.090> white<00:04:34.330> piping<00:04:34.570> in<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:34.900> black

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
with the white piping in the black

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.770 
with the white piping in the black
carpeting<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:37.030> so<00:04:37.180> we<00:04:37.270> still<00:04:37.510> wanted<00:04:37.690> that

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
carpeting and so we still wanted that

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.450 
carpeting and so we still wanted that
look<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.170> think<00:04:38.290> that's<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.710> classic<00:04:39.130> English

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
look I think that's the classic English

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.940 
look I think that's the classic English
sports<00:04:40.240> car<00:04:40.540> look<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:41.020> really<00:04:41.560> wanted<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.800> keep

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
sports car look I really wanted to keep

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.840 
sports car look I really wanted to keep
the<00:04:42.460> interior<00:04:42.880> as<00:04:42.940> original<00:04:43.390> as<00:04:43.480> possible<00:04:43.990> and

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
the interior as original as possible and

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.880 
the interior as original as possible and
probably<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:45.970> thing<00:04:46.210> that<00:04:46.390> I<00:04:46.870> think<00:04:47.440> I'm<00:04:47.770> the

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
probably the thing that I think I'm the

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.740 
probably the thing that I think I'm the
proudest<00:04:48.250> of<00:04:48.430> which<00:04:48.970> is<00:04:49.060> almost<00:04:49.450> sort<00:04:49.600> of<00:04:49.660> an

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
proudest of which is almost sort of an

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.420 
proudest of which is almost sort of an
accident<00:04:50.110> er<00:04:50.230> came<00:04:50.440> out<00:04:50.560> of<00:04:50.650> frustration<00:04:50.830> as<00:04:51.340> I

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
accident er came out of frustration as I

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.100 
accident er came out of frustration as I
kept<00:04:51.640> trying<00:04:51.850> to<00:04:51.970> use<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.390> wrinkle<00:04:52.780> spray

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
kept trying to use the wrinkle spray

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.230 
kept trying to use the wrinkle spray
paint<00:04:53.410> on<00:04:54.040> the<00:04:54.220> dashboard<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:54.970> harder<00:04:55.210> I

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.730 
paint on the dashboard and the harder I
tried<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.780> worse<00:04:55.870> of<00:04:56.080> that<00:04:56.260> I<00:04:56.470> think<00:04:56.530> I

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
tried the worse of that I think I

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.870 
tried the worse of that I think I
probably<00:04:56.890> went<00:04:57.160> through<00:04:57.190> two<00:04:57.430> or<00:04:57.520> three<00:04:57.700> cases

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
probably went through two or three cases

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.390 
probably went through two or three cases
of<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.380> wrinkle<00:04:59.380> coat<00:04:59.560> spray<00:04:59.860> paint<00:05:00.100> trying

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
of that wrinkle coat spray paint trying

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.880 
of that wrinkle coat spray paint trying
to<00:05:00.490> get<00:05:00.640> a<00:05:00.690> decent<00:05:01.690> result<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.830> don't

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
to get a decent result and I don't

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.430 
to get a decent result and I don't
remember<00:05:03.250> where<00:05:03.640> or<00:05:04.510> who<00:05:04.780> told<00:05:05.110> me<00:05:05.260> but

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
remember where or who told me but

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.620 
remember where or who told me but
somebody<00:05:05.800> said<00:05:06.040> you<00:05:06.160> could<00:05:06.310> get<00:05:06.460> that<00:05:06.640> powder

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
somebody said you could get that powder

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.330 
somebody said you could get that powder
coated<00:05:08.050> in<00:05:08.200> a<00:05:08.260> wrinkle<00:05:08.590> finish<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:09.160> so<00:05:09.310> I

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
coated in a wrinkle finish and so I

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.090 
coated in a wrinkle finish and so I
finally<00:05:09.700> just<00:05:09.850> stripped<00:05:10.270> off<00:05:10.420> my<00:05:10.660> horrid

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
finally just stripped off my horrid

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.560 
finally just stripped off my horrid
looking<00:05:12.100> coats<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.610> spray<00:05:12.730> paint<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.360> took<00:05:13.480> it

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
looking coats of spray paint and took it

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.510 
looking coats of spray paint and took it
to<00:05:13.600> a<00:05:13.720> powder<00:05:13.930> coater<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:14.470> they<00:05:14.980> did<00:05:15.160> the<00:05:15.250> Robo

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
to a powder coater and they did the Robo

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.280 
to a powder coater and they did the Robo
finish<00:05:15.850> on<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.120> dash<00:05:16.300> in<00:05:16.480> the<00:05:16.570> glove<00:05:16.750> box<00:05:16.960> and

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
finish on the dash in the glove box and

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.290 
finish on the dash in the glove box and
I<00:05:17.650> really<00:05:17.860> think<00:05:18.070> that's<00:05:18.220> adds<00:05:18.820> a<00:05:19.060> great<00:05:19.180> deal

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
I really think that's adds a great deal

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.410 
I really think that's adds a great deal
a<00:05:19.660> little<00:05:19.900> bit

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
a little bit

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.390 
a little bit
while<00:05:21.350> doing<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.650> interior<00:05:21.950> one<00:05:22.250> of<00:05:22.340> the

while doing the interior one of the

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.370 
while doing the interior one of the
things<00:05:22.580> I<00:05:22.730> wanted<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.210> look<00:05:23.660> nice<00:05:23.870> was<00:05:24.200> the

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
things I wanted to look nice was the

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.740 
things I wanted to look nice was the
speaker<00:05:25.100> grille<00:05:25.370> material<00:05:25.910> and<00:05:26.510> I<00:05:26.600> had<00:05:26.720> a

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
number of them I was working with and

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.280 
number of them I was working with and
the<00:05:28.250> harder<00:05:28.490> I<00:05:28.520> tried<00:05:28.850> to<00:05:29.120> clean<00:05:29.840> them<00:05:29.990> up<00:05:30.080> the

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
the harder I tried to clean them up the

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.990
