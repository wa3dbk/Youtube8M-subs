 15.6 inch class, and you will undoubtedly 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.260
 without difficulty in a special back or 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.030
 briefcase they match their a4 to it 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.379
 screen old she's still getting an idea 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.899
 the screen is about if I make 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.980
 keeps you see that side just 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.480
 further spout is just a little less 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.739
 high is an a4 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.449
 but gives a combination with that full 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.010
 hd is this looks so really nice for it 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.210
 space to work 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.670
 keep screen what is in it also one 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.080

 very nice full bright colors 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.170
 produces 9 but a little more trouble 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.360
 has the flexees then for example 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.619
 an anti-glare sharp at the top 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.119
 from the screen of him and hd-ready 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.110

 has no blu-ray player or interest 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.299
 so if you want to burn that or 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.189
 Then you will really play an external one 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.280

 both 3 points 0 and 1 on the left 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.180
