00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.960 

and<00:01:57.230> I<00:01:58.230> just<00:01:58.530> look<00:01:58.650> faster<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.250> land<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.670> you

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
and I just look faster you land it you

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.330 
and I just look faster you land it you
don't<00:02:00.150> want<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.360> flip<00:02:00.510> slow<00:02:01.160> that's<00:02:02.160> what

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
don't want to flip slow that's what

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.180 
don't want to flip slow that's what
happened<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.670> barely<00:02:02.940> my<00:02:03.150> lips<00:02:03.390> messed<00:02:03.660> up

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190
