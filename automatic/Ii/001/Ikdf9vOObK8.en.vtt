00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:08.670
 the talk is slow, it's all right, I'm there 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.759
 boxed was promised from the plate 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.889
 gigabyte sent it to us is gtx 760 for 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.529
 see you here voting the table to pick up the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.210
 details on the front of the carton 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.520
 No pleasure in not having much to talk about. 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.199
 not only for example comes with it that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.039
 Maybe we'll show you how 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.199
 it works 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.060
 it's here on the side too, nothing 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.910
 Too cool, I said. 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.009
 my reflecting the legal issue in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.440
 the back of the carton have all 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.210
 let's say the specifications for the right one 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950
 how does the scheme work? 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.290
 her hospitalization how well it is 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.489
 differentiated, we do not usually 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.320
 we could work with the plates 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.300
 divided gigabyte but you are 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.950
 asking enough we will start 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.989
 work with them 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:56.460
 Andrew also has a thing I had 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:01:00.120
 seen here in the box rose 2 gb had already 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.000
 pcs 3.0 256 bits hdmi has display 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.159
 port by the standards wine i will play 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.670
 on the screen the card's specifications and 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.439
 ufgd teacher on the screen but to all 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.159
 specifications people need to know 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.580
 board 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.820
 Let's finally see what box is little. 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820
 floor 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:30.640
 If it was here then fine with her with 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.290
 The kid's adapter is 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.829
 probably you will use that source 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.259
 You're going to have it, come the manual. 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.810
 those installation days with 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.939
 install platinum motherboard everything else 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.250
 the connections with connect well explanatory 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.340
 is multi language and quiet 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.649
 and here are the drawing of her drivers with 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.959
 her programs but not the 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.850
 driver that does not use the bottom of the 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.530
 always the last updated video and 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.420
 Schedule we will show you 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.000
 maybe some tests how it works 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.190
 relevant or not 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.360
 and here tabak work on the table for me 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:12.730
 So here it is. 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.560
 Look what a beautiful board k 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.880
 are three works are selling but 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.760
 honestly we never took the plate 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.500
 of gigabyte strengthens us for the 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.329
 first time already having contacted her 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.859
 We 'll get it and go to people who 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.870
 show more detail everyone has 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.850
 that even taking tests from her will do 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.950
 performance tests as well as 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.840
 temperature and everything to see us 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.060
 So how does this work? 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.160
 but you can see the issue of it that the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.829
 gauge well until the end of the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.750
 plate you until the end even with the 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.579
 novel of the kind that 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.350
 ate a piece of personal culture that yes 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.130
 nothing you have a share of it well 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.190
 giant even occupy the entire plate here at 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.440
 lpcs connection going on the motherboard 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:02.230
 connect and at the top of the screen that 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:07.230
 landed in force and here the connection of 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.230
 power one 8-pin and one 6-pin 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:17.170
 west lb very good that is very 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.780
 important on the back that you 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.400
 can see that it 's pretty standard even black is 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.859
 that here you held unless the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.389
 to see where it went. 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.980
 prolonged sign for it was prolonged 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.989
 that even to have a detail here 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.750
 probably must have been this part 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.390
 here not to be lazy 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.100
 With so much giant, here there is nothing. 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.970
 too much in this front part and here a 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.590
 part of it 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.750
 the connections but since then the sport and 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.090
 everything quiet academy 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.950
 so the staff without too many delays 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.110
 there is more to talk about the board even than 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.850
 very beautiful plate seemingly beautiful 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.650
 how you are even seeing us will 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.270
 start working with it is in 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.860
 soon going to be in the education system 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.670
 mount a pc with them you have 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.590
 interest 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.660
 currently it is not because it is 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.750
 there are few such as the launch of the 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.270
 x 768 few parts still compliant 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.120
 I commented tonight in another gtx 10 box and 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.440
 60 see few parts at the beginning of here 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.940
 little will be left in the market 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.410
 so we'll put there that we will not 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.100
 It's good to put this plate in 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.510
 two 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.010
 we will not want to see you soon 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.690
 We want everyone to have a 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.410
 bit and boot if you are available to 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.480
 all 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.750
 then what we will do if you 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.150
 find it interesting to compare 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.890
 trainings now compare the issue of 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.870
 temperatures and performance of the two 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.900
 the two have reference clock is 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.729
 no one has a normal notion copy of 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.220
 reference we will test the issue 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.140
 temperature and performance if you 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.220
 have an interest in knowing this 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.169
 so guys I hope you guys have 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.580
 leave your comment liked what it is or 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.290
 not this test components 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.010
 comparison we know to do to 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.650
 you 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.970
 like the one liquidity favorites not 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.590
 Forget to enroll in the channel that is very 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.590
 A big hug and even more. 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.590
 is
