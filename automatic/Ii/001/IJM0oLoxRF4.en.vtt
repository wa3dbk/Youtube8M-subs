eventually you're gonna run across

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.099 
eventually you're gonna run across
needing<00:00:15.289> firewire<00:00:16.289> or<00:00:16.490> 1394<00:00:17.490> support<00:00:17.910> which

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
needing firewire or 1394 support which

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.779 
needing firewire or 1394 support which
used<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.199> be<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> little<00:00:19.680> more<00:00:19.830> common<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.310> pcs

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
used to be a little more common in pcs

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.370 
used to be a little more common in pcs
but<00:00:21.119> lately<00:00:21.390> has<00:00:21.840> been<00:00:22.230> kind<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.189> disappearing

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
but lately has been kind of disappearing

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.300 
but lately has been kind of disappearing
there<00:00:25.380> used<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:25.590> some<00:00:25.800> other<00:00:25.949> boards<00:00:26.220> that

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
there used to be some other boards that

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.670 
there used to be some other boards that
had<00:00:26.430> support<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.990> seeing<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.439> less

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
had support for it you seeing that less

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.990 
had support for it you seeing that less
and<00:00:28.890> less<00:00:28.980> these<00:00:29.160> days<00:00:29.400> they're<00:00:29.640> changing

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
and less these days they're changing

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.290 
and less these days they're changing
those<00:00:30.179> ports<00:00:30.449> over<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.779> eSATA<00:00:31.640> but<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:33.210> know

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
those ports over to eSATA but you know

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.880 
those ports over to eSATA but you know
it's<00:00:33.450> an<00:00:33.540> Apple<00:00:33.870> standard<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
it's an Apple standard it's the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.650 
it's an Apple standard it's the
precursor<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.670> Thunderbolt<00:00:36.270> kind<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.620> I

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
precursor to Thunderbolt kind of so I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.380 
precursor to Thunderbolt kind of so I
have<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.950> sapphire<00:00:40.950> Pro<00:00:42.920> XLR<00:00:43.920> Bridge<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.460> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
have a sapphire Pro XLR Bridge and I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.439 
have a sapphire Pro XLR Bridge and I
need<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> 1394<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:48.289> this<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.500> what<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.710> got<00:00:50.449> it's

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
need the 1394 so this is what I got it's

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.439 
need the 1394 so this is what I got it's
just<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.960> basic<00:00:52.199> old<00:00:52.590> firewire<00:00:53.449> 1394

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
just a basic old firewire 1394

just a basic old firewire 1394
controller<00:00:54.870> card<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.829> works<00:00:56.190> both<00:00:56.520> half

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
controller card it works both half

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.209

connectivity<00:01:09.799> so<00:01:10.799> we're<00:01:10.979> gonna<00:01:11.100> go<00:01:11.280> ahead<00:01:11.369> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
connectivity so we're gonna go ahead and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
connectivity so we're gonna go ahead and
do<00:01:11.790> an<00:01:11.909> unboxing<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:13.530> I'm

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
do an unboxing of this and then I'm

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.109 
do an unboxing of this and then I'm
gonna<00:01:13.770> use<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.580> actually<00:01:14.820> use

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
gonna use it so that I can actually use

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.109 
gonna use it so that I can actually use
my<00:01:15.299> microphone<00:01:16.369> okay<00:01:17.369> guys<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> back

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
my microphone okay guys so on the back

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.399 
my microphone okay guys so on the back
of<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.299> box<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.460> few<00:01:21.020> things<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
of the box here we have a few things to

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.320 
of the box here we have a few things to
go<00:01:22.530> over<00:01:23.150> so<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.390> PCI<00:01:24.869> Express<00:01:26.330> compliant

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
go over so it is PCI Express compliant

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.830 
go over so it is PCI Express compliant

important the thing that I'm going to be
plugging<00:01:53.460> into<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.360> 8<00:01:54.780> interface<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.640> you

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
plugging into it is a 8 interface so you

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.649 
plugging into it is a 8 interface so you
do<00:01:56.820> want<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.030> make<00:01:57.149> sure<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.390> check<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
do want to make sure you check that

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.149 
do want to make sure you check that
before<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:59.360> go<00:02:00.360> ahead<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.659> buy<00:02:00.780> anything<00:02:01.159> on

some<00:02:38.560> complaints<00:02:39.010> about<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:40.480> have<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.780> have

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
some complaints about you have to have

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.180 
some complaints about you have to have
the<00:02:41.590> CD<00:02:41.860> drive<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.490> can<00:02:42.640> use<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.120> mini<00:02:44.190> discs

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
the CD drive that can use the mini discs

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.570 
the CD drive that can use the mini discs
or<00:02:46.290> just<00:02:47.290> go<00:02:47.470> get<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.890> damn<00:02:48.070> thing<00:02:48.310> off<00:02:48.430> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
or just go get the damn thing off the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.410 
or just go get the damn thing off the
internet<00:02:48.880> somewhere<00:02:50.610> if<00:02:51.610> you're<00:02:51.850> using<00:02:52.060> win

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
internet somewhere if you're using win

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.390 
internet somewhere if you're using win
eight<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:53.020> I<00:02:53.290> think<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.710> drivers<00:02:54.070> in<00:02:54.220> there

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
eight that I think the drivers in there

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.760 
eight that I think the drivers in there
so<00:02:54.670> I'll<00:02:55.330> verify<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:56.080> whenever<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.500> go<00:02:56.740> to

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
so I'll verify that whenever I go to

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.400 
so I'll verify that whenever I go to
install<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.670> do<00:02:57.850> a<00:02:57.880> review<00:02:58.300> of<00:02:58.360> my<00:02:58.480> my

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
install it and do a review of my my

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.650 
install it and do a review of my my
setup<00:02:59.680> but<00:03:00.130> until<00:03:00.940> then<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:02.200> assume<00:03:02.590> that

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
setup but until then just assume that

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.880 
setup but until then just assume that
you<00:03:04.660> might<00:03:04.810> have<00:03:04.990> to<00:03:05.140> deal<00:03:05.320> with<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.620> tiny

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
you might have to deal with that tiny

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.710 
you might have to deal with that tiny
little<00:03:07.620> driver<00:03:08.620> disk<00:03:09.240> so<00:03:10.240> here's<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> card

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
little driver disk so here's the card

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.510 
little driver disk so here's the card
itself<00:03:10.990> it<00:03:11.230> comes<00:03:11.350> pre-installed<00:03:11.740> with<00:03:12.370> the

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
itself it comes pre-installed with the

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.780 
itself it comes pre-installed with the
half-height<00:03:13.030> which<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.600> would<00:03:13.750> have<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.730> kind<00:03:15.730> of

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
half-height which I would have I kind of

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.040 
half-height which I would have I kind of
wish<00:03:15.970> they<00:03:16.150> would<00:03:16.300> have<00:03:16.360> pre-installed<00:03:16.900> it

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
wish they would have pre-installed it

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.470 
wish they would have pre-installed it
with<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.320> full-height<00:03:17.970> does<00:03:18.970> now<00:03:19.209> I'm<00:03:19.300> gonna

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
with the full-height does now I'm gonna

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.180 
with the full-height does now I'm gonna
take<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.989> apart<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.470> how<00:03:20.680> many<00:03:20.830> people

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
take it apart and how many people

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.470 
take it apart and how many people
actually<00:03:21.370> use<00:03:21.700> these<00:03:21.850> in<00:03:21.970> half<00:03:22.150> height<00:03:22.360> the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
actually use these in half height the

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.960 
actually use these in half height the
machines<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.959> guess<00:03:23.140> would<00:03:23.320> be<00:03:23.350> my<00:03:23.650> my<00:03:24.640> first

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
machines I guess would be my my first

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.300 
machines I guess would be my my first
question<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.860> there<00:03:27.100> is<00:03:27.220> an<00:03:27.430> onboard<00:03:28.170> port

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
question so there is an onboard port

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:37.050 
question so there is an onboard port
here<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:31.410> then<00:03:32.410> you<00:03:32.620> have<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:35.530> one<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.820> two

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
here and then you have the one a and two

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.890 
here and then you have the one a and two
B's<00:03:37.270> in<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.630> back<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.670> is<00:03:39.820> an<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.750> you

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
B's in the back so this is an a and you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.100 
B's in the back so this is an a and you
can<00:03:41.020> spin<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:41.739> off<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.160> another<00:03:42.250> or<00:03:43.110> an

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
can spin it off to another or an

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.510 
can spin it off to another or an
internal<00:03:44.470> port<00:03:44.830> if<00:03:44.920> you<00:03:45.010> have<00:03:45.100> an<00:03:45.220> internal

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
internal port if you have an internal

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.760 
internal port if you have an internal
device<00:03:45.910> that<00:03:46.120> uses<00:03:46.350> 19:34<00:03:47.350> that<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.620> need

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
device that uses 19:34 that you need

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.280 
device that uses 19:34 that you need
this<00:03:47.890> or<00:03:48.070> 1934<00:03:49.000> o<00:03:50.700> 1394<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:52.690> needs<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.050> will

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
this or 1934 o 1394 that needs this will

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.630 
this or 1934 o 1394 that needs this will
just<00:03:53.410> call<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.590> firewire<00:03:54.100> even<00:03:54.370> though<00:03:54.459> that's

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
just call it firewire even though that's

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.050 
just call it firewire even though that's
not<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.880> correct<00:03:55.030> term<00:03:55.300> and<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.540> PC<00:03:56.730> so<00:03:57.730> and

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
not the correct term and a PC so and

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.850 
not the correct term and a PC so and
then<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.270> have<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.600> full<00:03:59.020> plate<00:03:59.290> which<00:03:59.560> you

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
then you have the full plate which you

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.370 
then you have the full plate which you
know<00:03:59.950> two<00:04:00.010> screws<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.780> can<00:04:01.930> switch<00:04:02.200> that

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
know two screws and you can switch that

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.080 
know two screws and you can switch that
off<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.830> put<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.070> full<00:04:03.250> plate<00:04:03.489> on<00:04:03.670> there<00:04:03.910> and

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
off and put the full plate on there and

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.140 
off and put the full plate on there and
you<00:04:04.480> know<00:04:04.570> put<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:04.959> in<00:04:05.050> most<00:04:05.230> any<00:04:05.470> other<00:04:05.560> PC<00:04:06.250> so

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
you know put it in most any other PC so

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.229 
you know put it in most any other PC so
like<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.570> said<00:04:07.750> guys<00:04:07.870> really<00:04:08.350> really<00:04:08.890> short

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
like I said guys really really short

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.670 
like I said guys really really short
unboxing<00:04:10.239> I<00:04:10.630> do<00:04:10.690> like<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.019> fact<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.440> it's

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
unboxing I do like the fact that it's

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
unboxing I do like the fact that it's
you<00:04:12.610> know<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:12.880> is<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.030> black<00:04:13.420> PCB<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:15.400> might<00:04:15.580> be

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
you know it is a black PCB it might be

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.409 
you know it is a black PCB it might be
very<00:04:16.090> very<00:04:16.450> very<00:04:16.750> very<00:04:16.900> very<00:04:17.680> dark<00:04:18.459> brown<00:04:18.760> but
