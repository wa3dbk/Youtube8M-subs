first elliptical bicycle and what it

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.370 
first elliptical bicycle and what it
does<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.340> emulates<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.510> experience<00:00:25.260> of

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
cool concept but one that came out of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
motion and the fact that i could get a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.319 
motion and the fact that i could get a
workout<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.289> efficiently<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.670> i<00:00:47.700> hated<00:00:48.090> the

something<00:00:51.360> else<00:00:51.510> out<00:00:51.719> there<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.199> an<00:00:52.289> injured

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
something else out there for an injured

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.470 
something else out there for an injured
runner<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:53.070> himself<00:00:53.250> brian<00:00:53.940> started

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
runner like himself brian started

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.750 
runner like himself brian started
searching<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.289> thought<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.860> concept<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
searching I thought of this concept of a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.689 
searching I thought of this concept of a
low-impact<00:00:57.660> running<00:00:57.960> device<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.039> totally

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
low-impact running device and totally

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.670 
low-impact running device and totally
assumed<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.420> existed<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.350> didn't<00:01:01.590> strike

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
assumed that it existed it didn't strike

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.619 
assumed that it existed it didn't strike
me<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:01.980> all<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.309> particularly<00:01:02.910> innovative<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
me at all is particularly innovative and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.230 
me at all is particularly innovative and
it<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.589> did<00:01:04.949> not<00:01:04.979> exist<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.909> then<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.090> thought

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
it just did not exist so then I thought

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.270 
it just did not exist so then I thought
well<00:01:06.390> who<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> know<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.320> could<00:01:07.619> make<00:01:08.040> one

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
well who do I know that could make one

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.100 
well who do I know that could make one
of<00:01:08.369> these<00:01:08.460> things<00:01:08.670> happen<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:09.540> when<00:01:10.080> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
of these things happen and that's when I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.390 
of these things happen and that's when I
picked<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.500> phone<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.740> called<00:01:11.130> our

potential<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> idea<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.520> immediately

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
potential in the idea and immediately

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.210 
potential in the idea and immediately
got<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.479> work<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:19.200> design<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
got to work I design it all on the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.249 
got to work I design it all on the
computer<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.729> 3d<00:01:21.150> before<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> cut<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> piece<00:01:22.200> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
computer in 3d before I cut a piece of

metal<00:01:22.530> or<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.950> anything<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.090> got<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
metal or do anything and then I got a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.960 
metal or do anything and then I got a
torch<00:01:24.930> built<00:01:25.770> some<00:01:25.950> fixtures<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.670> put<00:01:26.820> my

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
torch built some fixtures and put my

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.550 
torch built some fixtures and put my
first<00:01:27.240> proof<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.689> concept<00:01:28.110> together<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.470> was

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
first proof of concept together it was

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.649 
first proof of concept together it was
really<00:01:28.890> pieced<00:01:29.490> together<00:01:29.670> out<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> parts<00:01:30.540> of

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
really pieced together out of parts of

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.510 
really pieced together out of parts of
other<00:01:30.869> bikes<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.619> had<00:01:31.829> really<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
other bikes that we had really on a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.310 
other bikes that we had really on a
shoestring<00:01:33.060> budget<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.869> gets<00:01:34.049> something

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
shoestring budget and it gets something

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.170 
shoestring budget and it gets something
together<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.890> quickly<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.310> possible<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.970> just

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
together as quickly as possible to just

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.990 
together as quickly as possible to just
see<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.840> idea<00:01:37.170> had<00:01:37.350> legs<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.009> speak<00:01:38.250> it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
see if this idea had legs so to speak it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.730 
see if this idea had legs so to speak it

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
creating a new thing and so I think

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.479 
creating a new thing and so I think

a<00:03:30.910> different<00:03:31.239> frame<00:03:32.230> mechanism<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.370> if<00:03:33.430> they

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
a different frame mechanism so if they

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.860 
a different frame mechanism so if they
run<00:03:33.640> into<00:03:33.700> problems<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.329> we<00:03:34.390> can't<00:03:34.600> support

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
run into problems and we can't support

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.530 
run into problems and we can't support
them<00:03:35.190> remotely<00:03:36.190> then<00:03:36.850> typically<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.390> bike

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
them remotely then typically the bike

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.089 
them remotely then typically the bike
shop<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.930> get<00:03:38.019> involved<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.470> help<00:03:38.530> them

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
shop and get involved and help them

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.880 
shop and get involved and help them
and<00:03:40.299> with<00:03:41.299> a<00:03:41.329> simple<00:03:41.719> adapter<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.530> can<00:03:42.560> even

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
and with a simple adapter you can even

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.130
