00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.549
 before we start with the right action 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.720
 we want to deal with a cure 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.500
 first clarify what is actually 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.000
 creatine month now creatine is one 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.650
 organic acid to the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.120
 Provision of energy at exclusive 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.660
 exertion of musculature 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.449
 creatin is needed in the muscle 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.010
 Creatine phosphate is then stored at 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.960
 intensive loads like 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.880
 For example, strength training for 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.170
 generating energy through the formation of 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.170
 atp to be mined 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.420
 creatine is made from the amino acid glycine 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.370
 evil and methionine synthesized the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.000
 The process takes place in the kidney liver and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.620
 pancreas takes place at the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.149
 athletes the intense stress 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.800
 being exposed is a creatine 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.840
 taking standard for many years 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.030
 besides protein, Kreatin is that 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.180
 We reject the most popular 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.399
 effect of creatin simply said 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.079
 Creatine increases physical performance 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.940
 with fast weight training in the frame 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.100
 short-term intense physical 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.220
 burden on an intake of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.710
 at least three grams per day 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.880
 But what does that mean for the athlete? 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.490
 Now that means you're in training 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.610
 can hang more weight and and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.350
 more repetitions creates more weight 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.880
 means a stronger growth stimulus 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.680
 for the muscles and thus better 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.630
 discuss progress in this video 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.340
 we are the creative chur on the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.170
 discussion whether a cure or taking 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.630
 is is a permanent ingestion meaningful 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.950
 not received here at the cure 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.079
 You can take the intake with it 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.770
 charging phase and without charging phase 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.509
 distinguish 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.360
 we will see later that one 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.759
 Creatine icon. Charge phase of the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.100
 dosage of the duration of intake equals 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.869
 However, the cure is just defined 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.640
 as the revenue over a certain 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.790
 period and subsequent break 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.140
 that's why a course creator is also involved 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.430
 Should be rejected in any case 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.329
 can be dosed correctly otherwise can 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.200
 it causes unwanted side effects 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.030
 come or else the effect will remain 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.829
 who is in charge of the creatine health 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.500
 phase decides that takes over one 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.720
 Period of five days per day about 20 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.640
 gramme creatine and loads with it 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.960
 proverbially the creatine phosphate 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.720
 Memory in the musculature 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.190
 on very heavy athlete we are talking here 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.360
 really can from serious athletes 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.430
 the dose to 30 grams increase that one 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.590
 name scheme of the cure with the charging phase 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.620
 So then it looks like this take 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:33.450
 from day one to day 520 grams per day 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:37.080
 and divide this 20 grams to 4 x 5 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.660
 gram on the ideal case combined that 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.250
 with a simple carbohydrate sources 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.010
 or a carbohydrate sources with high 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.690
 Glycemic index according to studies is included 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.940
 a combined intake of the char 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.620
 Effect also reinforces so-called non 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.180
 responder that in person so on 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.280
 a creatine taking bad or even 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.860
 did not react in a study 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.570
 this greatly benefits a simple one 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.220
 carbohydrate source is mostly the 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.310
 classic fruit juice over and over again 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.930
 Of course it is important to recommend that 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.120
 you do not get a diet of fruit juice there 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.940
 but a fruit juice with sugar 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.470
 we want this sugar in the 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.090
 principle, you can also sugar in the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.620
 Creatine must be pure so it's easy 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.920
 just to make this awesome me 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.540
 personally in the age extreme for that 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.590
 After the five days, there will be three to five 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.420
 taken per day 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.910
 take the creatine six to eight weeks 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.920
 and then take a break 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.360
 the three to five grams are also back 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.760
 depending on the weight of the athlete so 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.440
 an athlete with 60 kilo 70 kilo will be with 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.010
 Three grams of easy- going athlete 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.620
 with 100 110 kilo 120 kilo should already 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.060
 The dose can also take five grams 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.060
 safe to increase something else 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.480
 we come to the capture without a charge 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.030
 phase who on the charging phase 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.970
 the will be the effect of 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.230
 Driving creatin a little later is quite easy 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.640
 because that's a certain time 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.560
 lasts until the increase of 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.310
 creatine before the creatine phosphate 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.570
 memory in the musculature so to speak 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.420
 charged are overloaded 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.510
 according to studies, we have a creatine here 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.520
 phosphate increase compared to 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.560
 a non-revenue of up to 40 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.250
 percent of individual studies even 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.630
 higher at a circulation phase 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.100
 of course then, of course, therefore 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.310
 faster because he's just more creative 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.960
 has previously fed without a charge phase 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.229
 takes a little longer 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.620
 usually about one to two weeks 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.530
 then noticed that but clearly the 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.150
 total prescription during such a cure 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.560
 but it does not affect most people 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.530
 then contribute to a duration so 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.440
 a take without this edition phase 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.750
 a slightly longer cow then have exactly 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.610
 the same effect some athletes 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.710
 do that too because they mean 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.830
 if you have a high creatine dose each 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.470
 day accept about creatinine degradation 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.460
 to overload the kidneys too much 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.220
 Of course, it is very important 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.630
 always at the kreatin chur that here 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.910
 takes a lot of liquid 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.090
 I do not mean beer but I mean 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.710
 just drink a lot in the ideal case 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.930
 of course, water or isotonic 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.840
 drinks then in training but easy 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.639
 a lot to drink yes I read from 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.900
 should be given from five to six liters 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.330
 I now for clearly exaggerated though 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.330
 it should be three liters per day 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.830
 at the choir intake without a charge phase 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.690
 you are again dependent on the creatine 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.539
 from body weight again these three to 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.620
 five grams as already explained 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.380
 divide this dose back to two 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.930
 Revenues on again with a simple one 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.340
 carbohydrate sources and then 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.469
 Incidentally, trainingdays is also valid for 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.289
 the cool names with the charging phase is 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.520
 taking a dose right after the 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.680
 training always ideal 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.210
 most of you will be after that 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.039
 training to take a protein 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.560
 many also combine with one 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.659
 times dead extreme or with a simple one 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.400
 carbohydrate cases 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.810
 Here it is especially ideal if you that 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.000
 so if you like this combination 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.469
 makes it after training could 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.479
 So that the Shake meddle with capsules 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:05.449
 winter 7 additionally hinders the 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:09.800
 intake of other active ingredients not 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:12.000
 but then it will be better absorbed 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.740
 is not dependent Kreatin now but 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.750
 which refers to any drug the 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.099
 yes, almost after training takes 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.479
 Taking the choir without charging 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.650
 phase makes the athlete then too 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.599
 again usually six to eight 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.520
 weeks break but this period is 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:28.380
 not carved in stone I know 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.159
 athletes make short courses of 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.900
 six weeks 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:33.900
 I know athletes who do it too 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.029
 12 o'clock that's not it now 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.820
 to really give some insights 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.380
 Choir length is the most ideal 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.420
 especially against the background 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.870
 Meanwhile, the duration of intake pretty much 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.430
 had increased sharply as you can see is 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.780
 the coal name without charging up 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.350
 the break actually identical to the 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.320
 continue 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.560
 when no break takes place around the 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.520
 chamber and in a later video 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.200
 Thanks a lot for listening and until the 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.970
 next time we are looking forward to a live 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.250
 Of course you can also like us 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.910
 I would be happy to visit on facebook 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.910
 bye for now
