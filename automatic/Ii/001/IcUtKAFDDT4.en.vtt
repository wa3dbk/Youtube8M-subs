00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.170 
to this concept is that it's the human
tendency<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.590> follow<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.040> pattern<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.850> this

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
tendency to follow the pattern in this

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.390 
tendency to follow the pattern in this
case<00:02:30.480> where<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.050> person<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.500> viewing<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
case where the person is viewing is the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.809 
case where the person is viewing is the
pattern<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.720> then<00:02:34.260> he<00:02:34.440> do<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.680> our<00:02:35.340> entire

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
pattern so then he do that our entire

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.449 
pattern so then he do that our entire
perspective<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:37.020> focus<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.709> not<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.190> go<00:02:38.310> on

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
perspective and focus is not just go on

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.190 
perspective and focus is not just go on
the<00:02:38.489> person<00:02:39.090> when<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.480> runs<00:02:39.780> through<00:02:39.959> the
