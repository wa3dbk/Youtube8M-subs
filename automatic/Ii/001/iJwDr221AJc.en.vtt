00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
from from bending this construct this

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.539 
from from bending this construct this
control<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.229> perfect<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.439> haven't<00:01:53.130> even<00:01:53.250> used

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
control is perfect I haven't even used

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.560 
control is perfect I haven't even used
it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.029 

so<00:01:59.570> yeah<00:02:00.380> that<00:02:00.590> looks<00:02:00.799> good<00:02:01.810> but<00:02:02.810> it<00:02:03.500> won't

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
so yeah that looks good but it won't

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.320 
so yeah that looks good but it won't
look<00:02:04.250> too<00:02:04.460> good<00:02:04.640> after<00:02:05.200> using<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:07.179> for<00:02:08.179> like

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
look too good after using it for like

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.719 
look too good after using it for like
five<00:02:08.539> days<00:02:08.950> but<00:02:09.950> if<00:02:10.129> you<00:02:10.310> want<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.519> do<00:02:10.640> your

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
five days but if you want to do your

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.479 
five days but if you want to do your
console<00:02:11.330> that's<00:02:12.050> perfectly<00:02:12.530> fine<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.220> short

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
console that's perfectly fine the short

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.229 
console that's perfectly fine the short
of<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.120> paint<00:02:14.959> markers<00:02:16.030> here<00:02:17.030> are<00:02:17.120> the

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
of the paint markers here are the

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.400 
of the paint markers here are the
markers<00:02:17.660> right<00:02:17.930> here<00:02:19.120> Sharpie<00:02:20.120> paint<00:02:20.599> and

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
markers right here Sharpie paint and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.339 
markers right here Sharpie paint and
it's<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:22.120> fine<00:02:23.120> point<00:02:23.569> oil-based<00:02:24.760> marker<00:02:26.349> at

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
it's a fine point oil-based marker at

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.370 
it's a fine point oil-based marker at
first<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.830> kind<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:31.000> kind<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.090> figured<00:02:33.049> that

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
first I kind of I kind of figured that

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.630 
first I kind of I kind of figured that
if<00:02:33.769> it<00:02:33.950> was<00:02:34.130> oil<00:02:34.489> base<00:02:34.849> then<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.950> shouldn't<00:02:37.310> rub

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
if it was oil base then it shouldn't rub

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.100 
if it was oil base then it shouldn't rub
off<00:02:37.849> you<00:02:38.840> know<00:02:38.989> from<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:40.280> sweat<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.989> know

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
off you know from the sweat you know

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.699 
off you know from the sweat you know
water<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.310> oil<00:02:43.430> don't<00:02:43.700> mix<00:02:43.849> so<00:02:44.500> that's<00:02:45.500> what<00:02:45.680> I

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
water and oil don't mix so that's what I

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.140 
water and oil don't mix so that's what I
figured<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:47.000> mean<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:48.230> controller<00:02:48.680> is

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
figured and I mean the controller is

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.250 
figured and I mean the controller is
holding<00:02:50.150> up<00:02:50.560> but<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.980> just<00:02:52.760> rubbing<00:02:53.660> you

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
holding up but it's just rubbing you

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.580 
holding up but it's just rubbing you
know<00:02:54.379> where<00:02:54.620> you're<00:02:54.950> really<00:02:55.640> tearing<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.269> up

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
know where you're really tearing it up

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.360 
know where you're really tearing it up
so<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:58.569> don't<00:02:59.569> know<00:02:59.660> how<00:02:59.989> these<00:03:00.500> guys<00:03:00.709> paint<00:03:01.190> it

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
so I don't know how these guys paint it

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.479 
so I don't know how these guys paint it
and<00:03:01.670> maybe<00:03:02.209> they<00:03:02.420> put<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.720> coat<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.709> something

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
and maybe they put a coat of something

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.930 
and maybe they put a coat of something
else<00:03:04.609> on<00:03:04.880> it<00:03:04.910> too<00:03:05.389> to<00:03:06.319> harden<00:03:06.769> it<00:03:06.859> up<00:03:07.069> I<00:03:07.310> don't

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
else on it too to harden it up I don't

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:15.940 
else on it too to harden it up I don't
know<00:03:08.470> but<00:03:11.139> so<00:03:12.139> yeah<00:03:14.319> and<00:03:15.319> this<00:03:15.530> I'm<00:03:15.739> probably

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
know but so yeah and this I'm probably

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.629 
know but so yeah and this I'm probably
never<00:03:16.220> going<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.519> use<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:18.790> that's<00:03:19.790> fine

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
never going to use so that's fine
