of this promise so every time you see
the<00:00:54.719> rainbow<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.260> means<00:00:55.500> God's<00:00:55.980> still

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
seven colors to the rainbow and as you

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.310 
seven colors to the rainbow and as you
know<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> number<00:01:06.390> seven<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.020> very

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
know the number seven is very

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.429 
know the number seven is very
significant<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> Bible<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.869> also<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
significant in the Bible and also the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.910 
significant in the Bible and also the
number<00:01:11.210> twelve<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.630> very<00:01:13.110> significant<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
number twelve is very significant the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920 
number twelve is very significant the
two<00:01:14.130> most<00:01:14.430> significant<00:01:15.150> numbers<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.600> think<00:01:15.840> in

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
two most significant numbers I think in

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.160 
two most significant numbers I think in
the<00:01:16.020> Bible<00:01:16.380> are<00:01:16.939> seven<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.150> possibly<00:01:18.810> twelve

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the Bible are seven and possibly twelve

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320 
the Bible are seven and possibly twelve
maybe<00:01:19.500> three<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:20.070> know<00:01:20.340> three<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> big

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
maybe three I don't know three is a big

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.109 
maybe three I don't know three is a big
one<00:01:21.450> too<00:01:21.740> okay<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.220> another<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.880> eight

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
one too okay and another one is eight

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.789 
one too okay and another one is eight
because<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> eighth<00:01:25.049> day<00:01:25.080> they<00:01:25.590> would<00:01:25.770> be

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
because on the eighth day they would be

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.069 
because on the eighth day they would be
circumcise<00:01:26.670> their<00:01:27.119> children<00:01:28.220> okay<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:31.890> uh

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
circumcise their children okay so now uh

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.630 
circumcise their children okay so now uh
when<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.110> talked<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.619> sorry<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.250> little<00:01:35.430> bit

when I talked to you sorry a little bit
later<00:01:35.850> here<00:01:36.119> um<00:01:36.479> about<00:01:37.670> music<00:01:39.079> there<00:01:40.079> are

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
later here um about music there are

later here um about music there are
twelve<00:01:40.740> notes<00:01:41.720> in<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:43.409> chromatic<00:01:44.280> scale

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
twelve notes in a chromatic scale

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.429 
twelve notes in a chromatic scale
chromatic<00:01:45.149> scale<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.630> basically<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
chromatic scale is basically on a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.910 
chromatic scale is basically on a
keyboard<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.700> most<00:01:48.060> granular<00:01:50.119> level<00:01:51.119> of

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
keyboard the most granular level of

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.410 
keyboard the most granular level of
scale<00:01:52.920> okay<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> scale<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.090> like

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
scale okay and a scale would be like

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.310 
scale okay and a scale would be like
okay<00:01:54.840> get<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.140> dad<00:01:55.979> at<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.490> at<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.729> time

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
okay get that dad at that at that time

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.569 
okay get that dad at that at that time
like<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.740> don't<00:01:59.250> know<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.399> you've<00:01:59.549> seen

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
like that I don't know if you've seen

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.249 
like that I don't know if you've seen
that<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.939> there's<00:02:02.939> 12<00:02:03.329> notes<00:02:03.659> there's

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
that and so there's 12 notes there's

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.249 
that and so there's 12 notes there's
actually<00:02:04.619> 11<00:02:04.890> notes<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.610> scale<00:02:05.820> okay<00:02:06.540> but

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
actually 11 notes in that scale okay but

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.119 
actually 11 notes in that scale okay but
we<00:02:07.409> called<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.799> 12<00:02:08.129> tone<00:02:09.060> scale<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:11.069> don't

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
we called a 12 tone scale and I don't

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.790 
we called a 12 tone scale and I don't
know<00:02:11.370> why<00:02:11.580> but<00:02:11.879> we<00:02:12.030> do<00:02:12.680> because

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
know why but we do because

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.210 
know why but we do because
that<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.580> lowest<00:02:14.880> note<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.900> scale

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
that the the lowest note on the scale

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.920 
that the the lowest note on the scale
matches<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.430> highest<00:02:17.820> note<00:02:18.030> on<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.300> scale<00:02:18.510> if

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
matches the highest note on the scale if

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.410 
matches the highest note on the scale if
the<00:02:19.290> lowest<00:02:19.620> note<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.130> chromatic<00:02:20.730> scale

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
the lowest note on this chromatic scale

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.320 
the lowest note on this chromatic scale
12<00:02:21.930> note<00:02:22.110> chromatic<00:02:22.560> scale<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> seat<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
12 note chromatic scale is a seat the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.660 
12 note chromatic scale is a seat the
highest<00:02:24.660> note<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.990> see<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.830> don't<00:02:26.430> know<00:02:26.520> why

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
highest note to see so I don't know why

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.720 
highest note to see so I don't know why
they<00:02:26.850> do<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.530> but<00:02:28.530> okay<00:02:28.980> now<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.280> major

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
they do that but okay now the major

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.760 
they do that but okay now the major
scale<00:02:30.240> so<00:02:30.390> that's<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.780> number<00:02:31.020> 12<00:02:31.320> is

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
scale so that's the number 12 is

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.160 
scale so that's the number 12 is
significant<00:02:32.550> there<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.690> another<00:02:33.960> thing

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
significant there and another thing

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.750 
significant there and another thing
interesting<00:02:34.710> about<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:34.950> notice<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.460> said

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
interesting about that notice I said

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.760 
interesting about that notice I said

being<00:02:53.520> 12<00:02:53.780> just<00:02:54.780> scratch<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:56.210> that's

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
being 12 just scratch that that's

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.590 
being 12 just scratch that that's
another<00:02:57.420> whole<00:02:57.630> study<00:02:57.960> so<00:02:58.890> anyway<00:02:59.600> then

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
another whole study so anyway then

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.460 
another whole study so anyway then
there's<00:03:01.700> seven<00:03:02.700> notes<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.240> a<00:03:03.480> major<00:03:03.720> scale<00:03:04.170> and

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
there's seven notes in a major scale and

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.430 
there's seven notes in a major scale and
that's<00:03:04.950> done<00:03:05.280> not<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.390> piano<00:03:06.690> right<00:03:06.990> here<00:03:07.170> so

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
that's done not on a piano right here so

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.280 
that's done not on a piano right here so
but<00:03:08.100> it's<00:03:08.370> these<00:03:08.670> white<00:03:09.030> keys<00:03:09.390> going<00:03:09.960> from<00:03:10.170> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
but it's these white keys going from the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.670 
but it's these white keys going from the
C<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.800> C<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.460> a<00:03:12.180> C<00:03:12.480> major<00:03:12.780> scale<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.560> that's

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
C to the C is a C major scale and that's

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.700 
C to the C is a C major scale and that's
8<00:03:13.980> notes<00:03:14.340> they're<00:03:14.670> from<00:03:15.090> C<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.360> C<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.930> seven

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
8 notes they're from C to C and seven

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.610 
8 notes they're from C to C and seven
notes<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:18.630> it's<00:03:18.810> called<00:03:19.020> a<00:03:19.110> seven<00:03:19.320> note<00:03:19.560> scale

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
notes so it's called a seven note scale

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.320 
notes so it's called a seven note scale
because<00:03:20.370> there<00:03:20.489> are<00:03:20.550> seven<00:03:20.850> different<00:03:20.970> notes

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
because there are seven different notes

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.870 
because there are seven different notes
in<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.510> scale<00:03:21.800> minor<00:03:22.800> scales<00:03:23.280> same<00:03:23.550> thing

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
in that scale minor scales same thing

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.510 
in that scale minor scales same thing
but<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.480> starts<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:26.100> know<00:03:26.220> it's<00:03:26.370> got<00:03:26.489> a

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
but it starts you know it's got a

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.610 
but it starts you know it's got a
different<00:03:26.730> sequence<00:03:27.209> like<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.720> minor<00:03:28.050> is<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
different sequence like a minor is the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.100 
different sequence like a minor is the
relative<00:03:29.220> minor<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.730> C<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.720> that's<00:03:30.930> this

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
relative minor to C but that's this

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.470 
relative minor to C but that's this
music<00:03:31.500> lesson<00:03:31.890> this<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.040> not<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> musical<00:03:32.850> music

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
music lesson this is not a musical music

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.030 
music lesson this is not a musical music
lesson<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.800> it's<00:03:35.250> just<00:03:35.430> interesting<00:03:35.790> how<00:03:37.040> the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
lesson so it's just interesting how the

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.720 
lesson so it's just interesting how the
rainbow<00:03:38.610> has<00:03:39.209> got<00:03:39.420> all<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.840> colors<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.730> music

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
rainbow has got all the colors and music

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.810 
rainbow has got all the colors and music
seems<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.630> lay<00:03:43.080> out<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:44.180> a<00:03:45.260> similar<00:03:46.260> pattern

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
seems to lay out in a similar pattern

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.050 
seems to lay out in a similar pattern
but<00:03:48.290> excuse<00:03:49.290> me<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.739> know<00:03:49.830> at<00:03:50.640> least<00:03:50.820> the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
but excuse me you know at least the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.210 
but excuse me you know at least the
Western<00:03:51.510> musical<00:03:52.020> scales<00:03:52.380> fit<00:03:52.800> into<00:03:52.980> that

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
Western musical scales fit into that

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.090 
Western musical scales fit into that
pattern<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.940> know<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.360> this<00:03:55.050> twelve<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.739> in

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
pattern you know of this twelve and in

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.990 
pattern you know of this twelve and in
seven<00:03:56.790> note<00:03:57.030> pattern<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:59.640> it's<00:03:59.850> really

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
seven note pattern and so it's really

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.400 
seven note pattern and so it's really
cool<00:04:00.270> and<00:04:02.150> you<00:04:03.150> know<00:04:03.180> there's<00:04:03.480> music<00:04:03.840> in<00:04:04.200> the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
cool and you know there's music in the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.080 
cool and you know there's music in the
Bible<00:04:04.800> too<00:04:05.010> you<00:04:05.310> know<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:05.700> music<00:04:06.270> is<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:08.090> the

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
Bible too you know so music is is the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.850 
Bible too you know so music is is the
creation<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:09.630> God<00:04:09.870> it's<00:04:10.170> something<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.709> God

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
creation of God it's something that God

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.810 
creation of God it's something that God
created<00:04:11.400> us<00:04:11.489> for<00:04:11.700> us<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:12.090> enjoy<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:13.820> sing

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
songs to each other and so that's really

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.490 
songs to each other and so that's really
cool<00:04:18.330> and<00:04:18.600> I've<00:04:18.780> been<00:04:18.900> thinking<00:04:19.080> a<00:04:19.290> little<00:04:19.380> bit

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
cool and I've been thinking a little bit

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.150 
cool and I've been thinking a little bit
about<00:04:19.620> more<00:04:19.980> seriously<00:04:20.580> about<00:04:21.320> music<00:04:22.320> you

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
about more seriously about music you

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.440 
about more seriously about music you
know<00:04:23.910> that<00:04:24.240> if<00:04:24.479> I<00:04:24.870> begin<00:04:25.229> in<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.500> gift<00:04:25.800> from<00:04:26.190> God

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
know that if I begin in a gift from God

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.500 
know that if I begin in a gift from God
compose<00:04:27.900> music<00:04:28.230> or<00:04:28.770> play<00:04:29.550> an<00:04:29.790> instrument<00:04:29.940> or

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
compose music or play an instrument or

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.780 
compose music or play an instrument or
something<00:04:30.900> like<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.530> maybe<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.550> should

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
something like that that maybe I should

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.610 
something like that that maybe I should
do<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.000> for<00:04:33.210> his<00:04:33.330> glorious<00:04:33.810> time<00:04:34.140> just<00:04:34.320> playing

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
do it for his glorious time just playing

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.720 
do it for his glorious time just playing
around<00:04:35.390> I<00:04:36.560> kind<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:37.620> avoided<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:38.370> for<00:04:38.670> a

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
around I kind of avoided that for a

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.040 
around I kind of avoided that for a
while<00:04:38.880> but<00:04:39.180> I'm<00:04:39.270> certain<00:04:39.540> taking<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:39.930> little

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
while but I'm certain taking a little

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.100 
while but I'm certain taking a little
bit<00:04:40.200> more<00:04:40.350> seriously<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:42.540> music<00:04:42.900> that's

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
bit more seriously and the music that's

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.380 
bit more seriously and the music that's
in<00:04:43.350> my<00:04:43.500> head<00:04:43.740> is<00:04:43.950> it<00:04:44.190> seems<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.670> have<00:04:44.760> gone<00:04:45.030> up

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
in my head is it seems to have gone up

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.440 
in my head is it seems to have gone up
to<00:04:45.840> another<00:04:46.290> level<00:04:46.680> that<00:04:47.130> seems<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.300> be<00:04:48.330> a

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
to another level that seems to be a

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.060 
to another level that seems to be a
level<00:04:48.840> where<00:04:49.080> it's<00:04:49.260> like<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.620> can't<00:04:49.860> just

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
level where it's like I can't just

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.130 
level where it's like I can't just
ignore<00:04:50.220> it<00:04:50.490> it's<00:04:51.240> like<00:04:51.360> I'd<00:04:51.540> like<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:51.750> get<00:04:52.050> it

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
ignore it it's like I'd like to get it

on<00:04:52.260> paper<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:52.740> like<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.630> compose<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:55.110> music

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
on paper and like to compose the music

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.290 
on paper and like to compose the music
that's<00:04:55.710> in<00:04:55.920> my<00:04:56.070> head<00:04:56.310> it's<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.670> little<00:04:56.940> bit<00:04:57.090> more

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
um a little bit more on a higher level

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
it's like I'm starting to be able to

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.860 
it's like I'm starting to be able to
imagine<00:05:04.440> music<00:05:05.070> um<00:05:05.610> that's<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.450> little<00:05:06.570> better
