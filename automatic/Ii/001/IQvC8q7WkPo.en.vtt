00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
battlefield 3 is a really good game and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.219 
battlefield 3 is a really good game and
it's<00:02:00.420> probably<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.079> best

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it's probably one of the best

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.539 
it's probably one of the best
multiplayer<00:02:01.530> shooters<00:02:01.979> out<00:02:02.159> there<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:02.520> now

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
multiplayer shooters out there right now

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.209 
multiplayer shooters out there right now
but<00:02:03.450> still<00:02:03.689> has<00:02:03.899> some<00:02:04.049> glitches<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.740> bugs<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
but still has some glitches and bugs and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.719 
but still has some glitches and bugs and
major<00:02:05.790> imbalances<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.770> when<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.799> read<00:02:08.099> more

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
major imbalances and when I read more

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.309 
major imbalances and when I read more
classes<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.360> was<00:02:09.539> really<00:02:09.869> excited<00:02:10.080> about

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
classes I was really excited about

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.350 
classes I was really excited about
before<00:02:10.739> because<00:02:11.039> what<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.790> think<00:02:12.150> they're

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
before because what I think they're

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.480 
before because what I think they're
going<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.020> Utley

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
going to do is Utley

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.250 
going to do is Utley
put<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:13.880> five<00:02:14.210> classes<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.840> mean<00:02:14.990> right<00:02:15.110> now<00:02:15.170> we

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
put in five classes I mean right now we

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.440 
put in five classes I mean right now we
only<00:02:15.440> got<00:02:16.160> four<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.760> they<00:02:16.880> say<00:02:17.060> they're<00:02:17.270> going

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
only got four and they say they're going

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.540 
only got four and they say they're going
to<00:02:17.570> be<00:02:17.900> more<00:02:18.320> classes<00:02:18.860> which<00:02:19.070> means<00:02:19.310> there

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
to be more classes which means there

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.600 
to be more classes which means there
will<00:02:19.730> be<00:02:19.940> at<00:02:20.060> least<00:02:20.090> five<00:02:20.740> so<00:02:21.740> i<00:02:21.770> think<00:02:21.920> we'll

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
will be at least five so i think we'll

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.610 
will be at least five so i think we'll
definitely<00:02:22.880> split<00:02:23.480> up<00:02:23.660> again<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.230> medic<00:02:24.530> and

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
definitely split up again the medic and

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.860 
definitely split up again the medic and
assault<00:02:25.040> which<00:02:25.250> will<00:02:25.730> make<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.150> game<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:26.750> much

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
assault which will make the game so much

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.200 
assault which will make the game so much
more<00:02:27.050> balanced<00:02:27.500> it's<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.100> good<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.940> I'm<00:02:29.030> so

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
more balanced it's so good and I'm so

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.900 
more balanced it's so good and I'm so
happy<00:02:29.360> but<00:02:30.290> yeah<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.620> more<00:02:31.070> maps<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.610> course

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
happy but yeah and more maps of course

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.330 
happy but yeah and more maps of course
cool<00:02:32.150> as<00:02:32.330> well<00:02:32.540> as<00:02:32.660> more<00:02:32.840> vehicles<00:02:33.340> more

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
cool as well as more vehicles more

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.910 
cool as well as more vehicles more
veterans<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:34.940> mean<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.540> who<00:02:36.200> else<00:02:36.350> would

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
veterans to I mean and who else would

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.040 
veterans to I mean and who else would
not<00:02:37.070> like<00:02:37.310> weapons<00:02:37.520> I<00:02:37.760> mean<00:02:37.910> we<00:02:38.210> since<00:02:38.540> deke<00:02:38.810> I

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
not like weapons I mean we since deke I

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.540 
not like weapons I mean we since deke I
think<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.650> closed<00:02:39.830> course<00:02:40.100> you'll<00:02:40.280> see<00:02:40.430> was

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
think the closed course you'll see was

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.840 
think the closed course you'll see was
less<00:02:41.170> actual<00:02:42.170> DLC<00:02:42.590> where<00:02:42.770> we<00:02:42.920> are<00:02:43.070> where<00:02:43.700> we

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
less actual DLC where we are where we

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.180 
less actual DLC where we are where we
were<00:02:44.480> getting<00:02:44.810> some<00:02:45.050> real<00:02:45.290> weapons<00:02:45.710> which<00:02:46.010> we

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
were getting some real weapons which we

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.340 
were getting some real weapons which we
could<00:02:46.340> unlock<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.910> mean<00:02:47.570> of<00:02:47.840> course<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.200> got<00:02:48.320> a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
could unlock I mean of course you got a

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.890 
could unlock I mean of course you got a
crossbow<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.640> eda<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.330> like<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.870> know

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
crossbow and the eda and like you know

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.630 
crossbow and the eda and like you know
elastic<00:02:51.410> but<00:02:51.560> that's<00:02:51.800> not<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.100> real<00:02:52.250> deal<00:02:52.460> if

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
elastic but that's not the real deal if

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.360 
elastic but that's not the real deal if
you<00:02:52.760> know<00:02:52.850> what<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.030> mean<00:02:53.920> besides<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.220> there

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
you know what I mean besides that there

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.460 
you know what I mean besides that there
will<00:02:55.490> also<00:02:55.670> be<00:02:55.850> some<00:02:56.270> sort<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.600> like<00:02:56.840> battle

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
will also be some sort of like battle

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.110 
will also be some sort of like battle
packs<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:58.070> I<00:02:58.100> haven't<00:02:58.340> like<00:02:58.490> really<00:02:58.520> figured

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
packs and I haven't like really figured

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.270 
packs and I haven't like really figured
out<00:02:59.210> but<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.660> think<00:03:00.320> it's<00:03:00.440> if<00:03:00.680> you're<00:03:00.950> putting

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
out but I think it's if you're putting

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.550 
out but I think it's if you're putting
like<00:03:01.520> enough<00:03:02.330> time<00:03:02.630> into<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.990> game<00:03:03.170> or<00:03:03.350> you

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
like enough time into the game or you

get<00:03:03.710> it<00:03:03.800> like<00:03:04.070> enough<00:03:04.790> score<00:03:05.300> points<00:03:05.660> for

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
get it like enough score points for

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.500 
get it like enough score points for
something<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:06.980> get<00:03:07.160> like<00:03:07.310> extra<00:03:07.940> knives<00:03:08.180> and

actually<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:51.370> like<00:03:52.370> I<00:03:52.400> said<00:03:52.580> naval<00:03:53.030> warfare<00:03:53.240> is

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
actually so like I said naval warfare is

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.840 
actually so like I said naval warfare is
pretty<00:03:53.840> much<00:03:53.960> confirmed<00:03:54.470> on<00:03:55.460> the<00:03:55.610> other<00:03:55.730> hand

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
pretty much confirmed on the other hand

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.910 
pretty much confirmed on the other hand
what's<00:03:56.270> confirmed<00:03:56.870> pretty<00:03:57.230> much<00:03:57.410> as<00:03:57.560> well<00:03:57.770> as

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
what's confirmed pretty much as well as

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.070 
what's confirmed pretty much as well as
that<00:03:58.130> if<00:03:58.580> you<00:03:59.030> want<00:03:59.240> to<00:03:59.360> get<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.630> food<00:03:59.810> belt

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
that if you want to get the food belt

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.720 
that if you want to get the food belt
for<00:04:00.470> experience<00:04:01.100> you're<00:04:01.280> probably<00:04:01.520> gonna

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
for experience you're probably gonna

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.360 
for experience you're probably gonna
have<00:04:01.850> to<00:04:02.000> pay<00:04:02.510> extra<00:04:02.720> for<00:04:02.990> DLC<00:04:03.680> because<00:04:04.160> it

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
have to pay extra for DLC because it

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.040 
have to pay extra for DLC because it
doesn't<00:04:04.790> look<00:04:04.910> like<00:04:04.970> that<00:04:05.450> there<00:04:05.810> will<00:04:06.020> be

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
doesn't look like that there will be

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.580 
doesn't look like that there will be
like<00:04:06.380> and<00:04:06.950> nail<00:04:07.880> war<00:04:08.240> for<00:04:08.510> like<00:04:08.690> like<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:09.260> is<00:04:09.350> or

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
like and nail war for like like it is or

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.280 
like and nail war for like like it is or
as<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.160> integrated<00:04:10.820> in<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.030> game<00:04:11.209> but<00:04:12.020> you

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
as it is integrated in the game but you

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.690 
as it is integrated in the game but you
will<00:04:12.440> have<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.590> pretty<00:04:13.040> much<00:04:13.130> gather<00:04:13.400> with<00:04:13.640> a

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
will have to pretty much gather with a

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.949 
will have to pretty much gather with a
DLC<00:04:14.360> at<00:04:15.020> least<00:04:15.260> looks<00:04:15.530> like<00:04:15.740> that<00:04:15.920> again

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
DLC at least looks like that again

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.170 
DLC at least looks like that again
there<00:04:17.859> hasn't<00:04:18.069> been<00:04:18.250> confirmed<00:04:18.489> anything<00:04:18.910> yet

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
there hasn't been confirmed anything yet

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.090 
there hasn't been confirmed anything yet
so<00:04:19.299> I'm<00:04:19.389> not<00:04:19.539> sure<00:04:19.720> about<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.889> looks

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
so I'm not sure about that that looks

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.520 
so I'm not sure about that that looks
like<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.609> they're<00:04:21.759> also<00:04:21.940> going<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.300> be

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
like it and they're also going to be

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.870 
like it and they're also going to be
from<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.650> looks<00:04:23.830> of<00:04:23.919> it<00:04:24.039> every<00:04:24.639> specific

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
from the looks of it every specific

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.659 
from the looks of it every specific
again<00:04:25.479> with<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:26.020> DLCs<00:04:26.560> like<00:04:26.830> one<00:04:27.190> really

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
again with the DLCs like one really

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.969 
again with the DLCs like one really
small<00:04:28.000> there<00:04:28.750> with<00:04:28.930> small<00:04:29.349> maps<00:04:29.590> one<00:04:29.770> with

small there with small maps one with
really<00:04:30.490> large<00:04:30.610> maps<00:04:30.940> like<00:04:31.180> are<00:04:31.449> more<00:04:31.630> kill<00:04:31.870> and

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
really large maps like are more kill and

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.850 
really large maps like are more kill and
close<00:04:32.380> quarters<00:04:33.030> because<00:04:34.030> I'm<00:04:34.500> if<00:04:35.500> we<00:04:35.680> read<00:04:35.830> a

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
close quarters because I'm if we read a

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.469 
close quarters because I'm if we read a
little<00:04:36.039> bit<00:04:36.190> more<00:04:36.370> there's<00:04:36.610> not<00:04:37.090> another

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
little bit more there's not another

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.300 
little bit more there's not another
close<00:04:37.780> course<00:04:38.080> you'll<00:04:38.259> see<00:04:38.470> which<00:04:38.830> one<00:04:39.190> would

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
close course you'll see which one would

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.999 
close course you'll see which one would
be<00:04:39.370> bell<00:04:39.699> for<00:04:40.060> CQC<00:04:40.389> one<00:04:41.199> will<00:04:41.289> be<00:04:41.410> gutted<00:04:41.770> one

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
be bell for CQC one will be gutted one

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.550 
be bell for CQC one will be gutted one
would<00:04:42.220> be<00:04:42.370> on<00:04:42.639> guard<00:04:42.970> with<00:04:43.330> sounds<00:04:44.259> to<00:04:44.380> leave

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
would be on guard with sounds to leave

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.860 
would be on guard with sounds to leave
then<00:04:45.460> one<00:04:45.729> would<00:04:45.940> be<00:04:46.120> called<00:04:46.150> hand-to-hand

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
then one would be called hand-to-hand

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.659 
then one would be called hand-to-hand
with<00:04:47.080> something<00:04:47.530> more<00:04:47.710> stupid<00:04:48.130> almost<00:04:48.430> and

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
with something more stupid almost and

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.270 
with something more stupid almost and
the<00:04:49.000> last<00:04:49.180> one<00:04:49.419> is<00:04:49.449> Swift<00:04:50.050> kill<00:04:50.259> so<00:04:51.130> we'll

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
the last one is Swift kill so we'll

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.650 
the last one is Swift kill so we'll
probably<00:04:51.490> get<00:04:51.669> an<00:04:51.789> hour<00:04:51.910> like<00:04:52.120> closed<00:04:52.360> course

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
probably get an hour like closed course

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.339 
probably get an hour like closed course
TLC<00:04:53.080> again<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:54.340> our<00:04:54.940> TLC<00:04:55.240> which<00:04:55.570> I'm<00:04:56.139> really

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
TLC again and our TLC which I'm really

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:57.810 
TLC again and our TLC which I'm really
excited<00:04:56.500> for<00:04:56.889> it's<00:04:57.250> like<00:04:57.430> kind<00:04:57.669> of<00:04:57.729> a

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
excited for it's like kind of a

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.700 
excited for it's like kind of a
futuristic<00:04:58.479> DLCs<00:04:58.900> I'm<00:04:59.080> just<00:04:59.380> going<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.560> read

out<00:04:59.800> names<00:05:00.039> again<00:05:00.280> which<00:05:00.400> would<00:05:00.550> be<00:05:00.699> redacted

confidential or classified and they're

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.029 
confidential or classified and they're
like<00:05:06.970> some<00:05:07.300> prototype<00:05:08.169> weapons<00:05:08.560> in<00:05:08.680> there<00:05:08.830> for

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
like some prototype weapons in there for

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.950 
like some prototype weapons in there for
example<00:05:09.400> like<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.639> xm8<00:05:10.060> which<00:05:10.300> never<00:05:10.659> really

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
example like the xm8 which never really

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.140 
example like the xm8 which never really
made<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.139> into<00:05:11.409> the<00:05:11.440> actual<00:05:11.800> like<00:05:12.060> battle<00:05:13.060> in

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
made it into the actual like battle in

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.580 
made it into the actual like battle in
real<00:05:13.360> life<00:05:13.539> but<00:05:13.570> maybe<00:05:14.020> it<00:05:14.199> will<00:05:14.320> make<00:05:14.470> it

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
real life but maybe it will make it

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.960 
real life but maybe it will make it
better<00:05:14.710> for<00:05:14.830> and<00:05:15.250> I<00:05:15.280> think<00:05:15.490> looks<00:05:15.789> pretty

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
better for and I think looks pretty
