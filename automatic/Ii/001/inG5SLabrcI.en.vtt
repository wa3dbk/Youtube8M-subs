00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.740
 well everyone is philips and we 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.089
 finds himself today for something else 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
 only pvp since we will talk 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.580
 today from mr freeze 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.280
 no no no mitis taken here you are 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.440
 more disgusting is better so what 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.150
 boss who is quite known frankly on 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.840
 dofus and wakfu you by for his 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.970
 difficulty on dofus and wakfu it's not 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.510
 quite that and that's what we're on 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 will linger 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.359
 so she's in the fourth room 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.560
 of the ambassador's ale dungeon 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.000
 montcourt access it you will need a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.559
 key to the ambassador's ale 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.160
 but it's even better to know where he 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.980
 is here then it is not there it is 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:47.129
 there at the door so here she is 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.450
 has two clearly 9000 points of 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.800
 life so it's not it's not 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.570
 monstrous for a buzz frankly 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.420
 I think we've seen worse 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.870
 ten action points 6.2 movement 4.3 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.359
 inch 396 of initiative 187 of tak and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.449
 359 dodges so if you want 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.549
 start before a rogue if 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.770
 you want out of the bedrooms which need 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.330
 all the same but what it is if you 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.900
 want to attack you have to do 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.229
 gift bag and that's it has 675% 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.150
 damage in all items and 385 3 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.880
 180% resistance in all 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.920
 elements we can from europe on 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.140
 frisettes so that's the equivalent of red 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.780
 bull but in more times an ice kama 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.079
 defragments only to a fragment of 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.369
 death we are still very much 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.490
 a whole panoply necro forge a 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:42.450
 refrigerated placement and a headdress 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.890
 then manage for that to drop and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.509
 all this must obviously labat 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.579
 since it is still accompanied by 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.730
 the whole family of cats go north 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.660
 except 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.060
 North tracker e 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.000
 she is also accompanied by 4 fate 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.230
 that she can throw you in the face 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.930
 the first is a small avalanche 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.990
 all cute but that hurts so much 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.250
 you stay together a second spell that 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.380
 is a kind of wheel so it's a 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.970
 ice ray that hurts you right there 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.750
 can still go up to 650 children 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.090
 criticism so here we will avoid a 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.470
 also has a feel not really of 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.350
 passive but something that gets busy 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.850
 each round so she sets a mark in 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.860
 below some players a little to 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.440
 like cilantro on fleas but 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.700
 a little less hardcore anyway she 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.850
 not pose on every player going 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:40.550
 ask one or two everywhere so that makes 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.170
 that if you stay on here you are so 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.590
 you go on it by cons when you 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.520
 are resurrected so dead living there by 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.500
 against you are treated 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.910
 by the way talking about dying 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.530
 instantly she also has a second 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.780
 what's cool when she has 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.910
 fed up with her one shot 20 to you 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.170
 of a 1700 or 2000 and a few so in 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.820
 all the cases you are not eating 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.350
 since rim for that it is a pity 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.650
 yet it happened to us all 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.739
 time but the reward takes him away 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.330
 do not care so that's pretty much 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.770
 all that is to know for mitis 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.390
 reid 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.400
 so there are some small tips 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.410
 still so the first one is from 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.239
 disembodied they escaped dia who are 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.620
 dead because it really becomes I 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.459
 assures you that it really becomes very 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.770
 problematic 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.150
 this story of chater the second 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.520
 it's not to stay together so 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.770
 keep at least 2 cÃ s distance with 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.239
 your ally to avoid being caught 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.940
 avalanches have had 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.200
 because it's not very cool and the 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.000
 last trick that can be useful 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.230
 when you are alive you are not 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.670
 stay on the boxes with a head of 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.670
 Death here to go to everyone
