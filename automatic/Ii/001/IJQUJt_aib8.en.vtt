the YouTube problems update wonderful
time<00:00:05.520> here<00:00:06.140> basically<00:00:07.140> putting<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:08.360> couple<00:00:09.360> of

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
time here basically putting a couple of

time here basically putting a couple of
new<00:00:09.540> fans<00:00:09.809> put<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.769> xigmatek<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.519> side

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
new fans put the xigmatek on the side

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.360 
new fans put the xigmatek on the side
there<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.330> little<00:00:13.290> antique<00:00:13.410> fan<00:00:13.860> down<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> base

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
there a little antique fan down the base

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.300 
there a little antique fan down the base
to<00:00:15.030> suck<00:00:15.570> cold<00:00:15.839> air<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.260> straightening<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
to suck cold air in straightening the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.650 
to suck cold air in straightening the
gtx<00:00:17.699> 260<00:00:18.470> that<00:00:19.470> helps<00:00:19.770> push<00:00:20.010> air<00:00:20.250> long<00:00:21.240> cooler

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
gtx 260 that helps push air long cooler

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.460 
gtx 260 that helps push air long cooler
because<00:00:21.810> even<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> CM<00:00:22.710> 690<00:00:23.310> case<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:25.230> hard

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
because even the CM 690 case the hard

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.859 
because even the CM 690 case the hard
drive<00:00:25.710> tray<00:00:26.039> basically<00:00:26.730> blocks<00:00:27.060> all<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
drive tray basically blocks all of the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.859 
drive tray basically blocks all of the
airflow<00:00:28.380> completely<00:00:29.250> from<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.330> front<00:00:30.660> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
airflow completely from the front and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.080 
airflow completely from the front and
take<00:00:31.080> thing<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.250> mean<00:00:32.460> if<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.820> stick<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
take thing so I mean if you can stick a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.060 
take thing so I mean if you can stick a
few<00:00:33.390> minutes<00:00:33.719> will<00:00:34.230> help<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> air<00:00:34.860> actually

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
few minutes will help the air actually

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.000 
few minutes will help the air actually
circulate<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.200> ideally<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.380> suppose<00:00:37.829> you'd

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
circulate but ideally I suppose you'd

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.700 
circulate but ideally I suppose you'd
cut<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.489> actual<00:00:38.820> hard<00:00:39.030> drive<00:00:39.239> cage<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.899> we

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
cut the actual hard drive cage out we

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.560 
cut the actual hard drive cage out we
locate<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.070> hard<00:00:41.340> drives<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:41.820> until<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
locate the hard drives up until like a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.170 
locate the hard drives up until like a
three-in-one<00:00:43.050> beta<00:00:43.440> voice<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:44.160> when<00:00:45.030> that's

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
three-in-one beta voice but when that's

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.660 
three-in-one beta voice but when that's
pretty<00:00:45.450> extreme<00:00:45.920> you<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.250> else<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
pretty extreme you know what else I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.910 
pretty extreme you know what else I
chucked<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.390> SAM<00:00:48.899> blast<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.410> sound<00:00:49.710> card

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
chucked in a SAM blast a sound card

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.720 
chucked in a SAM blast a sound card
because<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.840> on-board<00:00:52.260> audio<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.070> 750<00:00:53.699> I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
because the on-board audio in the 750 I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.090 
because the on-board audio in the 750 I
is<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.199> bad<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:55.829> pretty

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
is just it's not bad but it's pretty

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.650 
is just it's not bad but it's pretty
weak<00:00:56.399> especially<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> want<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> drive<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
weak especially if you want to drive a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.110 
weak especially if you want to drive a
decent<00:00:58.140> set<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.320> headphones<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:59.190> power

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
decent set of headphones your power

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.569 
decent set of headphones your power
outputs<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.809> not<00:01:00.989> there<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:02.100> i<00:01:02.129> put<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
outputs just not there so i put the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.789 
outputs just not there so i put the
older<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:03.270> I'm<00:01:03.359> blaster<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.899> there<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.229> turn

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
older see I'm blaster in there and turn

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.230 
older see I'm blaster in there and turn
the<00:01:04.890> headphones<00:01:05.250> I'm<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.700> died<00:01:05.909> because

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the headphones I'm really died because

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.590 
the headphones I'm really died because

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it's so loud so I can actually get a bit

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.130 
it's so loud so I can actually get a bit

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
UV fan in there it was the only thing I

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.040 
UV fan in there it was the only thing I
could<00:02:24.950> find<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.580> could<00:02:25.910> put<00:02:26.120> behind<00:02:26.300> that<00:02:26.720> grill

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
could find I could put behind that grill

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.500 
could find I could put behind that grill
that<00:02:27.350> was<00:02:27.560> fairly<00:02:27.830> quiet<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.580> will<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.300> cooler

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
that was fairly quiet I will the cooler
