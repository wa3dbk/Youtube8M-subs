00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.690
 the garbage does not leave the house because the house is made of garbage 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.650
 a construction material as noble as any other 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.830
 In the house of the biologists Luis and Etna, the recycled house has several 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.569
 objectives 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:19.070
 maybe self-sustaining functional but also economic to 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.820
 that fact does not attack you others we had never thought about this but from 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.149
 suddenly we saw so much garbage lying around and nature suffering that 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.539
 we decided to put together a little to make a house 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.790
 trying to make it cheap also for the most needy families 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.520
 the gangs later 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.980
 used recycled materials in construction reduced the final price in 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.980
 70% in relation to a traditional house 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.930
 the house was built 90% with recycled material 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.540
 nothing is thrown away everything is recycled but today it makes of colombia a series of savings 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.670
 the house does not have bricks was made whole with debris reconstruction of 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.840
 demolition madrid also does not have to turn the meetings uimp durán the bounce 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.830
 so the saving was huge 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.250
 Lazio plastic bottles are applied both in construction 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.770
 as in decoration 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.220
 the technique consists of cutting the base and filling them with a mixture 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.990
 cheaper cement and rubble and that serves to replace the bricks 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.930
 with the same objective they also used milk boxes filled with their 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.530
 Once the glass bottles were incorporated as a coating for 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.980
 walls filled with construction debris 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.220
 but since I wanted to investigate other techniques they also did 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.990
 coatings with glass bottles and with remains of telgopor and until 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.170
 lamb manure among many other creative options 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.190
 the broken glass of colors were used as tiles or mosaic 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.140
 figurative to avoid bouncing the floors with pieces of marble come from 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.340
 of the most moderate works 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.170
 but there are other floors with materials like plastic caps and also bottles 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.070
 only bottles received at least three trucks with 24 tons per 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.609
 more we send a selection association 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.609
 trash goals in round volta that has tons daily and also 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.719
 we buy from the community so always trash available to choose 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.869
 As a matter of safety, the only thing that does not come from recycling is the 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:20.989
 beams pillars and columns 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.310
 all the rest of Luis' invention 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.629
 and in fact she 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.730
 Luis put roof made with milk boxes that turned out much more 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.730
 insulators of heat that detests it from vegetable fiber 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:36.639
 glass bottles were also useful for that purpose pieces 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.289
 just started or we looked for that we just wanted a good and cheap house but 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:45.669
 it turned out that with that material at home it's cool does not stop feeling the heat nor 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.569
 fan we have to use 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.799
 Negrín city bolpress the fans or rather the remains of fans 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:53.650
 discarded 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.939
 They were used as a base for wish lamps 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.339
 the curtains are remains of plastic bags 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:01.860
 all the decoration 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.589
 in recyclable garbage 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:07.699
 this lack taking transplanting are not the things we start to make a 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:11.850
 classification and when we see very interesting things for decoration 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.919
 we removed it after failing 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.419
 the sewers are also ecological 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.579
 separated and treated solid waste serve as fertilizer for the garden 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.709
 as well as other organic waste 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.509
 the liquid part treated 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:29.299
 returns clean for the toilet discharge ok for the garden as in this lake 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.609
 a type of architecture defined as spontaneous 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.629
 Hackett disputed in it is considered as transport axes 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.709
 in the construction of properties that use materials and technologies 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.420
 improvised according to the generally available recyclable material luis 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.680
 is building a condominium in luxury shot made with recycled material 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.199
 with common spaces such as entertainment and kitchen areas 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.560
 the ecological rural village solidaria 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.330
 will have a basic rule of coexistence only accept people who share 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.199
 that philosophy 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.299
 biologists technical education anyone interested in this kind of 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.099
 alternative construction 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.809
 a trend certainly with future with construction material that never 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:13.489
 missing and always left
