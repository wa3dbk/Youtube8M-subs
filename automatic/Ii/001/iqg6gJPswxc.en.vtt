00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.290
 Welcome to a new motto 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.780
 you this time I show you the hot 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.480
 pursuit and how you can see that 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.969
 hard to down 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.039
 this is more normal than not so you can 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.470
 now through this modification the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.119
 whole bodies look that way too 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.670
 shoulders have to look further 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.090
 but not and that just awesome 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.710
 o pop is just awesome horny 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.420
 that instead of always sometimes so when you are 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.850
 Look down that somehow 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.570
 his freezer are not and then 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 That's what it's all about from this perspective 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.379
 everything shown here and with the arrows 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.719
 just as there is now one 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.270
 a little new movement of it 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.789
 will you close the joint has 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.590
 and then you move 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.170
 then you also notice that in quote if 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.789
 one has already completely opened up 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.230
 it still quite normal one holds the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.189
 ears still here in the left hand 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:08.670
 but on the whole, actually 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.250
 pretty cool out of this 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.110
 For example, if you are there with the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:20.400
 Closing the bow would also make it easy 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.680
 much horny from so now in connection 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.619
 still the installation comes the money 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.060
 Of course there is also something to look at 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.650
 the best one just has to be one 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.570
 Doing something different is not 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.170
 so the complete standard installation and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.600
 So I say a lot of fun with it 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.000
 now we are here on the desktop 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.479
 you need these three files 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.329
 once minecraft ford once in the q5 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.420
 fit so hot and once the 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.329
 edges player api needs it 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.130
 Whole works at all what we do 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.530
 of course now you wake up 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.899
 All this in the description will find that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.820
 I will make everything link 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.610
 now here on start up 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.240
 do not want to click on it 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.479
 then just 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.190
 windows button and then press opens 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.230
 fill in the window too 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.890
 there he is then a percentage that steadily 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.650
 the whole then we go to the point 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.190
 minecraft folder in and then in the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.300
 folders open the minecraft year with 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.360
 are rar archives so the message 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.850
 close once then next 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:45.090
 let's just grab minecraft forge 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:51.060
 we just copy everything I can and 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:58.769
 then take the whole pack over it 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:01.580
 in the minecraft had short and 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.580
 to confirm 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.890
 huber pull that longer than there 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.019
 otherwise delete the meter in full 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.609
 we either button with the distance 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.709
 after having marked this or with 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:19.260
 right click and delete file 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:24.410
 I will call them as one we forces 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.410
 connect then come next 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:36.180
 the cylinder player api open the whole 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.900
 we also sign pixie mark again 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.670
 all copying this with jam c 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.819
 friend and control v 1 confirm 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.310
 next you can close that 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:54.000
 minecraft dzaka just close that here 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:58.590
 we need the improved ones right away 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.500
 first person I open that ever 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.230
 then I conclude instead that is easy 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.010
 short minecraft with it a folder 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.010
 is generated 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.150
 so attract a Us 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:28.750
 wait wait wait so long once 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:33.280
 just log in and it's enough 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:36.130
 could want x6 and then we mark 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.890
 these two and in our point 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.190
 Minecraft order here should now 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:45.490
 newfolder his will Hiscox beginning 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.130
 on it this is actually nothing 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.880
 be in there 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.880
 then we pack all those files 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.320
 once over here and move and 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.750
 written and then replace 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.670
 If you have the two of the culprits then you can 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.100
 you close the whole and you can 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.660
 gamble so that's it 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.460
 again with these people like you and me 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.800
 Hope you enjoyed it and continue 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.010
