their support and actually doing
something<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.900> because<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:32.070> now<00:00:32.430> feels

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
something like this because it now feels

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.569 
something like this because it now feels
like<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:34.280> regular<00:00:35.280> SimCity<00:00:36.210> game<00:00:37.340> playing<00:00:38.340> with

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
like a regular SimCity game playing with

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.700 
like a regular SimCity game playing with
the<00:00:38.730> constricted<00:00:39.600> boundaries<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.410> was<00:00:40.530> so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the constricted boundaries it was so

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.130 
the constricted boundaries it was so
small<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:42.030> you'd<00:00:42.210> build<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.750> build<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
small you know you'd build and build and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.950 
small you know you'd build and build and
to<00:00:43.399> finally<00:00:44.399> plop<00:00:44.940> every<00:00:45.300> little<00:00:45.539> thing<00:00:45.719> into

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to finally plop every little thing into

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.580 
to finally plop every little thing into
that<00:00:46.079> small<00:00:46.640> square<00:00:47.640> space<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.300> land<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.020> it

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
that small square space of land and it

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.619 
that small square space of land and it
was<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:49.980> annoying<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.910> now<00:00:51.090> as<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.570> see

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
was just annoying but now as you can see

i zoom out here and you have a huge huge

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.340 
i zoom out here and you have a huge huge
surrounding<00:00:59.609> area<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.239> land<00:01:00.539> where<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.199> you

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
surrounding area of land where that you

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.210 
surrounding area of land where that you
can<00:01:01.530> build<00:01:01.770> from<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.899> very<00:01:04.350> much<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.220> let

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
can build from but it's very much so let

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.130 
can build from but it's very much so let
me<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> settings<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.659> lower

me just go into the settings and lower
the<00:01:10.530> audio<00:01:11.220> here<00:01:15.049> okay<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.439> was<00:01:16.530> saying

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
the audio here okay so like I was saying

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.030 
the audio here okay so like I was saying
as<00:01:17.900> far<00:01:18.900> as<00:01:20.150> building<00:01:21.150> residential<00:01:22.049> areas<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
as far as building residential areas and

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.719 
as far as building residential areas and
zones<00:01:23.600> outside<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> boundaries<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:26.130> can

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
zones outside of the boundaries you can

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.359 
zones outside of the boundaries you can
simply<00:01:27.240> cannot<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.340> I

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
simply cannot do that as you can see I

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.460 
simply cannot do that as you can see I
select<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.229> commercial<00:01:31.229> zone

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
select a commercial zone

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.330 
select a commercial zone
I<00:01:31.710> cannot<00:01:32.189> zone<00:01:33.500> outside<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> boundary

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
I cannot zone outside of the boundary

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.399 
I cannot zone outside of the boundary
now<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.180> would<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.900> go<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.909> the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
now you would have to go to the the

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.910 
now you would have to go to the the
modded<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.299> density<00:01:42.899> buildings<00:01:43.680> you

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
modded you know density buildings you

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.770 
modded you know density buildings you
have<00:01:43.950> here

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
have here

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.550 
have here
and<00:01:46.490> plop<00:01:47.490> them<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.480> sometimes<00:01:48.840> this

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and plop them on and sometimes this

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
and plop them on and sometimes this
doesn't<00:01:49.950> even<00:01:50.010> work<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.410> very<00:01:55.400> it's<00:01:56.400> very

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
doesn't even work so it's very it's very

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.150 
doesn't even work so it's very it's very
should<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.630> said<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:57.990> very<00:01:58.200> constricted<00:01:58.979> and

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
should I said it's very constricted and

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.980 
should I said it's very constricted and
in<00:01:59.880> terms<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.420> what<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.720> can<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.310> now<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:03.210> order

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
in terms of what you can do now in order

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.480 
in terms of what you can do now in order
to<00:02:04.350> place<00:02:04.729> streets<00:02:06.020> around<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.490> extended

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
to place streets around this extended

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.980 
to place streets around this extended
boundaries<00:02:09.119> you'd<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.600> use<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
boundaries you'd have to use the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.070 
boundaries you'd have to use the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
I showed you guys earlier all of the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.100 
I showed you guys earlier all of the
streets<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.110> needed<00:02:16.470> come<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:18.000> those<00:02:18.300> zip

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
streets you needed come in in those zip

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.140 
streets you needed come in in those zip
files<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.650> port<00:02:20.280> them<00:02:20.430> over<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.820> your<00:02:20.910> Sim

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
files you port them over to your Sim

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.260 
files you port them over to your Sim
City<00:02:21.390> data<00:02:21.690> folder<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:23.010> here<00:02:23.640> they<00:02:23.850> all<00:02:24.030> are

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
City data folder so here they all are

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.340 
City data folder so here they all are
and<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:26.360> can<00:02:27.360> plop<00:02:28.140> these<00:02:28.500> down<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:30.350> build

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
and I can plop these down and build

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.260 
and I can plop these down and build
streets<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.730> as<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.660> can<00:02:33.870> see<00:02:33.930> on<00:02:34.350> those<00:02:35.270> you

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
streets and as you can see on those you

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.910 
streets and as you can see on those you
can<00:02:36.540> build<00:02:36.840> your<00:02:38.360> type<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.540> land<00:02:39.900> or<00:02:40.440> type<00:02:40.890> of

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
can build your type of land or type of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.290 
can build your type of land or type of
buildings<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.730> want<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.120> surround<00:02:42.330> them<00:02:42.720> with

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
buildings you want to surround them with

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.970 
buildings you want to surround them with
for<00:02:45.300> example<00:02:45.810> I'm<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:46.200> plopping<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.739> few

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
for example I'm just plopping a few

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.960 
for example I'm just plopping a few
buildings<00:02:47.190> here<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:49.830> know<00:02:49.980> I'm<00:02:50.100> just<00:02:50.250> going
