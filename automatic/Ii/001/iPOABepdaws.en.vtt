00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.190 
come on right but its own honestly up 64
that<00:00:40.950> bench<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.820> both<00:00:42.210> power<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.520> I

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
that bench they both power and I so I

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.830 
that bench they both power and I so I
those<00:00:46.200> guys<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.860> think<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.910> can't<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.510> jetting

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
those guys I think I can't be jetting

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.350 
those guys I think I can't be jetting
certainly<00:00:49.320> would<00:00:49.469> experience<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.700> is

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
certainly would experience and is

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.410 
certainly would experience and is
recognizing<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.739> me<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.010> he<00:00:53.100> has<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
recognizing that to me that he has is a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.959 
recognizing that to me that he has is a
talented<00:00:55.079> player<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.680> his<00:00:55.800> own<00:00:55.980> right<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.879> I

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
talented player in his own right and I

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.910 
talented player in his own right and I
think<00:00:57.000> Brandon<00:00:57.510> Harris<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.230> very<00:00:58.649> talented

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
think Brandon Harris is a very talented

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.760 
think Brandon Harris is a very talented
player<00:00:59.489> maybe<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.629> little<00:01:00.870> bit<00:01:01.109> more

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
player maybe just a little bit more

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.219 
player maybe just a little bit more
naturally<00:01:02.489> talented<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.239> think<00:01:03.539> me<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
naturally talented but I think me the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.250 
naturally talented but I think me the
competition<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.729> very<00:01:06.540> telling

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
if you will I think our office a wily

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.929 
if you will I think our office a wily
veteran<00:01:10.320> should<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.280> able<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.490> protect<00:01:11.640> them

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
