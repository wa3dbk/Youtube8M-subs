00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.039
 the chosen moral path meter was object 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.179
 of a lot of study by the secretariat and the advisory committee 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.829
 by the 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.919
 integrators that have been hired by our internal team 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.019
 per hundred of experts 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.810
 who work for the metro secretariat 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.210
 and toti has taken all this time because it is what we wanted before nothing 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 Be very sure that you are on the correct path 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.490
 as you know one can move people desert place to another place 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.120
 one percent 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.680
 taking taking different alternative different route 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.350
 but nevertheless 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.890
 there are places where inter-union inc to pass 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.690
 the route that we have chosen in the route that has the most impact for the city of 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.980
 Panama 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.450
 the route as I told you broken junk and a very stimulated route studied 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.260
 the demand 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.640
 great that we have at this time is going to be 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.130
 from North 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.030
 during the morning 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.870
 and the south in the afternoon 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.660
 but as we came we have made every effort to get into the middle 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.900
 from the city through a tunnel 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.710
 because what has 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.770
 truly impact is that people can get close to their jobs 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.020
 the most important thing that people can get close to their jobs and that they can 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.190
 walk 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.980
 by the meter certainly we had another cheaper alternative and more 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.980
 easy to build by going further and north 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.450
 really that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.079
 can study it a lot and really think about the future of the city 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.039
 panama the next 50 years really what we want is the route that has the 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.429
 greater impact and having 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.429
 the greatest possibility of providing a good transport service 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.250
 to the inhabitants of the city to go up 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.810
 the chip turned 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.229
 double-double-double a panamacompra punto bop aft 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.119
 the place 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.209
 percent of knowing panamacompra 11 put all the tenders 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:17.739
 is going to go up 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.859
 the complete specifications sheet for the prequalification of the company 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.559

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.709
 want to participate in the subway tender 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.709
 in front of a sheet that has taken several months to prepare 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:34.029
 i percent and very complete describing all the 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.689
 the aspects 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.749
 and the facilities and tic for the requirement that we are demanding 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:41.249
 the construction company 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.249
 we want world-class construction companies 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:49.179
 because it is a very big work very complex the time is very short 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:54.419
 For this reason the company has to have a website in the large capacity of 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.869
 can run p from the group to 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.479
