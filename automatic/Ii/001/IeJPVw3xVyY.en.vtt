00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.880
 I waste my time, I am on my feet 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.160
 close but more distant we look for the way 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.140
 to make us small just to hear 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.419
 these older children who have gods 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.279
 ties tightens them stronger if we were 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.960
 animals maybe we will know hands 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.050
 we could not unconditionally 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.210
 burn us not having your hands themes left 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.730
 I come back home and it's raining outside but also 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.650
 if it is not winter, summer acts with mine 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.410
 just cold inside is just an excuse 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.480
 do n't look for another excuse I miss 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.670
 each of the soil that is about us and 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.979
 that there are six numbers left 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.320
 different because if you look at your eyes 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:57.100
 beyond the tears I saw and reflected my own 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.610
 I saw your reflections and maybe you did 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.970
 you will go 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.180
 we'll never know what 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:08.150
 there is not a gift for ours 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.700
 trouble and I don't think you know 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.659
 the night you will remember our 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.270
 shadows 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.270
 join the sun that never warms up 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.300
 we are two strangers the oberstaufen e 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.580
 discs that maybe too much the same from 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.530
 not understand when he shakes me 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.360
 I observed leon that prevents the part 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.220
 of the state 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.240
 denying you the world does n't want us anymore 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.620
 assholes you see suffer known you invite 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.590
 with pressures 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.350
 food to the acids baskets years that I look for 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.960
 right formula to chemical is which which 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.580
 do not adjust to wine spread each 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.480
 once he suffered I drank 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.790
 vodka today 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.840
 as ethyl today you are assigned as the 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.270
 first day as the first evening 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.159
 the perfect sky but perhaps life at 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.940
 we will all wake up and maybe not you 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.160
 you will go 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.990
 we'll never know what 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.420
 dino gave us antigua pine 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.290
 and I don't think you know 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.080
 you will not be reminded of our unites 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.890
 from the sun warms up 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.950
 and maybe you will go away we will never know 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.640
 what fate has given us is 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.740
 thrown to the wind for our troubles and not 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.810
 I 'll think about it 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.650
 the note that you will make united by the sun than not 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.650
 there will never be
