00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.600
 finally it is nine years after 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.230
 the first reading with fine astonishing 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.380
 are now first time next neighbor bmx 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.810
 has published a demo at the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.940
 first edition of final fantasy type series 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.100
 hd included and we of course 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.900
 have just caught and this demo 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.020
 already gives good insights into the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.820
 coming part of the fantasy saga and before 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.370
 everything in the interesting innovations 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.360
 they are the ones over the former ones 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.100
 Heavy dump of fantasy 15 features 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.329
 as the first part of the series about one 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.550
 real openworld of that is already 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.090
 a part in the demo the way apple 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.760
 stores kay means available and the demo 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.680
 implies a living world 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.910
 different landscapes and also 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.110
 Many animals and monsters at one 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.390
 dynamic day night change is as well 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.610
 integrated like some side quests the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.610
 significantly increase the playing time of the demo 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.210
 the second no less important 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.920
 innovation affects the fighting system the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.990
 earlier round bouts are now 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.710
 finally battled real time 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.740
 given way 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.830
 This has, among other things, the consequence that he 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.230
 now regularly from more larger ones 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.980
 monster groups are attacked as in 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.980
 share the previous one 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.440
 Your hero has several 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.200
 special skills such as 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.700
 a teleport over a small distance 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.030
 that he uses during the fight 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.030
 can 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.790
 no less impressive, I think 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.740
 So the graphic is a fantasy 15 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.690
 the first part of the series will be the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.540
 especially for the new consoles for pc 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.170
 xbox is developed and I think so 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.760
 one sees 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.990
 It still takes a few months until 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.150
 The game seems to have no idea 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.650
 maybe this will also be the case in 2016 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.240
 exactly do you not know that 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.040
 but here is the monster design 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.720
 I find it very successful and it 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.900
 content by far the biggest monsters 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.290
 how to whom in the 50 year old 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.290
 want 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.480
 There is also an ID card system 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.239
 reminds a bit of that 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.189
 masking system of mad men playing with it 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.469
 can you escape your opponents 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:59.189
 you can also stay upside down and 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:01.040
 then I was automatically off 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:05.450
 However, all this costs mum 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.450
 as well as the special attacks eye 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.620
 You always have five different weapons 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.349
 with you these each fulfill one 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.099
 special task for example to him 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.290
 counter and in the demo are not yet 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.819
 all announced features of the 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.840
 fighting system in it so it feels 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.019
 really, really 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.220
 novel for final fantasy but the 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.900
 Developers promise that it will be in 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.330
 finished game even more 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.099
 will give special features so you can 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.290
 the fighting system a bit with kingdom 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.360
 Compare hearts 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.709
 but it's really good, too 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.709
 genre overarching very special 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.980
 pull there 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.670
 again and again come so big drop chips 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.849
 to the nearby enemy soldiers 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.739
 drop 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.290
 these chase you during the game 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.930
 targeted and usually resort to larger ones 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.030
 groups but also here you have to 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.100
 Do not look straight ahead in the eye 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.169
 You always have three companions in yours 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.570
 side you during the fight 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.320
 support and in case of emergency again 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.320
 can prove 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.909
 By the way, only the main character 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.310
 prince noctis playable 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:38.849
 your companions are going through from 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.849
 the ki controlled 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.610
 yes this mammoth has been like it can 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.320
 really take a lot 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.050
 yes with one of these special attacks 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.000
 seen as I said or mana 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.970
 So you always have to use targeted 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.030
 use 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.980
 another special feature is also like 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.170
 is dealt with the life energy 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.590
 if it consumes completely 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.540
 is 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.310
 then you are not dead automatically 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.590
 rather , you are hanging over that 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.510
 battlefield and must hope that 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.240
 you one of your comrades again 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:27.770
 Prepare before the next attack 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.840
 of an opponent you meet the demo 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.180
 version shows really well where the trip 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.280
 at 51 15 goes 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.290
 Although there are some technical misfires 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.030
 but otherwise we are in the good 30 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.590
 playtime nothing to complain about 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.330
 the soundtrack is great and the 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.830
 funny or attitudes between the 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.400
 Heroes also take care of the series 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.400
 the atmosphere
