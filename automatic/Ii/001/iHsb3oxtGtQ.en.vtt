00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.140
 with five specifically for agriculture 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.690
 underlines developed models 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.120
 chase idea that you as the farmers 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.660
 customer not only discovered but 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.340
 Also seriously takes next to biogas plants 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.090
 Wheel loaders are also in the payroll business 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.439
 increasingly in demand and 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.990
 busy, that's why we have that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.039
 current top model of jaycee like the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.779
 435 s ag sent to silo at 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.079
 Wheel loaders are different 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.399
 basically between two types 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.829
 machines with hydro state or with 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.890
 Hydrostatic transducers are far away 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.410
 spreads the higher the goal all the more 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.660
 they have to fight more 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.149
 due to the poorer power transmission 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.460
 they completely lost their ability to climb 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.789
 unlike our test candidate chelsea 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.430
 like he has one 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.859
 torque converter this works 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.640
 hydrodynamic allows a gentle 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.439
 approach and smooth gear changes 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.080
 This saves fuel and increases comfort 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.409
 on the silo but also when loading and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.380
 on the street around the high efficiency 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.540
 the converter can be improved in 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.640
 the transducers bypass each gear 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.549
 Activate the clutch that works 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.409
 button pressure in the left operating bar 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.930
 so the power is transmitted even better 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.560
 and the ability to climb on the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.140
 growing silo rent improved 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.350
 Generally, the 435 is in discipline 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.240
 mountaineering a good figure 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.220
 with an average of 35 cubic meters 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 we had maissilage delivered 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.070
 no problem 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.690
 the shredded food with one go 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.770
 to distribute 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.690
 unlike the tractor with 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.490
 Sliding plate can pass through the loader 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.980
 lifting the bucket the weight nicely 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.900
 pull on the front axle and get 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.560
 so that the power is better on the soft 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.260
 underground with its 14 two tons 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.500
 Without attachment, the compression was also possible 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.030
 performance satisfactory in the test 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.580
 have the individual proven ones 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.630
 components of the 435 rsag good 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.280
 played together 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.430
 the 6 7-liter kamenz makes 230 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.660
 ps at 2000 turns a maximum 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.610
 torque of 949 newton meters 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.530
 already at 1600 tours 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.280
 The engine meets animal 4 interim means 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.190
 diesel particulate filter diesel 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.380
 oxidation catalyst and 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.870
 exhaust gas recirculation are a nice feature 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.120
 the maximum speed limit per 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.800
 Button pressure limits the engine 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.410
 1,800 revolutions 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.410
 That's how you brake with light work 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.950
 a little loose gas feet and 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.650
 By the way, this saves you on 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.500
 loader for 30 seconds a function 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.800
 it automatically lowers the speed 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.320
 700 revolutions in idling off the 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.800
 gear like the six of zf has six 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.380
 transitions 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.050
 You can be left at the turn signal lever 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.320
 next to the steering wheel by switching the 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.570
 handle turns that is something unusual with 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.190
 various automatic modes can all 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.130
 six courses to the maximum 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.400
 speed of 40 kilometers per hour 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.200
 automatically be switched through 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.020
 it is only controlled by the accelerator pedal 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.140
 the axes come from zf and have one 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.200
 Maintenance interval of 1500 hours 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.930
 They have planets and drives 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.440
 and on each wheel sits a wet oil bath 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.599
 Slats brake is the basic equipment 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.760
 the open axle with 12 percent more 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.470
 worth installing 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.610
 but there are also axes with slats 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.890
 locking differential with 30 who joins 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.120
 our machine was an automatic 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.150
 we would be installed axle 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.610
 It works without steering angle sensors 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.370
 and turns with a spear worth 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.680
 from 100 percent automatically to when the 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.549
 torque and speed differences too 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.790
 grow up 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.769
 an argument for the wheel loader is his 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.040
 stately hydraulic performance of 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.799
 a total of 264 liters per minute 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.890
 for that he was finally constructed 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.479
 on four terminals can be additional equipment 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.510
 to be mounted on the swingarm 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.720
 the cultivation is easy the view is good 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.090
 the two load sensing pumps each 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.539
 132 lbs per minute give the swingarm 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.039
 in 4.4 seconds 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:34.039
 the additional functions are operated 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.580
 are directly on the joystick with buttons 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.830
 tools on the swing you drive in 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.860
 435 It is very comfortable on the road 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.650
 without a tool, unfortunately, it rocks 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.169
 quite strong on the automatic too 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.020
 vibration eradication does a good job 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.330
 the central lubrication system lubricates all 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.789
 points automatically only to the cross 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.570
 You still have to joint the cardan shaft 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.610
 hand ran 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.800
 the daily effort is so 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.690
 manageable the flap on the tail 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.280
 Restrict far enough in maintenance 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.400
 position on at all 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.320
 to control operating fluids 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.240
 nice it would be the air filter over the 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.590
 platform to the left of the cabin 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.570
 reach here 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.330
 the stand is a little better than on 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.160
 the package helped the cooler in the rear is 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.440
 sufficiently large 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.020
 the air becomes timely and after 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.910
 sucked in the back against extra charge 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.520
 The fan turns in a tight 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.950
 interval backwards and blows the 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.440
 air intakes is driven freely 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.150
 fan hydraulically the cabin is 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.700
 comfortable and nice and quiet 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.950
 the joystick for the swingarm is not 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.990
 integrated into an armrest as it is 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.960
 knows of tractors but on the 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.180
 Right console built up the arm can 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.720
 but on an adjustable pad 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.570
 lay 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.300
 through the slim dashboard is 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.690
 the view forward very well in the digital 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.430
 You can walk away from the display 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.920
 diesel consumption and remaining range 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.440
 show a passenger seat there 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.500
 Unfortunately it does not have the air conditioning and that 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.170
 radio only for an additional amount, a new 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.990
 Cabin with more features comes with the 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.900
 Revised 2016 series coming 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:20.290
