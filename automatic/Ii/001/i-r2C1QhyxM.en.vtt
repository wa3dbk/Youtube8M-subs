00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
head ok so we can look this way up and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.709 
head ok so we can look this way up and
down<00:00:28.880> follow<00:00:29.880> me<00:00:30.119> over<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.920> this<00:00:31.920> corner<00:00:32.309> and

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
down follow me over to this corner and

down follow me over to this corner and
up<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.680> down<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.390> even<00:00:36.660> check<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
up and down and we can even check in the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.010 
up and down and we can even check in the
midline<00:00:37.969> directly<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.600> down<00:00:40.340> ok<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.989> next

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
midline directly and down ok the next

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.590 
midline directly and down ok the next
thing<00:00:43.320> now<00:00:43.739> we're<00:00:43.980> those<00:00:44.969> were<00:00:45.210> cranial

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
thing now we're those were cranial

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.209 
thing now we're those were cranial
nerves<00:00:45.780> three<00:00:46.110> four<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.379> six<00:00:46.739> we've<00:00:46.980> tested

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
nerves three four and six we've tested

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.000 
nerves three four and six we've tested
cranial<00:00:47.879> nerve<00:00:48.059> two<00:00:48.360> already<00:00:48.860> now<00:00:49.860> we're

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
cranial nerve two already now we're

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.380 
cranial nerve two already now we're
going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> move<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> fifth<00:00:50.969> nerve<00:00:51.210> so

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
going to move on to the fifth nerve so

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.090 
going to move on to the fifth nerve so
we're<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> check<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.170> facial

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
we're going to check for facial

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.680 
we're going to check for facial
sensation<00:00:53.670> we're<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> screen<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
sensation we're going to screen for it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.099 
sensation we're going to screen for it
and<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.620> good<00:00:55.770> way<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.949> doing<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.989> well<00:00:57.989> as

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
and a good way of doing that as well as

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.840 
and a good way of doing that as well as
the<00:00:58.199> sensory<00:00:58.559> exam<00:00:58.859> leaders<00:00:59.219> perhaps<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.730> use

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the sensory exam leaders perhaps to use

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.399 
the sensory exam leaders perhaps to use
a<00:00:59.879> cotton<00:01:00.510> stick<00:01:01.469> applicator<00:01:02.219> ok<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.409> tease

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
a cotton stick applicator ok and tease

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.250 
a cotton stick applicator ok and tease
the<00:01:04.850> head<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> applicator<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.110> get<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the head of the applicator to get a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.310 
the head of the applicator to get a
little<00:01:07.409> wisp<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.860> cotton<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:09.110> we<00:01:10.110> could

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
little wisp of cotton and we could

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.530 
little wisp of cotton and we could
actually<00:01:10.860> snap<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.580> stick<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.720> get<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.250> pokey

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
actually snap the stick to get a pokey

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.270 
actually snap the stick to get a pokey
sharper<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:16.049> testing<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.590> pin<00:01:16.799> later<00:01:17.070> on

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
sharper in for testing for pin later on

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.140 
sharper in for testing for pin later on
but<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.380> facial<00:01:19.380> sensation<00:01:19.979> I'm<00:01:20.909> just

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
but for the facial sensation I'm just

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.690 
but for the facial sensation I'm just
going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.360> use<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.689> cotton<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.950> what<00:01:23.580> I'm

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
going to use the cotton and what I'm

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.649 
going to use the cotton and what I'm
going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.000> I'm<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.270> test<00:01:24.540> your

what I've done is checked the three

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.469 
what I've done is checked the three
divisions<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.560> trigeminal<00:01:58.560> nerve

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.190 
forehead cheek and along the chin or
jawline<00:02:06.180> ok

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.280 

next<00:02:10.200> we're<00:02:10.979> going<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.159> look<00:02:11.280> at<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:12.290> cranial

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
next we're going to look at the cranial

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.849 
next we're going to look at the cranial
nerve<00:02:13.409> seven<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.430> facial<00:02:14.819> nerve
