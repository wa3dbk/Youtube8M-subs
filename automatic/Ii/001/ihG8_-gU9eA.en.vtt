00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.309

 Martin Clint 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.599
 which am 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.310
 Nevertheless, the biggest challenge since today is empty 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.079
 further he must be finally 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.079

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.180
 others do 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.070
 Dorsten 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.160
 Utl at some places 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.509
 that can work 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.430
 some can trust 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.060
 takes responsibility 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 Marino 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.759
 they had to flee

 Referee not 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 that he knows what he wants 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.520
 Berlin 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.960
 4 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.620
