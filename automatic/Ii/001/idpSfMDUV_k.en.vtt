but yeah for you guys wondering about

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.310 
but yeah for you guys wondering about
this<00:01:46.920> setup<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.340> are<00:01:47.430> running<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:47.970> game

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
this setup that are running in this game

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.889 
this setup that are running in this game
I'm<00:01:49.320> running<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.799> mp7<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.090> laser<00:01:51.479> fast

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
I'm running the mp7 with the laser fast

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.100 
I'm running the mp7 with the laser fast
mag<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.520> third<00:01:53.790> attachment<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.720> probably

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
mag and the third attachment is probably

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.410 
mag and the third attachment is probably
long<00:01:55.380> barrel<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.880> probably<00:01:57.210> what<00:01:57.329> I'm

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
long barrel that's probably what I'm

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.330

second one whatever them in whatever
order<00:02:41.580> i<00:02:41.910> do<00:02:42.270> feel<00:02:42.570> one<00:02:42.780> lodestar<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.440> big

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
order i do feel one lodestar on a big

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.550 
order i do feel one lodestar on a big
streak<00:02:44.060> but<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.180> get<00:02:45.360> three<00:02:45.570> loads<00:02:45.750> ours<00:02:46.050> three

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
streak but I get three loads ours three

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.890 
streak but I get three loads ours three
gunships<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.460> believe<00:02:47.730> three<00:02:48.090> sets<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.690> dog

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
gunships and I believe three sets a dog

you<00:04:11.520> have<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.700> consider<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:12.090> few<00:04:12.270> things<00:04:12.330> first

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
you have to consider a few things first

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.130 
you have to consider a few things first
off<00:04:13.080> lost<00:04:13.800> my<00:04:14.040> first<00:04:14.250> lodestar<00:04:14.910> which<00:04:15.150> if<00:04:15.870> you

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
off lost my first lodestar which if you

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.479 
off lost my first lodestar which if you
get<00:04:16.290> a<00:04:16.320> lodestar<00:04:16.739> off<00:04:16.890> you<00:04:17.070> should<00:04:17.280> get

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
get a lodestar off you should get

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.849 
get a lodestar off you should get
somewhere<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.330> between<00:04:18.450> 15<00:04:19.170> to<00:04:19.200> 20<00:04:19.650> kills

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
somewhere in between 15 to 20 kills

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.289 
somewhere in between 15 to 20 kills
depending<00:04:20.370> on<00:04:20.460> the<00:04:20.580> map<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:20.910> stuff<00:04:21.120> like<00:04:21.239> that

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
depending on the map and stuff like that

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.420 
depending on the map and stuff like that
but<00:04:21.630> 15<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.290> 20<00:04:22.530> kills<00:04:22.740> is<00:04:22.919> not<00:04:23.130> impossible

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
but 15 to 20 kills is not impossible

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.140 
but 15 to 20 kills is not impossible
with<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.390> lodestar

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
with a lodestar

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.999 
with a lodestar
in<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.360> air<00:04:25.509> of<00:04:26.199> course<00:04:26.440> this<00:04:26.620> map<00:04:26.830> is<00:04:26.860> not

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
in the air of course this map is not

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.610 
in the air of course this map is not
really<00:04:27.430> made<00:04:28.090> for<00:04:28.120> lodestar<00:04:28.870> but<00:04:29.229> since<00:04:29.410> it<00:04:29.530> is

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
really made for lodestar but since it is

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.249 
really made for lodestar but since it is
demolition<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.400> sponsor<00:04:30.850> at<00:04:31.479> a<00:04:31.690> bit<00:04:31.870> open<00:04:32.139> so

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
demolition the sponsor at a bit open so

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.439 
demolition the sponsor at a bit open so
easy<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.710> get<00:04:32.800> walking<00:04:33.160> into<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.490> spawn<00:04:33.729> you

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
easy to get walking into the spawn you

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.240 
easy to get walking into the spawn you
can<00:04:34.660> rack<00:04:34.930> up<00:04:35.080> kills<00:04:35.380> that<00:04:35.590> way<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:36.039> could

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
can rack up kills that way so that could

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.969 
can rack up kills that way so that could
have<00:04:36.340> been<00:04:36.400> 50<00:04:36.789> to<00:04:36.910> 20<00:04:37.030> kills<00:04:37.360> if<00:04:38.080> not<00:04:38.320> more<00:04:38.650> and

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
have been 50 to 20 kills if not more and

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.560 
have been 50 to 20 kills if not more and
also<00:04:39.340> something<00:04:39.669> that<00:04:39.820> happened<00:04:40.210> was<00:04:40.330> that<00:04:40.360> a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
also something that happened was that a

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.870 
also something that happened was that a
lot<00:04:40.840> of<00:04:40.900> people<00:04:41.020> left<00:04:41.410> during<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.430> game<00:04:42.580> time

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
lot of people left during the game time

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.550 
lot of people left during the game time
I<00:04:43.180> mean<00:04:43.570> I've<00:04:43.780> obviously<00:04:43.930> caught<00:04:44.320> up<00:04:44.440> the
