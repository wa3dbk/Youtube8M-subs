00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.580
 and so failed to count to the end 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.710
 winning from fi with b3 them 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.730
 white chose the elephant inlet would 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.470
 five 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.350
 This move releases Libya but part 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.630
 overweight 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.000
 we elaborated on 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.530
 debut highlight to this party 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.470
 no further part 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.040
 interest due to fights and accuracy 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.190
 therefore, it will be considered fluently 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.500
 so the best protection for black here 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.810
 following 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.210
 they play elephant d 7 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.410
 and after 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.300
 elephant live 5 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.670
 word byt 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.850
 would be 5 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.550
 here is nonsense 3 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.550
 threatening mate 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.090
 would choose 5 shah 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.320
 horses would be d 7 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.390
 sing byt near 7 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.180
 and White's advantage is greatly reduced. 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.180
 but back to the party 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.299
 here black arshak closed 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.180
 a horse 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.620
 horse bd 7 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.450
 which could be expensive for black 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.140
 whites must play 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.410
 live 4 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.750
 and if black responds 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.710
 then strike a weakness 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.860
 namely 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.760
 horses are coming this is 7 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.160
 further follow 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.910
 butt king and at 7 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.010
 elephant c4 show 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.280
 the king and his son 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.279
 Well m 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:10.439
 scientists bad opposition 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.909
 return the pieces one turn back 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.319
 there may be a question 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.689
 what if black is closed by an elephant 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.809
 elephant Yeshe 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:23.429
 this is very bad 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.899
 elephant take eat 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:30.339
 the king takes another 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.499
 hatchback 3 check 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.239
 black king getting under smash attack 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.239
 but back to the party 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.989
 White played out of general considerations here. 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.529
 Finn of fate 3 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.399
 trying to just achieve a gain in 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.179
 development 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:47.559
 followed further 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.109
 elephant eat 6 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.179
 d 5 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:54.589
 word m 5 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.589
 and white castling zero zero 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.799
 finally black got a breather 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.499
 and played a 6 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.299
 I hope to ease the pressure of white figures 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.329
 white change 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.849
 takes gaisin 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.640
 here is the strongest defense 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.209
 was of course 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.989
 takes d 7 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.529
 now white practically 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:20.439
 forced to continue on a bargaining path 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.399
 byut to 7 shah 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:25.659
 Swiss Beta Gaisin 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:26.669
 further 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.489
 White must play my 4 pawn, but not 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.309
 more 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.309
 back to the party 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.720
 in this position 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.460
 black did not play the best bishop 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.459
 byt gaysin 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.159
 all their errors are related to the critical field 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.469
 to 7 at the beginning they closed at up to 7 and at 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:47.040
 shanghai 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.349
 nobody and figure 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.059
 now changing to 2 7 and again not 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.909
 a figure 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.499
 whites respond 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:54.320
 elephant 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.959
 come to 7 shah 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.099
 so as not to lose the pawn on up to 7 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.709
 have to play 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.759
 pier takes on 2 7 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.099
 and after 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.019
 same elephant 5 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.779
 scientist big problems 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.139
 it is difficult for them to finish the development and remove 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.919
 king from the center 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.039
 followed 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:15.149
 owning give 8 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:16.959
 black lost and almost not 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.159
 resist 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:19.219
 and further 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:20.390
 rook 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.159
 d 1 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.529
 be 5 

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:27.669
 owning m with where 1 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.539
 face d 6 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.539
 elephant byut kiev 6 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.189
 opening the way slime and naive 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:39.460
 I hope to make 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.150
 castling 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.199
 coby ice her 4 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.180
 would eat 6 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.759
 this weak move 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.189
 again white to finish the game effectively 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.189
 they are playing 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.349
 typical breakthrough on the topic of overlap 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:58.929
 here blacks can already with calm 

00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:00.680
 conscience surrender 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.580
 really white pawn blocked 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.180
 sixth horizontal 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.240
 and deprived the pawn 5 6 protection from 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.589
 black color 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:11.759
 the black king is very tight 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:12.939
 and white horse 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:16.419
 vadim threatens to move from the field of cues 6 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:17.750
 what to do black 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.669
 if they play 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.189
 who gets mate retracted and knight after 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.189
 horses gives m March 6 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:32.249
 if black moves the pawn forward 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:36.270
 then get even more exotic mat 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.370
 in the center of the board failure soft pawns knight 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.370
 dishes May 6 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.039
 back to the party 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:50.229
 here scientists are the only defense 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.800
 elephant g7 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.069
 whites play 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.849
 Berezniki 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.849
 and the black king cannot leave the center 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.330
 if black takes the book the king gives out 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.029
 7 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:07.110

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.339
 king info 8 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.339
 and eat bet and all 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.479
 in black you have to play 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.259
 D 7 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:22.270
 but after 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.300
 owning the idea 7 shah 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.300
 rook sacrifice for the purpose of imprisonment 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.309
 King give Esenin 

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:34.360
 they get marta again 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.449
 sphere will bring 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.960
 and in the Diet 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.979

 retreat king 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:45.120
 but here in the center of the board 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.860
 the king is not saved 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.229

 eat leads yes and 1 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.569

 faces a knight knight which will lead to 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.099
 huge material losses 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:14.439
 in desperation they take the pawn 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:16.460
 gives is 7 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.999
 but after

 material equality 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.830
 see this black recognized their 

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.830
 defeat
