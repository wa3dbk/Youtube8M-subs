00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:13.850
 and reseller and today we'll talk about 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.240
 cruiser mark2 british light tank 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.010
 level three little history cruiser 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.410
 mark 2 aka a10 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.590
 it is a rethinking of the experience gained by 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.200
 developing tank cruiser mark 1 aka 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.090
 will put two machine gun turrets in front 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.680
 removed and in return considerable effort 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.780
 car booking 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.910
 the funny thing is that the tank was taken to 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.550
 armament like a heavy cruising tank 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.640
 although in our game it is designated as 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.429
 light expression heavy cruising 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.320
 the tank is hidden the meaning and essence of the tank to 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:47.390
 booking the hull and tower forehead 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.249
 you can only stop the machine gunners 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.769
 type t7 combat car 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:54.440
 but the main purpose of the car has been moved 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.989
 the game is great if the machine gunner 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.670
 went into your barton sawed your tank for 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.479
 few seconds therefore not 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.789
 substitute 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.940
 and for ordinary guns even if 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.870
 masthead ms-1 at the cruiser mark2 no armor 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.229
 altogether 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.729
 machine weight about 15 tons while 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.969
 top engine that we can 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.259
 install in the game 150 horsepower so 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.140
 that the power of the machine 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.659
 only 10 horses per ton and this 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.500
 typical for heavy tanks 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.119
 not a machine but a tangle of contradictions but 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.130
 due to gentle factors 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.799
 cross cruiser mark2 has 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.640
 dynamic not the most frisky ester they 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.000
 heavy duty and thanks for the way max speed 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.270
 forward 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.820
 already 40 kilometers per hour but I will try them 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.890
 type the average tank goes through the fields with 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.590
 speed of about thirty kilometers in 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.740
 an hour the speed of turning the chassis is not happy 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.619
 only 34 degrees even fury 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.840
 it is 10 degrees higher than the tower 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.710
 spins briskly at a speed of 46 degrees 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.950
 per second 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.250
 machine overview 330 meters and a range 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.179
 connection 450 here we come to the very 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.100
 delicious in this tank gun on the cruiser 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.470
 mordva can be installed howitzer caliber 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.240
 three point and seven tenths of an inch is 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.030
 ninety four millimeters if 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.310
 transfer to the metric system and what 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.440
 she gets up on the field in 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.209
 it is not surprising that the vast 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.500
 most cruiser magician 2 which you 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.410
 meet the world of tanks 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.840
 equipped with just this tool for that 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.200
 guns are available two types of shells land mines 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.670
 with a breakdown of 47 millimeters and a damage of 370 and 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.640
 cumulative with breakdown 110 but damage 280 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.519
 accuracy of the gun is low scatter 058 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.400
 meters for every 100 meters distance but 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.769
 because we have the same cruising tank which means 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.750
 try to work at distances up to 200 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.140
 meters then the accuracy of the howitzers will be 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.330
 satisfactory and most importantly 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.590
 free yourself to the end of this weapon 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.940
 big time information 3.4 seconds 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.040
 Lyuska do not add about two more 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.860
 seconds before the lap seat starts 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.860
 shrink in general comes down gun very 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.400
 long and it needs to be considered and patiently 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.180
 take plumes to the fullest, but 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.620
 then bang and no offender 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.720
 howitzers decent rate of 5 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.329
 shots per minute that is of the type explicit 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.640
 Characteristic cruiser mark2 with a howitzer 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.829
 one thousand eight hundred fifty damage 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.019
 full blown away 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:30.200
 to the advantages of weapons can be attributed 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.690
 quite good wayne angle of declination of the tool 6 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.120
 degree elevation angle of 20 degrees 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.310
 it's time to discuss the acquisition of this 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.650
 I recommend to take the cars out of the modules 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.560
 fan reinforced aiming drives and 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.640
 enlightened optics yes exactly 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.370
 enlightened q 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.060
 review for the car without armor important 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.730
 indicator 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.160
 Well, since we are in the game lt then we shine 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.989
 accounted for regularly as the third so 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.420
 and on the fifth level fights 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.250
 choosing equipment I hold a set 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.709
 consisting of a large repair kit 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.870
 small repair kit and first aid kit though 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.019
 hot heads are happy to trade 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.569
 small river pudding with tea however in 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.030
 fifth level battles from pudding will be few 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.040
 sense though yaremko not much help 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.489
 because most cars are level five 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.169
 cruiser mark2 on one or two bites to give 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.209
 perk recommendations for crew 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.940
 difficult after all for many car 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.810
 level three is the entrance tank for 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.150
 yourself I am you 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.010
 would such 1 and perks commander light bulb and 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.990
 all other disguise 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.940
 combination enlightened cue good 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.580
 masking will allow to destroy cars 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.010
 the enemy is still on the main approaches 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.360
 get to the high time to take stock 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.710
 cruiser mark 2 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.660
 the tank will be interesting first 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.100
 those who decided to download a new thread 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.980
 British Fri-Sau 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.780
 and secondly to experienced players so 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.669
 how this tank makes it possible to carry 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.680
 third level battles and work wonders 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.530
 heroism in the battles of the fourth and fifth 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.120
 level on it all like 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.190
 subscribe to my channel link to 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.150
 He is in the description and on the channel here's a fan 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.150
 bye bye
