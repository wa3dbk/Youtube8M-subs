00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.820 
the information I need with the charts
etc<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:56.070> chat<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:57.740> highlighting<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
etc and is a chat I was highlighting the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.740 
etc and is a chat I was highlighting the
fact<00:01:58.860> about<00:01:59.220> some<00:01:59.580> snow<00:01:59.820> possible<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.570> some

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
fact about some snow possible for some

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.440 
fact about some snow possible for some
some<00:02:01.470> areas<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.190> it<00:02:02.700> shows<00:02:02.970> that<00:02:03.149> there<00:02:03.299> could

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
some areas and it shows that there could

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.590 
some areas and it shows that there could
be<00:02:03.479> something<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:04.020> precipitation<00:02:04.560> about<00:02:05.039> and

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
be something to precipitation about and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.690 
be something to precipitation about and
across<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:07.259> land<00:02:07.560> areas<00:02:08.039> especially<00:02:08.280> in

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.850 
a town on the Bristol Channel area etc
and<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:18.569> main<00:02:18.720> focus<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.319> week<00:02:19.380> is

and the main focus this week is

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.350 
and the main focus this week is
definitely<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.760> strength<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.239> wind

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
definitely the strength of the wind

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.390 
definitely the strength of the wind
again<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.709> going<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.920> be<00:02:22.980> some<00:02:23.160> very

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
again and it's going to be some very

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.670 
again and it's going to be some very
very<00:02:23.640> strong<00:02:23.940> winds<00:02:24.120> about<00:02:24.420> em<00:02:24.780> tomorrow<00:02:25.260> and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
very strong winds about em tomorrow and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.500 
very strong winds about em tomorrow and
into<00:02:26.010> Wednesday<00:02:26.280> like<00:02:26.819> I<00:02:26.850> said<00:02:27.060> particular

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
into Wednesday like I said particular

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.900 
into Wednesday like I said particular
for<00:02:27.690> Scotland<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.100> loss<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.670> sword

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
for Scotland and the loss of a sword

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.140 
for Scotland and the loss of a sword
England<00:02:30.239> for<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.480> town<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.280> but<00:02:32.280> what<00:02:32.760> happens

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
England for a town and but what happens

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.410 
England for a town and but what happens
after<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.640> there's<00:02:35.640> still<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.940> lot<00:02:36.239> of

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
after this and there's still a lot of

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.840 
after this and there's still a lot of
debate<00:02:37.080> going<00:02:37.319> on<00:02:37.500> because<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:38.459> just<00:02:38.640> flick

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
debate going on because but just flick

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.840 
debate going on because but just flick
through<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.930> your<00:02:40.110> /<00:02:40.319> 850<00:02:41.220> and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
through this is your / 850 and

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.789 
through this is your / 850 and
temperatures<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.450> sea<00:02:42.630> level<00:02:42.900> pressure<00:02:42.930> so

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
temperatures and sea level pressure so

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.979 
temperatures and sea level pressure so
it<00:02:43.830> just<00:02:44.100> basically<00:02:44.280> tells<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.660> I'll

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
it just basically tells you the I'll

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.440 
it just basically tells you the I'll
call<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.470> areas<00:02:46.829> basically<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:48.030> if<00:02:48.299> I<00:02:48.420> just

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
call the areas basically so if I just

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.759 
call the areas basically so if I just
run<00:02:48.780> through<00:02:49.110> until<00:02:49.980> Wednesday<00:02:50.880> night<00:02:51.769> and

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
run through until Wednesday night and

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.069 
run through until Wednesday night and
into<00:02:52.920> Thursday<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.940> low<00:02:54.239> pressure<00:02:54.420> system<00:02:54.600> just

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
into Thursday a low pressure system just

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.710 
into Thursday a low pressure system just
at<00:02:55.350> some<00:02:55.590> over<00:02:55.860> where<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.370> with<00:02:56.579> it<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:57.660> a

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
at some over where and with it it's a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.410 
at some over where and with it it's a
noble<00:02:57.870> oppressive<00:02:58.410> system<00:02:58.910> now<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.120> one

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
noble oppressive system now this is one

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.940 
noble oppressive system now this is one
that<00:03:00.540> will<00:03:00.660> be<00:03:00.780> keeping<00:03:01.140> an<00:03:01.260> eye<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:01.380> because

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
that will be keeping an eye on because

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.250 
that will be keeping an eye on because
there's<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.220> lot<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.790> uncertainty<00:03:03.600> because<00:03:03.810> two

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
there's a lot of uncertainty because two

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.590 
there's a lot of uncertainty because two
or<00:03:04.320> three<00:03:04.530> days<00:03:04.680> ago<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.549> was<00:03:05.730> shown<00:03:05.910> adapt<00:03:06.329> or

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
or three days ago it was shown adapt or

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.680 
or three days ago it was shown adapt or
that<00:03:07.019> baudler<00:03:07.609> band<00:03:08.609> smack<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.299> United

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
that baudler band smack of the United

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.500 
that baudler band smack of the United
Kingdom<00:03:09.859> bring<00:03:10.859> with<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.100> storm<00:03:11.910> force<00:03:12.209> winds

Kingdom bring with it storm force winds

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.590 
Kingdom bring with it storm force winds
or<00:03:12.780> we<00:03:12.900> can<00:03:13.140> go<00:03:13.380> for<00:03:13.829> swim<00:03:13.980> honestly<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:15.120> was

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
or we can go for swim honestly it was

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.810 
or we can go for swim honestly it was
looking<00:03:15.959> very<00:03:16.230> very<00:03:16.530> bad<00:03:16.829> but<00:03:17.489> over<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> past

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
looking very very bad but over the past

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.650 
looking very very bad but over the past
18<00:03:18.690> hours<00:03:18.870> it's<00:03:19.470> changed<00:03:20.370> very<00:03:20.940> rapidly<00:03:21.390> and

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
18 hours it's changed very rapidly and

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.979 
18 hours it's changed very rapidly and
the<00:03:21.799> focus<00:03:22.799> now<00:03:23.100> on<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:24.180> current<00:03:24.420> models<00:03:24.690> is

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
the focus now on the current models is

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.539 
the focus now on the current models is
for<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.410> low<00:03:25.560> pressure<00:03:25.739> system<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.310> track

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
for the low pressure system to track

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.060 
for the low pressure system to track

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
Friday but if I just run along now can

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.570 
Friday but if I just run along now can
see<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.940> low-pressure<00:03:36.180> system<00:03:36.690> here

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
see the low-pressure system here

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.630
