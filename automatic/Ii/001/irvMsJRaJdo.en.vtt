it's<00:03:46.570> a<00:03:46.840> simplistic<00:03:47.800> design<00:03:48.040> but<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.150> works

it's a simplistic design but it works

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
well one downside of the pooja is the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.330 
well one downside of the pooja is the
lack<00:03:54.460> of<00:03:54.900> cupholders<00:03:55.900> there<00:03:56.620> are<00:03:56.740> two<00:03:56.980> here<00:03:57.220> in

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
lack of cupholders there are two here in

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.390 
lack of cupholders there are two here in
the<00:03:57.370> center<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:57.970> really<00:03:58.030> are<00:03:58.980> too<00:03:59.980> small<00:04:00.340> to

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
the center that really are too small to

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.670 
the center that really are too small to
hold<00:04:00.910> any<00:04:01.300> of<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.540> six<00:04:01.750> hundred<00:04:01.990> mil<00:04:02.170> bottles

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
hold any of the six hundred mil bottles

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.440 
hold any of the six hundred mil bottles
of<00:04:02.800> water<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.520> we<00:04:03.610> have<00:04:03.640> in<00:04:03.850> Australia<00:04:03.940> and

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
of water that we have in Australia and

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.530 
of water that we have in Australia and
there's<00:04:05.350> nothing<00:04:05.890> in<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.040> doors<00:04:06.310> so<00:04:07.210> really

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
there's nothing in the doors so really

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.230 
there's nothing in the doors so really
there's<00:04:07.750> nowhere<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.290> we<00:04:08.620> can<00:04:08.770> put<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.250> bottle

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
there's nowhere that we can put a bottle

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.260 
there's nowhere that we can put a bottle
or<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.750> cup<00:04:10.990> of<00:04:11.080> coffee<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.610> small<00:04:12.610> takeaway<00:04:13.030> cup

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
or a cup of coffee a small takeaway cup

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.850 
or a cup of coffee a small takeaway cup
will<00:04:13.420> sit<00:04:13.600> there<00:04:13.780> but<00:04:14.170> that's<00:04:14.350> about<00:04:14.620> it

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
will sit there but that's about it

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.610 
will sit there but that's about it
so<00:04:15.850> that<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.120> a<00:04:16.150> downside<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.050> it's<00:04:17.440> probably

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
so that is a downside and it's probably

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.930 
so that is a downside and it's probably
something<00:04:17.980> that<00:04:18.130> they<00:04:18.340> shouldn't<00:04:18.580> look<00:04:18.730> at<00:04:18.910> I

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
something that they shouldn't look at I

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.930 
something that they shouldn't look at I
think<00:04:19.239> so<00:04:20.050> like<00:04:20.230> navigation<00:04:20.980> system<00:04:21.520> will<00:04:21.760> pop

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
think so like navigation system will pop

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.640 
think so like navigation system will pop
up<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.210> down<00:04:22.390> when<00:04:22.570> you<00:04:22.660> turn<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.080> engine<00:04:23.440> on

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
up and down when you turn the engine on

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.400 
up and down when you turn the engine on
and<00:04:23.980> off<00:04:24.330> it's<00:04:25.500> quite<00:04:26.500> visual<00:04:26.920> works<00:04:27.370> well

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
and off it's quite visual works well

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.070 
and off it's quite visual works well
quite<00:04:29.410> intuitive<00:04:29.890> to<00:04:30.040> use<00:04:30.780> so<00:04:31.780> that's<00:04:31.930> a

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
quite intuitive to use so that's a

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.330 
quite intuitive to use so that's a
worthwhile<00:04:32.260> option<00:04:32.830> as<00:04:32.950> well

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
worthwhile option as well

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.690 
worthwhile option as well
one<00:04:34.150> advantage<00:04:34.420> with<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.860> parking<00:04:36.280> sensors

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
one advantage with the parking sensors

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.340 
one advantage with the parking sensors
and<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:36.910> sublight<00:04:37.180> navigation<00:04:37.750> screen<00:04:37.990> there

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
and the sublight navigation screen there

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.190 
and the sublight navigation screen there
is<00:04:38.980> that<00:04:39.340> as<00:04:39.790> you're<00:04:40.150> reversing<00:04:40.720> any<00:04:40.960> getting

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
is that as you're reversing any getting

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.620 
is that as you're reversing any getting
closer<00:04:41.440> to<00:04:41.650> something<00:04:41.980> it<00:04:42.970> will<00:04:43.120> tell<00:04:43.420> you

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
closer to something it will tell you

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.240 
closer to something it will tell you
when<00:04:44.470> you're<00:04:44.560> getting<00:04:44.710> closer<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:47.100> you<00:04:48.100> can

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
when you're getting closer to it you can

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.340 
when you're getting closer to it you can
hear<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:48.520> beeping<00:04:48.730> and<00:04:49.270> then<00:04:49.990> as<00:04:50.140> you<00:04:50.230> get

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
hear it beeping and then as you get

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.590 
hear it beeping and then as you get
closer<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.770> closer<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.520> visual<00:04:52.150> as<00:04:52.360> well<00:04:52.390> as

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
closer and closer the visual as well as

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.760 
closer and closer the visual as well as
audio<00:04:52.750> tells<00:04:53.440> you<00:04:54.750> that<00:04:55.750> that's<00:04:55.930> probably

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
audio tells you that that's probably

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.220 
audio tells you that that's probably
about<00:04:56.950> far<00:04:57.370> enough<00:04:57.640> to<00:04:57.790> go<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:58.900> it<00:04:59.020> comes<00:04:59.170> up

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
about far enough to go and it comes up

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.410 
about far enough to go and it comes up
with<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.410> warning<00:04:59.770> sign<00:04:59.980> and<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:01.000> continuous

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
with a warning sign and it continuous

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.960 
with a warning sign and it continuous
beep<00:05:01.630> that<00:05:01.840> is<00:05:01.870> really<00:05:02.680> annoying<00:05:02.920> but<00:05:03.280> works

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
beep that is really annoying but works

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.210 
beep that is really annoying but works
well<00:05:04.120> because<00:05:04.450> it<00:05:04.770> alerts<00:05:05.770> you<00:05:05.980> to<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.130> fact

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
well because it alerts you to the fact

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.520 
well because it alerts you to the fact
that<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:06.670> are<00:05:06.700> too<00:05:07.030> close
