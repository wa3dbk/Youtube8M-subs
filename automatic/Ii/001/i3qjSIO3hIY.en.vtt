00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.600
 but we have the phone with us 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.930
 very welcome guest that you leave the honor 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.950
 to present watch when he is 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.770
 returned to Naples 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.350
 I thought you should never leave 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.660
 plus the blue shirt and today I do 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.129
 it's up to you to tell how the news is for 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.260
 me very sad 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.040
 paolo cannavaro is no longer a soccer player 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.440
 some of Naples at least for the moment 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.760
 less paolo good evening good evening a 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.760
 all of raffaele aroused precise of 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.969
 napoli good evening leaves naples unfortunately 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.770
 reluctantly my wish was that 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:05.840
 to end the possibility here but go 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.039
 ahead and I remain proud anyway 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.770
 when you say I was not given the 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:13.979
 possibility that with teeth all that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.250
 then it happened despite being placed 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.979
 so much time on the bench anyway you wanted 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.210
 stay with the blue shirt on 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.229
 you work in these months I have been in 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.840
 silence 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.880
 I could say many things but I didn't 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.369
 it was because I've always been 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.200
 milano with professional I accepted 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.270
 all there was to accept in 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.670
 silent manner I have always worked on 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.500
 what maybe I should do 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.090
 I have always given the example my companions 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.340
 they always followed me all that 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.250
 but I did then there are moments that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.630
 one has to look at something else and I believe 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.220
 that right now for me too 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.000
 go play a little i think the thing 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.960
 best that makes me good for me 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.850
 fundamental that the guy is a 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.340
 footballer you need to express yourself 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.710
 but you don't for one who has anyway 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.690
 made 40 games making 40 games 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.780
 the average year to bring up the theme 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.940
 to still have different game rhythms 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.500
 different has an age that you can anyway 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.600
 affect my career ending 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.190
 I believe that the best choice has it 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.170
 done together with the company choice is 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.600
 was to still give me the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.920
 chance to play then then you will see 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.750
 you know that I speak often with his 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.030
 prosecutor we are friends as well as 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.850
 it is you and me and it was also the 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.500
 advice that I have given you that Naples 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.540
 think to keep it so still in napa li 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.350
 na it is right that I go to play though 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.240
 all to 18 October when they took over 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.300
 for the accident of britos 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.780
 if I am not wrong yes to Rome, Naples will not 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.890
 is more set foot in the field than one 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.780
 explanation that they have since you 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.900
 I speak of silence I also meant this 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.520
 it's just a fact that coincides with 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.950
 that game but don't lose that one 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.460
 game for something conditioned 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.590
 within the choices or 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.170
 inside society I believe it was 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.670
 just an unlucky match for episodes 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.650
 but unfortunately for a bad day for 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.540
 me but as a place as it happens for 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.580
 all other players allow by 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.230
 that day line but nothing 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.230
 behind the exclusion 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.630
 I believe that whites anyway 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.120
 of the other because otherwise also a 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:36.330
 useful because you did n't have to go back to 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:39.220
 play because it's my idea they are 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.620
 everyone has his idea but the most thing 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.680
 important that today take advantage only 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.300
 to greet and thank for everything 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.010
 what I was given the 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.750
 possibility that was given to me 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.989
 I believe today is right where seven years 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.700
 and a half to make thanks and how 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.350
 I told someone I don't want tears 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.000
 but I just want to see why they have been 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.090
 these fantastic years and a half for me 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.790
 which gave me great joy 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.560
 since then you can understand why 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.920
 tears there have been sockets has 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.470
 called some team mate e 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.900
 own morning bell area are 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.260
 went to the camp this morning comrades who 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.900
 wrote 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.229
 their solidarity and trying to 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.449
 convince me not to leave 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.340
 that was a victory for me 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.790
 are those measures that others do not 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.880
 they see but they make you proud 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.940
 see or leave him crying more 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.090
 high that finally warehousemen are 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.070
 gestures you never forget you have 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.160
 left a wish , boys said 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.500
 win this for me 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.389
 they know they had the first one 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.060
 widespread team today have it far away 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.280
 but they have all my trust and all 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.050
 my esteem because they are men before 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.669
 all exceptional and then they are great 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.190
 players naples has all the cards in 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.860
 rule to return immediately to the first 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.510
 places and to play as protagonists 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.199
 two competitions we didn't do up 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.570
 now and and try to win a trophy e 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.400
 try to catch this juve that 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.419
 unfortunately for us and unfortunately for the 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.940
 others are at the speed of this mica 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.800
 we will only see the real cane but a 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.130
 pebble we have a canevaro that goes 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.500
 in the field the desire to play then the 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.260
 football is not an exact science 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.900
 I go however the motivation someone can 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.539
 think alone but because it is stale and 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.400
 today I can say that the table is is the 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.860
 company that strongly believed that 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.280
 he wants to remember that he has a project 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.810
 clear if you think of the early years of 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.400
 I look at the first years of Parma and then 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.039
 they are schools that have made history 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.560
 this is common in football years 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:52.970
 company clear ideas focus on me 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.620
 because I wrote something about us 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.990
 important to them but maybe they can 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.849
 looking normal for someone else is a 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.770
 project that gave me to marry I hope 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.840
 to have made the right choice 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.139
 will the time fall a moment 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.860
 a gentleman to say it will be called well 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:15.199
 of also not there and denny is yours and died 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:17.530
 count can not say something to the 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:23.330
 so many fans who are listening to you 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:25.400
 look, I take this opportunity to cause thanks 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.380
 thanks to those close to me 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.169
 thanks to those even in moments of 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.430
 criticisms have tried to detach me but 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.740
 they didn't understand that they gave me one 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.020
 big hand and an extra stimulus to do 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.450
 good to make me even more serious than me 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.479
 so those who adored me was 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:44.349
 a mix of emotions of games pensions 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:46.969
 that I will carry forever inside me and 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:49.010
 really leaves Naples with a smile 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:50.800
 on the lips because I want it to be so 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.300
 because it is for love 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.690

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:59.779

 fault napoli paolo cannavaro
