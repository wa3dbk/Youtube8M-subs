the first step of falling forward is

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.160 
the first step of falling forward is
easy<00:01:12.190> but<00:01:13.060> stringing<00:01:13.479> it<00:01:13.540> together<00:01:13.840> can<00:01:14.049> be<00:01:14.140> a

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
easy but stringing it together can be a

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.600 
easy but stringing it together can be a
little<00:01:14.350> difficult<00:01:14.619> because<00:01:15.010> people's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
little difficult because people's

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.930 
little difficult because people's
inclination<00:01:16.090> is<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:17.040> walk<00:01:18.040> up<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.400> hill<00:01:18.430> and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
inclination is to walk up the hill and

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.710 
inclination is to walk up the hill and
land<00:01:19.720> on<00:01:20.049> their<00:01:20.229> heel<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:21.549> that<00:01:21.580> as<00:01:22.299> opposed

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
land on their heel like that as opposed

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.660 
land on their heel like that as opposed
to<00:01:22.869> that<00:01:23.200> when<00:01:23.799> you're<00:01:23.950> when<00:01:24.220> you<00:01:24.310> begin<00:01:24.520> to

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
to that when you're when you begin to

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.700 
to that when you're when you begin to
string<00:01:24.909> it<00:01:24.970> all<00:01:25.090> together<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.690> few<00:01:26.380> pointers

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
string it all together a few pointers

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.889 
string it all together a few pointers
are<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.100> just<00:01:27.250> take<00:01:27.460> small<00:01:27.610> strides<00:01:28.119> at<00:01:28.750> the

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
are to just take small strides at the

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.020 
are to just take small strides at the
start<00:01:29.140> just<00:01:29.380> like<00:01:32.640> after<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:33.880> get

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
start just like after you get

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.760 
start just like after you get
comfortable<00:01:34.360> with<00:01:34.540> taking<00:01:34.960> small<00:01:35.229> steps<00:01:35.350> you

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
comfortable with taking small steps you

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.920 
comfortable with taking small steps you
can<00:01:36.250> begin<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.759> extend<00:01:36.970> your<00:01:37.270> stride<00:01:37.570> farther

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
can begin to extend your stride farther

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.969 
can begin to extend your stride farther
back<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.899> get<00:01:44.020> more<00:01:44.170> advanced<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.560> should

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
back as you get more advanced you should

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.639 
back as you get more advanced you should
add<00:01:45.130> in<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.399> bit<00:01:45.550> of<00:01:45.580> a<00:01:45.840> preload<00:01:46.840> like<00:01:47.229> that<00:01:47.440> a

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
add in a bit of a preload like that a

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.700 
add in a bit of a preload like that a
little<00:01:47.950> spring<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.640> your<00:01:48.670> step<00:01:48.759> so<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:50.320> final

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
little spring to your step so the final

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.999 
little spring to your step so the final
product<00:01:50.890> should<00:01:51.190> look<00:01:51.250> something<00:01:51.670> like<00:01:51.700> this

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.580 

imagine<00:01:57.009> your<00:01:57.130> preload<00:01:57.580> as<00:01:58.050> being<00:01:59.050> a<00:01:59.200> little

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
imagine your preload as being a little

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.919 
imagine your preload as being a little
tiny<00:01:59.890> jump<00:02:00.369> you<00:02:00.700> just<00:02:00.850> want<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.060> hop<00:02:01.600> down<00:02:01.630> and

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
tiny jump you just want to hop down and

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.080 
tiny jump you just want to hop down and
then<00:02:02.020> spring<00:02:02.409> up<00:02:02.530> like<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:02.800> to<00:02:03.700> work<00:02:03.850> on<00:02:04.000> your

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
then spring up like that to work on your

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.090 
then spring up like that to work on your
preload<00:02:04.509> in<00:02:04.720> ski<00:02:05.140> walking<00:02:05.500> it's<00:02:05.679> a<00:02:05.800> great<00:02:05.979> idea

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
preload in ski walking it's a great idea

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.759 
preload in ski walking it's a great idea
to<00:02:06.250> practice<00:02:06.759> ski<00:02:06.970> bounding<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:08.380> ski<00:02:08.560> bound

you're<00:02:09.220> just<00:02:09.399> going<00:02:09.519> to<00:02:09.550> add<00:02:09.759> in<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:10.090> bit<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.360> a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
you're just going to add in a bit of a

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.390 
you're just going to add in a bit of a
jump<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:11.170> your<00:02:11.260> ski<00:02:11.500> walking<00:02:11.830> stride<00:02:12.100> like

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
jump to your ski walking stride like

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.449 
jump to your ski walking stride like
this

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.619 

once<00:02:18.459> you're<00:02:18.610> comfortable<00:02:19.030> with<00:02:19.180> ski<00:02:19.420> bound

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
once you're comfortable with ski bound

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.119 
once you're comfortable with ski bound
in<00:02:19.810> like<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.650> could<00:02:20.800> actually<00:02:20.920> just

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
in like that you could actually just

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.309 
in like that you could actually just
tone<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.580> back<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.730> bit<00:02:21.879> bring<00:02:22.269> it<00:02:22.360> into<00:02:22.540> ski

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
tone it back a bit bring it into ski

tone it back a bit bring it into ski
walking<00:02:23.709> again<00:02:24.010> but<00:02:24.730> maintain<00:02:25.239> that<00:02:25.480> preload

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
walking again but maintain that preload

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:36.210 
walking again but maintain that preload
that<00:02:26.379> is<00:02:26.739> necessary<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.340> bound<00:02:34.950> most<00:02:35.950> people

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
that is necessary to bound most people

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.309 
that is necessary to bound most people
find<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.489> relatively<00:02:36.849> easy<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.480> ski<00:02:37.720> stride<00:02:38.019> up

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
find it relatively easy to ski stride up

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.530 
find it relatively easy to ski stride up
the<00:02:38.440> hill<00:02:38.650> just<00:02:38.860> using<00:02:39.220> their<00:02:39.340> legs<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:40.330> gets<00:02:40.480> a

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
the hill just using their legs it gets a

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.910 
the hill just using their legs it gets a
little<00:02:40.629> more<00:02:40.810> complicated<00:02:41.170> when<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.680> want<00:02:41.860> to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
little more complicated when you want to

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.339 
little more complicated when you want to
add<00:02:42.069> in<00:02:42.250> your<00:02:42.370> arms<00:02:42.700> basically<00:02:43.540> each<00:02:44.019> one<00:02:44.200> have

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
add in your arms basically each one have

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.740 
add in your arms basically each one have
your<00:02:44.440> arms<00:02:44.650> relaxed<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.220> let<00:02:45.370> them<00:02:45.750> flow

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
your arms relaxed and let them flow

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.370 
your arms relaxed and let them flow
naturally

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.750 

the<00:02:52.470> first<00:02:52.710> thing<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:52.950> do<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.460> hold<00:02:53.610> your

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
the first thing to do is to hold your

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.920 
the first thing to do is to hold your
poles<00:02:54.030> mid-shaft<00:02:54.510> like<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.260> just

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
poles mid-shaft like this and just

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.330 
poles mid-shaft like this and just
stride<00:02:57.930> up<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.260> hill

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
stride up the hill

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.960 
stride up the hill
moving<00:02:59.940> your<00:03:00.000> hands<00:03:00.390> like<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:05.670> ideal

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
moving your hands like that the ideal

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.970 
moving your hands like that the ideal
position<00:03:06.150> for<00:03:06.450> your<00:03:06.660> poles<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.050> be<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.650> to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
position for your poles to be in is to

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.540 
position for your poles to be in is to
be<00:03:08.780> right<00:03:09.780> here<00:03:10.080> add<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.440> boat<00:03:10.770> shoulder<00:03:11.370> height

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
be right here add a boat shoulder height

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.570 
be right here add a boat shoulder height
like<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:12.170> because<00:03:13.170> you're<00:03:13.320> on<00:03:13.470> grass<00:03:14.280> and

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
like that because you're on grass and

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.670 
like that because you're on grass and
not<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.850> snow<00:03:15.090> you're<00:03:15.690> not<00:03:15.870> going<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.140> push<00:03:16.470> as

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
not on snow you're not going to push as

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.220 
not on snow you're not going to push as
far<00:03:16.710> back<00:03:17.070> as<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.730> naturally<00:03:18.120> would<00:03:18.330> when

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
far back as you naturally would when

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.870 
far back as you naturally would when
you're<00:03:19.320> gliding<00:03:19.740> on<00:03:19.830> skis<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.730> you're<00:03:20.820> just

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
you're gliding on skis so you're just

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.960 
you're gliding on skis so you're just
going<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.090> keep<00:03:21.330> your<00:03:21.480> arms<00:03:22.020> in<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.440> position

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
going to keep your arms in this position

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:30.199 
going to keep your arms in this position
instead

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.479 

when<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:30.870> ski<00:03:31.079> baton<00:03:31.409> in<00:03:31.500> your<00:03:31.590> poles<00:03:31.859> can

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
when you ski baton in your poles can

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.490 
when you ski baton in your poles can
take<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.730> bit<00:03:32.969> of<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.120> longer<00:03:33.329> stride<00:03:33.810> because

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
take a bit of a longer stride because

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.229 
take a bit of a longer stride because
you're<00:03:34.829> in<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.040> air<00:03:35.159> you<00:03:35.310> can<00:03:35.459> push<00:03:35.670> back<00:03:35.939> more

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
you're in the air you can push back more

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.289 
you're in the air you can push back more
like<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:38.340> can<00:03:38.370> end<00:03:38.790> up<00:03:38.909> starting

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
like that so you can end up starting

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.599 
like that so you can end up starting
from<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.689> same<00:03:39.810> position<00:03:40.040> push<00:03:41.040> farther<00:03:41.280> back

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
from the same position push farther back

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:48.869 
from the same position push farther back
when<00:03:42.390> your<00:03:42.540> ski<00:03:42.750> bounding

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.070 

I'm<00:03:49.879> gonna<00:03:50.060> wrap<00:03:50.239> this<00:03:50.330> video<00:03:50.480> up<00:03:50.659> with<00:03:50.900> some

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
I'm gonna wrap this video up with some

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.990 
I'm gonna wrap this video up with some
