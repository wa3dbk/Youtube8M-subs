anymore you know the population is went
from<00:00:44.380> about<00:00:44.500> eight<00:00:44.770> to<00:00:44.980> twelve<00:00:45.250> percent<00:00:45.640> of

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
from about eight to twelve percent of

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
clinic to geriatric so over 20 years of

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.350 
clinic to geriatric so over 20 years of
age<00:00:50.650> so<00:00:50.950> it's<00:00:51.370> getting<00:00:51.670> older<00:00:51.970> and<00:00:52.030> older<00:00:52.150> and

age so it's getting older and older and

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.000 
age so it's getting older and older and
that<00:00:52.630> is<00:00:52.840> because<00:00:53.350> of<00:00:53.910> nutrition<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:56.010> medical

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
that is because of nutrition and medical

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.590 
that is because of nutrition and medical
services<00:00:57.490> that<00:00:57.700> we're<00:00:57.850> doing<00:00:58.000> for<00:00:58.420> these

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
services that we're doing for these

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.150 
services that we're doing for these
animals<00:00:58.810> to<00:00:59.110> get<00:00:59.440> them<00:00:59.530> so<00:00:59.680> they<00:00:59.800> live<00:01:00.130> a

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
animals to get them so they live a

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.540 
animals to get them so they live a
longer<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:00.970> more<00:01:01.120> healthy<00:01:01.630> life<00:01:02.320> so<00:01:02.710> there

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
longer and more healthy life so there

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.060 
longer and more healthy life so there
was<00:01:03.700> a<00:01:03.730> horse<00:01:04.119> in<00:01:04.330> Kansas<00:01:04.660> City<00:01:04.780> over<00:01:05.199> 40<00:01:05.890> years

to kind of keep track of arthritis and
those<00:01:49.030> things<00:01:49.300> as<00:01:49.510> they<00:01:49.690> do<00:01:49.750> get<00:01:49.930> older<00:01:50.260> but<00:01:50.440> a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
those things as they do get older but a

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.500 
those things as they do get older but a
lot<00:01:51.159> of<00:01:51.190> times<00:01:51.430> if<00:01:51.580> you<00:01:51.700> can<00:01:51.850> maintain<00:01:52.000> them

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
lot of times if you can maintain them

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.350 
lot of times if you can maintain them
just<00:01:52.870> based<00:01:53.080> on<00:01:53.229> health<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:54.150> keeping<00:01:55.150> them<00:01:55.210> so

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
just based on health and keeping them so

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.640 
just based on health and keeping them so
they're<00:01:55.479> not<00:01:55.570> lanes<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.020> that's<00:01:56.200> that's<00:01:56.470> a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
they're not lanes and that's that's a

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.469 
they're not lanes and that's that's a
big<00:01:56.799> part<00:01:57.010> you<00:01:57.549> can<00:01:57.729> keep<00:01:57.850> going<00:01:58.090> with<00:01:58.360> them

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
big part you can keep going with them

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.020 
big part you can keep going with them
and<00:01:58.570> I<00:01:58.600> think<00:01:58.690> horses<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.920> lot<00:02:00.040> of<00:02:00.640> just<00:02:00.880> like

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
and I think horses a lot of just like

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.270 
and I think horses a lot of just like
people<00:02:01.270> they'll<00:02:01.630> enjoy<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.290> keep<00:02:02.740> going<00:02:03.159> and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
people they'll enjoy to keep going and

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.890 
people they'll enjoy to keep going and
not<00:02:03.430> just<00:02:03.640> sit<00:02:03.850> out<00:02:03.970> somewhere<00:02:04.450> in<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.659> pasture

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
not just sit out somewhere in a pasture

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.750 
not just sit out somewhere in a pasture
but<00:02:05.799> they<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.280> know<00:02:06.400> there's<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.640> lot<00:02:06.729> of

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
but they you know there's a lot of

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.730 
but they you know there's a lot of
horses<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.210> actually<00:02:07.540> enjoy<00:02:07.960> going<00:02:08.229> out<00:02:08.409> and

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
horses that actually enjoy going out and

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:17.610 
horses that actually enjoy going out and
performing<00:02:09.280> too

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.680
