no<00:04:06.639> reason<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.239> imagine<00:04:07.780> it's<00:04:07.870> because<00:04:08.139> it<00:04:08.260> is<00:04:08.380> a

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
no reason I imagine it's because it is a

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.150 
no reason I imagine it's because it is a
very<00:04:08.650> difficult<00:04:08.859> candy<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.549> make<00:04:11.160> considering

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
very difficult candy to make considering

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.580 
very difficult candy to make considering
you<00:04:12.730> have<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.120> make<00:04:13.630> you<00:04:13.840> have<00:04:14.019> some<00:04:14.230> chocolate

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
you have to make you have some chocolate

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.800 
you have to make you have some chocolate
and<00:04:14.680> stick<00:04:15.099> candy<00:04:15.400> in<00:04:15.549> it<00:04:15.639> you<00:04:16.239> know<00:04:16.389> melt<00:04:16.720> it

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
and stick candy in it you know melt it

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.920 
and stick candy in it you know melt it
together<00:04:17.370> but<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.639> mean<00:04:20.219> it's<00:04:21.219> a<00:04:21.760> very<00:04:22.240> poor

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
together but I mean it's a very poor

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.420 
together but I mean it's a very poor
decision<00:04:23.320> on<00:04:23.380> their<00:04:23.590> part<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.890> stop<00:04:24.130> making

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
decision on their part to stop making

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.230 
decision on their part to stop making
these

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
these

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.379 
these
that's<00:04:26.020> only<00:04:26.710> that<00:04:26.949> guess<00:04:27.100> it<00:04:28.060> could<00:04:28.270> have

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
that's only that guess it could have

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.170 
that's only that guess it could have
been<00:04:28.509> some<00:04:28.870> sort<00:04:29.050> of<00:04:29.259> ploy<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.910> get<00:04:30.910> them<00:04:31.060> to

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
been some sort of ploy to get them to

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.050 
been some sort of ploy to get them to
come<00:04:31.360> back<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:31.930> make<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.050> profit<00:04:32.530> I<00:04:32.680> don't<00:04:32.919> know

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
come back and make a profit I don't know
