when<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.210> look<00:00:36.420> inside<00:00:45.020> it's<00:00:46.020> actually

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
when if you look inside it's actually

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.750 
when if you look inside it's actually
very<00:00:46.860> very<00:00:47.010> gray<00:00:48.410> but<00:00:49.410> don't<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.219> alarmed<00:00:50.399> by

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
very very gray but don't be alarmed by

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:02.450 
very very gray but don't be alarmed by
that<00:00:50.969> because<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.680> my<00:00:53.520> model<00:00:53.969> for<00:01:01.460> here's

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
that because I have my model for here's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.030 
that because I have my model for here's
model<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.680> although<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.129> grey<00:01:06.799> it<00:01:07.799> does

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
model so although it is grey it does

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
model so although it is grey it does
actually<00:01:08.580> dry<00:01:09.439> white<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> can

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
actually dry white and then you can

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.770 
actually dry white and then you can
paint<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.810> acrylic<00:01:12.869> paints

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.460 

so<00:01:17.780> sometimes<00:01:18.410> dusk<00:01:18.860> lay<00:01:19.190> yes<00:01:20.350> prepare<00:01:21.350> to

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
so sometimes dusk lay yes prepare to

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.500 
so sometimes dusk lay yes prepare to
fire<00:01:21.800> and<00:01:22.310> scalping<00:01:22.940> all<00:01:23.780> plays<00:01:24.020> by<00:01:24.440> that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
fire and scalping all plays by that

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.760 
fire and scalping all plays by that
which<00:01:26.510> I<00:01:26.630> understand<00:01:26.960> why<00:01:27.170> because<00:01:27.530> it's<00:01:27.710> a

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
which I understand why because it's a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.410 
which I understand why because it's a
modeling<00:01:28.160> play<00:01:28.370> but<00:01:28.970> I<00:01:29.030> don't<00:01:29.210> think<00:01:29.300> it

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
modeling play but I don't think it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.490 
modeling play but I don't think it
should<00:01:29.600> because<00:01:30.020> it's<00:01:30.920> totally<00:01:31.100> different

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
should because it's totally different

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.590 
should because it's totally different
now<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:33.650> is<00:01:33.800> kind<00:01:34.010> of<00:01:34.130> like<00:01:34.930> soft<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.470> smooth

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
now this is kind of like soft and smooth

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.250 
now this is kind of like soft and smooth
feels<00:01:38.600> quite<00:01:38.750> nice<00:01:40.750> so<00:01:41.750> I'm<00:01:41.870> going<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.110> get

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
feels quite nice so I'm going to get
