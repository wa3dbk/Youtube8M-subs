00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:11.210
 long shorter 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.870
 write and explain think done the best 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.210
 video 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:21.249
 for you to see here is my fee from 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:27.439
 tidy 200 accurate audi 200 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:34.250
 my tidy is cracked here 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:37.330
 payment in general, like here I tried to pay 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.230
 to understand you still did not return 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:44.060
 shit worked but lights then sensors 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.750
 I do not know and did not understand men 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.480
 matter in some kind of resistor controllers 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:57.970
 fren bonds 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:57.970
 in short, I bought a tidy too 200 exactly 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:11.710
 for 200 hryvnia dude fit them but she 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:16.369
 completely different first of all she goes with y 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.009
 me here is a computer here well then 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.829
 there is a computer and a crane on which 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.780
 errors are shown all errors are fuel 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:33.490
 ended omyvayka you crash 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:36.679
 and here are four light bulbs there is a sign! 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.639
 something else the battery is not rechargeable 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:47.240
 no matter in general I have a computer here 

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:51.320
 here was 4 of him here we will solder here 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.659
 solder and plus 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:03.229
 By the way about Chernysh in general, come and pay 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:06.590
 Printed under different modifications I mean 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.590
 it's all about jumpers and I don't know these 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.660
 as they are called i am not an electrician 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:17.209
 cooler than this all the kegs well, in general here a 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.330
 I thought it would be very easy and simple 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.120
 it all is plug in one and 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:28.220
 I looked at all these we will call 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:35.390
 their transistor resistors of different colors 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:38.300
 I mean, I donâ€™t know the resistance 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:43.489
 They Are there different Th plus there's the 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:48.700
 Here is the spider processor or sho I do not know 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:53.780
 in short they are with these different numbers 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:57.019
 Tobish they, too, different jumpers here 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.260
 let's say here is the place two jumpers on this 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:04.250
 tidy 1 I mean I'll sing my jumper 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.180
 and put here here I already soldered 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.100
 I had this keg here too 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.150
 he was not there 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.909
 jumper 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.500
 the volume somehow here didn't stand there not 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:20.260
 it was that is soldered 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:25.030
 and this is so here I sit here quietly 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:28.340
 expensive quote I do not know what time 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.810
 sleep yet do not want to sit sing 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:37.030
 I think that something will come out of it if not 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.030
 I will go out without an instrument
