00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.820
 hello ladies and gentlemen here he is 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.860
 again your killerbande nrd as always 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.289
 with hot news about the topic 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.730
 black Ops 2 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.760
 today we take a look at the 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.470
 City machines are all enumerated 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.910
 would there be the mp 7 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:33.220
 the ptb 750 the vector k10 the ms mmc 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.830
 the com c coupe and scorpion i want where 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.380
 we start with the mp 7 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:42.480
 the mp 7 should as in all previous ones 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.520
 also share in which they came before the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.380
 allrounder weapon par excellence 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.150
 search engines are all its bit 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.730
 curious about how she compares 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.520
 to the new weapons that come from 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.260
 the cities it is more in the middle 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.210
 area part of us in the upper middle 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.480
 area if we look at the mobility 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:05.109
 Since she has 16 out of 20 customers in the 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.770
 damage twelve and twenty of the range 

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:10.450
 10 and in the accuracy 18 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.539
 I'm curious how she will go beating 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.890
 all the new weapons and we will 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:19.149
 see how we can play with it 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.179
 Next, let's look at pbb 57 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.659
 this seems to me the ponton to the p90 too 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.999
 We can already be from Monaco 3 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.119
 It has the highest magazine capacity 

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:33.009
 among all in the gravel and also one 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.600
 increased range and if we look 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.700
 whole looking at the statesman 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.229
 Of course she has 16 points here again 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.509
 out of 20 in mobility as well as every smg 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.569
 when damaged, it is 13 points 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.969
 as well as at range and 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.420
 accuracy and that's what it has in the 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.729
 did 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.920
 at least as far as the stats are concerned 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.960
 highest range among the sms 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.670
 I am very curious if this is a result 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.319
 favorite is in the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.259
 hardcore mode often stops at the 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.409
 reach we are very 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.880
 curious if they can prevail there 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.920
 Next, let's look at the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.869
 vector k10 a little closer 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.770
 I am very happy with the vector k10 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.110
 looking forward to it you have a back 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.520
 shock reduction built-in that is 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.280
 Men say the weapon does not have that much 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.300
 Residue other weapons from the 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.530
 mobility ago 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.110
 one has the same score as 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.120
 all others also with 16 of the damage 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.130
 just now has just ten 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.680
 points and the range just 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.330
 nine points I'm curious if this 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.310
 recoil reduction of make up for 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.740
 can 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.960
 and the accuracy is very important to him 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.310
 good measure with twelve points is so 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.790
 the second highest weapon at the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.720
 Accuracy next to the pcb 750 and the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.670
 sm smc coming soon the ms mmc love 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.500
 friends is my personal favorite 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.870
 at least if we now from ins 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.310
 net out because clearly the mobility 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.690
 at 16 , all of us have now 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.990
 branded in the heads I will 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.550
 Do not repeat that again 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.010
 range here has a total of twelve points 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.230
 and it even damages a whole 14 points 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.960
 get and I think that as 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.180
 hardcore so disturbing our hardcore 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.650
 player of course very interesting ever 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.360
 higher the reach and the higher the 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.320
 hurt the better you grab it 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.209
 times a smg against a storm rifle 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.310
 and the accuracy is 13 points 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.459
 thus also in the top category at the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.770
 sms I'm curious how to play 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.540
 next we will have the idea 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.459
 come for example in the program 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.030
 and that's an interesting one 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.640
 alternative his citizen strategy that 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.830
 means the controls three shot as soon as you 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.510
 pressed the trigger and did however 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.459
 also a very high bike and 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.560
 really ricker several times into each other too 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.650
 can operate nicely and then always 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.510
 very purposeful brush place of the 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.030
 reach and harm is here 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.090
 but pretty far down and that 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.680
 at nine points each for the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.020
 accuracy, she has a total of eleven points 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.700
 but get missed by the 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.470
 burst are you also important 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.300
 more precisely and the three shots arrive 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.060
 you do not waste so much and me 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.950
 think she does not have a great repulsion 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.480
 at least if you have brushed you 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.970
 Generally not that big 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.760
 recoil and here I am again very much 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.700
 wondering how she was playful and 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.010
 if she can prevail 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.830
 the last weapon in this category is 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.810
 the scorpions the sg level shines with 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.530
 highest rate of fire throughout 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.479
 However, class has in return 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.210
 very little harm very little 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.460
 reach and very little accuracy 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.060
 we have damage from eighth reach 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.490
 from 6 an accuracy of 7 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.909
 whether fire rate, the highest up for it 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.500
 I dare to do all this personally 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.689
 to doubt I think that if one 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.009
 can also be the most unpopular 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.590
 that I can be wrong too 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.659
 is very popular with me personally 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.259
 she does not really come in 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.539
 the classes 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:04.289
 alone because of the small range and 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.729
 the very small damage to find 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.449
 it's good that the damage is less 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.770
 has become 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:12.389
 because the whole bagging machine makes perfect sense 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.460
 actually rather intended for the melee 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.199
 and not for the long distance and us 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.919
 remind us all of modern warfare 3 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:22.289
 because the mp 7 just over it 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.659
 miles of headshots missed and 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.520
 So the ultimate weapon is not true 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.770
 it barely went around a storm rifle 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.529
 most had their b7 in hand 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.699
 and you ran through the area with it 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:35.210
 and that does not happen anymore 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.650
 one decided on black ops 2 just the 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.940
 damage range and the like 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.009
 to put down 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.000
 However, I believe in the scorpion 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.469
 it was a bit over the top 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.599
 jason channell if that was so far from 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:51.089
 my page on the subject says machines 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.250
 Quite what this year we Schreitz betrayed 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:55.800
 below purely in the comments otherwise 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.020
 look forward to the next parts to 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.080
 theme storm rifles sniper shotguns and 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:06.229
 co, as always, remains share to say 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.229
 thumbs up and the whole other Japanese
