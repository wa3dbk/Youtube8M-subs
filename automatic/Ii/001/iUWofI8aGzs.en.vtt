 I will teach you this opportunity to 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:16.230
 how to make a video tutorial 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.170
 If you are dedicated to obtaining the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.600
 program with the program with which I 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.640
 I give up the subsequent videos 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.730
 the program is called the singer to 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.490
 study studio 7 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.810
 is a program that you found 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.030
 exactly and I've uploaded it to me 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.660
 to my page where they will be able to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.660
 to download 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.590
 the link of the download I am 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.970
 leaving 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.970
 or description of the video 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.820
 well then we're just going to continue 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.480
 the following steps click on it 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.960
 of the download and it will look like this 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.960
 next page 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.100
 as it has the name for qantas and 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.450
 study 7 I know it's me 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.130
 the weight of the program is 169 points 56 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.430
 megabytes 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.780
 and what we are going to do here 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.780
 click on 2 sorry 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.969
 we can order the technique 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.060
 and it appears 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.260
 the message below as you can 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.170
 see where they say they want to shoot 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:49.140
 can fatigue study 7 but what 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.140
 let's do in save play as 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.960
 we choose the place where we are going to 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.710
 save 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.710
 vitoria 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.659
 and then the program will be save 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:10.700
 as the weight is 169 point 56 mb 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.580
 it will take more or less 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.319
 in about 20 minutes in 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.230
 download depending on 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.319
 of the speed that your computer is not 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.450
 good this 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.890
 it takes a percent then what I'm going 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.940
 to do now is to cut the video 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.940
 in order to advance the process 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.940
 discharge 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.950
 well once at this cheeky the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.740
 program will appear in the place ando 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.550
 we have decided to download 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.770
 good on this occasion and I decided 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.560
 that the desktop appears as it is 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.900
 we do it right click on the file 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.750
 winzip good 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.260
 and we can extract encantas i study 7 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.260
 in observing 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.590
 and the external company program 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.720
 once extracted seem to the folder 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.290
 where the program is extracted we do 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.290
 Double click 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:28.319
 the program and this is the program the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.319
 installer because he was weighing 160 and 9.81 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.540
 welcomes the installation of 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.540
 I study 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.420
 I think this is because I already have 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:53.720
 installed the program then I'll go 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.710
 to click on 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.140
 modified 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.860
 but the next 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.860
 here 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.720
 ah 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.750
 on site 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.750
 now 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.970
 what will seem a moment that 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:36.080
 you are going to perform the installation 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.080
 of the program 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.000
 it will be 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.890
 is going to be something what seems to 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.230
 you a moment of initialization to 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.740
 be something like this good is a 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.980
 little blurred but the 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.900
 distraction type installation 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.150
 then say 30 days of duration with 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.120
 leave you are going to make it go 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.660
 on leave they will put any 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.760
 name they want in this summary that 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.689
 I put a tired program nothing more 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:14.139
 can you sing be in the what 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:19.439
 and that is where you in the same 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.439
 program that we have downloaded can a 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.390
 a block document we do not have to 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.390
 say it would be seven 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.060
 to brandon league the only thing they're going to 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.060
 do is select the first 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:46.690
 and right 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:54.820
 in this European case then once 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:57.160
 that I have been in which the former program 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.400
 school 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.820
 that would be practically all the 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.510
 installation now for us to start 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:11.010
 to make our tutorials 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.010
 let's go here 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.199
 let's open the program 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:29.260
 then study 7 then 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.510
 and so 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.580
 for us to start doing the 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:37.990
 recording we have to click here 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.690
 remembered screen clicking all this 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.190
 sale will not be administered only 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.810
 that this unique event will appear 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.860
 small showing here 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:50.000
 in which 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.800
 that they will choose before doing this 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.150
 you will appear with a button like this 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.729
 record although they will catch you but strong 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:02.310
 how much do you want to cover the space of 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:05.639
 recording all the window only 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:09.659
 some part and ends the effects well and 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:12.540
 the catch and that would be the whole program 

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:14.330
 this one is free 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:18.620
 and I hope that 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:21.280
 have helped in something they have in one 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.050
 of your readers 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.100
 in any question or any question 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.920
 no no 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.050
 we must consult I'm going to 

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.760
 answer maybe as now in our 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:35.420
 case is to take them off with a language 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.420
 good thank you
