 Santa Claus of course he brings in 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.110
 otherwise give maybe that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.250
 For example, Christkind loves that 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.750
 audience who brings in the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.970

 The Santa Claus brings the gifts 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.189

 been know from the christkind man of 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.670
 maybe predict for both 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.839
 the situation over the years always 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.960
 become more difficult 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.089
 but that should now be over because 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.479
 neither of the two would be the job en 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.190

 I was once very very quiet indeed the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.399
 sodas then the only argument 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.159
 that for decades comes the only one 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.929
 argument coca cola i am back 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.929

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.280
 the children do not find that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.110
