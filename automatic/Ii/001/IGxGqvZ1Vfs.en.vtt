00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
that it could because the brain is bream

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.580 
that it could because the brain is bream
they<00:01:56.730> are<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:56.970> in<00:01:57.120> big<00:01:57.630> shelves<00:01:58.050> all<00:01:58.200> time

the stick mix like you can see here I

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.900 
the stick mix like you can see here I
got<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.120> crushed<00:02:21.450> SL<00:02:22.140> it's<00:02:22.710> across<00:02:23.010> pop-ups

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
got like crushed SL it's across pop-ups

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.580 
got like crushed SL it's across pop-ups
because<00:02:24.150> Garrett<00:02:24.660> told<00:02:24.840> me<00:02:24.990> about<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.350> one<00:02:25.410> I

this technique just to get the ring out

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.990 
this technique just to get the ring out
why<00:03:02.750> food<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.110> business<00:03:04.620> buddy<00:03:04.890> out<00:03:05.100> then

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
why food is the business buddy out then

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.780 
why food is the business buddy out then

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
compress it like you used to do some

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.530 
compress it like you used to do some
yeah<00:03:12.739> like<00:03:13.739> this<00:03:14.030> nearly<00:03:15.030> every<00:03:15.330> time

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
yeah like this nearly every time

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.690 
yeah like this nearly every time
sometimes<00:03:16.170> bigger<00:03:16.500> but<00:03:16.890> mostly<00:03:17.250> like<00:03:17.489> this

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
sometimes bigger but mostly like this

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.590 
sometimes bigger but mostly like this
and<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:19.110> brainiest<00:03:19.500> loved<00:03:20.150> SL<00:03:21.150> dipping

across<00:03:21.840> this<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.290> think<00:03:22.560> it's<00:03:23.280> perfect<00:03:23.790> for

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
across this and I think it's perfect for

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.339 
across this and I think it's perfect for
bream<00:03:24.150> fishing

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.610
