Plantronics and game come not even the
name<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:24.269> course<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.869> think<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.199> people<00:00:25.470> who

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
name of course I think that people who

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.109 
name of course I think that people who
buy<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.980> will<00:00:26.460> know<00:00:26.609> what<00:00:26.789> their<00:00:26.910> mind

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
buy this will know what their mind

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.810 
buy this will know what their mind
because<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.990> not<00:00:28.230> quite<00:00:28.619> cheap<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.640> is

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
because this is not quite cheap this is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.410 
because this is not quite cheap this is
a<00:00:29.849> headset<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.599> think<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:32.279> a

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
a headset of I think it's about was a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.200 
a headset of I think it's about was a
250<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.690> 300<00:00:34.530> euros<00:00:34.890> something<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.000> I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
250 to 300 euros something like that I

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.069 
250 to 300 euros something like that I

show or is it really a good headset
that's<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.450> question<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.900> am<00:01:10.159> asking<00:01:11.159> myself

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that's the question I am asking myself

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.080 
that's the question I am asking myself
right<00:01:11.700> now<00:01:12.260> now<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.369> got<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
right now now as you can see you got the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.280 
right now now as you can see you got the
box<00:01:15.330> which<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.420> taking<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.110> box

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
box which we just you know taking a box

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.289 
box which we just you know taking a box
out<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.650> box<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.720> does<00:01:21.900> his<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:23.340> think

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
out of the box so does his if I think

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.410 
out of the box so does his if I think
the<00:01:24.659> idea<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.830> take<00:01:26.420> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the idea is that you can take the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.760 
the idea is that you can take the
headset<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.520> when<00:01:29.520> you're<00:01:29.700> going

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
headset with you when you're going

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.870 
headset with you when you're going
climbing<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.860> mountain<00:01:31.890> or<00:01:32.280> something<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
climbing a mountain or something and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.969 
climbing a mountain or something and
then<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.360> carry<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.650> quite

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
then you can carry it with you quite

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.060 
then you can carry it with you quite
safely<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:38.990> perhaps<00:01:39.990> yeah<00:01:40.799> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
safely like this and perhaps yeah I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.950 
safely like this and perhaps yeah I
think<00:01:41.490> that's<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.790> idea<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.780> go

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
think that's the idea here so you can go

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.340 
think that's the idea here so you can go
playing<00:01:43.799> games<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.399> mountains<00:01:44.790> perhaps

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
playing games in the mountains perhaps

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.520 
playing games in the mountains perhaps
maybe<00:01:46.350> who<00:01:47.040> knows<00:01:47.100> anyway<00:01:48.020> let's<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.170> look

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
maybe who knows anyway let's have a look

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.170 
maybe who knows anyway let's have a look
inside<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.280> quite<00:01:50.549> cool<00:01:50.850> actually

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
cable that you can probably hook up

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.850 
cable that you can probably hook up
somewhere<00:04:30.620> in<00:04:30.650> between<00:04:30.980> here<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:33.500> get<00:04:33.650> rid<00:04:33.830> of

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
somewhere in between here to get rid of

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.719 
somewhere in between here to get rid of
this<00:04:35.020> inline<00:04:36.020> remote<00:04:36.380> so<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.220> can<00:04:37.370> hook

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
this inline remote so that you can hook

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.990 
this inline remote so that you can hook
up<00:04:37.820> here<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.600> get<00:04:38.720> rid<00:04:38.900> of<00:04:38.960> this<00:04:39.169> inline<00:04:39.530> remote

sound<00:05:14.810> quality<00:05:15.200> of<00:05:15.289> this<00:05:15.470> will<00:05:15.680> be<00:05:15.890> and<00:05:16.160> my

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
sound quality of this will be and my

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.070 
sound quality of this will be and my
colleague<00:05:17.330> is<00:05:17.419> actually<00:05:17.690> going<00:05:17.810> to<00:05:17.990> be

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080

colleague is actually going to be
reviewing<00:05:18.410> it<00:05:18.560> but<00:05:18.590> I'm<00:05:18.800> probably<00:05:19.070> gonna<00:05:19.340> test

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
reviewing it but I'm probably gonna test

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.719 
reviewing it but I'm probably gonna test
this<00:05:19.760> myself<00:05:20.150> as<00:05:20.300> well<00:05:20.510> just<00:05:20.720> to<00:05:20.870> have<00:05:20.990> a<00:05:21.729> look

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
this myself as well just to have a look

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.880 
this myself as well just to have a look
at<00:05:22.910> it<00:05:23.060> and<00:05:23.210> see<00:05:23.690> what<00:05:23.960> this<00:05:24.110> isn't<00:05:24.500> so<00:05:24.650> I<00:05:24.680> can

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
at it and see what this isn't so I can

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.800 
at it and see what this isn't so I can
actually<00:05:25.010> give<00:05:25.340> you<00:05:25.460> guys<00:05:25.700> commentary<00:05:26.300> on<00:05:26.600> it

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
actually give you guys commentary on it

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.969 
actually give you guys commentary on it
later<00:05:27.590> as<00:05:27.830> well<00:05:28.010> if<00:05:28.130> you<00:05:28.220> have<00:05:28.340> questions<00:05:29.979> so

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
later as well if you have questions so

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.430 
later as well if you have questions so
as<00:05:31.039> I<00:05:31.190> said<00:05:31.370> this<00:05:31.430> is<00:05:31.550> a<00:05:31.580> limited<00:05:32.000> edition<00:05:32.440> not

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
as I said this is a limited edition not

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.590 
as I said this is a limited edition not
really<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.860> cheapest<00:05:34.280> headset<00:05:34.850> out<00:05:35.060> there<00:05:35.570> I

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
really the cheapest headset out there I

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.150 
really the cheapest headset out there I
think<00:05:35.840> this<00:05:36.110> is<00:05:36.200> kind<00:05:36.530> enough<00:05:36.650> to<00:05:36.710> show<00:05:36.979> the

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
think this is kind enough to show the

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.820 
think this is kind enough to show the
glory<00:05:37.430> of<00:05:37.580> their<00:05:38.120> game<00:05:38.870> com-series<00:05:39.410> because
