pressure cooker that there's this
buildup<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.269> pressure<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.809> comes<00:00:10.050> from

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
buildup of pressure and it comes from

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.350 
buildup of pressure and it comes from
two<00:00:10.530> sides<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:11.130> comes<00:00:11.370> from<00:00:11.580> what's<00:00:12.179> been

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
kind of anticipation of what's coming up

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.339 
kind of anticipation of what's coming up
into<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.670> new<00:00:26.820> year<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.869> like<00:00:28.019> two

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
into the new year so it's like two

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.740 
into the new year so it's like two
points<00:00:28.890> meeting<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.699> same<00:00:29.939> place<00:00:30.359> and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
points meeting at that same place and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.000 
points meeting at that same place and
that's<00:00:30.920> 2012<00:00:31.920> meeting<00:00:32.399> 2013<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.620> can<00:00:34.920> be

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
that's 2012 meeting 2013 and this can be

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.110 
that's 2012 meeting 2013 and this can be
in<00:00:35.100> different<00:00:35.130> area<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:35.880> for<00:00:36.059> example

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
in different area so for example

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.840 
in different area so for example
personal<00:00:37.079> pressure<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:38.129> could<00:00:38.370> be<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.700> with

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
personal pressure it could be to do with

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.340 
personal pressure it could be to do with
the<00:00:38.940> relationship<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.629> could<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.260> do

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the relationship it could to do be to do

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.160 
the relationship it could to do be to do
with<00:00:40.440> people's<00:00:40.739> health<00:00:41.540> family<00:00:42.540> concerns

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
with people's health family concerns

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.630 
with people's health family concerns
that<00:00:43.410> come<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:43.649> maybe<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.980> conflicts<00:00:44.460> within

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that come up maybe this conflicts within

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.680 
that come up maybe this conflicts within
the<00:00:44.820> family<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.270> they<00:00:45.329> haven't<00:00:45.570> been

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the family and they haven't been

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.110 
the family and they haven't been
resolved<00:00:46.430> relationship<00:00:47.430> challenges<00:00:47.640> then

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
resolved relationship challenges then

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.869 
resolved relationship challenges then
you've<00:00:48.239> got<00:00:48.390> financial<00:00:49.110> concerns<00:00:49.879> possibly

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you've got financial concerns possibly

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.729 
you've got financial concerns possibly
to<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> recession<00:00:51.840> their<00:00:52.199> finances

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
to do with the recession their finances

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.590 
to do with the recession their finances
within<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> household<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.449> have

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
within the household then you have

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.939 
within the household then you have
career<00:00:55.050> challenges<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.620> all<00:00:55.680> these<00:00:55.890> things

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
career challenges and all these things

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.220 
career challenges and all these things
come<00:00:56.399> into<00:00:56.550> one<00:00:56.789> point<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:58.020> some<00:00:58.199> reason

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
come into one point and for some reason

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.639 
come into one point and for some reason
around<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.859> Christmas<00:00:59.460> time<00:01:00.020> these<00:01:01.020> emerge

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
around the Christmas time these emerge

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.590 
around the Christmas time these emerge
and<00:01:01.949> they<00:01:02.160> become<00:01:02.460> conversation<00:01:03.120> pieces<00:01:03.359> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and they become conversation pieces and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.910 
and they become conversation pieces and
I<00:01:03.660> think<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.930> partly<00:01:04.229> because<00:01:04.439> people<00:01:04.860> are

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I think it's partly because people are

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.350 
I think it's partly because people are
running<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.369> hard<00:01:05.580> during<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> course<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
running so hard during the course of the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.270 
running so hard during the course of the
year<00:01:06.659> they<00:01:07.140> don't<00:01:07.320> necessarily<00:01:07.830> get<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> chance

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
year they don't necessarily get a chance

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.940 
year they don't necessarily get a chance
to<00:01:08.400> actually<00:01:08.520> pause<00:01:08.990> reflect<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.619> then

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
to actually pause reflect and then

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.370 
to actually pause reflect and then
discuss<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.330> when<00:01:12.780> typically<00:01:13.290> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
discuss and that's when typically it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.630 
discuss and that's when typically it
comes<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:13.920> Christmas<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.460> very

stress<00:03:15.940> right<00:03:16.389> now<00:03:16.419> because<00:03:16.870> one<00:03:17.139> of<00:03:17.229> those

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
stress right now because one of those

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.750 
stress right now because one of those
studies<00:03:17.739> that's<00:03:18.040> been<00:03:18.190> done<00:03:18.370> over<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.729> years

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
studies that's been done over the years

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.729 
studies that's been done over the years
well<00:03:19.690> it's<00:03:19.810> been<00:03:19.930> several<00:03:20.139> studies<00:03:20.319> but<00:03:20.650> in

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
well it's been several studies but in

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.110 
well it's been several studies but in
this<00:03:20.829> particular<00:03:20.979> area<00:03:21.250> it's<00:03:21.609> looking<00:03:21.909> at<00:03:22.000> the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
this particular area it's looking at the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.059 
this particular area it's looking at the
psychology<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:22.989> what<00:03:23.169> we<00:03:23.290> hold<00:03:23.500> in<00:03:23.620> our<00:03:23.709> brains

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
psychology of what we hold in our brains

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.490 
psychology of what we hold in our brains
so<00:03:24.669> for<00:03:24.819> example<00:03:24.909> a<00:03:25.419> lot<00:03:25.900> of<00:03:26.019> studies<00:03:26.290> show

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
so for example a lot of studies show

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.289 
so for example a lot of studies show
that<00:03:26.530> people<00:03:26.739> can<00:03:27.040> only<00:03:27.159> retain<00:03:27.669> about<00:03:27.909> seven

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
that people can only retain about seven

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.729 
that people can only retain about seven
things<00:03:28.479> consciously<00:03:28.989> that's<00:03:29.229> where<00:03:29.409> the<00:03:29.530> moat

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
things consciously that's where the moat

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.800 
things consciously that's where the moat
the<00:03:30.129> phone<00:03:30.340> numbers<00:03:30.609> came<00:03:30.790> up<00:03:30.939> if<00:03:31.419> you<00:03:31.540> go<00:03:31.629> back

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
the phone numbers came up if you go back

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.439 
the phone numbers came up if you go back
to<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.079> 70s<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.709> 80s<00:03:32.769> we<00:03:33.220> had<00:03:33.340> seven<00:03:33.639> figure<00:03:34.060> 7

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
to the 70s and 80s we had seven figure 7

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.030 
to the 70s and 80s we had seven figure 7
digit<00:03:34.720> phone<00:03:34.840> numbers<00:03:35.169> a<00:03:35.319> lot<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:35.829> stems

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
digit phone numbers a lot of that stems

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.649 
digit phone numbers a lot of that stems
from<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.340> research<00:03:36.669> that<00:03:36.879> said<00:03:37.090> human<00:03:37.479> beings

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
from the research that said human beings

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.629 
from the research that said human beings
can<00:03:37.780> only<00:03:37.900> retain<00:03:38.650> seven<00:03:39.129> things<00:03:39.310> in<00:03:39.519> their

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
can only retain seven things in their

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.270 
can only retain seven things in their
mind<00:03:39.879> so<00:03:40.540> holding<00:03:41.079> a<00:03:41.139> lot<00:03:41.259> of<00:03:41.409> stuff<00:03:42.009> in<00:03:42.129> your

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
mind so holding a lot of stuff in your

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.770 
mind so holding a lot of stuff in your
head<00:03:42.459> during<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.120> period<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.599> very

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
head during this period is very

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.050 
head during this period is very
stressful<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:45.220> just<00:03:45.400> capture<00:03:45.729> it<00:03:45.790> down<00:03:45.939> on

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
stressful so just capture it down on

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.939 
stressful so just capture it down on
paper<00:03:46.090> that's<00:03:46.509> the<00:03:46.629> first<00:03:46.840> thing<00:03:46.959> then<00:03:47.739> write

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
paper that's the first thing then write

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.979 
paper that's the first thing then write
down<00:03:47.979> what<00:03:48.729> you<00:03:48.759> didn't<00:03:49.269> achieve<00:03:49.329> that<00:03:49.810> was

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
down what you didn't achieve that was

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.259 
down what you didn't achieve that was
that<00:03:50.379> you<00:03:50.470> said<00:03:50.680> as<00:03:50.769> a<00:03:50.799> goal<00:03:51.040> but<00:03:51.220> then<00:03:51.489> start
