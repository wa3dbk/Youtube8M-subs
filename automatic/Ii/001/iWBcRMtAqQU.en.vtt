in<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:09.660> video<00:00:09.840> i<00:00:09.960> am<00:00:10.110> going<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.349> compare<00:00:10.650> both

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
in this video i am going to compare both

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.470 
in this video i am going to compare both
of<00:00:10.980> these<00:00:11.099> heart<00:00:11.400> phones<00:00:11.610> in<00:00:11.820> terms<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.269> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
of these heart phones in terms of the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.839 
of these heart phones in terms of the
video<00:00:12.719> recording<00:00:13.080> quality<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.679> as<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.700> can

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
video recording quality and as you can

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.519 
video recording quality and as you can
see<00:00:14.880> these<00:00:15.269> both<00:00:15.540> videos<00:00:15.929> are<00:00:16.080> being<00:00:16.260> recorded

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
see these both videos are being recorded

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.769 
see these both videos are being recorded
simultaneously<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.550> i<00:00:18.270> am<00:00:18.330> giving<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.750> a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
simultaneously and i am giving you a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.210 
simultaneously and i am giving you a
fact<00:00:19.199> they<00:00:20.100> move<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.640> same<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.710> in<00:00:22.710> short<00:00:23.039> you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
fact they move the same so in short you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.089 
fact they move the same so in short you
can<00:00:23.250> find<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.119> HTC<00:00:24.570> One<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.170> having<00:00:25.980> a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
can find that the HTC One is having a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.620 
can find that the HTC One is having a
better<00:00:26.279> viewing<00:00:26.699> angle<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.240> terms<00:00:27.449> of

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
better viewing angle in terms of

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.240 
better viewing angle in terms of
capturing<00:00:29.480> figure<00:00:30.480> area<00:00:30.990> when<00:00:31.830> compared<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
capturing figure area when compared to

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.790 
capturing figure area when compared to
the<00:00:32.340> samsung<00:00:32.700> galaxy<00:00:33.000> s4<00:00:33.360> while<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.530> colors

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the samsung galaxy s4 while the colors

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.030 
the samsung galaxy s4 while the colors
also<00:00:34.950> look<00:00:35.190> quite<00:00:35.790> natural<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.320> galaxy<00:00:37.739> s4

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
also look quite natural on the galaxy s4

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.709 
also look quite natural on the galaxy s4
but<00:00:38.250> that's<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> case<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> HTC<00:00:39.510> One

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
but that's not the case in the HTC One

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.590 
but that's not the case in the HTC One
let's<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:40.980> focusing<00:00:41.670> into<00:00:42.059> something<00:00:42.480> in

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
let's go for focusing into something in

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.080 
let's go for focusing into something in
detail<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.110> then<00:00:43.800> check<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.129> how<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.460> output

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
detail and then check out how the output

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.060 
detail and then check out how the output
is<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.840> audio<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.079> also<00:00:46.379> being<00:00:46.530> recorded<00:00:46.860> on

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
is the audio is also being recorded on

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.350 
is the audio is also being recorded on
both<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.610> mud<00:00:47.850> phones<00:00:48.059> i<00:00:48.180> will<00:00:48.270> keep

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
both of this mud phones i will keep

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.119 
both of this mud phones i will keep
switching<00:00:48.780> between<00:00:48.960> these<00:00:49.379> audios<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.739> you

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
switching between these audios and you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.069 
switching between these audios and you
can<00:00:50.280> understand<00:00:50.700> how<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.300> actual<00:00:51.660> audio<00:00:51.899> is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
can understand how the actual audio is

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.770 
can understand how the actual audio is
so<00:00:52.620> now<00:00:52.800> let's<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> very<00:00:54.239> close<00:00:54.510> by

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
so now let's go to a very close by

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.959 
so now let's go to a very close by
object<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.469> check<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.739> how<00:00:55.980> good<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
object and check out how good the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.810 
object and check out how good the
focusing<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.670> something<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.760> suppose

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
focusing is so something I suppose

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.029 
focusing is so something I suppose
quickly<00:01:00.480> focusing<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.199> objects<00:01:01.920> while

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
quickly focusing on to the objects while

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.789 
quickly focusing on to the objects while
the<00:01:02.460> HTC<00:01:02.850> One<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.059> taking<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.530> good<00:01:04.530> amount<00:01:04.710> of

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the HTC One is taking a good amount of

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.969 
the HTC One is taking a good amount of
time<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.420> it's<00:01:06.420> actually<00:01:06.990> only<00:01:07.380> focusing

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
time and it's actually only focusing

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.460 
time and it's actually only focusing
when<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> am<00:01:08.280> actually<00:01:08.430> touching<00:01:08.850> onto<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
when I am actually touching onto the

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.990 
when I am actually touching onto the
screen<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.770> selecting<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> object<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
screen and selecting the object in the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.660 
screen and selecting the object in the
background<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.960> that's<00:01:13.229> about<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.860> focusing

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
background so that's about the focusing

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.300 
background so that's about the focusing
part<00:01:14.909> now<00:01:15.509> let's<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.140> into<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> sunny<00:01:16.950> area

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
part now let's go to into a sunny area

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.070 
part now let's go to into a sunny area
and<00:01:17.549> then<00:01:17.909> check<00:01:18.150> out<00:01:18.240> how<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.509> rendering<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
and then check out how the rendering is

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.649 
and then check out how the rendering is
and<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.950> terms<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> study<00:01:20.939> area<00:01:21.060> recording

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and in terms of the study area recording

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.560 
and in terms of the study area recording
I<00:01:21.780> personally<00:01:22.320> feel<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.090> galaxy<00:01:24.090> s4

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
I personally feel that the galaxy s4

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.080 
I personally feel that the galaxy s4
actually<00:01:24.930> wins<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.530> case<00:01:26.159> because<00:01:26.580> it's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
actually wins the case because it's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.050 
actually wins the case because it's
quickly<00:01:27.299> focusing<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:29.060> actually

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
quickly focusing and the actually

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.670 
quickly focusing and the actually
showing<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> colors<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.750> quite<00:01:31.079> natural<00:01:31.500> way

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
showing the colors in quite natural way

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.710 
showing the colors in quite natural way
and<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.460> pretty<00:01:32.579> brilliant<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.509> you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
and that is pretty brilliant but if you

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.610 
and that is pretty brilliant but if you
talk<00:01:33.900> about<00:01:34.430> some

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
talk about some

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.890 
talk about some
in<00:01:35.860> terms<00:01:36.070> of<00:01:38.190> capturing<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.370> bigger<00:01:39.780> area<00:01:40.780> in

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
in terms of capturing a bigger area in

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.970 
in terms of capturing a bigger area in
the<00:01:40.960> background<00:01:41.320> then<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.830> HTC<00:01:42.190> one<00:01:42.400> wins<00:01:42.670> and

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
the background then the HTC one wins and

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.140 
the background then the HTC one wins and
that's<00:01:44.980> thanks<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.610> ultra<00:01:45.970> pixel

now<00:01:48.190> let's<00:01:49.090> quickly<00:01:49.540> go<00:01:49.960> into<00:01:50.380> some<00:01:50.760> close-up

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
now let's quickly go into some close-up

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.790 
now let's quickly go into some close-up
area<00:01:52.030> let's<00:01:52.540> try<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:52.780> quickly<00:01:52.990> focus<00:01:53.350> into

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
area let's try to quickly focus into

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.860 
area let's try to quickly focus into
some<00:01:53.980> area<00:01:54.370> and<00:01:54.520> then<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.910> can<00:01:55.450> focus<00:01:55.480> on<00:01:55.780> of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
some area and then I can focus on of

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.390 
some area and then I can focus on of
some<00:01:55.990> other<00:01:56.170> area<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.560> see<00:01:56.950> if<00:01:57.070> it's<00:01:57.220> weekly

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
some other area and see if it's weekly

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.870 
some other area and see if it's weekly
focusing<00:01:57.910> and<00:01:58.230> again<00:01:59.230> the<00:01:59.890> sec<00:02:00.280> one<00:02:00.400> has<00:02:00.640> some

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
focusing and again the sec one has some

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.610 
focusing and again the sec one has some
issues<00:02:01.150> with<00:02:01.330> focusing<00:02:02.020> but<00:02:02.170> apart<00:02:02.470> from<00:02:02.500> that

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
issues with focusing but apart from that

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.650 
issues with focusing but apart from that
it's<00:02:03.220> very<00:02:03.400> brilliant<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.210> terms<00:02:04.510> of

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
it's very brilliant in terms of

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.570 
it's very brilliant in terms of
everything<00:02:05.050> else<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.500> color<00:02:06.370> saturation

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
everything else the color saturation

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.240 
everything else the color saturation
everything<00:02:07.450> looks<00:02:07.660> perfect<00:02:08.080> let's<00:02:08.590> go<00:02:08.950> and

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
everything looks perfect let's go and

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.470 
everything looks perfect let's go and
zoom<00:02:10.149> into<00:02:10.330> some<00:02:10.920> low<00:02:11.920> light<00:02:12.100> area<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.760> check

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
zoom into some low light area and check

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.060 
zoom into some low light area and check
out<00:02:13.600> how<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.870> output<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:14.800> is<00:02:14.920> some

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
out how the output is so this is some

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.550 
out how the output is so this is some
low<00:02:15.220> light<00:02:15.400> area<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.970> now<00:02:16.510> as<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.410> can<00:02:17.500> see

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
low light area and now as you can see

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.080 
low light area and now as you can see
the<00:02:19.680> quality<00:02:20.680> on<00:02:20.920> both<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.610> video

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
the quality on both of this video

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.370 
the quality on both of this video
recording<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.720> then<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:22.990> can<00:02:23.140> quite

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.840 
recording and then you can quite
understand<00:02:23.800> which<00:02:23.980> one<00:02:24.160> looks<00:02:24.280> better<00:02:24.490> pretty

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
understand which one looks better pretty

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.170

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
beautiful so this ends the comparison of

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.170 
beautiful so this ends the comparison of
the<00:02:28.530> HTC<00:02:29.530> One<00:02:29.740> was<00:02:29.920> as<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.190> samsung<00:02:30.520> galaxy<00:02:30.820> s4
