a<00:03:13.440> ton<00:03:13.799> of<00:03:13.860> features<00:03:14.130> I'd<00:03:14.640> say<00:03:14.820> very<00:03:15.120> similar

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
a ton of features I'd say very similar

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.670 
a ton of features I'd say very similar
to<00:03:16.100> Apple's<00:03:17.100> car<00:03:17.610> play<00:03:18.110> but<00:03:19.110> definitely<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.620> lot

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
to Apple's car play but definitely a lot

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.860 
to Apple's car play but definitely a lot
more<00:03:19.769> voice<00:03:20.100> control<00:03:20.580> whereas<00:03:20.970> Apple<00:03:21.690> lets

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
more voice control whereas Apple lets

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.199 
more voice control whereas Apple lets
you<00:03:21.989> actually<00:03:22.290> access<00:03:22.650> some<00:03:22.799> keyboards<00:03:23.340> and

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
you actually access some keyboards and

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.520 
you actually access some keyboards and
then<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:24.420> can<00:03:24.540> always<00:03:24.690> go<00:03:24.930> right<00:03:25.110> back<00:03:25.290> to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
then you can always go right back to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.069 
then you can always go right back to
your<00:03:25.650> normal<00:03:25.739> pioneer<00:03:26.400> station<00:03:26.959> one<00:03:27.959> other

your normal pioneer station one other

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.449 
your normal pioneer station one other
nice<00:03:28.320> thing<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.650> does<00:03:28.799> that<00:03:29.040> I've<00:03:29.130> noticed

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459

that<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.850> can't<00:03:30.090> really<00:03:30.150> do<00:03:30.450> too<00:03:30.630> well<00:03:30.780> in<00:03:30.810> car

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110
