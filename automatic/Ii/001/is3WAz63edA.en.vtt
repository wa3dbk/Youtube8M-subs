too<00:00:28.980> many<00:00:29.160> miles<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.810> quite<00:00:30.810> good<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
too many miles and quite good on the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.620 
too many miles and quite good on the
chicken<00:00:31.380> strip<00:00:31.560> front<00:00:32.180> look<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.300> better<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
chicken strip front look the better and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.520 
chicken strip front look the better and
left<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.870> side<00:00:34.079> than<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> right

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
left on side than the right

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.459 
left on side than the right
but<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.130> tire<00:00:35.730> may<00:00:36.570> actually<00:00:36.780> be<00:00:37.079> showing<00:00:37.350> up

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
but this tire may actually be showing up

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.780 
but this tire may actually be showing up
and<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.680> bikes<00:00:37.860> got<00:00:38.010> more<00:00:38.190> ability<00:00:38.610> than<00:00:38.640> I

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and the bikes got more ability than I

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.690 
and the bikes got more ability than I
have<00:00:39.000> because<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.469> fair<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.129> thought<00:00:41.670> I

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
have because to be fair I I thought I

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.979 
have because to be fair I I thought I
would<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.059> scrubbed<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.450> all<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> way<00:00:42.750> edge

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
would have scrubbed it all the way edge

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.069 
would have scrubbed it all the way edge
to<00:00:43.020> edge<00:00:43.320> by<00:00:43.649> now<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.250> haven't<00:00:44.489> done<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
to edge by now and I haven't done and

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.029 
to edge by now and I haven't done and
one<00:00:46.079> reason<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.239> might<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.800> fact

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
one reason for that might be the fact

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.869 
one reason for that might be the fact
that<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:51.390> previous<00:00:51.750> owner<00:00:52.050> seems<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> been<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
that the previous owner seems to been a

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.549 
that the previous owner seems to been a
spinal<00:00:53.879> tap<00:00:54.059> fun<00:00:54.360> know<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.230> see<00:00:55.410> that

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
spinal tap fun know if you can see that

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.979 
spinal tap fun know if you can see that
but<00:00:55.829> basically<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.969> suspension<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.629> dialed

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
but basically the suspension is dialed

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.110 
but basically the suspension is dialed
up<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.350> 11<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.160> set<00:00:59.370> as<00:00:59.460> hard<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.969> can

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
up to 11 it's set as hard as it can

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.020 
up to 11 it's set as hard as it can
possibly<00:01:00.149> go<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.370> so<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> little<00:01:02.760> bit

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
possibly go and so it's a little bit

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.490 
possibly go and so it's a little bit
bouncy<00:01:03.149> sometimes<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.290> that's

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
bouncy sometimes I'm going to that's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.310 
bouncy sometimes I'm going to that's
going<00:01:04.619> my<00:01:04.799> next<00:01:05.010> job<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.309> play<00:01:05.549> with<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
going my next job is to play with that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.770 
going my next job is to play with that
but<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.400> other<00:01:08.520> thing<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.180> worth<00:01:09.390> noting

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
but the the other thing is worth noting

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.260 
but the the other thing is worth noting
with<00:01:09.930> these<00:01:10.189> series<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.340> fireblaze<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.060> the

with these series one fireblaze is the
front<00:01:12.900> runs<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.409> 16<00:01:13.920> inch<00:01:14.130> rim<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.450> a

managed to blister it don't if you can

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.130 
managed to blister it don't if you can
see<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.180> heat<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.750> blistered

see that the heat of it is blistered
it's<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> sport<00:01:26.310> tire<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> front

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it's really the sport tire on the front

the<00:02:04.080> grip<00:02:04.320> at<00:02:04.500> all<00:02:04.680> whatsoever<00:02:05.399> today

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the grip at all whatsoever today

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.900 
the grip at all whatsoever today
absolutely<00:02:06.630> superb<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.429> really<00:02:08.429> recommended

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
absolutely superb and really recommended

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.260 
absolutely superb and really recommended
I<00:02:09.649> think<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.360> weird<00:02:12.360> thing<00:02:12.800> is<00:02:13.800> having<00:02:14.270> a

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
I think the weird thing is having a

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.729 
I think the weird thing is having a
sport<00:02:16.020> touring<00:02:16.560> tire<00:02:16.800> on<00:02:17.360> something<00:02:18.739> like

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
sport touring tire on something like

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.510 
sport touring tire on something like
five<00:02:20.040> wide<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.959> sort<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.520> obvious

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
five wide it's not the sort of obvious

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.840 
five wide it's not the sort of obvious
choice<00:02:23.910> really<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.770> but<00:02:25.770> as<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.459> said<00:02:26.520> it

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
choice really and but as I said it

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.210 
choice really and but as I said it
combined<00:02:27.270> with<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> sort<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.470> softer<00:02:28.980> from

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
combined with the sort of softer from

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.870 
combined with the sort of softer from
the<00:02:29.370> Hypersport<00:02:29.910> from<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:32.130> harder<00:02:32.489> rear<00:02:32.610> tire

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
the Hypersport from the harder rear tire

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.900 
the Hypersport from the harder rear tire
is<00:02:33.090> actually<00:02:33.239> doing<00:02:33.750> quite<00:02:33.780> well<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.670> seems

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
is actually doing quite well so it seems

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.550 
is actually doing quite well so it seems
to<00:02:35.970> be<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.090> good<00:02:36.299> mix<00:02:36.540> especially<00:02:36.780> given<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
to be a good mix especially given the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.500 
to be a good mix especially given the
the<00:02:37.830> dodgy<00:02:38.010> front<00:02:38.370> wheel<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.790> sixteen<00:02:39.360> inch

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
the dodgy front wheel the sixteen inch

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.800 
the dodgy front wheel the sixteen inch
rim<00:02:40.230> size<00:02:40.530> on<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.830> front<00:02:41.070> so<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.820> you've<00:02:42.060> if

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
rim size on the front so if you've if

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.350 
rim size on the front so if you've if
you've<00:02:43.019> got<00:02:43.230> one<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.440> these<00:02:43.530> bikes<00:02:44.209> it's<00:02:45.209> a

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
you've got one of these bikes it's a

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.350 
you've got one of these bikes it's a
good<00:02:45.570> match<00:02:45.750> if<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.170> haven't<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.070> think<00:02:47.940> the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
good match if you haven't I think the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.090 
good match if you haven't I think the
the<00:02:48.900> Oh<00:02:49.799> 23<00:02:50.459> tires<00:02:51.440> pretty<00:02:52.440> good<00:02:52.680> pretty<00:02:52.980> good

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
the Oh 23 tires pretty good pretty good

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.310
