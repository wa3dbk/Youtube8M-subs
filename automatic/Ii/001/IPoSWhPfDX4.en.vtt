00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
think about them and if it's going to be

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.700 
think about them and if it's going to be
worth<00:00:14.790> our<00:00:14.940> sixty<00:00:15.360> dollars<00:00:15.719> because<00:00:15.900> they

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
worth our sixty dollars because they

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.109 
worth our sixty dollars because they
haven't<00:00:16.859> done<00:00:16.949> anything<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> graphics

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
haven't done anything to the graphics

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.200 
haven't done anything to the graphics
they<00:00:18.570> haven't<00:00:18.810> done<00:00:18.840> anything<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:20.090> from<00:00:21.090> what

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
they haven't done anything to from what

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.929 
they haven't done anything to from what
it<00:00:21.300> looks<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.570> crowd<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.519> honestly<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
it looks like the crowd and honestly the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.410 
it looks like the crowd and honestly the
goalies<00:00:24.269> look<00:00:24.449> exactly<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:24.960> same<00:00:25.640> so<00:00:26.640> these

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
goalies look exactly the same so these

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.570 
goalies look exactly the same so these
features<00:00:27.960> are<00:00:28.230> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.310> enough

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
features are going to have to be enough

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.999 
features are going to have to be enough
to<00:00:30.570> make<00:00:30.599> they're<00:00:31.380> gonna<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.650> persuade

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
to make they're gonna have to persuade

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.500 
to make they're gonna have to persuade
me<00:00:32.160> basically<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.640> spend<00:00:32.850> my<00:00:32.940> sixty<00:00:33.270> dollars

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
me basically to spend my sixty dollars

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.930 
me basically to spend my sixty dollars
on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> game<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.550> main<00:00:35.670> thing<00:00:35.910> that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
on the game so the main thing that

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.250 
on the game so the main thing that
everyone<00:00:36.390> seems<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.750> talking<00:00:36.899> about<00:00:37.170> is

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
everyone seems to be talking about is

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.440 
everyone seems to be talking about is
one<00:00:37.440> touch<00:00:37.649> deke<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> on

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
one touch deke and you can see it on

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.410 
one touch deke and you can see it on
screen<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.050> taken<00:00:40.350> straight<00:00:40.530> from<00:00:40.710> EAS

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
screen this was taken straight from EAS

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.830 
screen this was taken straight from EAS
NHL<00:00:42.420> 14<00:00:42.660> website<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.270> responsive

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
NHL 14 website so it's a more responsive

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.569 
NHL 14 website so it's a more responsive
Deacon<00:00:46.170> system<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:46.680> means<00:00:46.890> less<00:00:47.160> screwed

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
Deacon system which means less screwed

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.779 
Deacon system which means less screwed
up<00:00:47.730> geeks<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.239> absolutely<00:00:48.750> no<00:00:48.930> reason<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
up geeks for absolutely no reason and

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.340 
up geeks for absolutely no reason and
controlled<00:00:50.789> with<00:00:50.910> only<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.270> left<00:00:51.510> stick<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
controlled with only the left stick and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.740 
controlled with only the left stick and
one<00:00:52.710> button<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.670> that's<00:00:54.329> going<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> make<00:00:54.629> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
one button so that's going to make it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.540 
one button so that's going to make it
easier<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.289> means<00:00:55.469> anybody<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.280> dangle

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
easier that means anybody can dangle

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.610 
easier that means anybody can dangle
which<00:00:57.360> will<00:00:57.539> probably<00:00:57.809> mean<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> end<00:00:58.469> of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
which will probably mean the end of

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.410 
which will probably mean the end of
shootout<00:00:58.949> montages<00:00:59.489> because<00:00:59.730> anybody<00:01:00.329> can

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
shootout montages because anybody can

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.810 
shootout montages because anybody can
make<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.870> anyone<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.500> dangle<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:02.399> just

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
make and anyone can dangle I'm just

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
make and anyone can dangle I'm just
kidding<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.710> from<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:05.040> seems<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.460> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
kidding but from that it seems like I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.859 
kidding but from that it seems like I
think<00:01:05.970> that's<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.600> more<00:01:06.840> of

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
think that's going to be more of

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.440 
think that's going to be more of
practical<00:01:07.860> Deeks<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.369> not<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.820> between<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
practical Deeks so not like between the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.140 
practical Deeks so not like between the
legs<00:01:09.600> one<00:01:09.869> hand<00:01:10.049> windmill<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:11.119> anything<00:01:12.119> like

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
legs one hand windmill or anything like

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.730 
legs one hand windmill or anything like
that<00:01:12.240> I'm<00:01:12.570> assuming<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.500> gonna<00:01:13.590> be

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that I'm assuming that it's gonna be

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.399 
that I'm assuming that it's gonna be
more<00:01:13.890> basic<00:01:14.460> Deeks<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:15.090> one-on-one<00:01:15.750> Deeks

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
more basic Deeks like one-on-one Deeks

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.469 
more basic Deeks like one-on-one Deeks
you<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.970> head<00:01:18.810> fake<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:20.390> maybe<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you know just to a head fake or maybe a

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.390 
you know just to a head fake or maybe a
total<00:01:21.840> drag<00:01:22.020> something<00:01:22.680> something<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.159> too

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
total drag something something not too

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.580 
total drag something something not too
fancy<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.850> blow<00:01:24.060> past<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.479> defenders<00:01:24.960> that's

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
fancy to blow past your defenders that's

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.890 
fancy to blow past your defenders that's
what<00:01:25.799> I'm<00:01:26.040> assuming<00:01:26.610> from<00:01:27.540> beginner<00:01:27.869> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
what I'm assuming from beginner to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.270 
what I'm assuming from beginner to
advanced<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> system<00:01:28.740> allows<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.100> quicker

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
advanced the system allows for quicker

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.330 
advanced the system allows for quicker
response<00:01:29.369> or<00:01:29.939> quicker<00:01:30.270> reactive<00:01:30.720> Deeks<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
response or quicker reactive Deeks and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.130 
response or quicker reactive Deeks and
intuitive<00:01:32.340> combination<00:01:33.030> Deeks<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:33.990> think

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
intuitive combination Deeks so I think

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.030 
intuitive combination Deeks so I think
you're<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.799> able<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
you're going to have to be able to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.120 
you're going to have to be able to
combine<00:01:35.189> them<00:01:35.520> from<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> sounds<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.720> it's

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
combine them from the sounds of it it's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.840 
combine them from the sounds of it it's
it's<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.369> interesting<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.790> think

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
it's going to be interesting I think

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.999 
it's going to be interesting I think
it's<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.210> throw<00:01:39.509> back<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
it's going to throw back to the to the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.319 
it's going to throw back to the to the
days<00:01:41.189> where<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.729> one<00:01:41.880> button<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.299> you

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
days where it's just one button that you

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.469 
days where it's just one button that you
press<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.780> do<00:01:42.869> any<00:01:43.020> Deeks<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.090> it

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
press to do any Deeks and you know it

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.830 
press to do any Deeks and you know it
was<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.320> bit<00:01:46.470> more<00:01:46.590> fun<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.070> way

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
was a little bit more fun that way

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.300 
was a little bit more fun that way
because<00:01:48.840> i'm<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.290> good<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:49.590> dangling<00:01:50.159> with

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
because i'm not good at dangling with

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.700 
because i'm not good at dangling with
the<00:01:50.399> scope<00:01:50.610> still<00:01:50.909> skill<00:01:51.570> stick<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.380> that's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the scope still skill stick so that's

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.490 
the scope still skill stick so that's
that's<00:01:53.070> my<00:01:53.340> take<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.450> now<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.200> 1<00:01:55.380> i'm

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that's my take on that now the 1 i'm

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.630 
that's my take on that now the 1 i'm
really<00:01:55.890> looking<00:01:56.009> forward<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
really looking forward to is the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.940 
really looking forward to is the
enforcer<00:01:57.240> engine<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.259> basically<00:01:58.680> they're

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
enforcer engine so basically they're

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.219 
enforcer engine so basically they're
redoing<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.460> fighting<00:01:59.850> its<00:02:00.420> third<00:02:00.719> person

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
redoing the fighting its third person

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.170 
redoing the fighting its third person
again<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.979> physics<00:02:02.399> based<00:02:02.700> which<00:02:03.030> is

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
again and it's physics based which is

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.560 
again and it's physics based which is
targeting<00:02:03.979> basically<00:02:04.979> uh<00:02:05.219> where<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.119> punch

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
targeting basically uh where you punch

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.080 
targeting basically uh where you punch
and<00:02:06.899> how<00:02:07.530> big<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> other<00:02:08.099> person<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.910> going

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
and how big the other person is is going

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.910 
and how big the other person is is going
to<00:02:09.149> make<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.390> difference<00:02:09.539> because<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.440> NHL<00:02:10.890> 13

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
to make a difference because in NHL 13

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.730 
to make a difference because in NHL 13
if<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:12.330> are<00:02:12.690> Brian

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
tyne you fight Zdeno Chara in the fight

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.810 
tyne you fight Zdeno Chara in the fight
you<00:02:16.650> will<00:02:16.800> both<00:02:16.950> end<00:02:17.220> up<00:02:17.370> being<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.790> same

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
you will both end up being the same

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.270 
you will both end up being the same
height<00:02:18.300> which<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.080> stupid<00:02:19.830> beyond<00:02:20.310> belief<00:02:20.610> and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
height which is stupid beyond belief and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.160 
height which is stupid beyond belief and
you<00:02:23.280> could<00:02:23.430> easily<00:02:23.970> win<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.210> fight<00:02:24.420> as<00:02:24.720> Brian

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
you could easily win the fight as Brian

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.380 
you could easily win the fight as Brian
Gionta<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.860> got<00:02:26.310> would<00:02:26.430> never<00:02:26.670> happen<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.330> real

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
Gionta I got would never happen in real

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.830 
Gionta I got would never happen in real
life<00:02:27.570> as<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:27.990> it's<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.710> obvious<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.940> plus

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
life as a it's just obvious so plus

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.300 
life as a it's just obvious so plus
they're<00:02:31.020> going<00:02:31.140> back<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.380> third<00:02:31.590> person<00:02:32.130> I

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
they're going back to third person I

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.190 
they're going back to third person I
never<00:02:32.880> liked<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.270> first<00:02:33.450> person<00:02:33.840> fighting<00:02:33.990> it

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
never liked the first person fighting it

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
never liked the first person fighting it
was<00:02:34.230> just<00:02:34.470> not<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.340> hasn't<00:02:35.790> changed<00:02:35.820> at<00:02:36.360> all

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
was just not it it hasn't changed at all

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.880 
was just not it it hasn't changed at all
so<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.400> will<00:02:38.550> be<00:02:38.640> very<00:02:38.790> interesting

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
so this will be very interesting

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.710 
so this will be very interesting
fighting<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.010> really<00:02:41.730> important<00:02:42.210> in<00:02:42.330> hockey

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
fighting is really important in hockey

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.170 
fighting is really important in hockey
and<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:44.040> fact<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.730> they're<00:02:44.910> going<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.090> make

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
and the fact that they're going to make

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.410 
and the fact that they're going to make
it<00:02:45.300> more<00:02:45.390> realistic<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:47.330> definitely<00:02:48.330> an

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
it more realistic is definitely an

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.370 
it more realistic is definitely an
upgrade<00:02:48.480> from<00:02:48.720> NHL<00:02:49.530> 13<00:02:49.880> online<00:02:50.880> seasons<00:02:51.690> so

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
upgrade from NHL 13 online seasons so

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.340 
upgrade from NHL 13 online seasons so
now<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.740> I<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.610> haven't<00:02:54.180> read<00:02:54.360> up<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:55.020> lot

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
now this I I haven't read up on it a lot

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.620 
now this I I haven't read up on it a lot
but<00:02:55.710> when<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.550> first<00:02:56.790> heard<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.210> assumed

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
but when I just first heard it I assumed

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.000 
but when I just first heard it I assumed
it<00:02:57.750> was<00:02:57.840> going<00:02:57.960> to<00:02:58.020> be<00:02:58.080> something<00:02:58.320> like<00:02:58.590> maybe

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
it was going to be something like maybe

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.130 
it was going to be something like maybe

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
weaker players it makes sense all right

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.470 
weaker players it makes sense all right
i<00:03:40.860> don't<00:03:41.130> know<00:03:41.310> why<00:03:41.520> they<00:03:41.970> had<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.180> wait<00:03:42.300> till

something<00:03:53.070> else<00:03:53.280> they<00:03:53.610> said<00:03:53.880> last<00:03:54.120> year<00:03:54.270> they

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
something else they said last year they

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.570 
something else they said last year they

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
added 1,000 new goalie animations you

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.680 
added 1,000 new goalie animations you
want<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.820> know<00:03:56.880> how<00:03:57.090> many<00:03:57.150> new<00:03:57.450> goalie

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690

animations<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.380> saw<00:03:58.590> this<00:03:58.770> year<00:03:58.980> from<00:03:59.100> NHL<00:03:59.520> 12<00:03:59.760> I

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
animations I saw this year from NHL 12 I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.290 
animations I saw this year from NHL 12 I
think<00:04:00.870> probably<00:04:01.110> about<00:04:01.560> seven<00:04:02.100> or<00:04:02.220> eight<00:04:02.550> not

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
think probably about seven or eight not

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.930 
think probably about seven or eight not
near<00:04:03.780> 1,000<00:04:04.590> alright<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.100> that's<00:04:05.610> probably

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
near 1,000 alright so that's probably

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.180 
near 1,000 alright so that's probably
going<00:04:06.270> to<00:04:06.330> mean<00:04:06.480> about<00:04:06.720> 10<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.530> 15<00:04:07.680> new

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
going to mean about 10 to 15 new

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.270 
going to mean about 10 to 15 new

turn like a rhinoceros in this game it's

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.090 
turn like a rhinoceros in this game it's
ridiculous<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.510> enhanced<00:04:22.320> lateral<00:04:22.740> skating

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
control the lateral skating is actually

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.430 
control the lateral skating is actually
important<00:04:28.440> I<00:04:28.650> think<00:04:29.490> because<00:04:29.850> of<00:04:30.440> what

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
important I think because of what

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.500 
important I think because of what
happens<00:04:31.830> sometimes<00:04:32.220> as<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.520> defenseman<00:04:33.180> it's

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
happens sometimes as a defenseman it's

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.540 
happens sometimes as a defenseman it's
tough<00:04:33.840> you're<00:04:34.050> playing<00:04:34.260> defense<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:34.889> you

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
tough you're playing defense and you

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.100 
tough you're playing defense and you
just<00:04:35.639> can't<00:04:35.820> get<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.120> a<00:04:36.150> puck<00:04:36.389> because<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.870> goes

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
just can't get to a puck because it goes

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.140 
just can't get to a puck because it goes
beside<00:04:37.470> you<00:04:37.650> you<00:04:37.680> just<00:04:38.010> do<00:04:38.430> not<00:04:38.550> get<00:04:38.790> to<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.060> and

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
beside you you just do not get to it and

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.219 
beside you you just do not get to it and
then<00:04:39.270> in<00:04:39.570> NHL<00:04:40.229> 13<00:04:41.300> so<00:04:42.300> next<00:04:42.780> we<00:04:42.930> move<00:04:43.050> on<00:04:43.199> to

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
then in NHL 13 so next we move on to

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.260 
then in NHL 13 so next we move on to
collision<00:04:43.770> physics<00:04:43.889> they're<00:04:44.370> revamping<00:04:45.150> the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
collision physics they're revamping the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.510 
collision physics they're revamping the
hitting<00:04:45.630> this<00:04:46.110> was<00:04:46.380> somewhat<00:04:46.800> obvious<00:04:46.979> in<00:04:47.340> in

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
hitting this was somewhat obvious in in

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.870 
hitting this was somewhat obvious in in
the<00:04:47.760> trailer<00:04:48.180> what<00:04:49.050> I<00:04:49.080> don't<00:04:49.199> like<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.979> that

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
the trailer what I don't like is that

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.740 
the trailer what I don't like is that
it's<00:04:51.650> bigger<00:04:52.650> more<00:04:53.040> thrilling<00:04:53.550> hits<00:04:53.880> their

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
it's bigger more thrilling hits their

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.730 
it's bigger more thrilling hits their
hits<00:04:55.139> are<00:04:55.380> already<00:04:55.949> too<00:04:56.370> big<00:04:56.669> I<00:04:57.360> mean<00:04:58.260> in<00:04:58.470> real

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
hits are already too big I mean in real

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.620 
hits are already too big I mean in real
life<00:04:58.979> you<00:04:59.220> don't<00:04:59.340> have<00:04:59.610> hits<00:04:59.940> take<00:05:00.210> place<00:05:00.450> at

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
life you don't have hits take place at

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.540 
life you don't have hits take place at
the<00:05:00.690> blue<00:05:00.870> line<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.560> have<00:05:01.710> one<00:05:01.919> guy<00:05:02.100> bouncing

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
the blue line and have one guy bouncing

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.100 
the blue line and have one guy bouncing
on<00:05:02.639> his<00:05:02.760> head<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.180> spinning<00:05:03.570> around<00:05:03.660> under

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
on his head and spinning around under

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.719 
on his head and spinning around under
ending<00:05:04.500> up<00:05:04.620> behind<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.950> goal<00:05:05.100> line<00:05:05.310> it

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
ending up behind the goal line it

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.210 
ending up behind the goal line it
doesn't<00:05:06.030> work<00:05:06.120> like<00:05:06.150> that<00:05:06.419> all<00:05:06.840> right<00:05:07.100> be<00:05:08.100> I'd

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
doesn't work like that all right be I'd

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.330 
doesn't work like that all right be I'd
also<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:09.030> also<00:05:09.060> does<00:05:09.540> say<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:10.410> it's<00:05:10.530> truer<00:05:11.070> to

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
also it also does say that it's truer to

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.710 
also it also does say that it's truer to
life<00:05:11.490> collisions<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.240> looked<00:05:12.389> like<00:05:12.479> that

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
life collisions and it looked like that

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.770 
life collisions and it looked like that
in<00:05:13.020> in<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.889> trailer<00:05:14.370> thing<00:05:15.360> I<00:05:15.419> don't<00:05:15.540> like<00:05:15.660> is

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
in in the trailer thing I don't like is

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
in in the trailer thing I don't like is
a<00:05:16.229> new<00:05:16.710> left<00:05:17.180> stick<00:05:18.180> control<00:05:18.780> scheme<00:05:19.110> makes

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
a new left stick control scheme makes

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.430 
a new left stick control scheme makes
delivering<00:05:20.340> a<00:05:20.900> game-changing<00:05:21.900> hit<00:05:22.050> simpler

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
delivering a game-changing hit simpler

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.990 
delivering a game-changing hit simpler
and<00:05:22.560> more<00:05:22.680> rewarding<00:05:23.160> than<00:05:23.220> ever<00:05:23.430> which

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
and more rewarding than ever which

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.400 
and more rewarding than ever which
basically<00:05:24.360> means<00:05:24.570> you<00:05:24.720> just<00:05:24.870> got<00:05:25.020> to<00:05:25.050> skate

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
skating and collision physics I think

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.520

are just going to be exactly the same
it's<00:07:02.250> 13<00:07:02.700> or<00:07:02.940> they're<00:07:03.090> going<00:07:03.210> to<00:07:03.270> be<00:07:03.360> worse<00:07:03.600> but

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
it's 13 or they're going to be worse but

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.770 
it's 13 or they're going to be worse but
everything<00:07:04.590> else<00:07:04.860> seems<00:07:05.790> seems<00:07:06.300> exciting
