00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.060
 replay a single passage of this game I 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.830
 would choose without hesitation the temple of 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.140
 water as much for its graphic quality 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.430
 that for the atmosphere that emerges 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.890
 passage is for me my best 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.020
 remember where is a fan of games 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.910
 of puzzles I loved this aspect 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.350
 puzzle platform where everything rests on a 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.210
 good management of objects a 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.870
 clear and precise understanding of 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.909
 situation 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.040
 the first time I visited this 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.960
 temple I sweated blood and water to get 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.489
 at the end of these riddles and what gave me 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.559
 more bluffed is the linguistic aspect 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.530
 who escapes and the architectured side 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.360

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.310
 serves as a cherry on the cake in 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.990
 this thrilling and mysterious adventure 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.600

 the monstrous but impalpable and without 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.510
 real identity 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.920
 this allows us to present it but its 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.380
 aqueous form does not matter any other 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.940
 information about its real appearance for little 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.979
 of his reasons I would like to relive this 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.810
 experience set out to conquer the 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.820
