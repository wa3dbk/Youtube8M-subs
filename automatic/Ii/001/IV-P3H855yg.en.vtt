after tax now i went into the gold cup
and<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> come<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.240> against<00:01:39.509> f5<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> back

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and I come up against f5 that the back

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.800 
and I come up against f5 that the back
who<00:01:40.740> had<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> lot<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> pace<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.820> he<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.570> played

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
who had a lot of pace and he just played

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.569 
who had a lot of pace and he just played
all<00:01:42.990> too<00:01:43.290> defensive<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.130> didn't<00:01:44.399> create

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
all too defensive so it didn't create

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.060 
all too defensive so it didn't create
many<00:01:44.880> interesting<00:01:45.689> chances<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.649> he<00:01:46.799> just

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
many interesting chances because he just

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.190 
many interesting chances because he just
had<00:01:47.250> eight<00:01:47.490> players<00:01:47.850> back<00:01:48.149> basically<00:01:48.570> all<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
had eight players back basically all the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.170 
had eight players back basically all the
time<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.100> difficult<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.610> break<00:01:50.759> down<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.149> I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
time so difficult to break down but I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.030 
time so difficult to break down but I
will<00:01:51.390> get<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.869> there<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.229> make<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:52.829> nil

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040
