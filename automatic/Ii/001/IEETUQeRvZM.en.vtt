00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
and starting to gain the proper amount

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.759 
and starting to gain the proper amount
of<00:02:33.950> weight<00:02:34.250> she<00:02:34.280> was<00:02:34.819> weighing<00:02:35.150> 1<00:02:35.720> pound<00:02:36.140> 11

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.339 
of weight she was weighing 1 pound 11
ounces<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.459> she's<00:02:37.670> still<00:02:37.879> very<00:02:37.909> very<00:02:38.480> small<00:02:38.930> so

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
ounces so she's still very very small so

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.630 
ounces so she's still very very small so
that<00:02:39.379> was<00:02:39.620> kind<00:02:39.829> of<00:02:39.860> like<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.159> main<00:02:40.310> event

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
that was kind of like the main event

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.420 
that was kind of like the main event
like<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:40.940> said<00:02:41.209> so<00:02:41.480> there<00:02:41.709> I'm<00:02:42.709> actually<00:02:43.069> going

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
like I said so there I'm actually going

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.099 
like I said so there I'm actually going
to<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:43.670> doctor's<00:02:44.060> appointment<00:02:44.180> tomorrow<00:02:44.690> to

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
that is going to give me a real idea of

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.800 
that is going to give me a real idea of
when<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:52.760> are<00:02:52.790> actually<00:02:53.209> going<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.660> be

and I think some of you guys were
confused<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.310> hadn't<00:02:58.579> really<00:02:58.760> got<00:02:58.879> to<00:02:59.030> this

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
confused and I hadn't really got to this

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.380

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280

was 30 weeks and you know she's coming
soon<00:03:04.459> like<00:03:04.519> less<00:03:05.060> than<00:03:05.239> 10<00:03:05.450> weeks<00:03:05.690> and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
soon like less than 10 weeks and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.000 
soon like less than 10 weeks and
everyone<00:03:06.200> was<00:03:06.319> like<00:03:06.440> kind<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.680> like<00:03:06.799> what

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
everyone was like kind of like what

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.039 
everyone was like kind of like what
you're<00:03:07.430> 30<00:03:07.940> weeks<00:03:08.269> you<00:03:08.359> know<00:03:08.480> how<00:03:08.659> do<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.870> know

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
you're 30 weeks you know how do you know

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.229 
you're 30 weeks you know how do you know
they<00:03:09.319> are<00:03:09.440> probably<00:03:09.650> going<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.370> induce<00:03:10.970> me

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
they are probably going to induce me

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.530 
they are probably going to induce me
early<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:11.989> think<00:03:12.109> 35<00:03:12.859> weeks<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.760> probably<00:03:14.299> the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
early I think 35 weeks is probably the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.400 
early I think 35 weeks is probably the
longest<00:03:14.780> they<00:03:15.260> would<00:03:15.440> let<00:03:15.650> me<00:03:15.799> go<00:03:16.959> with<00:03:17.959> the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
longest they would let me go with the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.500 
longest they would let me go with the
current<00:03:18.650> situation<00:03:18.980> with<00:03:19.790> her<00:03:19.970> being<00:03:20.209> so

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
current situation with her being so

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.030 
current situation with her being so
small<00:03:20.840> they're<00:03:21.139> thinking<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:21.709> maybe<00:03:21.919> she

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
small they're thinking that maybe she

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.640 
small they're thinking that maybe she
isn't<00:03:22.280> getting<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.639> proper<00:03:23.530> nutrients<00:03:24.530> from

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
isn't getting the proper nutrients from

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.409 
isn't getting the proper nutrients from
the<00:03:24.829> placenta<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.579> that<00:03:25.819> she<00:03:26.030> could<00:03:26.239> be

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
the placenta and that she could be

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.409 
the placenta and that she could be
growing<00:03:26.840> better<00:03:27.169> outside<00:03:27.889> of<00:03:28.220> me<00:03:28.519> than<00:03:28.910> she<00:03:28.940> is

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
growing better outside of me than she is

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.330 
growing better outside of me than she is
growing<00:03:29.750> inside<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.200> me<00:03:30.349> my<00:03:30.769> doctor<00:03:31.129> in<00:03:31.250> the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
growing inside of me my doctor in the

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
situation I am now and I just wished

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.319 
situation I am now and I just wished
that<00:04:04.010> there<00:04:04.220> was<00:04:04.400> more<00:04:04.579> that<00:04:04.639> I<00:04:04.790> could<00:04:05.000> do<00:04:05.150> it's

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
that there was more that I could do it's

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.990 
that there was more that I could do it's
just<00:04:05.540> kind<00:04:05.750> of<00:04:05.810> hard<00:04:06.019> when<00:04:06.769> somebody<00:04:07.760> tells

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
just kind of hard when somebody tells

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.580 
just kind of hard when somebody tells
you<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.299> you<00:04:08.930> know<00:04:09.019> you're<00:04:09.260> doing

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
you that you know you're doing

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.410 
you that you know you're doing
you<00:04:09.890> can<00:04:10.099> but<00:04:10.430> things<00:04:10.610> are<00:04:10.790> still<00:04:11.000> kind<00:04:11.300> of

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
you can but things are still kind of

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.509 
you can but things are still kind of
going<00:04:11.690> wrong<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.260> so<00:04:12.769> at<00:04:12.950> this<00:04:13.069> point<00:04:13.280> it's

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
going wrong so so at this point it's

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.100 
going wrong so so at this point it's
just<00:04:13.580> kind<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:13.940> a<00:04:14.000> waiting<00:04:14.360> game<00:04:14.390> I<00:04:14.810> guess

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
just kind of a waiting game I guess

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.409 
just kind of a waiting game I guess

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
I'm hoping that kind of before they want

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.190 
I'm hoping that kind of before they want
to<00:05:04.370> induce<00:05:04.729> me<00:05:04.970> she'll<00:05:05.210> flip<00:05:05.389> around<00:05:05.750> it's

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
to induce me she'll flip around it's

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.860 
to induce me she'll flip around it's
still<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:06.500> possibility<00:05:06.850> but<00:05:07.850> with<00:05:08.270> as<00:05:08.479> low<00:05:08.690> as

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
still a possibility but with as low as

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.320 
still a possibility but with as low as
my<00:05:08.990> fluids<00:05:09.650> are<00:05:09.949> they<00:05:10.220> said<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:10.789> the<00:05:10.880> chances

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
my fluids are they said that the chances

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.300 
my fluids are they said that the chances
are<00:05:11.360> pretty<00:05:11.510> small<00:05:12.229> that<00:05:12.620> she<00:05:12.650> will<00:05:13.039> flip

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
are pretty small that she will flip

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.670 
are pretty small that she will flip
around<00:05:13.490> to<00:05:13.760> where<00:05:13.940> she<00:05:14.090> needs<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.360> be<00:05:14.479> so<00:05:14.870> that

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
around to where she needs to be so that

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.620 
around to where she needs to be so that
kind<00:05:15.919> of<00:05:16.010> stinks<00:05:16.280> because<00:05:16.820> that<00:05:16.970> wasn't<00:05:17.389> you

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
kind of stinks because that wasn't you

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.300 
kind of stinks because that wasn't you
know<00:05:17.750> originally<00:05:18.320> part<00:05:18.560> of<00:05:18.620> my<00:05:18.710> plan<00:05:18.979> but

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
know originally part of my plan but

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.590 
know originally part of my plan but
that's<00:05:19.400> just<00:05:19.639> kind<00:05:19.850> of<00:05:19.970> how<00:05:20.060> this<00:05:20.210> whole<00:05:20.270> thing

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
that's just kind of how this whole thing

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.300 
that's just kind of how this whole thing
goes<00:05:20.840> you<00:05:21.020> just<00:05:21.050> kind<00:05:21.380> of<00:05:21.440> have<00:05:21.680> to<00:05:21.710> take<00:05:22.039> it<00:05:22.190> as

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310
