through defending Cybertron and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.679 
through defending Cybertron and
ultimately<00:01:47.850> making<00:01:48.030> some<00:01:48.240> very<00:01:48.420> tough

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
ultimately making some very tough

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.630 
ultimately making some very tough
decisions<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.740> where<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.009> finished<00:01:50.399> with<00:01:50.520> him

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
decisions and where we finished with him

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.940 
decisions and where we finished with him
is<00:01:50.790> he<00:01:50.909> realized<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.780> he<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.439> prime<00:01:52.680> he

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
is he realized that he is the prime he

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.859 
is he realized that he is the prime he
is<00:01:53.130> Optimus<00:01:53.610> Prime<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.600> other<00:01:54.689> thing<00:01:54.840> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
is Optimus Prime the other thing that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.149 
is Optimus Prime the other thing that
I've<00:01:55.049> been<00:01:55.200> very<00:01:55.380> excited<00:01:55.799> about<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.100> this

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
I've been very excited about with this

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.060 
I've been very excited about with this
project<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.560> again<00:01:58.560> as<00:01:58.710> we're<00:01:58.890> talking

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
project is that again as we're talking

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.039 
project is that again as we're talking
about<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.369> being<00:01:59.640> tied<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.000> movie<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.719> core

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
about not being tied to a movie the core

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.660 
about not being tied to a movie the core
foundation<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.829> game<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.189> actually<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
foundation of this game is actually the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.609 
foundation of this game is actually the
gameplay<00:02:03.240> which<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.290> layered

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
gameplay which we then layered

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.910 
gameplay which we then layered
transformers<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.549> top<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.680> played

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
transformers on top of so if you played

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.169 
transformers on top of so if you played
third<00:02:08.220> person<00:02:08.550> shooters<00:02:08.789> before<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
third person shooters before the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.100 
third person shooters before the
controls<00:02:09.539> are<00:02:09.599> going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.869> real

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
controls are going to be real

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.710 
controls are going to be real
comfortable<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.009> right<00:02:11.340> because<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:12.270> go

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
comfortable to you right because we go

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.610 
comfortable to you right because we go
with<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.020> standards<00:02:13.440> that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
with the standards that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.910 
with the standards that
people<00:02:13.890> know<00:02:14.159> and<00:02:14.459> are<00:02:14.610> used<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:15.500> two<00:02:16.500> weapons

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
people know and are used to two weapons

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.410 
people know and are used to two weapons
that<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.099> can<00:02:17.250> switch<00:02:17.459> between<00:02:17.640> anytime<00:02:18.390> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
that you can switch between anytime a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.990 
that you can switch between anytime a
segmented<00:02:19.110> health<00:02:19.349> system<00:02:19.860> fine<00:02:20.610> aim<00:02:20.819> all

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
segmented health system fine aim all

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.220 
segmented health system fine aim all
that<00:02:21.150> stuff<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.420> you're<00:02:21.659> really<00:02:21.810> used<00:02:22.080> to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
that stuff that you're really used to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.080 
that stuff that you're really used to
but<00:02:22.440> then<00:02:22.590> we<00:02:22.620> layer<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.849> gameplay

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
but then we layer the gameplay

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.869 
but then we layer the gameplay
strategies<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.890> transformation<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.099> cool

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
strategies of transformation and cool

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.850 
strategies of transformation and cool
transformer<00:02:27.629> based<00:02:27.810> abilities<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.440> top<00:02:28.680> of

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
transformer based abilities on top of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.830 
transformer based abilities on top of
that<00:02:28.920> now<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.310> guys<00:02:29.580> took<00:02:29.790> some<00:02:30.390> slight

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
that now you guys took some slight

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.569 
that now you guys took some slight
artistic<00:02:31.409> liberties<00:02:31.799> with<00:02:31.980> those<00:02:32.129> character

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
artistic liberties with those character

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.670 
artistic liberties with those character
designs<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.239> know<00:02:33.299> Optimus<00:02:33.930> he's<00:02:34.140> not<00:02:34.379> a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
designs I know Optimus he's not a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.190 
designs I know Optimus he's not a
semi-truck<00:02:35.640> he's<00:02:35.879> a<00:02:36.090> he's<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.390> hovercar<00:02:36.989> in

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
semi-truck he's a he's a hovercar in

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.259 
semi-truck he's a he's a hovercar in
here<00:02:37.440> yeah<00:02:37.829> so<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.579> know<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:38.819> originally

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
here yeah so you know we originally

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.300 
here yeah so you know we originally
started<00:02:39.360> with<00:02:39.659> some<00:02:39.930> much<00:02:40.409> more<00:02:40.680> eccentric

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
started with some much more eccentric

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.789 
started with some much more eccentric
designs<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:42.360> what<00:02:42.510> we<00:02:42.599> realized<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:43.620> had

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
designs and what we realized is we had

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.970 
designs and what we realized is we had
to<00:02:43.920> create<00:02:44.159> a<00:02:44.579> style<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.750> look<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.410> made

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
to create a style and a look that made

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.319 
to create a style and a look that made
sense<00:02:47.160> with<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.370> property<00:02:47.790> but<00:02:47.879> also<00:02:48.030> worked

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
sense with the property but also worked

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.599 
sense with the property but also worked
for<00:02:48.420> gameplay<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.379> so<00:02:49.560> hover<00:02:49.769> cars<00:02:50.099> made<00:02:50.579> a

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
for gameplay and so hover cars made a

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.270 
for gameplay and so hover cars made a
lot<00:02:50.879> more<00:02:51.060> gameplay<00:02:51.359> sense<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.099> can

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
lot more gameplay sense so that you can

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.369 
lot more gameplay sense so that you can
use<00:02:53.579> your<00:02:54.000> boost<00:02:54.299> mode<00:02:54.599> and<00:02:54.840> your<00:02:54.930> hover<00:02:55.109> mode

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
use your boost mode and your hover mode

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.520 
use your boost mode and your hover mode
much<00:02:55.769> more<00:02:56.040> much<00:02:56.489> faster<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.349> transform<00:02:58.349> much

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
much more much faster and transform much

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.140 
much more much faster and transform much
more<00:02:58.709> frequently<00:02:59.129> so<00:02:59.310> we<00:02:59.430> did<00:02:59.819> take<00:02:59.970> some

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
more frequently so we did take some

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.369 
more frequently so we did take some
liberties<00:03:00.299> but<00:03:00.720> stayed<00:03:01.079> within<00:03:01.260> the

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
liberties but stayed within the

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.470 
liberties but stayed within the
guardrails<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.190> what<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.849> Transformers

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
guardrails of what the Transformers

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.930 
guardrails of what the Transformers
candidates<00:03:03.959> we've<00:03:04.650> got<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> pretty<00:03:05.519> good<00:03:05.700> look

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
candidates we've got a pretty good look

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.030 
candidates we've got a pretty good look
at<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.299> at<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.750> game<00:03:07.049> right<00:03:07.260> there<00:03:07.470> but<00:03:07.829> you

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
at the at the game right there but you

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.520 
at the at the game right there but you
guys<00:03:08.190> also<00:03:08.579> have<00:03:08.730> boss<00:03:09.510> battles<00:03:10.019> engineer<00:03:10.379> and

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
guys also have boss battles engineer and

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.020 
guys also have boss battles engineer and
know<00:03:10.680> we<00:03:10.859> would<00:03:10.980> be<00:03:11.010> remiss<00:03:11.099> if<00:03:11.609> we<00:03:11.640> didn't

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
know we would be remiss if we didn't

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.119 
know we would be remiss if we didn't
