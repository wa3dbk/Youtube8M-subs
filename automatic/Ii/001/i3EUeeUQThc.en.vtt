00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
 Well, no 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.520
 hello everyone welcome to me every time 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.830
 more today I bring you another video very 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.050
 concentrated and is only referred to 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.300
 lighting outline I already have 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.830
 applied the entire base the concealer and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.480
 I also have sealed at the base with 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.960
 loose powders and now let's go 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.810
 directly just to stir this 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.730
 volume to my face I have already applied the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.129
 base as I said and the proofreader 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.530
 applied to the base of the sun clinic area 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.080
 that leaves a super natural finish and very 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.870
 very nice and uniform as a proofreader has 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.180
 used the allison corrector rafael his 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.090
 concealer that has medium coverage 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.739
 high and as you see leaves a smoothing of the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.100
 area of ​​dark circles and the rest of the face 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.420
 where they could correct very very nice and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.890
 now let's move directly to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.899
 return the volumes as I tell you I'm going 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.530
 to also use a product from ria and other 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.160
 of allison to an analysis are rafael and the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.660
 product of reality is directly the 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.670
 tanning powders that are the ones with 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.580
 those that we go to with turner to return 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.070
 those shadows are two types of colors 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.020
 one that is more matte for more contouring and 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.579
 the other one that has a bit of 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.850
 it's something that we could use to the best 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:23.280
 to give a touch of sun to the face and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.159
 as an illuminator we have this one 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.240
 allison rafael incandescent linear that 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.079
 is an illuminator in liquid cream with 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.390
 a tone 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.520
 peach pizzi very very very nice so 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.860
 let's go to it you can start with 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.360
 contour with lighting depending 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.920
 as you want this time we can start 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.899
 with the illuminator because it is a product 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.090
 in cream and we're going to apply it in 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.610
 points where we would have to eliminate 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.229
 after having flattened the face that 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.090
 is what we have done with our with 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.099
 our concealer in our base as 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.840
 we define the areas where we are going to 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:56.610
 illuminate good professionals very tricks 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.739
 easy is to expose yourself a lamp over 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.500
 of the head protruding a bit from the 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:03.659
 front and make it light up towards the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.789
 face in this way we see that it's like 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.590
 if it were the sun and it would mark us the zones 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.810
 where would the sun give the areas to 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.670
 light up but if we do not want to do this 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.440
 we have a very easy way to do it 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.480
 which is just to look at the areas 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.160
 that are higher rises of 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.349
 our face like the cheeks 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.060
 the nose above the eyebrows in the 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.200
 chin a little over the arch of 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.569
 cupid alone 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.340
 that are most pronounced and are the 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.750
 areas where they would hit only then there 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.940
 is where we are going to illuminate in a way 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.700
 very light and natural not changing 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.239
 our physiognomy of the face 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.310
 our our already real traits for 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.200
 that this lighting does not seem weird like that 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.550
 that we are going to eliminate little by little and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.080
 little by little we will be blurring 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.450
 We are also in the same we can 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.620
 Blur with a brush or we can blur 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.620
 with fingers as we want 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.459
 yes 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.760
 t 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.790
 as you see it is very obvious the way in which 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.500
 that applied the product is not yet 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.180
 blurred simply what applied to 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.610
 that you can see exactly where the 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.710
 illuminate areas in this way 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.910
 you can identify in your face 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.530
 also those areas 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.420
 you can apply a lot less quantity 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.740
 to add products according to your wishes 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.450
 but well I tell you that you have applied 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.980
 more product in a little more way 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.990
 obvious so you can see it 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.400
 identify it more easily and now 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.230
 blur and masters or with the fingers of 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.240
 natural way or blur and masters with a 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.220
 brush little by little in the area where 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.090
 we want to illuminate without extending too much 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.090
 area the area 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.980
 here 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.000
 here 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.079
 as you can see the finish that I have given is with 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.239
 the finger to make it more natural like 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.919
 we have done before and an area is a bit 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.630
 more specific to give some effects 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.430
 more special in the hour of illuminated 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.530
 to illuminate how the arch can be 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.419
 cupid that we light up this area is going to 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.520
 make our upper lip look like 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.750
 more bulky if we illuminate the areas 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.090
 of flat couch that what he is doing 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.190
 is to blur a little the possible 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.020
 wrinkles that we have there and then also 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.940
 we can blur the arch of the eyebrow that 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.560
 in this way what we are going to create is 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.910
 that is more defined and has more 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.310
 highlight more this area that is very 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.470
 feminine as you see is very easy 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.570
 illuminate we simply have to 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.340
 illuminate the areas that we want to highlight 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.130
 and we're going to do the opposite that would be 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.740
 outline and we will give shadows that 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.630
 what we want is to hide those areas or that 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.030
 look darker then we can 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.470
 simply return the shadows to your 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.560
 face at the same time we do it we can 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.750
 give different touches to your face by 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.310
 example we can outline to return 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.930
 to this shadow that we have below the 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.030
 cheeks but we can also lower it 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.370
 a little bit to create our 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.740
 his face a little thinner and thinner 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.240
 we can also outline the line of 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.890
 our jaw that what is going to 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.810
 to do is if we have one more face 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.550
 round more rounded more square we 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.250
 will refine this area to make it more 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.690
 pointy we can outline a little the 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.130
 area of the temple that will do what 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.350
 same is going to make our face 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.810
 be finer and then we can use a 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.840
 little like visagism and we outline the 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.810
 lateral area of ​​the nose to create more 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.670
 the one that seems thinner nose or 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.160
 tip of the nose to make it look more 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.540
 cortita that are a little more specific 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.430
 but what are we going to do now is a 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.050
 no more general story for you to see 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.980
 where you can outline and give a touch 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:59.530
 more beautiful to the face and that is very obvious 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.950
 I'm going to use the brush of 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.120
 allison de flame making a brush 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.040
 synthetic that goes very well for this guy 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.900
 of works the way to apply it is 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.520
 apply it from the hair line towards 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.320
 the interior in this way to the quantity 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.910
 extreme color need not 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.680
 what is extreme where there is more color 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.240
 It will be at the hairline and go 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.710
 blurring towards the face so that 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.550
 go disappearing and that much more 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.550
 degraded natural 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.470
 Y 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.630
 Y 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.910
 here 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.420
 here 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.500
 here 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.930
 ah 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:06.689
 Y 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.639
 this would be the very easy outline the 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.679
 trick to contour the cheek that are 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.389
 more complicated is finding the end of the 

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:14.729
 cheek bone and that's where 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:16.649
 we would start to outline and the direction 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:18.479
 depending on if we only want 

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:19.649
 make a contour to return the 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.990
 volume then what we would do the 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:24.419
 address would be from the highest part 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.059
 from the ear to the corner of the mouth 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:28.649
 that would be the direction we would have 

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:30.990
 do not reach contour 

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:33.270
 the mouth but if this direction and leaving 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.009
 that is blurring in this area and 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.959
 this would be the way to contour very 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:38.339
 facilitates as you see returns the 

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:39.930
 volumes now we have much more 

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:42.089
 volume is lighting is missing 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.949
 eye makeup obviously but already 

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:45.719
 we have lighting and contour volumes 

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:47.039
 in the face I hope it is cervi 

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:49.189
 help and see you next up 

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:49.189
 then 

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.240
 do not
