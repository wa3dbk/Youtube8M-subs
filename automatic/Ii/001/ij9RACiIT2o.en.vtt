00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.259
 hello citizens of the world we are not 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.119
 anonymous ha ha ha ha ha ha ha this is 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.310
 maybe one of the stupidest videos 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.360
 that you have climbed or will never climb or 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.220
 except that I hope and I just uploaded this video 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.080
 to try the oquendo with Jorge's voice 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.620
 that I finally got to download and 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.629
 install and apparently virus free 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.140
 well how I do not like doing things in 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.030
 vain 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.370
 I leave you in the description of the video the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.290
 download link that is not mine but I think 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.300
 that the kid deserves it because it's the 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.579
 only one that I managed to install at the first 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.699
 you just have to pay attention in a few 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.920
 simple details first wait for 20 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.800
 seconds to force if you do not have an account 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.019
 premium second when you download the 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.149
 file click if you accept 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.220
 unzip only the text folder to 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.580
 load more voice loquendo de jorge uploaded 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.440
 tenth and Chinese is usually decompressed in 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.080
 the same folder where you downloaded the 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.030
 third file when you're going to install 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.850
 the contents of the file you must do 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.750
 in this order first install the text 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.360
 of 2,292 exe when you install it 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.860
 careful to make an installation 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.870
 customized or custom brand in the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.030
 box of the type of installation and 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.650
 give the following uncheck the boxes 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.390
 of the browser bars that only 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.370
 They make you screw your browser and you do not 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.410
 you can use google yahoo your search engine 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.210
 favorite you use and redirect you 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.460
 where text advertisers what 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.530
 they want that is called kidnapping 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.740
 browser but it's simple to avoid it 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.869
 unchecking the boxes done this only 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.060
 you have to install it when this one 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.000
 uncheck the boxes to see file 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.070
 html and to execute load text since still 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.350
 we have to put the voice of Jorge or 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.170
 loquendo or anonymous each one that 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.420
 call as it comes out of the balls 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.670
 Once the text is installed, we go to the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.300
 jorge folder and install voice Spain 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.520
 the file 651 run time for windows xp 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.980
 since it is imperative to install 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.170
 the voice of loquendo when we have 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.989
 installed then if we can install 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.420
 the file jorge dot exe these two 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.330
 files are installed without complication is 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.580
 say the same as your sister yes to everything 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.170
 or next in each case what corresponds 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.000
 it is interesting what comes to 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.040
 continuation because many of you 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.660
 you will feel like hackers for about 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.610
 seconds jajajajaja I know it 's like this we're going to 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.070
 the folder crack and we copy the file 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.050
 what's inside like this video will see it 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.760
 more than anything my friends and acquaintances and 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.470
 they are knowles ters I will say that the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.270
 file is a library created or 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.520
 modified by a hacker so that the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.280
 program does not ask us for code my serial or 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.170
 that is worth the one we have 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.600
 those types of files are called tracks 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.700
 Well, this crack we copy it and what 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.940
 we paste in the folder where it was installed 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.250
 Jorge exe point which is not usually 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.160
 on c2 points or local disk files 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.080
 program loquendo stick inside the 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.630
 folder loquendo the file and will tell us 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.870
 if we want to replace it because it already exists 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.000
 one with that name we give him yes now 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.010
 it only remains to open the load text but 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.990
 from a desktop shortcut 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.720
 from the start button all the 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.850
 programs when we start it will ask us 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.300
 a serial that is the number that is in 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.240
 the text document from here point txt 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.730
 done this is now ready to work 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.950
 Jorge sham instead of the tab 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.960
 you can already upload stupid videos 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.750
 like this or videos full of insults or 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.690
 words that you like to do well 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.480
 this was all for now remember I'm not 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.430
 legion but neither forgiveness nor forgetfulness and if I 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.480
 you wait, do it sitting because I do not have 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.130
 thought to go because going pana is nonsense 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.760
 Sincerely Jorge Loquendo on behalf of 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.760
 dark shine
