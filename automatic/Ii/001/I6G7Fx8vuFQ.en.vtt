Aquafresh<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.730> like<00:00:42.200> I<00:00:44.090> think<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.270> says

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
Aquafresh and it's like I think it says

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
Aquafresh and it's like I think it says
for<00:00:45.629> whiter<00:00:46.610> for<00:00:47.610> whiter<00:00:47.760> cheese<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.829> that's

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
for whiter for whiter cheese so that's

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
for whiter for whiter cheese so that's
something<00:00:50.309> used<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.910> that's<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.500> keep

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.499 
squishy toothbrush handle oh yeah after
that<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.740> use<00:01:37.740> western<00:01:38.189> means<00:01:38.340> total<00:01:38.729> care<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
that I use western means total care and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.760 
that I use western means total care and
I<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.259> MIT<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.549> mouthwash<00:01:42.270> afterwards<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
I see MIT as a mouthwash afterwards and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.969 
I see MIT as a mouthwash afterwards and
he's<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.670> cat<00:01:44.909> floor<00:01:45.270> or<00:01:46.110> that's<00:01:46.350> some

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
he's like a cat floor or that's some

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.800 
he's like a cat floor or that's some
stuff<00:01:47.189> some<00:01:47.340> really<00:01:47.579> intense<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.659> did

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
stuff some really intense and I just did

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.940 
stuff some really intense and I just did
that<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.259> five<00:01:52.829> minutes<00:01:53.009> ago<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.990> I<00:01:54.990> think

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that like five minutes ago so I think

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.690 
that like five minutes ago so I think
that's<00:01:56.219> probably<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> best<00:01:57.299> trick<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:59.610> I'm

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
that's probably the best trick that I'm

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.580 
that's probably the best trick that I'm
going<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.090> because<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.869> read<00:02:01.290> all<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
going to do because I read all the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.300 
going to do because I read all the
directions

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
directions

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.139 
directions
for<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.549> back<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.710> papers<00:02:05.610> directions

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
for this back in the papers directions

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.540 
for this back in the papers directions
and<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.930> didn't<00:02:07.170> say<00:02:07.290> anything<00:02:07.500> about<00:02:07.860> like

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
and it didn't say anything about like

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.999 
and it didn't say anything about like
just<00:02:08.789> pursing<00:02:09.270> your<00:02:09.360> teaser<00:02:09.709> using<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> exact
