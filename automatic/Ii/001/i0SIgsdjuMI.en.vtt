00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 testimony of a full life 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.600
 in javier's life we ​​can contemplate a man of hope 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.640
 married with pilar sanchez 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 and with four beautiful children 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.190
 álvaro leire and carlitos 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.590
 he was pursuing his PhD in philosophy at the University of Navarre 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.030
 where he was originally from 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.960
 as a high school professor at the institute of palma de mallorca spain 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.880
 where he spent 17 years teaching philosophy classes 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.170
 ethics 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.420
 cultural anthropology 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.310
 bioethics and study techniques 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.490
 he was a regular character in radio and television programs 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.750
 where he was usually invited to defend the Catholic position 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.430
 not only for its brilliance 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.619
 but for his charisma before the cameras and for his sense of humor 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.170
 his list of publications was surprising for its number and its wide 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.030
 thematic 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.070
 in 1998 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.010
 received the announcement that changed his life 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.650
 the active master expert in karate and Thai boxing 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.640
 passionate about their children 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.990
 and with an inexhaustible list of commitments and projects 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.810
 had cancer 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.840
 he better than anyone synthesized his own experience 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.160
 way to the final encounter 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.600
 First interview 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.970
 1998 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.500
 intereconomy radio 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.260
 more than a dialogue was a monologue 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.780
 the director of the space was quite impressed 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.789
 like the many listeners 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.789
 Javier answered well to this question 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:21.749
 what it feels like to a 38-year-old man and they tell him he has cancer 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:27.299
 I have seen many times the four children playing on the shore of the beach 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.579
 from the arenal 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:29.999
 with your paddlers 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:31.829
 making castles 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.720
 the observed how they insist that their castle 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.879
 It is the only way 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.220
 absolutely in itself voice 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.269
 each with its castle 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.909
 so that if the cattle come back and arrive by chance with the foot 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.669
 and he throws a wall 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.849
 it is a horrible misfortune 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.269
 they cry they come saying 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.679
 dad to dad 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:56.889
 look what he told me 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.169
 it is as if their lives sank 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:00.779
 and you think 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:03.579
 that's how we humans are 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.459
 we have money in the bank 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.559
 our house 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.209
 our work 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.999
 we think they are internal 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:12.339
 when in fact 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.540
 they are sandcastles that you have not yet finished making 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.319
 and they are already falling 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:25.279
 better and phoenix 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:28.549
 I will die with the smile on my lips saying 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.169
 Now I'm going to heaven and I'll be happy 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.109
 that is to say 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.719
 will not come to find me the old woman with the scythe cut my neck no no no 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.730
 but it's going to come looking for me in nothing less 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.849
 that the same god 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.189
 that I'm going to go through a bodily life like the one we have 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.219
 pretty limited 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.219
 to a fuller life 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.059
 in the background 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:57.959
 I believe that the moment I die 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.289
 it's going to be very exciting 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:03.289
 exciting hills that has happened to me in life 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.589
 life 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:07.719
 It is common in black and white 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.189
 and the moment I die 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.319
 apart from the colors that I do not want anything to suffer 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.779
 the moment of death 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.569
 will close your eyes to this life 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:21.569
 and open them to eternal life 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:25.349
 we Christians decided 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:29.680
 I believe in the resurrection of the dead and in eternal life amen 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.400
 it is not an invention 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.139
 we will be there with our soul 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.930
 and with our spirit 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.229
 with our own self 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.229
 it will be a new birth 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.830
 we are born to life by our mother 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.129
 and we will not be to true life 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.259
 for the redemption of Jesus 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.560
 thank you because it intimidates us
