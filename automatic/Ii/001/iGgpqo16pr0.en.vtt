so guys for Travis agates frame a quick
little<00:00:12.179> review<00:00:12.650> here<00:00:13.650> it's<00:00:14.009> mussel<00:00:14.849> farms

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
little review here it's mussel farms

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.710 
little review here it's mussel farms
combat<00:00:16.470> protein<00:00:16.890> powder<00:00:17.570> difference<00:00:18.570> about

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
combat protein powder difference about

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.570 
combat protein powder difference about
this<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.170> has<00:00:19.199> like<00:00:19.500> five<00:00:19.920> four<00:00:20.250> protein

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
this it has like five four protein

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.140 
this it has like five four protein
sources<00:00:21.199> it's<00:00:22.199> got<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> hydro<00:00:22.769> isolate<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:24.090> I

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
sources it's got a hydro isolate so I

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.689 
sources it's got a hydro isolate so I
guess<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.420> quick<00:00:24.660> fast<00:00:25.260> release<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> way<00:00:26.580> of

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
guess a quick fast release and a way of

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.150 
guess a quick fast release and a way of
protein<00:00:27.090> isolate<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.810> then<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> whey<00:00:28.710> protein

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
protein isolate and then a whey protein

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.990 
protein isolate and then a whey protein
concentrate<00:00:29.210> a<00:00:30.710> albumin<00:00:31.710> what's<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> slow

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
concentrate a albumin what's like a slow

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.479 
concentrate a albumin what's like a slow
release<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.690> Michael<00:00:34.410> or<00:00:34.559> casein<00:00:35.309> was

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
release and that Michael or casein was

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.850 
release and that Michael or casein was
the<00:00:35.640> slow<00:00:35.850> digesting<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.770> there's<00:00:37.770> my

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the slow digesting so there's my

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.880 
the slow digesting so there's my
low-carb<00:00:38.309> days<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.390> up<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.469> my<00:00:40.530> protein

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
low-carb days so I up in my protein

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.010 
low-carb days so I up in my protein
intake<00:00:41.100> course<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.600> she's<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.899> little

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
intake course and so she's like a little

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.330 
intake course and so she's like a little
