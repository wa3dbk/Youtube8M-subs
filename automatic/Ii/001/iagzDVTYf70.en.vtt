00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.490
 and welcome to a new one 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.809
 sequence of computer chips 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.700
 today there is one again with us 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.990
 notebook review from the toshiba 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.310
 satellite 940 100 julian got that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.710
 whole in the last weeks and months 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.850
 looked a little closer and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.140
 but some weak spots 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.180
 found out 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.119
 simple and slim as presented 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.070
 the toshiba satellite ii 940 100 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.380
 the smallest ultrabook litter his 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.390
 series ultrabooks on a display size 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.660
 of over 14 inches usually cost 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.760
 a lot of money the 940 100 you get 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.770
 but already from 590 euro 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
 his field of application is quickly becoming clear 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.520
 this ultrabook is for office 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.680
 applications and intended for surfing 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.809
 modern games were missing processor as well 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.969
 graphics performance already in the all around 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.399
 view, we notice dull is the new one 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.840
 piano lacquer especially outstanding 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.820
 on the other hand is the keyboard illumination 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.440
 sounds like standard is in this 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.539
 Price but an exception 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.920
 However, our tester had considerable 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.460
 Problems with writing on the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.519
 keyboard 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.110
 that's not everyone's thing, too 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.000
 built-in wireless display 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.920
 interface for wireless connection 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.869
 belonged to a tv or monitor 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.890
 generally still to the rare functions 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:21.420
 of notebooks two usb 3.0 ports 1 x usb 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.400
 2.0 wlan lan bluetooth 4.0 hdmi and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.830
 Card readers complete the connections 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.840
 next to the charging socket the hybrid memory 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.409
 solution is almost at ultrabooks 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.960
 normal 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.549
 windows 8 is on the 500 gb hard drive 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.210
 installed for fast boot 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.360
 a 32 gb ssd to the side are effective 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.009
 but read only 11 gb warm 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.939
 Guys should be the fingers of this 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.590
 let ultrabook 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.240
 during our test on one 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.369
 desk including notebook cooler 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.409
 we had to protect the ultrabook 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.020
 Switch off the technology several times as the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.939
 ssd went hot if the error at 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.920
 samsung is located directly at toshiba 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.710
 could not be resolved until the end of the test 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.229
 become 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.200
 In human beings, 3d mark 11 came that 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.150
 Ultrabook just at 587 points 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.490
 and are thus still clearly below the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.259
 today's standards of office pcs one 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.140
 high end gaming pc beats these 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.030
 20 times ultrabook that was it 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.620
 from computer chips i hope you are 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.600

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.430
