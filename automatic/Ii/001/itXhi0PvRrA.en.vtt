 resistors and opening the housing is 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.979
 showing the motherboard is certainly 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.930
 making a pattern with a processor ok 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.170

 play enough games showing strength 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:46.200
 this processor is such a stop to make 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.200
 block neither the type nor now 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:59.090
