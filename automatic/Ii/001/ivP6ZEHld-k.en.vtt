i'm actually getting a 55 download in a
35<00:03:04.910> upload<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:06.110> when<00:03:06.260> he<00:03:06.380> ran<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.739> test<00:03:06.980> i<00:03:07.160> was

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
35 upload and when he ran the test i was

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.040 
35 upload and when he ran the test i was
actually<00:03:07.430> getting<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.850> 37<00:03:08.420> upload<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:08.930> the
