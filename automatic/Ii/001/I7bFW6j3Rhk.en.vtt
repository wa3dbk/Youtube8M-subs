00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.650
 input devices and output are 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.320
 the set of technological devices with 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.140
 which the user has interaction 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.160
 with the computer these are classified 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.250
 on devices input devices 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.820
 output output devices 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.190
 and the communication devices 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.640
 input devices are those that 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.620
 allow the user to enter data 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.770
 commands and programs on the computer 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.650
 as we can see some examples of 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.000
 these devices would be the keyboard the 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:54.230
 mouse the microphone the webcam control 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.300
 optical scanner and pencil games 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.520
 output devices are the 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.530
 devices that show or project 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.170
 information to the outside of the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.920
 computer a clear example would be the 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.550
 printer monitor speakers the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.100
 hearing aids the cannon and the fax 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.560
 the input devices output are 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.940
 those who use the computer so much 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.480
 to send as to receive 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.190
 information mostly these are 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.440
 storage devices 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.130
 information permanently or 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.540
 virtual examples would be the hard disks 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.120
 the memories usb the diskette the reader or 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.510
 burner for cd and dvd or blu-ray the 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.700
 touch screens multifunctionals 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.490
 among others the devices of 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.060
 communication are responsible for sending and 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.160
 receive information to other computers 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.590
 example would be the modem the cards 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.360
 wired and wireless the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.360
 hub and bluetooth
