00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.140
 Fresh ideas are the daily business 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.630
 by shawn mcneil he is at 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.170
 Software manufacturer sap responsible 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.210
 for the development of an innovative 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.449
 Corporate communication at the twelfth 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.490
 forum for thought leader of the profile workshop 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.310
 betrays computationally through his experience 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.980
 innovative after company communication 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.199
 so for me that's going to be in now 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.089
 in the outside and vice versa if a whole 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.699
 interesting place it is a kind 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:39.609
 trinity or a brother triangle 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.129
 in a positive sense where ultimately humane 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.839
 resources marketing &amp; communications 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.609
 they all come together separately 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.030
 functions or departments is 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.929
 no matter 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.789
 but just where these three are 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.639
 there are those at all 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.679
 possibility of opening a portal 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:58.030
 and especially Germany that is missing in 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.399
 Most companies it is that is 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.199
 also the problem of communication 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.660
 starts in the company at many 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.610
 different places always where the 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.900
 people are 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.780
 that's why mclaren wants the internal 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.970
 to channel communication productively and 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.160
 so the staff to motivated 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.380
 make ambassadors of your company 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:25.150
 but only if all succeed for him 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:27.010
 pull together and you know that 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.180
 partly and employer brandings employer 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.040
 branding 20 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.840
 Pippo Marketing is on the marketing side 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.180
 Concept of the project mini patience 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.860
 20 you can say maybe 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.600
 ultimately you need everything for it 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.220
 these three departments or functions 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.930
 have to work together to work together 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.430
 so that's a real inside 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.260
 outside and outside inside as one 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.900
 Stimmplus cycle gives that 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.670
 innovative evans approach consists in 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.220
 the technical possibilities the 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.620
 modern intranets offer to employees 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.930
 to motivate what motivates people 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.290
 So everybody is talking about that 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.479
 Action is an important topic it is 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.040
 currently something buzzword the one 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.659
 a few years ago and social media 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.830
 password was but it is actually 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.690
 has long been in the macher 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.479
 nothing new really we started already 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.769
 to play and learn with lego and 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.030
 if you work up to the 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.340
 playful 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.380
 So I still wish so much travel 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.450
 settlements somehow with golf 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.620
 are connected or shooting attacks 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.300
 But at some point the direction was 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.840
 be possible so my bill and so 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.910
 to shoot at green pigs 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.040
 hopefully speak specifically whether the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.640
 Equalization was very interesting 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.650
 simply as a point or as an incentive for 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.790
 the staff are more concerned with the 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.890
 to occupy internet 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.489
 Modern intranet are like a staircase 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.680
 with many levels so that it is used 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.200
 motivate gaming fiction elements 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.190
 they offer other levels 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.989
 forward - looking possibilities for 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.690
 knowledge management and to 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.800
 idea development a knowledge base 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.750
 Building is something very important 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.510
 just for internet 20 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.730
 if people lose the company most of the time 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.550
 take your heads with you 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.459
 and unfortunately there is this feature rama 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.890
 Do not bark yet to find experts 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.000
 that it is often a problem so it 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.080
 There are experts in a company find themselves 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.510
 but they are a certain size 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.549
 impossible to identify and through 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.320
 the right application of media and 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.360
 You can also communicate 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.670
 Experts find in the comments and 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.269
 at all in the game atoms and ideas too 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.970
 to generate 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.640
 Everyone has one in the social media 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.430
 own voice transmits this principle 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.420
 a modern intranet also intranet 2.0 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.340
 called on the internal communication 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.290
 represents some things on the head offers 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.500
 but also a huge potential for 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.959
 employee motivation but only if one 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.180
 new form of communication is learned 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.880
 we do not get kate is easy 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.470
 our guide in communications 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.109
 We also try all managers at sap 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.720
 this opportunity to teach what 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.540
 communicator is just new to 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.970
 learn how to speak before 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.160
 you would be professionally spoiled like 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.870
 to be communicated transparently 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.390
 should be from level to level 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.070
 different that clarifies 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.440
 Comparison from shawn mcneil ins 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.600
 privacy so i speak with mine 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.640
 12-year zone also and one 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.260
 ten years old and I can show 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.760
 not everything can I explain I can 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.409
 I have to say it all in one way 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.050
 and wisely explain that you insist 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.490
 could 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.610
 only information it is not that 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.009
 The first stupid I sat few 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.979
 experience and only with experience can 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.430
 you then give more information and 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.159
 become transparent 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.110
 for corporations like sap with many 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.330
 locations and areas like the 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.229
 advantages of social platforms 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.909
 the hand lie 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.919
 but what about smaller ones? 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.259
 company from when is it worthwhile? 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.599
 build social platforms 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:53.030
 So I think in any case 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:54.650
 newsroom where you exchange ideas and so on 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.270
 Next maybe blog writes so 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.240
 if it is a slightly smaller company 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.139
 then maybe a clever one will do 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.990
 internet newsroom probably only the 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.000
 you can access staff 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.849
 So also questions open that one 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.500
 platform would be enough if people 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.229
 do not assemble and not 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.759
 just to a neighbor so 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.379
 can then submit in the plane 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.750
 is it worth any digital 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.550
 Of course, art has to communicate 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.539
 not only digital comes where the 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:26.659
 People are not there for it will still be 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.580
 a lot of reading in companies where they are not 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.669
 connected with where not everyone is full 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.699
 There is a law like sap 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.529
 strong function which is great is if 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.300
 you can connect the when a 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.460
 online has platform and one more print 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.650
 platform that you start stuff in 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.750
 to let oneself flow 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.069
 comments on various topics 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.960
 the online area is coming in 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:50.539
 print area and so on but one 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.879
 company a hundred people in any case so 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.440
 Also a company with 16 people if you are 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.030
 could be distributed worldwide 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.550
 benefit 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.190
 For Shawn Mcneil makes an innovative 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.030
 Corporate Communications that in to 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.040
 Outside 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.990
 the employees become too 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.570
 motivated ambassadors of her 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.940
 merck is one of those companies that merck 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.000
 sap on the manifold possibilities 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.430
 of social communication platforms 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.100
 he sees the advantages of such a platform 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.220
 for both the tussi and b2b 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.900
 companies do not see a difference 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.380
 between gm offers them for the 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.400
 internal communication 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.570
 the kind of employees you 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.920
 maybe one until she has that 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.050
 maybe different and you offer 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.440
 Want it to be like you would like indication 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.440
 goes ahead
