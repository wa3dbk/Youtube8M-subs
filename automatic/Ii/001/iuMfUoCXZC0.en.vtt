00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
how powerful this kill streak is or

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.280 
how powerful this kill streak is or
isn't<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.180> how<00:01:05.449> many<00:01:05.600> bullets<00:01:05.900> that<00:01:06.020> actually

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
isn't and how many bullets that actually

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.320 
isn't and how many bullets that actually
take<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.590> kill<00:01:06.770> something<00:01:06.950> up<00:01:07.130> close<00:01:07.430> do<00:01:08.240> you

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
take to kill something up close do you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.090 
take to kill something up close do you
think<00:01:08.600> it's<00:01:08.750> too<00:01:08.930> much<00:01:09.110> too<00:01:09.439> little<00:01:09.470> do<00:01:10.009> you

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
think it's too much too little do you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.190 
think it's too much too little do you
think<00:01:10.340> this<00:01:10.490> might<00:01:10.700> be<00:01:10.729> a<00:01:10.880> concern<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:11.899> really

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
think this might be a concern it really

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.230 
think this might be a concern it really
doesn't<00:01:12.530> seem<00:01:12.619> too<00:01:12.890> hard<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.340> get<00:01:13.490> this<00:01:13.640> one<00:01:13.880> so

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
doesn't seem too hard to get this one so

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.959 
doesn't seem too hard to get this one so
I<00:01:14.509> I<00:01:14.929> don't<00:01:15.320> think<00:01:15.679> it's<00:01:15.920> gonna<00:01:16.039> be<00:01:16.249> something

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
I I don't think it's gonna be something

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:19.209 
I I don't think it's gonna be something
that<00:01:17.479> it's<00:01:17.780> gonna<00:01:17.929> be<00:01:18.140> rare<00:01:18.380> it<00:01:18.679> is<00:01:18.829> probably

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
that it's gonna be rare it is probably

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.700 
that it's gonna be rare it is probably
gonna<00:01:19.340> be<00:01:19.460> one<00:01:19.700> of<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.049> medium-high<00:01:21.049> kill

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
gonna be one of the medium-high kill

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.679 
gonna be one of the medium-high kill
streaks<00:01:22.039> it's<00:01:22.219> not<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.520> highest<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.569> know
