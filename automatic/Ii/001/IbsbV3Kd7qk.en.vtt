00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
card even there is the bat signal comes

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.550 
card even there is the bat signal comes

villains
so<00:02:34.040> what<00:02:34.520> we<00:02:34.640> would<00:02:34.790> do<00:02:34.910> at<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.090> point<00:02:35.300> is<00:02:35.780> is

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
so what we would do at that point is is

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.650 
so what we would do at that point is is
draw<00:02:36.680> one<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.220> Batman<00:02:37.520> cards<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.150> this
