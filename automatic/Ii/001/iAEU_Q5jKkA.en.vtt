00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
able to sleep at night this is the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.750 
able to sleep at night this is the
science<00:02:44.560> thing<00:02:44.739> is<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.100> imagine<00:02:45.310> what<00:02:45.640> would

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
science thing is to imagine what would

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.940 
science thing is to imagine what would
be<00:02:45.910> happening<00:02:46.060> with<00:02:46.780> Dhoni<00:02:47.170> with<00:02:47.380> our<00:02:47.530> 3d<00:02:47.830> and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
be happening with Dhoni with our 3d and

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.290 
be happening with Dhoni with our 3d and
all<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.220> others<00:02:48.459> how<00:02:48.580> do<00:02:48.640> they<00:02:48.760> handle<00:02:49.030> this

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
all the others how do they handle this

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.420 
all the others how do they handle this
pressure<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.870> think<00:02:50.530> we<00:02:50.590> find<00:02:50.860> ways<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.280> handle

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
pressure I think we find ways to handle

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.170 
pressure I think we find ways to handle
it<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:52.120> know<00:02:52.239> even<00:02:52.300> when<00:02:52.570> we<00:02:52.720> played<00:02:53.610> we<00:02:54.610> win

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
it you know even when we played we win

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.640 
it you know even when we played we win
this<00:02:55.360> pressure<00:02:55.630> cooker<00:02:55.989> situation<00:02:56.440> we<00:02:56.560> went

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
this pressure cooker situation we went

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.530 
this pressure cooker situation we went
to<00:02:56.800> pass<00:02:56.980> his<00:02:57.130> son<00:02:57.280> in<00:02:57.430> 2003<00:02:58.090> for<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.360> first

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
to pass his son in 2003 for the first

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.800 
to pass his son in 2003 for the first
time<00:02:58.920> after<00:02:59.920> 15<00:03:00.519> years<00:03:00.550> i<00:03:00.850> think<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.420> that

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
time after 15 years i think and and that

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.090 
time after 15 years i think and and that
was<00:03:02.019> different<00:03:02.230> but<00:03:02.470> we<00:03:02.620> enjoyed<00:03:02.920> the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
was different but we enjoyed the

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.530 
was different but we enjoyed the
thoughts<00:03:03.340> i<00:03:03.519> think<00:03:03.730> these<00:03:03.880> players<00:03:04.060> are<00:03:04.300> under

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
thoughts i think these players are under

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.690 
thoughts i think these players are under
pressure<00:03:04.570> every<00:03:05.170> day<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.830> i<00:03:05.890> don't<00:03:06.489> think

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
pressure every day and i don't think

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.920 
pressure every day and i don't think
there<00:03:06.820> was<00:03:06.880> any<00:03:07.060> less<00:03:07.300> pressure<00:03:07.570> when<00:03:07.810> they

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
there was any less pressure when they

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.990 
there was any less pressure when they
played<00:03:08.110> australian<00:03:08.650> on<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.890> bus<00:03:09.040> but<00:03:09.610> just

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
played australian on the bus but just

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.699 
played australian on the bus but just
pakistan<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.720> semi-final<00:03:11.320> but<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:11.590> was

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
pakistan in the semi-final but that was

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.229 
pakistan in the semi-final but that was
australian<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.280> quarterfinal<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.000> they<00:03:13.090> had

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
australian a quarterfinal and they had

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.850 
australian a quarterfinal and they had
to<00:03:13.390> win<00:03:13.510> obviously<00:03:14.050> this<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.650> biggest

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
to win obviously this is the biggest

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.160 
to win obviously this is the biggest
india<00:03:15.280> pakistan<00:03:15.430> game<00:03:16.030> because<00:03:16.330> India<00:03:16.870> expect

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
india pakistan game because India expect

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.690 
india pakistan game because India expect
Pakistan<00:03:17.680> in<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:17.830> quarterfinals<00:03:18.519> in<00:03:18.610> the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
Pakistan in the quarterfinals in the

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.460 
Pakistan in the quarterfinals in the
past<00:03:18.940> but<00:03:19.120> not<00:03:19.300> in<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.480> World<00:03:19.720> Cup<00:03:19.810> semi<00:03:20.230> farm

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
past but not in a World Cup semi farm

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.229 
past but not in a World Cup semi farm
and<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.040> think<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.340> play<00:03:21.519> is<00:03:21.550> know<00:03:21.850> it<00:03:21.970> they<00:03:22.209> are

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
and I think the play is know it they are

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.699 
and I think the play is know it they are
used<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.720> pressure<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.230> they<00:03:23.350> just<00:03:23.530> have

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
used to the pressure and they just have

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.259 
used to the pressure and they just have
to<00:03:23.739> deal<00:03:23.980> with<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.160> know<00:03:24.220> sonic<00:03:24.610> I've<00:03:24.940> often

to deal with you know sonic I've often

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.050 
to deal with you know sonic I've often
