00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.470
 food hygiene the 5 keys of 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.470
 Wholesome food safety of who 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.660
 one 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.329
 the people 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.240
 mom what about eating a hamburger 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.240
 complete son 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.870
 how delicious my favorite food 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.909
 it is important to maintain cleanliness 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.640
 i 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.710
 although most of the microorganisms 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.259
 do not cause diseases the dangerous 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.940
 are present in the ground water the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.010
 animals and people 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.260
 these microorganisms are found in 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.420
 hands and kitchen utensils and 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.070
 the least contact can lead to your 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.680
 transfer to food and 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.610
 caused illness careful with the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.610
 cross contamination 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.150
 separates raw foods from the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.900
 Cooked and use different utensils 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.900
 for each one 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.780
 raw foods especially those 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.120
 red meats, poultry meats and 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.980
 fish and their juices may contain 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.290
 microorganisms that can be transferred 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.720
 to other foods during preparation 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.280
 and conservation of them is why 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.769
 that you should take care to avoid this 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.370
 pollution completely cook the 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.370
 foods 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.360
 with proper cooking they can kill 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.340
 almost all microorganisms has been 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.200
 shown in studies that cook 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.239
 food until they reach a 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.159
 70 degree temperature can 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.450
 contribute to guaranteeing its innocuousness 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.910
 for consume 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.450
 keep food at temperatures 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.670
 sure lucas next do not forget 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.410
 put the food in the refrigerator to 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.970
 avoid the development of bacteria and 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.370
 take care of our health 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.980
 you're right , I'll have to borrow more 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.840
 attention next time 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.090
 the microorganisms can be 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.159
 multiply very quickly if the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.830
 Foods are preserved at temperature 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.050
 ambient 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.660
 at temperatures below 5 degrees 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.670
 or higher than 60 degrees the 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.130
 microbial growth slows him 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.850
 stops use water and raw materials 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.850
 secure 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.659
 all right 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.579
 remember to always look at the date of 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.729
 expiration before consuming a 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.729
 product 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.600
 the raw materials including water 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.130
 and ice can be contaminated with 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.550
 microorganisms and chemical products 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.380
 dangerous the care in the selection of 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.180
 the raw materials and the adoption of 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.300
 simple measures like washing and 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.670
 peeling can reduce the risk you knew 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.620
 the keys of the who is the moment of 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.260
 put them into practice to take care of 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.270
 health of your family and friends and so on 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.960
 prevent diseases transmitted by 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.790
 food a little advice more when with 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.980
 gel is a food labeled and 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.140
 fractionated in small portions now 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.400
 that the portions are ready 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.400
 freeze the 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.759
 to thaw food in the 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.699
 refrigerator never on the counter to 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:18.099
 room temperature I'll leave them at 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:21.189
 the table thus thaws faster 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.990
 no son that's dangerous for our 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:26.370
 health put it in the refrigerator or 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.370
 defrost or in the microwave 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.960
 and take care of yourself and your family 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.240
 helps to take care of the world this is

 all for today thank you very much for your 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.380
 company and attention 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:50.439
 master 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.100
