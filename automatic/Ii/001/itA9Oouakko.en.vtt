00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
there's just too much rain I mean I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.760 
there's just too much rain I mean I
understand<00:00:39.690> obviously<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.290> real<00:00:40.469> life<00:00:40.620> you

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
understand obviously in real life you

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.139 
understand obviously in real life you
get<00:00:40.890> rain<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.399> FIFA<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.730> things<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.090> that

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
get rain and FIFA and things like that

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.139 
get rain and FIFA and things like that
but<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:43.079> genuinely<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.640> raining<00:00:44.640> cats<00:00:44.879> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
but it genuinely is raining cats and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.090 
but it genuinely is raining cats and
dogs<00:00:45.180> all<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.870> time<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:46.920> maybe

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
dogs all the time so you know maybe

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.650 
dogs all the time so you know maybe
there<00:00:47.280> should<00:00:47.460> be<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> different<00:00:48.420> level

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
there should be a different level

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.869 
there should be a different level
because<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.050> playing<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.860> rain<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.430> snow

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
because they playing in rain and snow

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.600 
because they playing in rain and snow
are<00:00:51.110> extremely<00:00:52.110> frustrating<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.920> they<00:00:53.399> come

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
are extremely frustrating and they come

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.400 
are extremely frustrating and they come
up<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:53.969> too<00:00:54.270> often<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:54.780> my<00:00:54.870> liking<00:00:55.110> I

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
up a little too often for my liking I

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.439 
up a little too often for my liking I
understand<00:00:56.070> obviously<00:00:56.190> fifa<00:00:56.760> at<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> end<00:00:57.360> of

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
understand obviously fifa at the end of

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.599 
understand obviously fifa at the end of
the<00:00:57.510> day<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> simulation<00:00:58.170> game<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:59.579> I

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the day is a simulation game and there I

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.240 
the day is a simulation game and there I
get<00:00:59.850> quite<00:01:00.120> lucky<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.570> rebound<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.289> by

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
get quite lucky little rebound but by

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.729 
get quite lucky little rebound but by
design<00:01:02.550> FIFA<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> simulation<00:01:03.780> game<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.589> I

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
design FIFA is a simulation game but I

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.250 
design FIFA is a simulation game but I
mean<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:06.119> most<00:01:06.390> games<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.810> doesn't<00:01:07.080> snow

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
mean it in most games it doesn't snow

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.830 
mean it in most games it doesn't snow
every<00:01:07.890> every<00:01:08.700> other<00:01:08.820> game<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.330> play<00:01:09.570> or

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
every every other game that you play or

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.140 
every every other game that you play or
I<00:01:10.080> mean<00:01:10.409> most<00:01:10.590> i<00:01:10.979> play<00:01:11.310> probably<00:01:11.700> more<00:01:11.909> rainy

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
I mean most i play probably more rainy

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.510 
I mean most i play probably more rainy
games<00:01:12.479> than<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:13.189> which<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> bit

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
games than I do not which is a bit

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.700 
games than I do not which is a bit
frustrating<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.150> check<00:01:15.479> Luis<00:01:15.750> Gustavo<00:01:15.960> there

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
frustrating but check Luis Gustavo there

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.700 
frustrating but check Luis Gustavo there
for<00:01:16.890> an<00:01:16.979> absolute<00:01:17.340> rocket<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:18.060> his<00:01:18.210> left<00:01:18.450> foot

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
for an absolute rocket on his left foot

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.020 
for an absolute rocket on his left foot
that's<00:01:19.710> that's<00:01:20.040> what<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.310> capable<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.729> really

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that's that's what is capable of really

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.140 
that's that's what is capable of really
and<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.200> yeah<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.710> mean<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.520> weather<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and but yeah so I mean the weather is a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.480 
and but yeah so I mean the weather is a
big<00:01:24.750> thing<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> would<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.340> see

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
big thing that I would like to see

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.039 
big thing that I would like to see
change<00:01:26.729> maybe<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.570> such<00:01:27.900> an

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
change maybe just not have such an

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.679 
change maybe just not have such an
impact<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.920> game<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.450> might

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
impact in the game and that that might

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.960 
impact in the game and that that might
be<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.320> might<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> solution<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:32.400> something

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
be that might be a solution or something

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.050 
be that might be a solution or something
like<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> next<00:01:34.049> thing<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
like that now the next thing is and the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.560 
like that now the next thing is and the
fact<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.110> referees<00:01:38.000> really<00:01:39.000> really

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
fact that the referees really really

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
will happen i really do hope that an

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.670 
will happen i really do hope that an
someone<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.090> comes<00:02:06.299> along<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.780> with

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
someone like this comes along and with

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.130 
someone like this comes along and with
the<00:02:07.920> improved<00:02:08.520> impact<00:02:08.940> engine<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.479> certainly

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the improved impact engine I certainly

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.589 
the improved impact engine I certainly
hope<00:02:10.379> comes<00:02:10.739> improved<00:02:11.459> refereeing<00:02:12.090> decisions

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
hope comes improved refereeing decisions

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.400 
hope comes improved refereeing decisions
because<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
because of the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.200 
because of the
moment<00:02:13.740> like<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.220> wipe<00:02:14.550> someone<00:02:14.970> out<00:02:15.090> in

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
moment like you can wipe someone out in

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.090 
moment like you can wipe someone out in
the<00:02:15.270> penalty<00:02:15.540> box<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.380> nothing<00:02:16.980> will

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
the penalty box and you nothing will

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.920 
the penalty box and you nothing will
happen<00:02:17.430> another<00:02:18.360> time<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.750> could<00:02:18.900> just

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
happen another time and you could just

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.570 
happen another time and you could just
stick<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.260> leg<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:19.860> get<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> bit<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.400> ball

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
stick a leg in and get a bit of the ball

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.850 
stick a leg in and get a bit of the ball
in<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.880> bit<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.300> their<00:02:21.420> leg<00:02:21.690> as<00:02:21.870> well<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.290> it'll

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
in a bit of their leg as well and it'll

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.370 
in a bit of their leg as well and it'll
be<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> penalty<00:02:23.700> red<00:02:24.120> card<00:02:24.390> situation<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:25.140> mean

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
be a penalty red card situation I mean

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.190 
be a penalty red card situation I mean
it<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.590> an<00:02:25.800> absolute<00:02:26.670> shambles<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.810> really

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
it is an absolute shambles so I really

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.380 
it is an absolute shambles so I really
would<00:02:28.320> like<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.530> see<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.950> sorted<00:02:29.460> something

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
would like to see that sorted something

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.750

well<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:16.920> training<00:03:17.220> isn't<00:03:17.550> fun<00:03:17.940> at<00:03:18.390> all<00:03:18.630> at<00:03:18.900> the

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
ultimate team you can now have custom

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.500 
ultimate team you can now have custom
formations<00:03:40.920> now<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.370> don't<00:03:41.670> know<00:03:42.090> enough<00:03:42.360> about

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
formations now I don't know enough about

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.199 
formations now I don't know enough about
it<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.840> tell<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.380> guys<00:03:43.500> what<00:03:44.040> how<00:03:44.520> exactly<00:03:44.940> to

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
people are talking about the formation

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.729 
people are talking about the formation
505<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.920> or<00:03:51.110> 405<00:03:52.110> or<00:03:52.170> something<00:03:52.590> like<00:03:52.680> that

anyways and then I mean it just seems a
bit<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.180> shambles<00:03:57.660> at<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.840> moment<00:03:58.170> custom

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
bit of a shambles at the moment custom

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.020 
bit of a shambles at the moment custom
formations<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.370> don't<00:03:59.790> know<00:03:59.850> how<00:03:59.970> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
formations I don't know how the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.520 
formations I don't know how the
chemistry<00:04:00.300> works<00:04:00.780> for<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.410> only

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
chemistry works for it and you can only

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.560 
chemistry works for it and you can only
do<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:01.830> in<00:04:02.040> game<00:04:02.280> or<00:04:02.489> something<00:04:02.820> like<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:02.970> so

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570

team personally I don't think it's a

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.039 
team personally I don't think it's a
good<00:04:19.859> idea<00:04:20.130> i<00:04:20.549> won<00:04:21.510> i<00:04:21.539> don't<00:04:21.870> know<00:04:21.960> how

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.830 
good idea i won i don't know how

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
chemistry will work with it whatsoever
